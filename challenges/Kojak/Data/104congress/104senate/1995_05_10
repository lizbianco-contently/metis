Seeing \nnobody here at the moment to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      Amendment No. 693, as Further Modified, to Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto amend the Shelby-Heflin amendment, which is slated to be voted on in \na few minutes, by inserting at the end of the amendment: ``This \nparagraph shall cease to be effective September 1, 1996.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 693), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS RELATING TO DEATH.\n\n       In any civil action in which the alleged harm to the \n     claimant is death and, as of the effective date of this Act, \n     the applicable State law provides, or has been construed to \n     provide for damages only punitive in nature, a defendant may \n     be liable for any such damages without regard to section 107 \n     but only during such time as the State law so provides. This \n     paragraph shall cease to be effective September 1, 1996.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is now a reasonable amendment. There \nwas a debate on the Shelby-Heflin amendment yesterday to which I had \ncertain objections, but it is clear that the law of Alabama is unique \nand peculiar.\n  [[Page S6370]] I think it can easily be amended, and the two Senators \nfrom Alabama will want to give the Alabama Legislature sufficient time \nto consider that amendment. I think that is appropriate, and I believe \nthat we can now accept the Shelby-Heflin amendment by voice vote. \nAssuming that we do so, Mr. President, there will only be one vote at \n9:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas further modified.\n  So the amendment (No. 693), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I have reservations about this in regard \nto what has occurred, but I am faced with reality, the reality of \nvotes, and the reality of conference.\n  Senator Shelby and I, therefore, are approaching this issue from a \npragmatic, not philosophical, viewpoint. I just want to make that \nclear.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, regarding the amendment we have worked out \nand that has been voted on, I agree with the senior Senator from \nAlabama. We can both count. We were counting votes and we were looking \nreality in the face.\n  Our State of Alabama is unique among the 50 States in that, as I have \nsaid before on the floor, we have had a wrongful death statute that \nassesses punitive damages only where someone is killed and there is a \ncivil action because of the death. Most States in the Union--I guess \nall of them except Alabama--have compensatory damages.\n  If I had my ``druthers,'' I would leave this like it was or like it \nis today, but this will give the Alabama Legislature until September \n12, 1996, to consider changing it, if this proposed legislation were to \nbecome law.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 749\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 749, offered by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin].\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to table the Harkin amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

This will in no way change the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 629 to Amendment No. 690, as amended\n\n         (Purpose: To eliminate caps on punitive damage awards)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to offer amendment No. 629. \nThe amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 629 to amendment No. 690, as amended:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place: ``Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, nothing in this Act shall impose \n     limitations on punitive damage awards.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment which I have offered is not \nidentical but nearly identical to the amendment I offered prior to \ncloture. The amendment deals with the punitive damage cap. The \namendment I offered previously I offered to the Dole substitute. I now \noffer this amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Very simply, my amendment would remove the cap on punitive damages \nthat exists in the bill. The amendment that I offered previously was \ndefeated by a vote of 51 to 49. I would like for the Senate to express \nitself on that issue in light of the activities on this legislation \nsince the Senate voted on it. While I think there is merit in a product \nliability reform bill and while I think there is merit on both sides of \nthis issue, I believe the legislation should be like the legislation on \nproduct liability we considered last year. That legislation came to the \nfloor of the Senate and was voted on with respect to the last cloture \nvote without any cap on punitive damages.\n  Last year, the bill that originated in the Commerce Committee and \nbrought to the floor, did not include a cap on punitive damages. This \nyear, the legislation, as it emerged in the Commerce Committee by the \nsame authors, included a cap on punitive damages. I believe they were \nright last year and wrong this year on that particular section of the \nbill.\n  I believe some reform necessary in this area, but I believe their \nbest impulses and best instincts last year served them better than this \nyear when they decided to impose an arbitrary cap on punitive damages.\n  After all, the legislation requires you to provide clear and \nconvincing evidence as a burden of proof that the harm caused was \ncarried out with a--let me quote this--``conscious and flagrant \nindifference to the safety of others.'' If a plaintiff has gone through \ntrial and provided clear and convincing evidence that harm was caused \nor carried out with a conscious and flagrant indifference to the safety \nof others, then I do not understand why someone would suggest we ought \nto have a cap on punitive damages.\n  [[Page S6371]] The legislation that is before us contains a cap on \npunitive damages in several different steps. It is, as I understand it, \ntwo times compensatory damages to a maximum of $250,000, a distinction \nfrom that particular cap for small businesses, certain designated small \nbusinesses in the bill, and, third, a provision that a judge could \nincrease the punitive damage award upon a petition by the plaintiff. \nThat is my understanding of what is in the legislation that is before \nthe Senate. My amendment says, notwithstanding any other provision of \nthis act, nothing in this act shall impose limitations on punitive \ndamage awards.\n  Again and finally, let me say that this is the same position Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Gorton had last year, no cap on punitive \ndamages. And I think it is appropriate. The reason I think it is \nappropriate is we have changed the bar that you must get over in order \nto prove punitive damages. It requires clear and convincing evidence \nthat the harm caused was carried out with conscious and flagrant \nindifference to the safety of others.\n  I just do not understand how, if you meet that burden of proof and \ndemonstrate conscious and flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers, you can say to a corporation worth several billions of dollars, \nit would cost less to pay awards than it would to fix the problems. A \npunitive damages cap is appropriate. I really believe the Senate would \nimprove this legislation by adopting the very position the two managers \nof the bill had last year. Their first and best instinct was not to \nhave a punitive damages cap then. I believe that is the position the \nSenate ought to adopt now.\n  Mr. President, with that, I would hope, when we have another vote on \nthis, the Senate will decide to eliminate the punitive damages cap. \nWith that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, unlike the situation at the time at which \nthe Senator from North Dakota presented this amendment a week or so \nago, we now have a bill in the Chamber in which there is no cap on \npunitive damages. I say that not in triumph but in regret. I believe \nthat one of the great vices at which legislation of this sort properly \nshould be aimed is at creating some kind of relationship between the \nactual damages caused by a tort, caused by a wrong, and the damages \nthat can be recovered as a result. But with the latest set of \namendments here, we have permitted a judge on certain findings of \negregious conduct to go beyond what juries are permitted successfully \nto impose in the way of punitive damages.\n  The entire matter, Mr. President, is at one level an argument on \nphilosophy but at another level it is a debate about the Constitution \nof the United States. The Supreme Court in several recent cases, while \nnot setting a specific ceiling or cap on punitive damages itself, has \nspoken of serious constitutional questions caused by unlimited punitive \ndamages, or by punitive damages that are not related in any rational \nfashion to actual damages found by a jury or determined by a court.\n  In other words, the Supreme Court of the United States has invited \nthe Congress to do exactly what I had hoped we would do more \nsuccessfully than we have accomplished in this bill.\n  But just to go over it again, we have said that the maximum punitive \ndamages that can effectively be awarded by a jury are in an amount \ntwice the total of all economic damages and all noneconomic damages \nthat go for pain and suffering. And since those damages, in very \nserious cases of people being maimed for life, can well go into eight \nfigures, and sometimes do, we have a very large potential remaining for \npunitive damages. But in addition to that provision, in the so-called \nSnowe amendment is a $250,000 figure when twice the total of economic \nand noneconomic damages would be less than $250,000, together with the \nright of a judge to go beyond even the Snowe formula where the judge \nfeels that formula to be too limited not to permit proper punitive \ndamages for particularly egregious conduct.\n  So the Senator from North Dakota, in a number of respects, has \nalready succeeded. There is no number. There is no specific formula \nwhich limits punitive damages.\n  As I have said frequently, I think there should be. Working with the \nlaws of my own State and a handful of other States where punitive \ndamages are not allowed at all, where the cap is zero in most cases, we \nfind no difference in the safety or carefulness of business enterprises \nin those States. No case has been proven for the efficacy of punitive \ndamages as a deterrent, in any event. My own view is that the original \nlimitation in this bill was an appropriate one, but that original \nlimitation has twice been liberalized in the course of this debate. And \nI express the fervent hope that in concerning ourselves with the \nproposition that we should not permit absolutely unlimited discretion \non the part of juries, we should not have no maximum sentence in civil \ncases for wrongs, that we will make the partial and halting move toward \nsome kind of rationalization which is now contained in this bill.\n  Mr. President, we are in a peculiar situation here this morning in \nthat we have a potential of this amendment and one other to be dealt \nwith and we do not have specific limitations on the amount of time that \ncan be utilized for them. So I hope that, when either the Senator from \nWest Virginia or the Senator from North Dakota next speaks, we can get \nan indication as to when they will finish to allow the other amendment \nto take place. There will be votes on any other amendments which come \nup, but we will be asking unanimous consent that those votes take place \nafter closing arguments and before the vote on final passage. So the \nsooner we know how long these two amendments will be debated, the \nearlier we will be able to predict to our Senators who are not here \nwhen they will have to come back to the floor to vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a couple of points. I agree with what \nthe Senator from the State of Washington said in argument to this \namendment.\n  Just for the edification of my colleagues--this fact has not been \nbrought out, I do not believe, in the debate--we have removed caps, but \npeople do not realize, I think, often that there are caps on some \nrather extraordinary crimes in the Federal statutes. I will give some \nexamples.\n  Many Federal criminal fines, even for particularly egregious crimes, \ndo not exceed $250,000. And that was our original proposal, economic \ndamages times three or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  Listen to this. If you tamper with consumer products and it results \nin death, the Federal statute limitation is $100,000 for punitive \ndamages. If you retaliate against a witness, it is $250,000. If you \nassault the President, it is $10,000. If you rob a bank with the use of \na deadly weapon, the punitive damage limit cap is $10,000. Sexual \nexploitation of children for an individual, $100,000; in terms of an \norganization--however that would work out--$200,000. For treason--for \ntreason--$10,000.\n  Now I say that in no way to defend caps, because the Senator from \nWest Virginia has fought for the removal of caps and we have, I \nbelieve, been able to do that.\n  I would, in closing, remind my esteemed friend and colleague from the \nState of North Dakota, who is as principled a person as I have ever \nmet, that the Senator from the State of Washington and I have so \nbloodied ourselves in making sure we come back with effective removal \nof caps that we have said, and that we have been unable to obtain \nunanimous consent in this body to, in effect, make the cap total and \ncomplete because of a matter of 60 seconds in filing the amendment, \nthat if we bring back the amendment with anything but the cap removed, \nthat we will vote against the motion for cloture should there be a \nfilibuster on the conference report.\n  So I really do believe that we are operating not only in good faith \nbut in good substance on removal of the cap. I hope, therefore, that \nwhat I consider a redundant amendment by the Senator from North Dakota \nwould be defeated.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n   [[Page S6372]] Mr. DORGAN. I shall not prolong the debate. When I \nhave completed with my remarks, I see no reason that you could not \nenter a unanimous-consent request to have a vote. I have no objection \nto a vote.\n  First, let me make a couple of comments. The Senator from Washington \nsaid, and I think the Senator from West Virginia also seemed to say, \nthe way the bill is constructed, there really are not caps on punitive \ndamage awards. If that, in fact, is the case, then I would think that \nthey would have no objection to accepting language that says there are \nno caps on punitive damage awards. That is what my amendment says.\n  That was the Commerce Committee position last year on this bill. It \nwas the right position. We raised the bar on what you must prove to \nreceive a punitive damage award. Once we raised the bar, we felt it \ninappropriate to include caps. Now this year they want to include caps.\n  When the two Senators say there are not really caps, I understand \nwhat they are referencing. But, honestly, I think the claimants will \nfind there are caps. There is $250,000 written in. That is written \nthere for a reason. Because, under ordinary circumstances, that will be \na cap, two times compensatory damages.\n  Let me make two other quick points.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Just as a point of clarification, the reason that \nthe $250,000 was put in there in its new configuration was not in terms \nof the caps. We made certain that there was an alternate ceiling. So \nthat if the economic damages and the noneconomic damages did not appear \nto arrive at $250,000 multiplied by two, that the claimant would be \nguaranteed the $250,000. It is an alternate ceiling.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senators were building a floor rather than \ncreating a cap, I say, God bless the floor and let us just get rid of \nthe cap. Let us vote for my amendment and we will solve this.\n  But, let me make two other comments. First, if a company, a large \ncompany with vast resources, produces a product or a device that will \nbe used in the field of medicine discovers, during its testing, the \nproduct is sufficiently faulty in its operation and it may cause some \ndeaths; if the company fails to disclose that information and the \nproduct goes to market and some unsuspecting patient lies on a hospital \ngurney going into the operating room and dies during a routine \nprocedure and later the family discovers that person died because the \nproduct used was faulty and the company knew it, I suppose they would \nwant to bring a lawsuit against the company. In that case, I think \nsociety would want that company to be punished sufficiently so that \nother companies would understand you cannot do that, that kills people; \nyou ought to be punished for it. You ought not get a slap on the wrist, \nyou ought to be punished for it.\n  That is what punitive damage awards are for. The case I just \nmentioned is a real case, and there are plenty of cases like that.\n  There is not an epidemic of punitive damage awards in this country. \nIt happens rarely because it requires a substantial burden of proof, \nand we have increased that burden. There is no litigation crisis with \nrespect to punitive damages. In 25 years, the survey that I have seen--\n1965 to 1990--says that 355 punitive damages were awarded in State and \nFederal product liability lawsuits nationwide. This is a country of 250 \nmillion people; 355 punitive damage awards nationwide. Of those awards, \n35 are larger than $10 million. All but one of these awards were \nreduced, and 11 of the 35 were reduced to zero.\n  The point I make is, this is not an epidemic or crisis. Punitive \ndamage awards have not been escalating out of control. But I do think \nthere are certain circumstances where an enterprise worth billions \nmakes a conscious decision that we will risk whatever awards exist out \nthere because we will gain more profit by selling this, knowing the \ndefects, than we will risk paying the damages to someone injured or \nkilled by that product.\n  My own view is that there is merit on both sides of the debate on \nproduct liability. That is why I have decided to support and have \nsupported moving forward, increasing the standards, trying to shut down \nsome of the litigation in this country, because there is too much \nfrivolous litigation, as a matter of fact. The country is just prone to \nlitigate almost everything. We have too many lawyers in America. And we \nkeep training more and more every year.\n  I think there is merit to the position of the two Senators, that we \nought to do something in a reasonable way on product liability. I think \nthere is no merit to putting a cap on punitive damages. There was not \nmerit to it last year. They did not have it in the bill last year. They \nchanged their minds. Their first instinct is correct. Always stick with \nyour first instinct. My amendment will allow us to stick with your \nfirst instinct. If the Senate agrees, we will live with your victory of \nlast year deciding there shall not be punitive damages in the product \nliability bill.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Very briefly, Mr. President, I think that Members should \nknow that this amendment by the Senator from North Dakota is all-\nencompassing and that it overrides the amendment which was supported by \nthe vast majority of Members of the Senate that does have strict limits \non punitive damages in cases involving small businesses, businesses \nwith fewer than 25 employees and individuals of relatively modest means \nwhose total assets are less than half a million dollars.\n  So they, after having been the beneficiary of the last week of that \nvery careful protection, protection against absolute bankruptcy, should \nthe Dorgan amendment be adopted, they will be thrown into a situation \nin which absolutely unlimited punitive damages can be awarded against \nthem. It is important for Members to understand that.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. With that, Mr. President, now having cleared this with \nthe Democratic side, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on, or in \nrelation to, the Dorgan amendment, or in relation to any other \namendment in order, and final passage occur back to back at the \nconclusion of the previously allotted time with the first vote limited \nto 15 minutes and the other consecutive votes in the voting sequence \nlimited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was going to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to table the Dorgan amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against passage of this \nbill. I realize that, with cloture having been invoked, my words may \nnot change many votes, but maybe they might change one or two. And then \nI feel like maybe my remarks, in a strong adversarial posture, might \nappeal to the reason of Senators to encourage them to eliminate some of \nthe grossly unfair provisions that are in this bill.\n  I might say in the beginning that I believe the difference between \nthe caps that are put in this bill and the fact that there were no caps \nin the last bill reflects a change in the makeup of the Senate, as a \nresult of last November's elections.\n  There are caps in this bill with an additur provision whereby a judge \ncould increase a jury's award of punitive damages. Clearly, that has \nalready been ruled on by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional. \nThe case of Dimick versus Schiedt was decided in 1935 on that issue and \nmakes the additur provision unconstitutional.\n  In my judgment, there are a number of other unconstitutional elements \nthat should be pointed out. One is the matter pertaining to the role of \nthe U.S. circuit courts of appeal being able to determine controlling \nprecedent on the State courts within the jurisdiction of the Federal \ncircuit.\n   [[Page S6373]] Article III of section 1 of the Constitution, which \nprovides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested \nin one Supreme Court, has been construed to mean that the State courts \nmust follow the decision of the Supreme Court and not the lower Federal \ncourts.\n  The case of Erie versus Tompkins basically says that the Federal \ncourts, in diversity cases, shall follow the substantive law of the \nState. There is no question that the Federal courts, through its \nrulemaking process and Congress, pursuant to its powers under the Rules \nEnabling Act, control in regards to procedural matters. I just want to \nmention that.\n  I want to direct the Senate's attention to a chart that Senator Levin \nproduced and used in a previous argument. I thought it was an excellent \npresentation, and I ask unanimous consent that this table be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  PREEMPTION OF STATE PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWS UNDER S. 565, AS REPORTED  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  State laws  State laws\n                                                     more        more   \n                                                   favorable   favorable\n                                                      to          to    \n                                                  plaintiffs  defendants\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiability of product sellers....................

Do.   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this is chart entitled ``Preemption of \nState Product Liability Laws,'' and it has a column of State laws more \nfavorable to plaintiffs and State laws more favorable to defendants and \nwhat happens as regards preemption under this legislation. First as to \nthe liability of product sellers, that is retailers, this bill \nprohibits any laws more favorable to plaintiff, but it allows laws more \nfavorable to the defendants. Second, with respect to the alcohol or \ndrug abuse defense, the bill prohibits State laws more favorable to \nplaintiffs but it allows State laws more favorable to defendants. \nThird, as to the misuse or alteration of product defense, the bill \nprohibits State laws more favorable to plaintiffs but allows State laws \nmore favorable to defendants.\n  Punitive damage limitations are treated the same way--unfavorable as \nto plaintiffs and favorable as to defendants. As to the statutes of \nlimitations, that is the one and only provision that really exists in \nthis whole bill is as to uniformity.\n  With regard to the statute of repose provision of 20 years, this bill \npreempts State laws more favorable to plaintiffs but not those State \nlaws more favorable to defendants.\n  On the issue of eliminating joint and several liability for \nnoneconomic damages, this bill preempts State laws which are more \nfavorable to plaintiffs but allow State laws which are more favorable \nto defendants. And you have the biomaterials provisions which are \ntreated in the same manner. I think this chart Senator Levin prepared \nis a very excellent chart, and I hope my colleagues will take time to \nreflect upon it.\n  Now, I want to also direct my colleagues attention to the potential \ncosts of the bill, an issue which I hope will be investigated, because \nI do not believe CBO or anyone else has looked at this matter very \nclosely. There is language in the bill that includes within the scope \nof the word ``claimant'' a governmental entity which includes the \nFederal Government and all of its entities.\n  I do not think there is any question that the purpose of this bill is \nto save product manufacturers money. The Government, as a claimant, \nwould be bringing suit against a defendant, and if the purpose of the \nbill is to save money, it means it saves money for the defendant, for \ncorporate America, when the Federal Government brings suit.\n  So the cost to the Government has never been calculated, and there \nare so many things that are involved, particularly like the statute of \nlimitations and statute of repose as to helicopters, tanks, NASA \nequipment, and all of GSA's equipment, and every conceivable way \nregarding which products are purchased by the Government. The issue of \ncosts to the Government ought to be looked at more closely in my \njudgment.\n  Now, there is also a provision dealing with foreign nationals and \nforeign governments, and I realize that this is under statutory \nconstruction, that nothing in this title can be construed to preempt \nState choice of law rules with respect to claims brought by a foreign \nnation or a citizen of a foreign nation and, in effect, the right of \nany court to transfer venue, or to apply the law of a foreign nation, \nor to dismiss a claim of a foreign nation, or of a citizen of a foreign \nnation, on the grounds of inconvenient forum.\n  In the world of terrorism today, these issues ought to be addressed. \nHopefully, in the terrorist bill that will come before the Senate in \nthe coming weeks, we will give some consideration regarding this issue. \nThe Senate ought to make certain that the provisions of this product \nliability bill do not in some unintended way give some advantage to a \nterrorist entity.\n  I think one of the most unfair provisions in this legislation is the \nprovision that says that an injured party cannot introduce in the \ncompensatory damage part of a trial elements of conduct that constitute \na cause of action for punitive damages. Therefore, as I have pointed \nout before, gross negligence, recklessness, wantonness, intentional \nconduct, and all activity of a similar nature, is prohibited from being \nconsidered in the main trial for compensatory damages. To me, that is \none of the most unfair provisions that exist in this bill.\n  The biomaterials section and the definition of implants therein, \nwhere there is language regarding coming in contact through a \nsurgically produced opening and coming in contact with bodily fluids or \ntissue, in my judgment, is a wide-open situation for a great deal of \nproblems pertaining to component parts of the implant, and I urge that \nthat be carefully reviewed.\n  Some of these issues which I have just reviewed--and I hope some \npeople in the White House are listening to me as I speak about this--\nought to be carefully considered not only by the Department of Justice \nand every agency of Government that could be affected. Certainly, the \nFDA ought to consider the language that is being placed into this bill \nas to matters dealing with the human body in that biomaterial \ndefinition of ``loss.''\n  Of course, the very basic unfairness of the bill begins with the fact \nthat commercial loss, which is a business loss, is excluded from being \nwithin the purview of this bill.\n  Of course, I have given illustrations on the floor about the fact \nthat if a factory blows up and people that are injured from the faulty, \ndefective product, they come under this bill; but for commercial law, \nthey do not.\n  Some say the commercial loss exemption might be applied to \nindividuals. I remember there was a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \ncirculated on this issue. I would imagine in that instance we would \nfind it would be rarely ever used, we might find out of 2,000 employees \nin a factory where a boiler blows up, we might find that there might be \none moonlighting sock salesman. That would be the only way that we \nwould have, basically, any commercial loss that would occur to that \nindividual.\n  Now, most of all of the business litigation and most of the punitive \ndamages awards that have come about are business or commercial losses. \nThe case of Pennzoil versus Texaco was, for example, probably the \nlargest punitive damages case that has ever been awarded, and it was a \ncommercial litigation where business was suing other business.\n  There are other provisions throughout the bill that are very unfair, \nand I have listed them in previous arguments. I hope that this bill \nwill be carefully reviewed in conference and we will see the removal of \na great number unwise provisions.\n  I just appeal to the conscience of the people that are involved who \nwill be in conference on this, and appeal to the White House to look at \nthis matter when it reaches conference between the House and Senate. It \njust shocks the conscience to see the unfairness that exists in all the \nvarious provisions of this bill and I hope that I have pointed out the \nkey issue very clearly for my colleagues to consider. Mr. President, I \nurge that we vote no on final passage.\n   [[Page S6374]] Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I encourage my \ncolleagues would vote aye on this bill.\n  Mr. President, while I had my doubts, I have believed for a long time \nthat the Senate would eventually come to this point. Inexorably, it \nwould happen. After many years of debate, many years of filibusters on \nthis Senate floor, this body finally has a chance to cast its vote for \nwhat I think is responsible, balanced punitive damages tort reform.\n  I think the vote yesterday was historic. The Senate, for the first \ntime, broke the log jam that has blocked action on what I referred to \nlast night as a deadly serious issue, and the Senate has blocked that \nfor years and years. Now the Senate has said, ``proceed.''\n  My belief that this time would come is based on several points. First \nand foremost, the problems with our punitive damages system cry out for \nsolutions. We are here for that purpose. We were elected to address the \nproblems that require attention and action. We have done so to the best \nof our ability.\n  In this case, because products by definition, virtually, involve \ninterstate commerce--that point has been made but not accepted, I \nsuppose, by all--70 percent of everything we make in West Virginia is \nsold in another State. By definition, States cannot preoccupy this \nfield. This is precisely an area where Congress needs to step in.\n  Each State really cannot fix the flaws of the country's interstate \nproduct liability system. That is because the biggest problem involves \nthe patchwork--varied, unpredictable nature--of every State in the \nunion having different product liability rules and standards.\n  Businesses that sell or manufacture products are subject to the \nendless confusion, the hassle, the court costs, the wasteful costs, in \ngeneral, of this maze.\n  Consumers who want safe products want more products that will \nincrease their safety and cannot get them. Consumers who are victims of \ndefective products and cannot get recompensed for an average of 3 \nyears, are also hurt by the delays and the costs that stem from the \nproduct liability system. So businesses hurt, consumers are hurt. We \nhave a problem.\n  My interest in these problems really stem from seeing the way they \nhurt my own State of West Virginia. Manufacturers, small businesses, \nthe fear, consumers, workers, and the victims of defective products.\n  The Senator from North Dakota several moments ago said that there has \nonly been x numbers of liability cases in the last 2 years, 10 years \nwhatever. That argument has been used many, many times. It is a very \nmisleading, false argument. It is not the number of punitive damages \nawards that have been granted. It is the threat which exists in every \ncase, in every suit, of which there are unending numbers in this \nlitigious society.\n  It is the threat of litigation that is the problem and has crushed so \nmuch innovation and research and development which would help \nconsumers.\n  My interest, again, in West Virginia comes from knowing people who \ndirectly have suffered from this and have gone out of business from \nthis, as well as victims who have been hurt by this. I have seen the \nvictims who came back from the Persian Gulf war with something called a \nmystery syndrome illness which the Defense Department says does not \nexist, but I see these people and I know it does exist.\n  When we see the people, and we see the individuals and we see they \nare hurt, we want to help them. To put it simply, then, the product \nliability system is broken. The Congress and the President must have \nparity.\n  Second, I have believed that a product liability reform bill would \neventually pass this Senate because of the way some Members have \napproached the effort to cause it to pass, which I believe it will.\n  Members of both sides of the aisle have been troubled by the problems \nwith product liability. Some time ago the bipartisan team work \nnecessary to enact legislation began to form. In the past 4 years, the \nSenator from the State of Washington and I have had the job of leading \nthat team. The Senator from Washington and I made a pact: To promote a \nbalanced, moderate, serious, legislative remedy to these problems in \nproduct liability, tort reform.\n  We let the businesses interested in reform know that the consumers \nand victims had to be the winners of reform, too. We made that very \nclear and have made that very clear up until the very last moments.\n We have kept making it clear.\n\n  We explained to the general public that the harm done to business by \nthe problems with product liability also hurt the general public, which \nis called the rest of the country. They cost jobs, they stifle the \ninnovation needed to make safer drugs and products, and they impose an \nenormous hidden tax on every American.\n  That is why we devised a bill to deal with the range of problems that \naffect different sectors of the society, and we did it fairly. In this \nlegislation we promote quicker settlements through alternative dispute \nresolution. We insisted on that so victims get compensation faster. We \ngive the victims of harm done by substances like asbestos enough time \nto seek relief by saying the clock can only run after they discover the \nharm that they are suffering and, again, the reason, the cause of the \nharm they are suffering.\n  We have made a number of adjustments in the way businesses are made \nliable for the impact of products where the rules are not fair to them.\n  But my point is also that this bill reflects the balance and the \nmoderation that emerges when Members of both sides of the aisle choose \nto work together, choose to trust one another, choose to accommodate \nthe diverse concerns that arise when a complicated topic like product \nliability comes up.\n  We are not seeing a lot of bipartisanship in the legislative process \nthese days, and it is sad. It is more than sad for the country, it is \ngrievous. I find all of that very troublesome. I think it is \nessentially a disservice to the country. We are a diverse nation with a \nGovernment designed to represent our differences and built with checks \nand balances on one another. We should draw on the strength of that \ndiversity. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate should spend more \ntime, I think, working together on the country's problems, working out \nsolutions that will last and that will take root.\n  I think we do that in this bill. And when we do have bipartisan \ncooperation and it works, it only encourages us to do more, I hope. \nThat is why the Senator from Washington and I formed the team to deal \nwith the problems of product liability, and we intend to maintain that \nbipartisanship until we see a bill signed into law sometime later this \nyear.\n  Finally, my belief that product liability legislation would pass has \nbeen based on the talent and the leadership that have been invested in \nthis effort. Many Members of this body have contributed to this \narduous, difficult effort. Senators Dodd and Lieberman have been \nstaunch allies, and their staffs, Tony Orza and Nina Bang-Jensen. \nSenators on the other side of the aisle, from the majority leader to \nthe chairmen of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees, have played \nessential roles in this. It is impossible to fully explain how much I \nrespect and appreciate the Senator from Washington, Slade Gorton. I \nthink he stands out for, first of all, his acumen, his amazing mind, \nhis tenacity, the wisdom of his counsel, his calmness under substantial \nfire, and his commitment to reform.\n  The staff who have assisted in this effort I think deserve medals for \ntheir valor and service and for their, by the way, exhaustion. On \nSenator Gorton's staff, Lance Bultena and Trent Erickson have been \nsteady, quiet, dogged, and perfect in helping us work this through.\n  Assisting me, I cannot thank enough, and I would need to start with \nTamera Stanton, who is my legislative director who sits at my left as I \nspeak, who masters all subjects with tenacity and with understanding, \nis skillful in her sense of nuance, strategy, politics, and policy; \nEllen Doneski, who does not know how to stop working, and as a result \nnever does stop working and accomplishes incredible, amazing things, \noften many at the same time, so she just never stops working; Jim \nGottlieb and Bill Brew, both in fact lawyers, which we need in our \noffice. And they have both been brilliant, skillful, dogged, and \nsuccessful. Without their labors and their incredible talent we would \nnot be at this point.\n   [[Page S6375]] I do not want to take the body's time, but I just \nwant to make the point again that, if you pick up the paper, you will \nread Senator Gorton's name. If you listen to the television, you will \nhear his name and Senator Hollings' name. And they can both do all of \nthis on their own, pretty much, anyway. But actually it does not quite \nwork out that way. Just as Senator Hollings, Kevin Curtin, and others--\nit is the public that needs to know, while they are in their orgy of \ndislike for the Federal Government, that there are incredible people \ncalled staff of the U.S. Senators who make possible what it is that we \ndo.\n  I want to acknowledge with respect the persistence and commitment of \nthe flag-bearers who took the other side on this issue. The Senators \nfrom Alabama and South Carolina are daunting in their own legal minds \nand ferocity when it comes to this issue--both of them. They are \ndifferent in many ways, the same in many ways, but both of them are \nextraordinary in their commitment to their beliefs. I hope they would \nagree it was a fair and open debate. They prevailed in the past without \nexception. It worked out the other way this time.\n  This has not been an easy issue for anybody involved. The legal \nsystem is a very serious part of our national fabric and life. The \nrights of every American are fundamental and are not to be tampered \nwith easily. I have always felt that, as I have fought for product \nliability reform, in a sense I restate my pledge to navigate the \nremainder of the legislative process with a deep commitment to the \nprinciples of fairness and justice.\n  But I remain absolutely sure that it is time to fix this broken part \nof our legal system, and I think we have done a lot of it. The country \nis saddled with costs, with waste, with problems that can be eased with \nthe reforms in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am proud to give the Senate a chance, finally, to \ncast its vote on a balanced legislative remedy. I am relieved we \nrestored a bill simply dealing with product liability and with the \nimportant changes worked out in the final hours that represent the \nbipartisanship and the balance that we sought from the beginning of \nthis effort.\n  I am confident that President Clinton will sign this bill with \nwhatever perfections we can make. I hope we will soon see the benefits \nof reform and demonstrate to the skeptics that the changes are in the \nentire Nation's interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first a procedural announcement. Thirty \nminutes remains under the order with respect to debate on product \nliability. Senators in their offices, therefore, should be on notice \nthat approximately at 11:40 there will be a vote on my motion to table \nthe Dorgan amendment, followed immediately by a vote on final passage \nof the product liability bill with, we think, the substitute adopted by \nvoice vote. So Members should be prepared to come to the floor at or \nshortly after 11:40.\n  On a second matter, in which I know I am joined by my colleague from \nWest Virginia, regrettably, due to the inability of the Senators from \nWashington and West Virginia to get unanimous consent to make one \nadditional change in their proposal, the so-called new trial provision \nafter an additur remains in this bill.\n The Senators from West Virginia and Washington have pledged that the \nbill will not be presented by them to this body with that provision in \nit, and that pledge remains.\n\n  Other than that, this bill is the work of many years of effort \nculminated in this Congress, as in the last Congress, by the joint \nefforts of the Senator from West Virginia and myself, and of many \nothers whom I will mention after we have had a final vote. Together, \nwith the input from Members on both sides of the aisle, I am confident \nthat the bill will pass and that it will represent a significant step \nforward.\n  Mr. President, one other comment that I make as a sponsor and one of \nthe people who drafted this bill in the punitive damages section, we \nincluded an additive provision at the request of the Department of \nJustice of the United States, with the assurance that the provision is \nconstitutional. That opinion, in my view, is correct. Such provisions \nare found in the laws of many States. If a court should, however, find \nthe additive provisions to be unconstitutional, it is our intention \nthat the remainder of the punitive damages provision will stand and \nthat only the additive provision which is now found in section \n107(b)(3) would be severed.\n  Mr. President, one argument against congressional legislation in this \nfield, which has been raised by almost all of those who have come here \nto speak against it, is that we should not interfere in the Federal \nsystem with the laws of the 50 States. It is a curious argument as it \nis generally advanced by those Members of this body who are most \nanxious to interfere with the prerogatives of the States in many areas \nfor which there is no explicit constitutional warrant. This, however, \nis a case in which congressional legislation is expressly warranted by \nthe Constitution, and may very well have been anticipated, or would \nhave been anticipated had they known what the economy of the United \nStates would look like in the late 20th century, by those who wrote the \nConstitution itself. One of the principal reasons for the \nConstitutional Convention was the chaos that attended interstate \ncommerce among the 13 States after the close of the War of the \nRevolution and before the adoption of the Constitution.\n  So under article I, section 8, clause 3, the interstate commerce \nclause, the Congress is invited, is given plenary power over interstate \ncommerce. Of course, most of the products with which this bill deals \nare made of materials that arrive in interstate commerce and are sold \nafter they are manufactured in interstate commerce, and a far greater \ndegree of uniformity that is now in this bill would be constitutionally \nwarranted. The compromises in this bill are in certain cases political \nand in other cases highly principled attempts to provide a degree of \npredictability and uniformity which will lead to more economic \ndevelopment, greater jobs, and better products for consumers with the \nvery real history of local control over our courts and over our \nlitigation. But as long ago as in the Federalist Papers, Alexander \nHamilton made it clear that one of the key purposes of the Constitution \nwas to prevent interstate commerce from being, and I quote him: \n``Fettered, interrupted, and narrowed'' by parochial State regulations.\n  That, regrettably, is exactly what we have, particularly in that \nhandful of States, often in rural counties, in which we find repeated \nhuge punitive damage awards, almost invariably entered against out-of-\nState defendants or out-of-State corporations in a way which fetters, \ninterrupts, and narrows interstate commerce by discouraging research \nand development and discouraging the marketing of new products. We have \nseen that happen in instance after instance in which companies large \nand small have found it improvident to develop new products to cure \npreviously incurably diseases or to solve problems in our society \nbecause they might have an adverse impact on some individual, and that \nindividual might sue and that individual might persuade a jury in \nsomeplace or another to award punitive damages in an amount that would \nmake it utterly unprofitable ever to have entered that business in the \nfirst place.\n  Perhaps worse, and perhaps a greater interference with interstate \ncommerce, is successful defense litigation where large companies find \nthat they have spent tens of millions of dollars successfully defending \nagainst product liability litigation over products, that gross price of \nwhich is far less than those legal fees. So they say, ``Why produce \nparts for implant into the bodies of people of the United States, as \nmuch good as those things do?\"\n  It is our hope to make a modest step forward in creating a balance, \nnot by denying any person the right to go to court, not by limiting the \nactual damages that any individual can receive for an act which is the \nresponsibility of the individual or company which is called upon to \nmake payment, but to see to it that there are fewer arbitrary \n [[Page S6376]] judgments; that less of the time defendants are \nrequired to pay for the negligence or for the acts of others.\n  Mr. President, a day or so ago, the Senator from California [Mrs. \nBoxer], argued at length with respect to the McCain-Lieberman portions \nof this bill on biomaterials and that corporations would be allowed to \nset up shell subsidiaries and protect themselves from liabilities.\n  That concern was raised in the Commerce Committee by the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon], and expressly taken care of by an amendment that \nwill allow piercing that corporate shell and not preventing the \ncorporation, which is actually in control and which has assets, from \nprotecting itself from the consequences of its own negligence.\n  But basically, Mr. President, we now have a product liability bill \nwhich includes a statutory repose for products that are used in a \nbusiness enterprise. We have a limitation on joint liability with \nrespect to noneconomic damages--that is, pain and suffering--under \nwhich we simply say that you are responsible as a defendant for the \ndegree to which you have harmed the claimant, but that a defendant that \nis only 10 or 20 percent responsible for these damages is not going to \nbe charged for the entire verdict simply because some other defendant \ncannot be reached.\n  We have imposed some modest rationality on the award of punitive \ndamages. My colleague here this morning came up with one of the best \nsets of examples I have ever heard, something which has not been \nbrought before the Senate in this 3 weeks, when he points out that for \nall practical purposes every Federal criminal statute which includes \nthe right to a fine as a part of the sentence has a limitation on those \nfines, and yet to be subjected to a criminal fine one must be found \nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. One has all of the protections of the \nfifth amendment against self-incrimination. And yet here we, the \nCongress of the United States, have set a maximum fine, $10,000; \nmaximum fine, $25,000. I think the maximum fine they found was \n$250,000.\n  We vote for these criminal penalties, and yet our opponents tell us \nhow outrageous it is in a civil case, with no fifth amendment rights, \nno standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, how unreasonable it is \nto set any limit on what a jury can do in the way of punishment--\npunishment over and beyond all of the damages that are actually proven \nby the claimant in a particular case.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a perfect bill, in my view, and it is \nnot a perfect bill because it does not limit that form of arbitrary \npunishment sufficiently. But it does begin down a road which we have \nbeen invited to take by the Supreme Court of the United States which \nsays without having set standards itself that there are constitutional \nimplications to unlimited punitive damage verdicts. And so here we have \nan experiment. We attempt to balance the rights of trial lawyers \nagainst the necessity for a better and more effective economy, one in \nwhich people are encouraged to innovate, to create new jobs and to \ncreate new products for the American people.\n  We have been at this for a long time. I know from personal experience \nthat there were product liability bills in the Senate and in the \nCommerce Committee on which I serve as long ago as 1982. I suspect that \nthey existed before that time. I can remember one product liability \nbill in that committee against which I voted myself because it seemed \nto me it went too far, that it was unbalanced on the other side. This \none is not, Mr. President. This one is a good piece of legislation. It \nis something that will help the American economy and help the cause of \nbalanced and appropriate justice.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is a precedent in a sense but it has one \npreceding element. A year or so ago, we passed a very modest product \nliability bill for piston driven aircraft. The legal system, the legal \nsystem defended by the other side here, had destroyed that business, \nreduced its production by 95 percent. A modest change in the law at the \nFederal level has already contributed to the recovery, the beginning of \nthe recovery of that business--a dramatic illustration that the horror \nstories are not true and that the promises made by the proponents of \nthis litigation have been proven to be valid by history. If my \ncolleagues will vote for this, if we get it accepted by the House and \nsigned by the President of the United States, this country will be \nsignificantly better off.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, so reasoned, says my distinguished colleague from \nWashington. It is so balanced. GOPAC has taken over. Gingrich is the \nSpeaker, and there is a contract. Look at the elements of this \ncontract. Part and parcel either by way of amendments here or in bills \non the House side or what they have in mind is not just product \nliability but they have limiting pain and suffering damages; they have \nlimiting the punitive damages; they tried to fit in medical \nmalpractice; they tried to then limit plaintiff's attorney's fees. They \nvoted against the fees on the defendants. They were not making enough. \nThey ought to make more than $133,000 a year. They tried to limit \npunitive damages in all civil cases. The English rule is in the bill \nover on the House side; the alternative dispute resolution with the \nplaintiff having to pay all the fees; the securities litigation, the \nFDA and FAA rules where they would bar damages if the product is \napproved by either of those entities; they exempt the medical devices \nand the doctors, a provision about frivolous suits, statutes of repose; \nrestricted submission of evidence is in this bill, in the House bills, \nbifurcation of the trials, both actual and punitive damages. Then they \neven put in an unconstitutional additur provision here.\n  Like the sheepdog had tasted blood, with product liability they are \ngoing to gobble up all the other rights and say it is so reasoned and \nso balanced.\n  One exemption they have from all this, Mr. President. One exemption--\nthe manufacturers, the very crowd that through this bill continue to \nput in the amendments and everything else. They exempt the manufacturer \nand apply this all to the injured party and have the unmitigated gall \nto come up here and say they are for consumers. Why, heavens above. \nCome on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the State-based \norganizations opposed to this legal reform bill.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nState Based Organizations Opposed to ``Legal Reform'' in the Senate (S. \n                                  565)\n\n       Alaska PIRG.\n       Arizona

Montgomery, AL, April 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby: On behalf of our members, I am writing \n     to thank you for your past opposition to federal ``tort \n     reform'' legislation and to offer our support in your efforts \n     this year.\n       As you know, Governor Fob James, in his April 18th State of \n     the State Address, stated that ``intrusive federal law should \n     not dictate tort reform legislation to the states.'' You \n     might also be interested to know that similar sentiments have \n     been reflected by the majority of audiences in several forums \n     I have attended on the issued in the past month.\n       Our members also are deeply concerned about the \n     consequences of capping punitive damages and eliminating \n     joint and several liability for non-economic damages. \n     Proposals such as these threaten public safety in Alabama by \n     removing the deterrent effect of punitive damages, and they \n     discriminate against those most likely to suffer non-economic \n     damages, such as women, seniors, and children.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in fighting to uphold \n     the democratic principles embodied in our state civil justice \n     system and for voting ``no'' on the upcoming cloture votes on \n     S. 565. Please do not hesitate to call on me for any \n     assistance on this matter in the coming weeks.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        Mike Odom,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Arizona Consumers Council,\n\n                                      Phoenix, AZ, April 19, 1995.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Two bills are expected to come to the \n     floor this week--The Telecommunications Competition and \n     Deregulation Act of 1995, and the Product Liability Fairness \n     Act of 1995. We believe that these bills are both anti-\n     consumer and anti-competitive.\n       Consumers have been strong in their requests to continue \n     regulation of cable and in feeling that their bills have gone \n     too high--three times the rate of inflation--for this \n     service. Reregulation was the ONLY bill which was passed over \n     the veto of President Bush.\n       Your office asked me to represent you on KFYI in favor of \n     reregulation at that time. I did my best on that program.\n       Local cable companies now have a network which pass 96% of \n     the homes in the country. They are best positioned to compete \n     with the monopoly local telephone companies. This bill would \n     permit these local monopolies to buy each other, merge or \n     joint venture, thus eliminating the most likely competitor in \n     each market. This means the promised benefits of competition, \n     including lower prices, greater innovation and better service \n     may never be realized by most consumers.\n       S. 565 sets arbitrary limits on punitive damages and \n     eliminates joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages. This bill will restrict the ability of injured \n     consumers to obtain full and fair compensation for their \n     injuries, and for juries to act to prevent further \n     wrongdoing.\n       The Arizona Consumers Council which represents consumers in \n     all countries of the state and was organized in 1966 is also \n     a member of Consumer Federation of America, who represent 50 \n     million consumers nationwide, we urge you to opposed S. 652. \n     and also S. 565.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Phyllis Rowe,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Consumer Federation\n\n\n                                                of California,\n\n                                  Westminster, CA, April 18, 1995.\n     Re Opposition to S. 565 and S. 454.\n\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the Consumer Federation of \n     California, I wish to express strong opposition to S 565, the \n     ``Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995.'' Injured consumers \n     would not be able to obtain full and fair compensation if \n     this legislation is passed.\n       The two major provisions of this legislation would have a \n     far reaching, negative impact on consumers and workers. \n     First, this bill would set arbitrary limits on punitive \n     damage awards of $250,000 or three times economic damages, \n     reducing the ability to deter corporations from inflicting \n     harm on others and threatening Americans' economic security \n     and well being. At a time when Congress is talking about \n     increasing personal responsibility, it makes no sense to \n     reduce the responsibility of corporations guilty of \n     manufacturing or selling dangerous products.\n       Second, this bill would eliminate joint and several \n     liability for noneconomic damages, making it difficult for \n     consumers to recover costs related to injuries such as the \n     loss of reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or \n     disfigurement. Those injuries deserve to be compensated and \n     should not be treated as less important than the loss of high \n     salaries or investment income.\n       Consumer Federation of California also urges you to oppose \n     S. 454, ``The Health Care Liability and Quality Assurance \n     Act'' which would severely affect the rights of injured \n     patients.\n       I urge you to act to prevent passage of this legislation, \n     which would greatly restrict the ability of the consumer to \n     be compensated fully for injuries and to act to prevent \n     further wrong doing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Dr. Regene L. Mitchell,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Motor Voters,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, April 19, 1995.\n     Re S. 565: Oppose.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Motor Voters is a non-profit, non-\n     partisan auto safety organization founded in Lemon Grove, \n     outside San Diego, in 1979.\n       This letter is to urge you to oppose S. 565, the product \n     liability measure. Our members include parents of children \n     who suffered permanent, debilitating brain injuries or who \n     were killed due to the deliberate disregard of auto \n     manufacturers.\n       It would be impossible to tell you how strongly those \n     parents feel that companies need to be held accountable for \n     their actions. In fact, they wish to see the law strengthened \n     to provide for felony criminal penalties for corporate \n     executives who knowingly market unsafe products.\n       Corporate executive are too insulated from the damage they \n     inflict upon their customers and the public at large. If they \n     were more personally accountable, it would provide a \n     desperately needed incentive for them to consider more than \n     their bottom line.\n       In the absence of criminal penalties, the only hope we have \n     of curbing rampant corporate misconduct is through product \n     liability laws. It is appalling that special interests are \n     seeking to restrict remedies in consumers' court of last \n     resort. The ``loser pays'' concept is particularly \n     pernicious, as it entirely ignores the unequal footing of the \n     two \n      [[Page S6378]] parties. Individuals already risk a great \n     deal when they sue a giant corporation, and experience \n     tremendous stress. A family with a brain-injured child has \n     enough to worry about without the danger that, if their \n     attorney makes a mistake, they can be totally impoverished.\n       Ironically, many advances in safety technology, spurred by \n     lawsuits, end up benefiting everyone--including companies. \n     For example, here in California, many former defense \n     contractors are converting to making auto safety components \n     such as air bags. The demand for improved safety is spawning \n     an entire new industry and creating new, high-tech jobs. It \n     is time to move forward, not back.\n       For all of the above reasons, I urge your ``no'' vote on S. \n     565.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Rosemary Shahan,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        California Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, April 24, 1995.\n     Protect Victims of Dangerous Products--Oppose Cloture and \n         Vote ``No'' on S. 565.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, We are writing on behalf of \n     CALPIRG's members, and on behalf of all residents of \n     California to urge your strong opposition to proposed \n     legislation, S. 565, that would eviscerate the rights of \n     victims of dangerous and defective products. As you know, \n     CALPIRG is a statewide, non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and \n     environmental advocacy group that has fought to protect the \n     rights of consumers for many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable. Yet the Senate must also consider that, if \n     passed, S. 565 would have to be reconciled with the even more \n     egregious and extreme House-passed bill. H.R. 1075, in \n     addition to the measures above, arbitrarily caps pain and \n     suffering awards in medical malpractice cases and establishes \n     an automatic punitive damages shield for FDA-approved \n     products. Worse, the House cap on punitive damages extends to \n     all civil lawsuits, not only to product liability cases.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, against S. \n     565 and against any conference measure restricting the rights \n     of consumers. We look forward to hearing your views on this \n     important legislation. Please contact me if you or your staff \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mary Raftery,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Coalition for\n\n\n                                     Accountability & Justice,\n\n                                                   April 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We, the undersigned individuals and \n     organizations, urge you to oppose efforts to weaken America's \n     civil justice system. We urge you to vote against cloture on \n     S. 565, the product liability measure sponsored by Sens. \n     Gorton and Rockefeller, or any other legislation that would \n     weaken the rights of the citizens of Colorado.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By giving ``non-economic'' damages second-\n     class treatment, the bill discriminates against populations \n     with less earning power, specifically women, children, \n     seniors and low- and middle-income workers. Under S. 565, the \n     U.S. would have a two-tier system of justice where rich, \n     high-salaried workers would be accorded better treatment and \n     higher damage awards than the rest of us. Finally, by \n     establishing brand new federal rules for product liability \n     cases, S. 565 removes from state authority and oversight a \n     civil justice system that, despite the hyperbole of the big \n     business interests backing this legislation, has served \n     consumers and the residents of Colorado exceedingly well.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen, or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years. Moreover, S. 565 adds protection for manufacturers of \n     raw materials in medical devices and for rental car \n     companies, and reduces manufacturer liability for misuses or \n     alterations made to the product by anyone else--provisions \n     that were not in last year's bill. Even if one reasonably \n     believes that the measure introduced by Sens. Gorton and \n     Rockefeller is sound public policy (which we do not), it must \n     ultimately be reconciled with the extreme revisions to the \n     civil justice system recently adopted by the House of \n     Representatives. H.R. 956, in addition to the provisions \n     outlined above, enacts an arbitrary cap on pain and suffering \n     awards in medical malpractice and cases involving drugs and \n     medical devices, at the same time it offers an automatic \n     punitive damages shield for products that have received FDA \n     approval. In addition, the House measure extends the cap on \n     punitive damages to all civil lawsuits, and establishes an \n     arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for product liability \n     cases.\n       Passage of either of these measures, or a combination of \n     the two, would cause grievous harm to the people who have \n     elected you--and depend on you--to represent their interests \n     in Congress. We urge you to oppose any effort to weaken or \n     federalize product liability laws, and to vote ``no'' on \n     cloture on S. 565, on S. 565, and on any conference committee \n     reported-measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Julie Shiels, Son killed by defective bunkbed; \n           International Steelworkers Union, Local 2102; Coalition \n           of Silicon Survivors; DES Action, Colorado Chapter; \n           Denver United Auto Workers; ACLU of Colorado; Gray \n           Panthers of Denver; Colorado Public Interest Research \n           Group (CoPIRG); Clean Water Action, Colorado Chapter; \n           Ann Ives, Silicon breast survivor, DES survivor; Oil, \n           Chemical & Atomic Worker International Union, AFL-CIO; \n           Colorado Senior Lobby.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Colorado Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, April 24, 1995.\n     Re Protect Victims of Dangerous Products--Oppose Cloture and \n         Vote No. on S. 565.\n\n     Hon.

S. 565, called the ``Product Liability \n     Fairness Act'' does nothing to protect consumers. Instead, it \n     lets corporate wrongdoers off the hook when they produce \n     products that injure consumers.\n       First, this bill sets arbitrary caps on punitive damages of \n     $250,000 or three times the out-of-pocket expenses. Ordinary \n     citizens serving on juries use these awards to punish and \n     deter outrageous and dangerous behavior by corporations.\n       Second, this bill makes it more difficult for victims with \n     less earning power--particularly seniors, women and \n     children--to recover the fair cost of their injuries. \n     Consumers and workers injured through no fault of their own, \n     but by the actions of more than one wrongdoer would have to \n     prove the degree of fault of each liable party. If any \n     wrongdoer were unable to pay its share, the injured consumer \n     would have to bear the cost.\n       Senator Dodd, these reforms are wrong-minded. They imperil \n     ordinary consumers and we ask that you work to defeat such \n     measures. Again, please vote against S. 565 and against \n     cloture.\n                                                   Gregory Haddad,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Delaware Coalition for\n\n\n                                   Accountability and Justice,\n\n                                                   April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. William Roth,\n     Hon. Joseph Biden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned individuals and \n     organizations, urge you to oppose efforts to weaken America's \n     civil justice system. We urge you to vote against cloture on \n     S. 565, the product liability measure sponsored by Sens. \n     Gorton and Rockefeller, or any other legislation that would \n     weaken the rights of the citizens of Delaware.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages, and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By giving ``noneconomic'' damages second-\n     class treatment, the bill discriminates against populations \n     with less earning power, specifically women, children, \n     seniors and low- and middle-income workers. Under S. 565, the \n     U.S. would have a two-tiered system of justice where rich, \n     high-salaried workers would be accorded better treatment and \n     higher damage awards than the rest of us. Finally, by \n     establishing brand new federal rules for product liability \n     cases, S. 565 removes from state authority and oversight a \n     civil justice system that, despite the hyperbole of the big \n     business interests backing this legislation, has served \n     consumers and the residents of Delaware exceedingly well.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years. Moreover, S. 565 adds protections for manufacturers of \n     raw materials in medical devices and for rental car \n     companies, and reduces manufacturer liability for misuse or \n     alterations made to the product by anyone else--provisions \n     that were not in last year's bill.\n       Even if one reasonably believes that the measure introduced \n     by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller is sound public policy (which \n     we do not), it must ultimately be reconciled with the extreme \n     revisions to the civil justice system recently adopted by the \n     House of Representatives. H.R. 959, in addition to the \n     provisions outlines above, enacts an arbitrary cap on pain \n     and suffering awards in medical malpractice and cases \n     involving drugs and medical devices, at the same time it \n     offers an automatic punitive damages shield for products that \n     have received FDA approval. In addition, the House measure \n     extends the cap on punitive damages to all civil lawsuits, \n     and establishes an arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for \n     product liability cases.\n       Passage of either of these measures, or a combination of \n     the two, would cause grievous harm to the people who have \n     elected you--and depend on you--to represent their interests \n     in Congress. We urge you to oppose any effort to weaken or \n     federalize product liability laws, and to vote ``no'' on \n     cloture on S. 565, on S. 565, and on any conference committee \n     reported-measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Edward Cahill, State Director, Delaware AARP; Edward \n           Peterson, President, Delaware AFL-CIO; Deirdre \n           O'Connoll, Executive Director, Women and Wellness; Rick \n           Crawford, President, Building Trades Council of \n           Delaware; Debbie Heaton, President, Delaware Sierra \n           Club; Til Purnell, Executive Director, Save Wetlands \n           and Bays; Amos McCluney, Jr., President, Delaware \n           Council of Senior Citizens; May Northwood, President, \n           Delaware Federation of Women's Clubs;\\1\\ Maureen \n           Lauterbach, Women and Wellness and National Breast \n           Cancer Coalition;\\1\\ Don Cordell, President, United \n           Auto Workers Local 1183; Ann Rydgren, President, \n           Delaware Audubon Society.\n     \\1\\For identification purposes only.

First, \n     this bill would set arbitrary limits on punitive damage \n     awards of $250,000 or three times economic damages, reducing \n     the ability to deter corporations from inflicting harm on \n     others and threatening Americans' economic security and well-\n     being. At a time when Congress is talking about increasing \n     personal responsibility, it makes no sense to reduce the \n     responsibility of corporations guilty of manufacturing or \n     selling dangerous products.\n       Second, this bill would eliminate joint and several \n     liability for non-economic damages, making it difficult for \n     consumers to recover costs related to injuries such as the \n     loss of reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or \n     disfigurement. Those injuries deserve to be compensated and \n     should not be treated as less important than THE loss of high \n     salaries or investment income. For similar reasons as those \n     described, CFA also urges you to oppose S. 454, ``The Health \n     Care Liability and Quality Assurance Act'' which would \n     severely affect the rights of injured patients.\n       I urge you to act to prevent passage of this legislation, \n     which would greatly restrict the ability of injured consumers \n     to be compensated fully and for juries to act to prevent \n     further wrongdoing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Walter T. Dartland,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Florida Consumer Action Network,\n\n                                  Tallahassee, FL, April 24, 1995.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Florida Consumer Action Network \n     (FCAN) is requesting that you vote ``NO'' on Senate Bill 565, \n     the Product Liability Bill. Additionally, we are asking you \n     to vote against cloture. If this bill passes, it will have a \n     devastating effect on the more than 40,000 families that are \n     members of FCAN and on all Florida consumers.\n       By capping punitive damages at $250,000 or three times the \n     economic loss (whichever is greater) the legislation removes \n     the punitive impact from punitive sanctions, rendering them \n     meaningless as punishment in most cases. It will be cheaper \n     for many corporations to pay such damages rather than rectify \n     their faulty products.\n       Eliminating joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages saddles the victim for the costs of damages incurred \n     by the wrongdoing parties. It is unjust and particularly \n     discriminatory for women, children and senior citizens.\n       Obviously this bill is not in the best interest of \n     Florida's consumers. We again ask for \n      [[Page S6380]] your vote against S. 565 and against cloture \n     in the upcoming debate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Monte E.

Paul Coverdell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: On behalf of the 40,000 members of \n     Georgia Citizen Action, I am writing to express our \n     opposition to S. 565 and to urge you to vote against cloture.\n       S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995, is \n     anything but fair to consumers. In fact, it will effectively \n     leave citizens unprotected against the manufacture and sale \n     of hazardous or defective products. Capping punitive damages \n     at $250,000 or three times economic loss defeats the purpose \n     of punitive damages, which is to punish for a wrongdoing. \n     Multi-million dollar corporations will consider these caps \n     merely the cost of doing business, rather than a punishment \n     for injuring unsuspecting consumers, and consequently, \n     punitive damages will no longer serve as a deterrent to \n     irresponsible and unscrupulous companies who would \n     manufacture or sell harmful products.\n       Additionally, the provisions to eliminate joint and several \n     liability for non-economic damages discriminates against \n     women, children, and senior citizens as they are less likely \n     to recover high economic damages (i.e. lost wages). Joint and \n     several liability ensures that the parties at fault pay, not \n     the victim, and by eliminating this, those victims who suffer \n     loss of reproductive capacity, disfigurement, or loss of \n     sight, for example, could be further wronged by not being \n     able to recover the full amount of their awarded damages.\n       For these reasons, Georgia Citizen Action strongly urges \n     you to oppose S. 565 and to vote against cloture. Please \n     inform us of your actions regarding this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lori Glidewell,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Citizen Advocacy Center,\n\n                                     Elmhurst, IL, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: The Citizen Advocacy Center, a \n     non-partisan, not-for-profit organization in DuPage County, \n     is dedicated to building democracy for the 21st century. We \n     promote good citizenship, participation in civic affairs, \n     access to justice, and accountability of local governments to \n     the citizens of the western suburbs of Chicago. We are \n     writing to urge you to vote ``no'' both on the upcoming \n     cloture vote of S. 565, and the vote on the merits. We oppose \n     any legislation that makes access to justice more difficult \n     for individual citizens.\n       As you know Senator Braun, the large crossover vote in the \n     western suburbs of Chicago, particularly the crossover vote \n     of women, helped to elect you to represent our interests in \n     the United States Senate. We expect you to make access to \n     justice easier, not more difficult, for consumers viciously \n     injured by defective products. The provisions of S. 565 are \n     an undisguised attempt to take control and common sense away \n     from Illinois citizens in the jury box and to replace it with \n     Washington-dictated arbitrariness designed to protect and \n     payback the business interests that have paid so handsomely \n     for this legislation. In particular, we find the provisions \n     of S. 565 do great damage to women--and as one of the few \n     women Senators, we frankly expect you to take a good hard \n     look at how the specific provisions of this bill will prevent \n     women with low economic damage awards from being adequately \n     compensated for lifelong injuries caused by corporate greed.\n       Moreover, after last Sunday's Chicago Tribune Magazine \n     cover story, it seems that you are burnishing your business \n     image after having recently secured a seat on the Finance \n     Committee. Nonetheless, Illinois voters remember that last \n     year you voted against a less damaging products liability \n     bill, and a flip-flop vote now will look like you are selling \n     out ordinary citizens and consumers to cozy up to business \n     interests. We are happy that you have won a seat on the \n     committee, but we expect you to use that seat to remain true \n     to the agenda that put you in the Senate in the first place. \n     Please do not sell out the citizens of Illinois.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                                Theresa Amato,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Citizen Advocacy Center.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Chicago and Central States Joint Board, ACTWU, \n           Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union,\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 31, 1995.\n     Senator Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: On behalf of the members of our \n     union we urge you to vote against consideration of any \n     legislation that lessons the financial responsibility of \n     corporate polluters or manufacturers of dangerous products. \n     These, so called, efforts at ``tort reform'' are more aptly \n     known as the Wrongdoer Protection Act.\n       Furthermore, these attempts at reform are plainly anti-\n     workers and anti-consumer.\n       Your opposition to the more onerous parts of these tort \n     reforms proposals is not enough. Your leadership is needed to \n     stop passage of any restrictions limiting the access of \n     consumers and workers to the courts.\n       Your leadership against these tort restrictions can send a \n     positive signal that you stand on the side of workers and \n     consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n     James K. Tribble,\n       International Vice President.\n     Ronald Willis,\n       Manager, ACTWU, Chicago and Central States Joint Board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Public Action,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 24, 1995.\n     Senator Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: Illinois Public Action is \n     requesting that you vote ``NO'' on Senate Bill 565. \n     Additionally we are asking you to vote against cloture. If \n     this bill passes, it will have a devastating effect on the \n     215,000 families that are members of Public Action and on all \n     Illinois consumers.\n       By capping punitive damages at $250,000 or three times the \n     economic loss (which ever is greater), the legislation \n     removes the punitive impact from punitive sanctions, \n     rendering them meaningless as punishment in most cases. It \n     will be cheaper for many corporations to pay such damages \n     than rectify their faulty products.\n       Eliminating joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages saddles the victim for the costs of the damages \n     incurred by the wrongdoing parties. It is unjust and \n     particularly discriminatory for women, children and senior \n     citizens.\n       Obviously this bill is not in the best interest of the \n     Illinois public. We again ask for your vote against the bill \n     and against cloture in the coming debate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert B. Creamer,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Illinois PIRG, Illinois Public\n\n\n                                      Interest Research Group,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 24, 1995.\n     Re: Protect Victims of Dangerous Products, Oppose Cloture and \n         Vote No on S. 565.\n\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Wshington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: We are writing on behalf of \n     Illinois PIRG's members, and on behalf of all residents of \n     Illinois to urge your strong opposition to proposed \n     legislation, S. 565, that would eviscerate the rights of \n     victims of dangerous and defective products. As you know, \n     Illinois PIRG is a statewide, non-profit, nonpartisan \n     consumer and environmental advocacy group that has \n      [[Page S6381]] fought to protect the rights of consumers for \n     many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable. Yet the Senate must also consider that, if \n     passed, S. 565 would have to be reconciled with the even more \n     egregious and extreme House-passed bill. H.R. 1075, in \n     addition to the measures above, arbitrarily caps pain and \n     suffering awards in medical malpractice cases and establishes \n     an automatic punitive damages shield for FDA-approved \n     products. Worse, the House cap on punitive damages extends to \n     all civil lawsuits, not only to product liability cases.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, against S. \n     565 and against any conference measure restricting the rights \n     of consumers. We look forward to hearing your views on this \n     important legislation. Please contact me if you or your staff \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Diane Brown,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      Iowa Citizen\n\n\n                                               Action Network,\n\n                                   Des Moines, IA, April 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: We are writing to communicate ICAN's \n     views about the so-called Products Liability ``Fairness'' \n     Act--S. 565. It is our understanding that S. 565 is set for \n     two weeks of debate on the Senate floor, beginning on or \n     about April 24.\n       We are pleased that you have indicated that, as in the \n     past, you will lead the fight against this legislation. We \n     heartily commend your determination to use all means \n     available to keep the bill from coming to a vote on final \n     passage.\n       S. 565 is a bill that would produce extremely detrimental \n     consequences for citizens, workers, and consumers. There are \n     a number of objectionable provisions in the legislation, but \n     for the purposes of this letter we would like to focus on \n     provisions relating to joint and several liability and \n     punitive damages.\n       As you know, S. 565 eliminates joint and several liability \n     for non-economic damages. This clearly discriminates against \n     women, children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, \n     the poor, and low-wage workers, who more often receive the \n     bulk of compensation for their injuries due to sustained non-\n     economic losses, such as loss of reproductive capacity, loss \n     of vision, disfigurement, etc. S. 565 treats these first rate \n     members of society as second class citizens.\n       Under current Iowa law, in cases where more than one party \n     is found to have been at fault in causing a plaintiff's \n     injuries, a guilty party that caused more than 50% of the \n     harm can be held jointly and severally liable for damages. S. \n     565 would supersede Iowa law, making it more likely that \n     injured parties would be forced to forego amounts of \n     compensation for their non-economic losses when one or more \n     of the defendants are unable to pay. This Washington-Knows-\n     Best bill reshuffles the cards and stacks the deck against \n     plaintiffs in Iowa.\n       S. 565 also imposes an arbitrary and unreasonable cap on \n     punitive damages that would undermine the important deterrent \n     effect which these damages have on corporate wrongdoers. This \n     is unnecessary and rash in light of the fact that punitive \n     damages in product liability cases are rare but have made \n     Americans much safer.\n       The bill limits punitive damage judgments to the greater of \n     three times the amount of economic losses or $250,000. Once \n     again, this provision is a slap in the face to women, \n     children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, the \n     poor, and low-wage workers. And the provision sends a warped \n     message to corporate wrongdoers: If you injure a woman, a \n     child, an elderly grandparent, a disabled person, or a \n     minimum wage worker, you are likely to be punished less than \n     if you injure a corporate CEO. The consequences of such a \n     legal policy would be lethal to many average Americans.\n       In addition, S. 565 imposes an unreasonable standard of \n     ``conscious flagrant indifference to safety'' for assessment \n     of punitive damages. A defendant whose conduct was merely \n     ``reckless'' or ``wanton'' would escape punitive damages. If \n     the superheightened punitive damage standards in S. 565 had \n     applied to the Exxon-Valdez case, Exxon would probably not \n     have paid a dime in punitive damages since the punitive \n     damages were awarded for ``reckless'' conduct. Moreover, \n     proving a corporate defendant's ``state of mind'' would be \n     next to impossible in most product liability cases.\n       S. 565 is imprudent and unwarranted legislation. Product \n     liability tort filings make up an extremely small percentage \n     of all civil filings and the number of product liability \n     filings has been steadily declining. We are mobilizing \n     concerned citizens in Iowa to oppose this bogus bill.\n       We are grateful for your leadership in opposing this \n     legislation. Please let us know whether and how we can \n     provide any information or assistance to support your \n     efforts.\n       Your commitment to civil justice for all Americans is \n     greatly appreciated.\n           Respectfully,\n     Steve Siegel/bl\n       President.\n     Brad Lint,\n       Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                           UAW Sub-Regional Office\n\n\n                                                     Region 4,\n\n                                   Des Moines, IA, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the UAW men and women who \n     live, work, and vote in Iowa, I am writing to express our \n     opposition to S. 565--the so-called Products Liability \n     ``Fairness'' Act. This legislation is grossly unfair and one-\n     sided.\n       S. 565 would, without a doubt, take away the right of \n     workers to hold large corporations fully accountable for the \n     injuries they cause when they manufacture and sell defective \n     products--including dangerous workplace machinery. Employers \n     claims, however, appear to be unaffected by the law--only \n     workers would lose their right to be heard.\n       S. 565 sets up a series of hurdles and obstacles to the \n     ability of injured workers and consumers to recover from the \n     manufacturers of defective products. In fact, under the \n     bill's statute of repose, workers injured by defective \n     machinery more than twenty years old could not recover at \n     all, but businesses apparently could recover all their \n     losses--including lost profits.\n       S. 565 would also cap punitive damages far below the point \n     of effectiveness. If the bill becomes law it would be much \n     more difficult for ordinary Iowans to punish and deter \n     corporate misbehavior, even when they are maimed or killed by \n     the recklessness or negligence of a corporation.\n       In summary, S. 565 is unfair to workers and consumers. The \n     UAW is delighted that you will be voting against cloture \n     during debate and, if needed, against the bill on final \n     passage.\n       Thank you for your firm commitment to civil justice for \n     workers and consumers.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Chuck Gifford,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Iowa State Council\n\n\n                                           of Senior Citizens,\n\n                                     Waterloo, IA, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to express our concern \n     about S. 565--the so-called Products Liability ``Fairness'' \n     Act. The Iowa State Council of Senior Citizens believes the \n     bill to be unfair to senior citizens and we are grateful for \n     your announced opposition to it.\n       It is my understanding that S. 565 eliminates joint and \n     several liability for non-economic losses. Senior citizens do \n     not generally incur substantial economic losses when they are \n     injured by defective products. They tend to receive \n     compensation for non-economic losses resulting from \n     disfigurement, loss of vision, pain and suffering, etc.\n       Under S. 565 when multiple parties are found to have caused \n     the harm to an injured consumer the amount of compensation \n     for non-economic losses would, without exception, be reduced \n     when one or more of the at-fault parties is unable to pay. \n     This situation would be worse than current Iowa law where \n     injured consumers can at least recover non-economic damages \n     jointly and severally whenever one of the parties at fault is \n     more than 50% responsible for the harm caused to the injured \n     consumer.\n       It is also my understanding that S. 565 limits punitive \n     damages in product liability cases to the greater of three \n     times the amount of economic losses or $250,000. This \n     provision also discriminates against senior citizens. Again, \n     since seniors do not usually have large economic losses, \n     corporate wrongdoers who injure a senior are likely--if their \n     misconduct was bad enough to warrant punitive damages--to be \n     punished less than if they injure a corporate executive who \n     has large earnings. Is this wise legal policy?\n       The Iowa State Council of Senior Citizens believes that, \n     taken together, these two discriminatory provisions could \n     lead to less safe medical devices and consumer products \n     primarily manufactured for use by senior citizens. Women, \n     children, disabled persons, and low-wage workers are also \n     likely to be adversely affected by these ill-conceived \n     provisions.\n       S. 565 could have a devastating effect on the economic \n     security and safety of older Iowans. The Iowa State Council \n     Citizens is glad you will oppose S. 565 during the coming \n     Senate debate by voting against cloture and, if necessary, \n     against the bill.\n       Thank you for your considerate attention to our point of \n     view. Please let us know if we can be of any further \n     assistance.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Frank Alexander,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                               [[Page S6382]]\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                   Louisville, KY, March 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of Kentucky Citizen \n     Action, I would like to express our strong opposition to the \n     so-called ``Product Liability Fairness Act'', S. 565. I urge \n     you to vote against efforts to pass this legislation, as it \n     is anything but fair to your constituents or to any \n     individual American citizen.\n       While the proponents of this bill have attempted to cast a \n     ``moderate'' light on the legislation, painting it as more \n     fair and equitable than proposed legal reforms which came \n     before it, our careful study from the consumer's perspective \n     has revealed that it is neither fair nor equitable to real \n     Americans. Areas of particular concern include:\n       Punitive damage caps of $250,000 or three times the \n     economic loss. Imposing such caps completely undermines the \n     important deterrent effect which these damages have on \n     corporate wrongdoing. While punitive damages are rarely used, \n     the very threat that their existence presents has proven to \n     be critical in persuading manufacturers to improve the safety \n     of their products or in actually removing unsafe products \n     from the marketplace. If you undermine this system, American \n     consumers truly will be at the mercy of big business.\n       Elimination of joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages. This provision discriminates against the most \n     vulnerable members of our society--women, children, seniors, \n     the poor--whose form of compensation would most likely be in \n     the form of non-economic damages. This legislation says that \n     only the wealthy should be empowered to hold wrongdoers \n     accountable for their egregious behavior. These damages also \n     cover a great deal more than just pain and suffering, as is \n     often thought. They also cover loss of reproductive capacity, \n     loss of sight, and disfigurement. Is it fair to punish \n     individuals who have suffered these tragedies?\n       S. 565 is not fair, although its name attempts to imply \n     otherwise. It is not fair to the workers, to women, to \n     children, to the real people of this country. It is a one-\n     sided, unjustified and cynical attempt to provide a subsidy \n     to big business at the expense of the American consumer.\n       We understand that S. 565 will be brought to the floor on \n     Monday, April 25 and a vote on cloture could come within a \n     few days of this. We urge you to cast your vote on behalf of \n     your constituents and all American citizens and oppose S. 565 \n     by voting ``No'' on cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lori Everhart,\n     State Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                  Baton Rouge, LA, April 14, 1995.\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Breaux: On behalf of our members, your \n     constituents, Louisiana Citizen Action once again asks that \n     you vote ``No'' on S. 565 and ``No'' on cloture. We strongly \n     believe that it is your responsibility to hold negligent \n     businesses accountable to the public.\n       By setting caps on punitive damages, S. 565 would send a \n     clear message that corporations do not really have to worry \n     about liability for dangerous products and practices. \n     Punitive damages, after all, were meant to be deterrents to \n     corporate misconduct.\n       This law, which favors the financial interests of big \n     business over protecting the public, is especially \n     threatening to the most vulnerable--women, children, and \n     seniors. Elimination of joint and several liability for non-\n     economic damages deeply undervalues the impact of injuries \n     upon these citizens.\n       Please take a firm stand to support fairness and \n     responsibility in our judicial system. We will be happy to \n     inform our members when you vote no to S. 565 and no to \n     cloture. Thank you for your consideration on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Paula Henderson,\n     State Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Maine People's Alliance.\n\n                                                   April 21, 1995.\n     Senator Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: As you know, debate will begin next \n     week on the Rockefeller-Gorton Bill (S. 565). We wanted to \n     write you in hopes that with your concern for the citizens of \n     Maine--particularly women, children and other economically \n     underprivileged--you will join with us in opposition to that \n     bill. The Contract With America effort is bulldozing ahead \n     with legal reforms that only benefit the manufacturers of \n     defective products.\n       The bill's supporters claim it is designed to reduce the \n     ``explosion'' of product liability lawsuits, but there is no \n     evidence suggesting that such a problem exists. In fact, \n     close study of 30 years of case law in Maine reveals that \n     punitive damages have been awarded in only three cases. At \n     $250,000, companies will not be deterred and will simply \n     write the cost of a punitive damage award into the cost of \n     doing business.\n       An especially worrisome provision of this bill will be the \n     elimination of joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages. Since women, seniors, and children are more likely \n     to suffer non-economic injuries than high economic injuries \n     (e.g. lost wages), the elimination of joint and several \n     liability discriminates against them. This provision \n     basically states that corporations which manufacture child \n     car seats or children's pajamas can be less careful than \n     manufacturers of golf carts.\n       As you know, our organization has differed with you on some \n     issues in the past, however we know that you will join with \n     us in opposing this tort reform effort. The notion of Federal \n     Legislation that would preempt the ability of states like \n     Maine to hold wrong doers accountable and deter their future \n     wrongdoing is unacceptable. As you know our organization has \n     had differences with you in the past, but we hope that you \n     will join us in standing against the bill. All Mainers, \n     especially those without the largest salaries (especially \n     women and children) deserve access to a fair and supportive \n     legal system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Ditre,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, April 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of Maryland Citizen Action \n     and our 50,000 members I am writing to urge you to oppose \n     ``The Product Liability Fairness Act'' (S. 565). Please vote \n     pro-consumer and against cloture when this bill comes up in \n     the Senate. If enacted the most vulnerable citizens in our \n     state would be further disadvantaged and the rights of \n     consumers to hold irresponsible manufacturers accountable for \n     their wrongful behavior would be severely limited.\n       As a champion of women's health, working people and \n     children, I am sure you know that these groups are \n     disproportionately affected by faulty products--breast \n     implants, asbestos, and flammable pajamas to name just a few. \n     S. 565 limits the ability of these people to collect fair \n     compensation for their injuries or losses because it would \n     eliminate joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages. Under current law, a plaintiff is paid only once, \n     and the cost is covered by the wrongdoers who contributed to \n     the victim's loss. Under S. 565, non-economic damages, such \n     as a women's loss of fertility or a worker's loss of a limb, \n     would not be fully compensated if one of the wrongdoers is \n     unavailable or insolvent. The victim would be forced to carry \n     the burden.\n       S. 565 also imposes a cap on punitive damages ($250,000 or \n     3 times economic damages) which undermines the important \n     deterrent effect that these damages have on corporate \n     wrongdoers. Under our current system punitive damages are \n     often the only means available to deter irresponsible \n     behavior such as that exhibited by Dow Corning when it \n     knowingly sold hundreds of thousands of faulty and dangerous \n     breast implants to women. Under S. 565, large corporations, \n     such as Dow Corning, may find it more cost effective to \n     continue their harmful behavior and risk paying punitive \n     damages.\n       Please stand up for consumers in Maryland by opposing S. \n     565 and voting against cloture. We are counting on your \n     admirable leadership and your great fighting spirit to halt \n     the current attack on average consumers, women, families and \n     children.\n       Please let me know how you intend to vote.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Shelli Craver,\n     Director, Maryland Citizen Action.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Maryland State Teachers\n\n\n                                             Association--NEA,\n\n                                    Baltimore, MD, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Maryland State Teachers \n     Association has very strong reservations about the so-called \n     ``Common Sense Legal Reforms Act,'' which the Senate appears \n     to be rushing forward without full debate or careful \n     analysis. We urge you to vote against this bill as anti-\n     consumer legislation.\n       We see this bill as restricting the ability of injured \n     consumers and workers to obtain full and fair compensation \n     for such injuries. While all of us have a stake in making \n     sure that frivolous law suits become less common than they \n     appear to be, we also all have a stake in making sure that \n     individuals maintain rights to protest and recover damages \n     from product manufactures which have been shown to be \n     dangerous.\n       Therefore, I urge your opposition to this and similar \n     legislation.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                    Karl K. Pence,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Maryland Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group,\n\n                                    Baltimore, MD, April 24, 1995.\n\n Protect Victims of Dangerous Products--Oppose Cloture and Vote ``No'' \n                               on S. 565\n\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: We are writing on behalf of \n     MaryPIRG's members, and on behalf of all residents of \n     Maryland to urge your strong opposition to proposed \n     legislation, S. 565, that would eviscerate the rights \n      [[Page S6383]] of victims of dangerous and defective \n     products. As you know, MaryPIRG is a statewide, non-profit, \n     nonpartisan consumer and environmental advocacy group that \n     has fought to protect the rights of consumers for many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable. Yet the Senate must also consider that, if \n     passed, S. 565 would have to be reconciled with the even more \n     egregious and extreme House-passed bill. H.R. 1075, in \n     addition to the measures above, arbitrarily caps pain and \n     suffering awards in medical malpractice cases and establishes \n     an automatic punitive damages shield for FDA-approved \n     products. Worse, the House cap on punitive damages extends to \n     all civil lawsuits, not only to product liability cases.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, against S. \n     565 and against any conference measure restricting the rights \n     of consumers. We look forward to hearing your views on this \n     important legislation. Please contact me if you or your staff \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Daniel Pontious,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to oppose efforts to weaken America's civil justice system. \n     We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, the product \n     liability measure sponsored by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller, \n     or any other legislation that would weaken the rights of the \n     citizens of Maryland.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By giving ``non-economic'' damages second-\n     class treatment, the bill discriminates against populations \n     with less earning power, specifically women, children, \n     seniors and low- and middle-income workers. Under S. 565, the \n     U.S. would have a two-tiered system of justice where rich, \n     high-salaried workers would be accorded better treatment and \n     higher damage awards than the rest of us. Finally, by \n     establishing brand new federal rules for product liability \n     cases, S. 565 removes from state authority and oversight a \n     civil justice system that, despite the hyperbole of the big \n     business interests backing this legislation, has served \n     consumers and the residents of Maryland exceedingly well.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen, or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years. Moreover, S. 565 adds protections for manufacturers of \n     raw materials in medical devices and for rental car \n     companies, and reduces manufacturer liability for misuses or \n     alterations made to the product by anyone else--provisions \n     that were not in last year's bill.\n       Even if one reasonably believes that the measure introduced \n     by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller is sound public policy (which \n     we do not), it must ultimately be reconciled with the extreme \n     revisions to the civil justice system recently adopted by the \n     House of Representatives. H.R. 956, in addition to the \n     provisions outlined above, enacts an arbitrary cap on pain \n     and suffering awards in medical malpractice and cases \n     involving drugs and medical devices, at the same time it \n     offers an automatic punitive damages shield for products that \n     have received FDA approval. In addition, the House measure \n     extends the cap on punitive damages to all civil lawsuits, \n     and establishes an arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for \n     product liability cases.\n       Passage of either of these measures, or a combination of \n     the two, would cause grievous harm to the people who have \n     elected you--and depend on you--to represent their interests \n     in Congress. We urge you to oppose any effort to weaken or \n     federalize product liability laws, and to vote ``no'' on \n     cloture on S. 565, on S. 565, and on any conference committee \n     reported-measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jennifer L.

We urge you to \n     oppose these proposals, particularly the ``Product Liability \n     Fairness Act,'' (S. 565) cosponsored by Senators Rockefeller \n     and Gorton, and to oppose cloture, for the following reasons:\n       Elimination of Joint and Several Liability for Non-Economic \n     Damages--The Rockefeller/Gorton bill would shift costs from \n     parties that caused injuries to injured workers and \n     consumers. By eliminating joint and several liability for \n     non-economic damages, injured workers and consumers whose \n     compensation includes losses related to lifelong excruciating \n     pain, loss of fertility, loss of mobility, and disfigurement \n     may be left to bear the cost of those injuries. Joint and \n     several liability requires that those judged responsible for \n     an injury be responsible for paying the costs of that injury. \n     Elimination of it for non-economic damages unfairly hurts \n     workers and consumers, especially those who don't earn high \n     incomes or are older since their damages often are mostly \n     non-economic.\n       Caps On Punitive Damages--Rockefeller/Gorton would limit \n     punitive damages to $250,000 or three times economic damages, \n     whichever is greater, and would make it much harder to impose \n     them. Punitive damages, though rarely awarded, are a powerful \n     tool in preventing repetition of preventable injuries. \n     Limiting them would lessen the motivation of corporations to \n     make safe products. As a result, more workers and consumers \n     will be injured.\n       Statute of Repose--This would make it impossible for a \n     worker injured by defective machinery and equipment to \n     receive compensation from the manufacturer if the machinery \n     and equipment had been on the market for twenty years.\n       For the above reasons, we urge you to protect workers and \n     consumers by opposing the Rockefeller/Gorton bill and similar \n     legislation and to oppose cloture.\n       Sincerely,\n         Juana Hernandez, Staff, Immigrant Workers Resource Ctr.; \n           Melanie Kasperian, Vice President, Mass Teachers \n           Association; Edward Kelly, Executive Director, Citizen \n           Action of Massachusetts; Miles Calvey, Business \n           Manager, I.B.E.W.

Defective products \n     cases represent less than one-hundredth of one percent of the \n     total caseload in state courts, according to the National \n     Center for State Courts. Since 1990, total state tort filings \n     have decreased. Nor have punitive damage awards been \n     widespread. Between 1965 and 1990, punitive damages were \n     awarded in less than 15 products liability cases each year, \n     one quarter of which involved asbestos.\n       S. 565, and similar bills make it more difficult for \n     consumers who obtain an award of damages caused by \n     irresponsible corporate behavior from actually collecting \n     those damages where more than one corporation is responsible \n     for their injuries. In addition S. 565 and similar bills seek \n     to drastically limit the ability of citizen juries to award \n     punitive damages: the kind of damages which deter the \n     production and marketing of unsafe products. At time of \n     decreasing regulatory oversight, the possibility of punitive \n     damages represents a vital pro-consumer bulwark against \n     unsafe and defective products. Punitive damages, because they \n     can be high, \n      [[Page S6384]] make corporations take notice and treat \n     product safety seriously.\n       S. 565 and similar bills are irresponsible and anti-\n     consumer. I strongly urge you to oppose them and to vote \n     against cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Edward F.

John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We are writing on behalf of MASSPIRG's \n     members, and on behalf of all residents of Massachusetts to \n     urge your strong opposition to proposed legislation, S. 565, \n     that would eviscerate the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products. As you know, MASSPIRG is a statewide, \n     non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and environmental advocacy \n     group that has fought to protect the rights of consumers for \n     many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable. Yet the Senate must also consider that, if \n     passed, S. 565 would have to be reconciled with the even more \n     egregious and extreme House-passed bill. H.R. 1075, in \n     addition to the measures above, arbitrarily caps pain and \n     suffering awards in medical malpractice cases and establishes \n     an automatic punitive damages shield for FDA-approved \n     products. Worse, the House cap on punitive damages extends to \n     all civil lawsuits, not only to product liability cases.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, against S. \n     565 and against any conference measure restricting the rights \n     of consumers. We look forward to hearing your views on this \n     important legislation. Please contact me if you or your staff \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deirdre Cummings,\n     Consumer Program Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                 Michigan Consumer Federation,\n\n                                                   April 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I appreciated meeting you at the \n     ``Teddy Bear Clinic'' where you so ably pointed out the \n     threat to public safety posed by the Republican's \n     ``regulatory moratorium.'' Your leadership for consumer \n     safety has always been appreciated.\n       We need your leadership in another consumer safety area--\n     products liability. With federal cutbacks in regulatory \n     programs, we look to the legal system as one of the few \n     effective means of improving product safety. Time and time \n     again, it has been private lawsuits--or the perceived threat \n     of lawsuits--which has forced corporations to either remove \n     defective products from the marketplace or improve them.\n       I know you are a fan of ``cost-benefit'' analyses. So are \n     manufacturers. In a well-known memo, Ford Motor Company \n     calculated that it would cost more to prevent Pintos from \n     exploding than it would pay out in legal expenses. \n     Consequently, many Pinto owners were incinerated. Why would \n     we want to cap the only means of making ``cost-benefit'' \n     assessments favor consumer safety?\n       The Michigan Consumer Federation is a member of the \n     Consumer Federation of America. Annually, CFA bestows its \n     highest honor for consumer advocacy--the Philip A. Hart \n     award. We are proud that the nation's largest and most \n     respected consumer organization recognized a Michigan giant \n     and former United States Senator for its most prestigious \n     award. That places a great deal of responsibility for those \n     of us in Michigan.\n       S. 565 isn't about fairness. It's about corporations \n     wanting to ``get away with murder.'' Let's not tilt the \n     playing field in their favor. Vote for a strong system of \n     individual legal rights for victims of corporate wrongdoing. \n     It helps make products safer for all of us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Rick Gamber,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                 East Lansing, MI, April 24, 1995.\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 300,000 members of \n     Michigan Citizen Action, I want to express our strong \n     opposition to the so-called ``Product Liability Fairness \n     Act.'' I urge you to vote against efforts to move this anti-\n     consumer, anti-worker legislation.\n       There are three major provisions in S. 565 which have been \n     introduced in the Senate and which would have a negative \n     effect on consumers and workers. First, all bills set \n     arbitrary limits on punitive damage awards of $250,000 or \n     three times economic damages, reducing the ability to deter \n     corporations from inflicting harm on others and threatening \n     Americans' economic security and well-being. At a time when \n     Congress is talking about increasing personal responsibility, \n     it makes no sense to reduce the responsibility of \n     corporations guilty of manufacturing or selling dangerous \n     products.\n       Second, S. 565 eliminates joint and several liability for \n     non-economic damages, making it difficult for consumers to \n     recover costs related to injuries such as the loss of \n     reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or disfigurement. Those \n     injuries deserve to be compensated and should not be treated \n     as less important than the loss of high salaries or \n     investment income.\n       Third, S. 565 prevents workers and consumers--but not \n     businesses--from recovering for losses caused by defective \n     machines or products over 20 years old.\n       I urge you to act to prevent passage of this legislation \n     which would greatly restrict the ability of injured consumers \n     to be compensated fully and for juries to act to prevent \n     future wrongdoing. this bill is not in the best interest of \n     Michigan residents. Vote ``NO'' on cloture and ``NO'' on the \n     bill.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                  Linda A.

We are writing on behalf of PIRGIM's \n     members, and on behalf of all residents of Michigan to urge \n     your strong opposition to proposed legislation, S. 565, that \n     would eviscerate the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products.

As a national \n     leader in the fight for health care reform, you probably \n     recognize that this legislation will seriously undermine the \n     ability of consumers to be protected from and compensated for \n     medical malpractice negligence.\n       By capping the punitive damages at $250,000 or three times \n     the economic loss (whichever is greater), S. 565 restricts a \n     person's ability to obtain full and fair compensation and \n     dramatically reduces the ability to deter future wrongdoing.\n       Furthermore, S. 565 eliminated joint and several liability \n     for punitive damages and non-economic loss but not for \n     economic damages. This distinction will aggravate the \n     disparity in awards between high-income earners and low-\n     income earners.\n       Medical malpractice causes 80,000 deaths and up to 300,000 \n     serious injuries each year according to a recent Harvard \n     Medical Practice Study. For the health and safety of \n     consumers throughout Minnesota, please vote ``no'' on S. 565 \n     and vote against cloture on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jon Youngdahl,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                               [[Page S6385]]\n\n                                      Missouri Citizen Action,\n\n                                                   April 24, 1995.\n     Senator John Ashcroft,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft, Missouri Citizen Action strongly \n     urges you to vote ``no'' on Senate Bill 565. In addition, we \n     urge you to vote against cloture when the bill is debated on \n     the Senate floor. As Missouri's largest consumer coalition, \n     we can tell you that this bill could have a major negative \n     impact on the rights, and lives, of the tens of thousands of \n     Missouri consumers and families which we represent.\n       Caps on punitive damages, such as those in S.B. 565, gut \n     the ability of our civil justice system to threaten real \n     punishment of those whose negligence or greed may tempt them \n     to put a product on the market which could injure us or our \n     family members. Without the threat of real punitive damages, \n     these potential corporate wrongdoers will see damages awards \n     as just another predictable cost of doing business, to be \n     factored into the price of a defective product.\n       The elimination of joint and several liability for non-\n     economic damages will, likewise, have a negative effect on \n     average Missourians. This provision of S.B. 565 strikes \n     especially at women, children, and seniors.\n       Clearly this legislation is not in the interest of working \n     Missourians. It is merely an attempt to shield wrongdoers \n     from the consequences of their actions. In that you have \n     consistently voiced a strong opinion in favor of ``getting \n     tough'' on criminals who prey on our communities, we believe \n     that it would be inconsistent on your part to now vote to \n     protect those whose potential to harm innocent victims in the \n     pursuit of profit. Once again, we urge you to vote ``no'' on \n     S.B. 565, and to vote against cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Patrick Harvey,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                      Lincoln, NE, March 28, 1995.\n     Senator Bob Kerrey,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As director of Nebraska Citizen Action, with \n     over 8,000 active members, I want to express our strong \n     opposition to the so-called ``Common Sense Legal Reforms \n     Act.'' The Senate is rushing this bill forward without full \n     debate or time for careful analysis. I urge you to vote \n     against efforts to move this anti-consumer legislation \n     forward, including procedural moves to cut off debate.\n       This and similar bills pending in the Senate would restrict \n     the ability of injured consumers and workers to obtain full \n     and fair compensation and for citizen juries to impose \n     adequate deterrents to prevent future injuries.\n       There are two major provisions which are common to all the \n     bills which have been introduced in the Senate and which \n     would have a negative effect on consumers and workers. First, \n     all bills would set arbitrary limits on punitive damage \n     awards of $250,000 or three times economic damages, reducing \n     the ability to deter corporations from inflicting harm on \n     others and threatening Americans' economic security and well-\n     being. At a time when Congress is talking about increasing \n     personal responsibility, it makes no sense to reduce the \n     responsibility of corporations guilty of manufacturing or \n     selling dangerous products.\n       Second, all bills would eliminate joint and several \n     liability for non-economic damages, making it difficult for \n     consumers to recover costs related to injuries such as the \n     loss of reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or \n     disfigurement. Those injuries deserve to be compensated and \n     should not be treated as less important than the loss of high \n     salaries or investment income. It defies all principals of \n     fairness to base how we determine compensation for damages, \n     only on a persons yearly salary.\n       I urge you to act to prevent passage of this legislation, \n     which would greatly restrict the ability of injured consumers \n     to be compensated fully and for juries to act to prevent \n     future wrongdoing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Walt Bleich,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Coalition for Accountability & Justice,\n                                                   April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: We, the undersigned organizations, urge \n     you to oppose efforts to weaken America's civil justice \n     system. We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, the \n     product liability measure sponsored by Sens. Gorton and \n     Rockefeller, or any other legislation that would weaken the \n     rights of the citizens of Nebraska.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By giving ``non-economic'' damages second-\n     class treatment, the bill discriminates against populations \n     with less earning power, specifically women, children, \n     seniors and low- and middle-income workers. Under S. 565, the \n     U.S. would have a two-tiered system of justice where rich, \n     high-salaried workers would be accorded better treatment and \n     higher damage awards than the rest of us. Finally, by \n     establishing new federal rules for product liability cases, \n     S. 565 removes from state authority and oversight a civil \n     justice system that has served consumers and the residents of \n     Nebraska exceedingly well. As you noted during our meeting, \n     your efforts at medical malpractice reform is but one \n     example.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen, or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years. Moreover, S. 565 adds protections for manufacturers of \n     raw materials in medical devices and for rental car \n     companies, and reduces manufacturer liability for misuses or \n     alterations made to the product by anyone else--provisions \n     that were not in last year's bill.\n       One must also keep in mind that S. 565 must ultimately be \n     reconciled with the extreme revisions to the civil justice \n     system recently adopted by the House of Representatives. H.R. \n     956, in addition to the provisions outlined above, enacts an \n     arbitrary cap on pain and suffering awards in automatic \n     punitive damages shield for products that have received FDA \n     approval. In addition, the House measure extends the cap on \n     punitive damages to all civil lawsuits, and establishes an \n     arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for product liability \n     cases.\n       Passage of either of these measures, or a combination of \n     the two, would cause grievous harm to the people who have \n     elected you--and depend on you--to represent their interests \n     in Congress. S. 565 does nothing to bring the rights and \n     remedies available to Nebraskans up to the proposed federal \n     standards, and yet it limits our ability to shape state law \n     in a way that would address the unique needs and concerns of \n     Nebraska citizens.\n       We urge you to oppose any effort to weaken or federalize \n     product liability laws, and to vote ``no'' on cloture on S. \n     565, on S. 565, and on any conference committee reported-\n     measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Hansen, President, Nebraska Farmers Union; Carol \n           McShane, Nebraska Women's Political Network; Jared \n           Teichmeier, President, United Rubber Workers of America \n           Local 286; Linda Burkey, Executive Director, Nebraska \n           Head Injury Association; Walt Bleich, Executive \n           Director, Nebraska Citizen Action; Cristina Sherman, \n           State Coordinator, National Organization for Women; \n           Marv Morrison, Secretary-Treasurer, Communications \n           Workers of America Local 7470; Marty Strange, Program \n           Director, Center for Rural Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         New Hampshire Citizen Action,\n                                      Concord, NH, April 20, 1995.\n     Senator Judd Gregg,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: I am writing to express my concerns \n     about S. 565--the Rockefeller-Gorton bill. The expressed goal \n     of this bill is to reduce the supposed explosion of product \n     liability lawsuits. It does this by effectively limiting the \n     awards a plaintive could receive: capping punitive damages \n     and eliminating joint and several liability.\n       I have three problems with this bill. First, I do not think \n     that it will accomplish its goals. I am aware of no evidence \n     that capping awards will in fact reduce the number of suits \n     filed. Capping awards could in fact increase the total dollar \n     amount of liability awards if it removes the incentive for a \n     producer to correct a dangerous flaw in its product, such \n     that more injuries occur and more suits are filed.\n       Second, I was under the impression that the Republican \n     Party was a supporter of the rights of victims as opposed to \n     criminals. Punitive damages are one way of compensating \n     victims injured through criminal negligence. Protecting the \n     assets of the perpetrator is wrong.\n       Third is the issue of states' rights. You and your \n     Republican colleagues have gone on and on about returning \n     decision making power to the states. Yet in this bill, by \n     preempting state statutes, you would gather in to the federal \n     government powers that have belonged to the states for over \n     two hundred years. That, sir, is as big a flip-flop as Dick \n     Swett ever made!\n       I urge you not to support this bill, and not to support any \n     vote for cloture on debate of this bill. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert D. Yager, M.D.,\n       P.S.: I have been sued and lost a case involving punitive \n     damages. Despite that personal experience, I still think this \n     is a bad bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    New Jersey Citizen Action,\n\n                                   Hackensack, NJ, April 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Bill Bradley,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bradley: New Jersey Citizen Action in \n     requesting that you vote ``NO'' on Senate Bill 565. \n     Additionally we are asking you to vote against cloture. If \n     this bill is passed, it will have a devastating effect on the \n     115,000 families that are members of N.J.C.A.\n       [[Page S6386]] By capping punitive damages at $250,000 or \n     three times the economic loss (which ever is greater) the \n     legislation removes ``the punishment'' that is supposed to be \n     reflected in the damages. It becomes cheaper to pay the \n     damages than to rectify the situation.\n       Eliminating joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages discriminates against women, children, and seniors. \n     Non-economic loss is much more than pain and suffering--it \n     could also be loss of reproductive capacity, loss of sight or \n     disfigurement.\n       Obviously this bill is not in the best interests of New \n     Jersey residents. Once again we ask you to vote ``NO'' on \n     Senate Bill 565 and vote against cloture.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Phyllis Salowe-Kaye,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        New Jersey Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group,\n\n                                      Trenton, NJ, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We are writing on behalf of \n     NJPIRG's members, and on behalf of all residents of New \n     Jersey to urge your strong opposition to proposed \n     legislation, S. 565, that would eviscerate the rights of \n     victims of dangerous and defective products. As you know, \n     NJPIRG is a statewide, non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and \n     environmental advocacy group that has fought to protect the \n     rights of consumers for many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable. Yet the Senate must also consider that, if \n     passed, S. 565 would have to be reconciled with the even more \n     egregious and extreme House-passed bill. H.R. 1075, in \n     addition to the measures above, arbitrarily caps pain and \n     suffering awards in medical malpractice cases and establishes \n     an automatic punitive damages shield for FDA-approved \n     products. Worse, the House cap on punitive damages extends to \n     all civil lawsuits, not only to product liability cases.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, against S. \n     565 and against any conference measure restricting the rights \n     of consumers. We look forward to hearing your views on this \n     important legislation. Please contact me if you or your staff \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Andy Igrejas,\n     Consumer Advocate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              New Jersey Tenants Organization,\n\n                                   Hackensack, NJ, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The New Jersey Tenants \n     Organization (NJTO) opposes any changes in joint and several \n     liability and the imposition of punitive damage caps. This is \n     not reform; it is war on consumers.\n       Please oppose the tort reform legislation now before the \n     Senate and vote ``NO.''\n       Thank you for your anticipated stand in favor of the \n     consumers of the State of New Jersey.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Bonnie Shapiro,\n     Administrative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Citizen Action of New York,\n\n                                       Albany, NY, April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We are writing to urge that you \n     protect victims of dangerous products by voting to be sure \n     that S. 565 never comes to the Senate floor and continuing to \n     oppose S. 565 and any other measures that would strip victims \n     of dangerous products, incompetent doctors or other negligent \n     parties of their fundamental rights to justice and fair \n     compensation.\n       Those who would vote for S. 565 forget the famous exploding \n     Pinto, a traveling bomb that Ford's bean counters let stay on \n     the road rather than spend a few dollars to fix the gas tank. \n     They would forget the damage to women from the Dalkon shield \n     and breast implants, products that the manufacturers knew \n     might cause harm. They would forget those children who were \n     horribly burned by flammable pajamas. And they would forget \n     the thousands of workers who were exposed to asbestos decades \n     after the manufacturers knew that the material caused cancer.\n       There are very few cases a year, 15, in which punitive \n     damages are awarded. But the threat of these damages is too \n     often the only barrier to more companies making the cold \n     calculation that making a safe product isn't worth the cost. \n     Artificial caps on punitive damages will result in a slap on \n     the wrist to negligent corporations and expose American \n     consumers to dangerous products.\n       The provision in S. 565 that would not allow workers or \n     consumers to sue over damages caused by older products, but \n     allows companies to sue, reveals the vicious anti-consumer \n     bias of this bill. If the bill were honestly concerned about \n     the legal system why would it allow businesses to sue but not \n     consumers or workers? The exemption for businesses shows that \n     the authors primary motive is to protect corporations from \n     being punished for the harm their negligence causes to \n     consumers and employees.\n       We also urge your opposition to changes in joint and \n     several liability. This provision only increases the \n     likelihood that a victim will not be fairly compensated for \n     the injuries and suffering caused by negligence. Those who \n     are the most vulnerable, women, children and the elderly, \n     will lose the most if joint and several liability is \n     eliminated.\n       Finally, we remain concerned that the Senate will consider \n     establishing a cap on pain and suffering in medical \n     malpractice cases. Such an action would be particularly \n     ironic coming just after well publicized incidents of medical \n     malpractice. The facts remain that, as the Office of \n     Technology Assessment found in a recent report, caps on \n     malpractice awards will have no impact on the nation's health \n     care costs but they will save money for doctors at the \n     expense of victims of gross malpractice.\n       We urge your continued vigilance on behalf of victims of \n     negligence by voting against cloture for S. 565 and working \n     vigorously to oppose any other measures that would gut the \n     civil justice system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Kirsch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            Empire State Consumer Association,\n\n                                    Rochester, NY, April 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Hart Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: I want to express our strong \n     opposition to S. 565, the ``Product Liability Fairness Act of \n     1995.'' This bill would restrict the ability of injured \n     consumers to obtain full and fair compensation and for \n     citizen juries to impose adequate deterrents to prevent \n     further injuries.\n       There are two major provisions of this legislation which \n     would have a negative effect on consumers and workers. First, \n     this bill would set arbitrary limits on punitive damage \n     awards of $250,000 or three times economic damages, reducing \n     the ability to deter corporations from inflicting harm on \n     others and threatening Americans' economic security and well-\n     being. At a time when Congress is talking about increasing \n     personal responsibility, it makes no sense to reduce the \n     responsibility of corporations guilty of manufacturing or \n     selling dangerous products.\n       Second, this bill would eliminate joint and several \n     liability for non-economic damages, making it difficult for \n     consumers to recover costs related to injuries such as the \n     loss of reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or \n     disfigurement. Those injuries deserve to be compensated and \n     should not be treated as less important than THE loss of high \n     salaries or investment income. For similar reasons as those \n     described, CFA also urges you to oppose S. 454, ``The Health \n     Care Liability and Quality Act'' which would severely affect \n     the rights of injured patients.\n       I urge you to act to prevent passage of this legislation, \n     which would greatly restrict the ability of injured consumers \n     to be compensated fully and for juries to act to prevent \n     further wrongdoing.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Judy Braiman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                      Raleigh, NC, March 14, 1995.\n     Hon. D.M. Lauch Faircloth,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Faircloth: On behalf of North Carolina Citizen \n     Action, I would like to express our strong opposition to the \n     so-called ``Product Liability Fairness Act'', S. 565. I urge \n     you to vote against efforts to pass this legislation, as it \n     is anything but fair to your constituents or to any \n     individual American citizen.\n       While the proponents of this bill have attempted to cast a \n     ``moderate'' light on the legislation, painting it as more \n     fair and equitable than proposed legal reforms which came \n     before it, our careful study from the consumer's perspective \n     has revealed that it is neither fair nor equitable to real \n     Americans. Areas of particular concern include:\n       Punitive damage caps of $250,000 or three times the \n     economic loss. Imposing such caps completely undermines the \n     important deterrent effect which these damages have on \n     corporate wrongdoing. While punitive damages are rarely used, \n     the very threat of that their existence presents has proven \n     to be critical in persuading manufacturers to improve the \n     safety of their products or in actually removing unsafe \n     products from the marketplace. If you undermine this system, \n     American consumers truly will be at the mercy of big \n     business.\n       Elimination of joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages. This provision discriminates against the most \n     vulnerable members of our society--women, children, seniors, \n     the poor--whose form of compensation would most likely be in \n     the form of non-economic damages. This legislation says that \n     only the wealthy should be empowered to hold wrongdoers \n     accountable for their \n      [[Page S6387]] egregious behavior. These damages also cover \n     a great deal more than just pain and suffering, as is often \n     thought. They also cover loss of reproductive capacity, loss \n     of sight, and disfigurement. Is it fair to punish individuals \n     who have suffered these tragedies?\n       S. 565 is not fair, although its name attempts to imply \n     otherwise. It is not fair to the workers, to women, to \n     children, to the real people of this country. It is a one-\n     sided, unjustified and cynical attempt to provide a subsidy \n     to big business at the expense of the American consumer.\n       We understand that S. 565 will be brought to the floor on \n     Monday, April 24 and a vote on cloture could come within a \n     few days of this. We urge you to cast your vote on behalf of \n     your constituents and all American citizens and oppose S. 565 \n     by voting ``NO'' on cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lori Everhart,\n     State Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Coalition for Accountability\n\n\n                                                  and Justice,\n\n                                                    April 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to oppose efforts to weaken America's civil justice system, \n     and to vote ``no'' on S. 565, the product liability measure \n     sponsored by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By limiting pain and suffering damages in \n     some cases, the bill will severely restrict awards to certain \n     groups--including seniors, women, and children--and favor the \n     rich who, in the case of death or serious injury, have high \n     lost wages, over the rights of low- and middle-income wage \n     earners. Finally, by establishing brand new federal rules for \n     product liability cases, S. 565 removes from state authority \n     and oversight a civil justice system that, despite the \n     hyperbole of the big business interests backing this \n     legislation, has served consumers and the residents of North \n     Dakota exceedingly well.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen, or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years.\n       Even if one reasonably believes that the measure introduced \n     by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller is sound public policy (which \n     we do not), it must ultimately be reconciled with the extreme \n     revisions to the civil justice system recently adopted by the \n     House of Representatives. H.R. 956, in addition to the \n     provisions outlined above, enacts an arbitrary cap on pain \n     and suffering awards in medical malpractice and cases \n     involving drugs and medical devices, at the same time it \n     offers an automatic punitive damages shield for products that \n     have received FDA approval. In addition, the House measure \n     extends the cap on punitive damages to all civil lawsuits, \n     and establishes an arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for \n     product liability cases. Passage of either of these measures, \n     or a combination of the two, would cause grievous harm to the \n     people who have elected you--and depend on you--to represent \n     their interest in Congress. We urge you to oppose any effort \n     to weaken or federalize product liability laws, and to vote \n     ``no'' on cloture on S. 565, and on any conference committee \n     reported-measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gerrard Friesz, North Dakota Public Employees \n           Association.\n         Pam Solwey, North Dakota DES Action.\n         Sherry Shadley, North Dakota Clean Water Action.\n         Chuck Stebbins, Dakota Center for Independent Living.\n         Pauline Nygaard, North Dakota Breast Implant Coalition.\n         Don Morrison, North Dakota Progressive Coalition.\n         Lani Weatherly, Laborers International Union, Local 580.\n         Jude M.

There are a number of reasons \n     for our opposition to this bill, but we will briefly mention \n     only two.\n       First, the cap on punitive damages would unquestionably \n     undermine the potential for such assessments to truly punish \n     wrongdoers. While punitive damage assessments are rare in \n     product liability cases, they often are the only means for \n     citizens to stop the reckless behavior of a wrongdoer. With \n     the arbitrary cap, not only would future punitive damage \n     assessments not adequately punish the wrongdoer, but \n     companies could calculate whether it would be more cost-\n     effective to produce a safe product or risk punitive damages.\n       Second, the statute of repose would deny workers and \n     consumers their right to seek compensation if they are \n     injured by a product that is more than twenty years old. It \n     is, by no means, uncommon for workplace equipment to exceed \n     this limit. At the same time, however, businesses are exempt \n     from this restriction. The company can still sue for \n     commercial losses.\n       S. 565 would be a giant step backwards in a legal system \n     that now works reasonably well to protect average Americans. \n     We urge you to oppose S. 565 and to vote against cloture.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Shari Weir,\n     Consumer Issues Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Ohio Public Interest Research Group,\n                                     Columbus, OH, April 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: We are writing on behalf of Ohio \n     PIRG's members, and on behalf of all residents of Ohio to \n     urge your strong opposition to proposed legislation, S. 565, \n     that would eviscerate the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products. As you know, Ohio PIRG is a statewide, \n     non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and environmental advocacy \n     group that has fought to protect the rights of consumers for \n     many years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. Its caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 make it \n     unacceptable.

Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: We are writing on behalf of OSPIRG's \n     members, and on behalf of all residents of Oregon to urge \n     your strong opposition to proposed legislation, S. 565, that \n     would eviscerate the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products. As you know, OSPIRG is a statewide, non-\n     profit, nonpartisan consumer and environmental advocacy group \n     that has fought to protect the rights of consumers for many \n     years.\n       Each year, more than 28 million Americans are injured by \n     consumer products and 21,000 are killed. Why should this \n     Senate pass legislation that limits the legal rights of \n     victims at the same time as it is cutting back funding for \n     the federal agencies that are supposed to protect consumers \n     from these dangerous products?\n       S. 565, the so-called Product Liability ``Fairness'' Act \n     is, in fact, manifestly unfair to consumers. We have numerous \n     problems with the bill. It caps on punitive damages will \n     encourage faulty product design. Its limits on pain and \n     suffering damages unfairly and unjustly restrict awards to \n     women, children and senior citizens who are harmed. Its \n     preemption of numerous stronger state laws is unfair to all \n     consumers.\n       [[Page S6388]] These anti-consumer provisions of S. 565 \n     make it unacceptable.

We believe \n     bill S. 565 is an anti-consumer legislative move that will \n     only enhance the rights of big business, i.e., manufacturers. \n     We believe that this bill will only encourage manufacturers \n     to have a stronger attitude of uncaring towards the products \n     they produce and place in the marketplace for the consumer. \n     Today, with workers' relaxed attitudes and work ethics it \n     would hardly be a feasible idea to give the manufacturers a \n     freer hand in the quality control of products. This is a time \n     when we need stronger controls over big business, not the \n     consumer. The consumer is being hurt enough as it is with the \n     dangerous quality of products that is being turned out to \n     them now.\n       Injuries that are the result of a manufacturer's flaw \n     should be compensated to the injured. When products are \n     marketed as being wonderful and safe in fancy, expensive \n     advertisements to draw in the consumer to purchase, the \n     manufacturer should be responsible for any consequence after \n     the sale of their product if it has been flawed from the \n     manufacturing process.\n       V.A.L.V. members throughout the state of Pennsylvania \n     strongly urge you to vote against bill S. 565 as well as \n     similar legislation and to vote against cloture.\n       We thank you for considering our fears.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                               Elaine S.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of our 40,000 members in \n     Pennsylvania, we are writing to express our strong opposition \n     to S. 565, the so-called ``Product Liability Fairness Act'' \n     sponsored by Senators Rockefeller and Gorton. We urge you to \n     oppose any effort to move this anti-consumer, anti-worker \n     legislation forward, including procedural moves to cut off \n     debate.\n       S. 565 would drastically limit the ability of injured \n     consumers and workers to obtain full and fair compensation, \n     and would restrict the ability of citizen juries to impose \n     adequate deterrents to prevent future injuries.\n       Specifically, S. 565 would place caps on punitive damage \n     awards of $250,000 or three times economic damages. Such \n     awards, while rare, are designed to punish corporations that \n     intentionally or recklessly disregard the safety of \n     consumers, and to deter other corporations from such \n     behavior. Placing arbitrary limits on punitive damages will \n     only serve to encourage such behavior, placing consumers at \n     greater risk.\n       S. 565 would also eliminate joint and several liability for \n     noneconomic damages, making it difficult for consumers to \n     recover costs related to injuries such as the loss of child-\n     bearing capacity, loss of sight or limb, or disfigurement. \n     This provision places a greater value on lost income, thereby \n     discriminating against women, children, and senior citizens.\n       Finally, this bill would prevent workers and consumers--but \n     not businesses--from recovering damages for losses caused by \n     defective machines or products that are more than 20 years \n     old.\n       We strongly urge you to protect the legal rights of \n     consumers and workers throughout Pennsylvania by voting \n     against passage of S. 565 and voting against cloture.

Rich Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirkson Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: We are writing to urge your strong \n     opposition to S. 565, reforms to the Product Liability Law. \n     S. 565 will have its most dramatic effect on working men and \n     women who are injured by defective machinery. It is our \n     understanding that 60% of the Product Liability claims arise \n     from workplace injuries.\n       First and foremost, we are concerned that weakening the \n     Product Liability Law will undermine safety in the workplace. \n     As a practical matter, it is the threat of a lawsuit that \n     encourages manufacturers to design and produce safe \n     machinery. OSHA, which could play some role, has been \n     ineffective in regulating in this area and is likely to \n     continue to be ineffective. We must look to the Product \n     Liability Law as the single most important force for safety \n     machinery in the workplace.\n       The specific changes proposed by S. 565 will not only \n     undermine safety, but unfairly deny injured workers \n     compensation for loss of body part or body function.\n       Several issues are of priority concern for Pennsylvania \n     workers:\n       (1) Twenty-year Statute of Repose:\n       The statute of repose would deny the right to file a claim \n     if a worker is injured by machinery more than 20 years old. \n     Pennsylvania, as you know, is a mature industrial state. Many \n     of our workers are working with machinery that is older than \n     20 years.\n       To cut off their rights by a fixed time limitation is \n     artificial and will deny those injured any remedy. The age of \n     the machine should be taken into account in determining the \n     defect, but the proposed change is inflexible and unfair. \n     Finally, it will create a market for used machinery rather \n     than encourage\n      new manufacturing of safer equipment.\n       (2) The overriding of both the Federal Employers' Liability \n     Act and the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers Compensation \n     Act will hurt those covered by these laws in Pennsylvania--\n     specifically our Longshoremen and Railroad and Airline \n     workers.\n       (3) The elimination of joint and several liability could \n     end up leaving injured workers with no responsible party to \n     pay for a judgement and award.\n       [[Page S6389]] (4) The cap on punitive damages again is \n     arbitrary and will undermine the incentive to produce safe \n     machinery. The cap of $250,000 is artificially low and fails \n     to consider the reality that few punitive damages are awarded \n     under current Pennsylvania law.\n       The real purpose of punitive damages is to control \n     outrageous conduct on the part of manufacturers.\n       These are just some of our major concerns with S. 565.\n       We urge you to strongly oppose this legislation and vote in \n     support of encouraging the manufacture of safe products. Each \n     year, 150,000 Pennsylvanians experience serious workplace \n     injuries and close to 5,000 occupationally caused deaths \n     occur. Many of these injuries and diseases are caused by \n     defective products. S. 565 will only add to the pain and \n     suffering of those who go to work each day with an \n     expectation of returning home safe.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     William M. George,\n       President.\n     Richard W. Bloomingdale,\n       Secretary-Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Coalition for Accountability\n\n\n                                                     & Justice\n\n                                                   April 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to oppose efforts to weaken America's civil justice system. \n     We urge you to vote against cloture on S. 565, the product \n     liability measure sponsored by Sens. Gorton and Rockefeller, \n     or any other legislation that would weaken the rights of the \n     citizens of South Dakota.\n       By restricting the rights of victims of dangerous and \n     defective products, this measure undermines the role of the \n     civil justice system in redressing damages and deterring \n     harmful behavior. By giving ``non-economic'' damages second-\n     class treatment, the bill discriminates against populations \n     with less earning power, specifically women, children, \n     seniors and low- and middle-income workers. Under S. 565, the \n     U.S. would have a two-tiered system of justice where rich, \n     high-salaried workers would be accorded better treatment and \n     higher damage awards than the rest of us. Finally, by \n     establishing brand new federal rules for product liability \n     cases, S. 565 removes from state authority and oversight and \n     civil justice system that, despite the hyperbole of the big \n     business interests backing this legislation, has served \n     consumers and the residents of South Dakota exceedingly well.\n       S. 565 is far more restrictive than last year's Senate \n     product liability bill. First and foremost, the bill \n     establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times economic \n     loss, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this cap, \n     corporations will be punished more if they injure or kill a \n     corporate executive than if the same conduct harms a child, a \n     senior citizen, or a schoolteacher. How can this be fair? In \n     addition, the bill establishes a 20 year limit on lawsuits \n     for capital goods--in last year's bill, the limit was 25 \n     years. Moreover, S. 565 adds protections for manufacturers of \n     raw materials in medical devices and for rental car \n     companies, and reduces manufacturer liability for misuses or \n     alterations made to the product by anyone else--provisions \n     that were not in last year's bill.\n       Even if one reasonably believes that the measure introduced \n     by Sens. Gorton and Rockfeller is sound public policy (which \n     we do not), it must ultimately be reconciled with the extreme \n     revisions to the civil justice system recently adopted by the \n     House of Representatives. H.R. 956, in\n      addition to the provisions outlined above, enacts an \n     arbitrary cap on pain and suffering awards in medical \n     malpractice and cases involving drugs and medical devices, \n     at the same time it offers an automatic punitive damages \n     shield for products that have received FDA approval. In \n     addition, the House measure extends the cap on punitive \n     damages to all civil lawsuits, and establishes an \n     arbitrary 15 year statute of repose for product liability \n     cases.\n       Passage of either of these measures, or a combination of \n     the two, would cause grievous harm to the people who have \n     elected you--and depend on you--to represent their interests \n     in Congress. We urge you to oppose any effort to weaken or \n     federalize product liability laws, and to vote ``no'' on \n     cloture on S. 565, on S. 565, and on any conference committee \n     reported-measure restricting the rights of consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike Coffey, AFSCME; Bob Burns, South Dakota State \n           University; Jeanne Koster, South Dakota Peace and \n           Justice Center; Jack E.

Fred Thompson,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: Greetings from Nashville. I am \n     director of Tennessee Citizen Action, a grassroots consumer \n     group with over 5,000 members across the state. I am writing \n     to express Citizen Action's strong concerns about S. 565, the \n     product liability bill to be considered next week on the \n     Senate floor.\n       It is our view that this legislation would have serious \n     implications for the health and safety of your constituents. \n     S. 565 would impose federal requirements, for the first time \n     in over two hundred years, on an area which has been under \n     state authority. In doing so, we believe that it would limit \n     both the ability of injured consumers to obtain fair \n     compensation and the ability of citizen juries to hold guilty \n     parties accountable for their actions. As a result, the \n     incentives which have convinced many companies to improve the \n     safety of their products will be lessened.\n       While there are a number of troubling provisions in S. 565, \n     I would like to raise two key issues. First, the bill would \n     destroy the ability of citizen juries to impose penalties on \n     wrongdoers in order to prevent future injuries. Punitive \n     damages are rarely used. In fact, over the last 25 years, \n     punitive damages have been awarded in less than 15 cases each \n     year (less than 11 cases excluding asbestos cases). But \n     punitive damages have proven to be critical in persuading \n     manufacturers to improve the safety of their products or \n     remove unsafe products from the marketplace. By placing \n     arbitrary caps on awards, S. 565 would make it virtually \n     impossible for citizen juries to act to protect society from \n     future harm. At a time when Congress is considering limits on \n     federal regulation, it makes little sense to further erode \n     the ability of people to use the courts as a way to improve \n     the safety of the marketplace.\n       Second, S. 565 would establish a discriminatory legal \n     system in which the level of compensation is based not on the \n     level of the injury, but on the economic status of the \n     injured consumer. By eliminating joint and several liability \n     for non-economic damages, the bill states that it is not \n     important to compensate individuals for having to live with \n     excruciating pain, disfigurement, blindness, or loss of the \n     ability to bear children.\n       Given these and other provisions, Tennessee Citizen Action \n     believes that the passage of S. 565 would be detrimental to \n     consumers and the nation. We appreciate your consideration of \n     our views and look forward to learning your position on these \n     important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 C. Brian McGuire,\n                                                   State Director.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                         Texas Citizen Action,\n                                       Austin, TX, April 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: We are writing you to ask for your vote \n     against cloture on S.565 the ``Unfair Product Liability Act'' \n     introduced by Senator Rockefeller. We are extremely concerned \n     about the impact this will have on the safety standards of \n     everyday products for consumers and innocent citizens. We \n     believe there are several provisions of the bill which will \n     eliminate the consumers ability to hold wrongdoers \n     accountable for their actions, and limit innocent victims \n     recourse to fully recover for damages they have accrued.\n       Capping punitive damages will do nothing to increase safety \n     standards for innocent consumers. By limiting punitive damage \n     awards to $250,000 or three times economic damages you are \n     creating a nuisance expense for multi-billion dollar \n     companies such as Ford Motor Company or Dow Chemical. This is \n     creating a predictability in the market place for the minute \n     number of companies who act negligently allowing them to \n     calculate their risk for producing a less than safe product \n     and further lets them rest assured they will never be held \n     liable past a certain dollar amount.\n       S.565 prevents consumers from holding manufacturers of \n     products which cause significant harm or injury accountable \n     if the product is older than 20 years. Many products are \n     intended to last longer than 20 years. This law however, \n     would eliminate all consumer rights to be made whole if a 20 \n     year old product caused significant harm or damages. This is \n     an example of corporate wrongdoers being protected at the \n     expense of consumers protection.\n       The elimination of ``Joint and Several Liability'' is a \n     slap in the face to innocent individuals, families, and \n     communities. Allowing guilty defendants off the hook without \n     having to make innocent victims 100% whole is a disgrace. We \n     will without a doubt see victims paying for portions of their \n     damages even when they were completely without fault. This \n     will not only affect individuals but likewise families, \n     communities, cities, and states. We will see wrongdoers \n     getting off free of charge while cities, towns, and families \n     pick up the tab for the irresponsible behavior of others.\n       Texas Citizen Action has a membership of well over 150,000 \n     citizens. These people have joined our organization because \n     they believe in the positions we take on consumer protection \n     issues. The passage of S.565 will be a major step backwards \n     for individuals and communities and their rights to hold \n     others \n      [[Page S6390]] accountable for wrongs they may commit. We \n     ask you to vote against cloture on S.565 for the citizens of \n     Texas.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Daniel Lambe,\n     Program Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            Defenders of the Rights of Texans,\n\n                                       Austin, TX, April 24, 1995.\n     Re S. 565.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Defenders of the Rights of Texans \n     (DRT) is asking you to vote against cloture on S. 565, Sen. \n     Rockefeller's ``Unfair Product Liability Act.'' This bill \n     will adversely impact the safety standards of products which \n     we consumers utilize on a daily basis. We strongly feel that \n     victims of unsafe products must retain the ability to hold \n     accountable those who produce products which kill and maim. \n     Limiting damages does not protect consumers, it protects \n     manufacturers of products that injure consumers. That should \n     not happen!\n       The effect of eliminating some of the current protections \n     in the law will be to make the victim pay twice, even when \n     they contributed nothing to the accident or injury. If \n     Congress eliminates ``Joint and Several Liability'', you will \n     make it difficult for your constituents to recover fully from \n     their misfortune. The only pain and suffering you will be \n     eliminating is that of the offending party. We support \n     victims' rights, not the rights of those corporations or \n     individuals who do not want to take responsibility when their \n     products harm the American public.\n       We oppose capping punitive damages because we know that it \n     takes significant awards to get the attention of \n     manufacturers who continue to foist its products on an \n     unsuspecting public years after the corporation knows the \n     product to be unsafe. Why Congress would consider rewarding \n     such unacceptable behavior is beyond our organization's \n     comprehension.\n       Defenders of the Rights of Texans is a coalition of \n     individuals and organizations--consumer, environmental, \n     worker, academic, clergy, student, and victims--who oppose \n     sacrificing our rights on the alter of corporate greed. We \n     ask you to represent our interests by voting against cloture \n     on S. 565.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bob Comeaux,\n     San Antonio, TX.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Virginia National Organization\n\n\n                                                    For Women,\n\n                                                   April 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles Robb,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Robb, Virginia N.O.W., represents some 20,000 \n     Virginia women. We are writing to urge you to vote no on \n     cloture and no on S. 565 and any other measure that restricts \n     individual legal rights.\n       S. 565, the ``Product Liability Fairness Act'', is in fact, \n     unfair. By limiting non-economic damages, it give wealthy \n     individuals and corporations greater rights than middle-\n     income citizens and families. Additionally, S. 565 transfers \n     authority for the civil justice system from the states to the \n     federal government. States know better how to serve its \n     individual citizens and the issues that impact the citizens \n     than the Washington bureaucracy. Whatever happened to the \n     idea of states' rights and limiting the power of the federal \n     government? S. 565 caps pain and suffering awards on medical \n     malpractice suits. Why single out a particular type of \n     lawsuit to cap awards?\n       Virginia N.O.W. has supported many women who have filed \n     lawsuits, for both international and negligent injuries. \n     During the 1995 legislative session we along with other \n     citizens groups such as the VTLA, NAACP, ACLU, LofWV, worked \n     hard to obtain a compromise on the Virginia Human Rights Act. \n     A bill which passed the legislative session only to be vetoed \n     by the Governor. The bill reverses the Lockhart decision, \n     which basically prevents a small business employee from \n     filing a lawsuit based on race, color, sex or national \n     origin. Additionally, VA N.O.W. supports lawsuits for sexual \n     harassment, defective products, product liability, employment \n     discrimination and of course intentional injury. Economic \n     justice as well as civil justice must be preserved. S. 565 \n     seeks to destroy both, please vote ``no'' on S. 565.\n       People all across America are closely watching the new \n     Republican majority in Congress in an effort to determine \n     whether it truly represents the people or big business. \n     Surely, the outcome and deliberations of S. 565 will provide \n     an answer.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dulaney S. Nickerson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                              Charlottesville, VA, April 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles S. Robb,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Robb: I am writing on behalf of Virginia \n     Citizen Action and its over 50,000 members to ask you to \n     oppose S. 565, the ``Product Liability Fairness Act.'' We \n     would ask you that you do whatever is necessary to defeat \n     this bill, including voting against any effort invoke cloture \n     on debate.\n       Senator, this bill would make America a much more dangerous \n     place for all of us. By capping punitive damages, this bill \n     will send a signal to corporate wrongdoers that they can \n     escape any real punishment for making and selling products \n     that will kill or injure innocent people. S. 565 would \n     eliminate the deterrent effect of punitive damages and remove \n     one of the real protections Americans have had for over 200 \n     years.\n       This bill is anything but fair. By eliminating joint and \n     several liability for non-economic damages, it discriminates \n     against women, children and seniors. Non-economic damages are \n     not just pain and suffering. What about a women's loss of the \n     ability to bear children or a child's disfigurement for life!\n       Senator, S. 565 is not ``moderate'' and it is not ``fair''. \n     We hope that you will work to defeat this bill and protect \n     every Virginian and every American from those special \n     interests who want to escape responsibility for their actions \n     at the expense of the health and safety of the American \n     people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Marc Wetherhorn,\n     State Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,\n\n                                     Yorktown, VA, April 25, 1995.\n     Re S. 565.\n     Hon. Charles S. Robb,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Robb: The Virginia Citizens Consumer Council \n     strongly urges you to oppose S. 565, the ``Product Liability \n     Fairness Act of 1995. This bill will do irreparable harm to \n     Virginia consumers by restricting the ability of injured \n     consumers to obtain full and fair compensation and for \n     citizen juries to impose adequate deterrents to prevent \n     further injuries. Corporate wrongdoers must be held \n     accountable when consumers are harmed by the products they \n     buy as a matter of simple justice and to foster confidence in \n     the American marketplace.\n       Two major provisions of this legislation will have a \n     negative impact on consumers and workers. First, this bill \n     sets arbitrary limits on punitive damage awards of $250,000 \n     or three times the economic damages, reducing the ability to \n     deter corporations from inflicting harm on others and \n     threatening Virginians' economic security and well-being. At \n     a time when Congress is talking about increasing personal \n     responsibility, it makes no sense to reduce the \n     responsibility of corporations guilty of manufacturing or \n     selling dangerous products.\n       Second, this bill eliminates joint and several liability \n     for non-economic damages, making it difficult for consumers \n     to recover costs related to injuries such as the loss of \n     reproductive capacity, loss of sight, or disfigurement. Those \n     injuries deserve to be compensated and should not be treated \n     as less important than the loss of high salaries or \n     investment income. For similar reasons, VCCC urges you to \n     oppose S. 454, ``The Health Care Liability and Quality \n     Assurance Act'' which would severely affect the rights of \n     injured patients.\n       VCCC urges you to act to prevent passage of this \n     legislation, which will greatly restrict the ability of \n     injured consumers to be compensated fully and for juries to \n     act to prevent further wrongdoing. Virginia consumers count \n     on you to act in our best interest by voting NO on this anti-\n     consumer, auto-worker bill. Please let me know the outcome of \n     the Senate votes on S. 565 and S. 454 and how you cast your \n     votes. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jean Ann Fox,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Washington Citizen Action,\n\n\n                                           State Headquarters,\n\n                                      Seattle, WA, April 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton:\n       On behalf of our 42,000 members statewide and our 20 \n     affiliate community, church, labor, and senior organizations, \n     Washington Citizen Action urges you to oppose Senate Bill 565 \n     and to vote against cloture. This bill is one of the most \n     anti-consumer pieces of legislation to make it to the Senate \n     floor in decades. Please do all that you can to stop S. 565 \n     from passing.\n       The arbitrary caps on punitive damages would eliminate the \n     incentive to produce safe products and would allow negligent \n     corporations to operate with little to no accountability. S. \n     565 will undoubtedly result in a multitude of injuries, \n     disfigurements, and deaths. In addition, these limits will \n     take away all recourse society has to punish wrongdoers that \n     knowingly and repeatedly maim and kill people with deadly \n     products and negligent actions.\n       By eliminating joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages, S. 565 would weaken the ability of ordinary \n     Americans to receive fair compensation when they are injured \n     by unsafe products and practices. The bill is unfair to \n     women, children, seniors, working families, small businesses, \n     and lower to middle income Americans. Victims and their \n     families will be rendered unable to receive adequate \n     compensation for their injuries while the guilty parties are \n     let off the hook. This is not our idea of American justice.\n       In America, the courts have proven to be the major \n     protection citizens have against negligent corporations and \n     unsafe products. We cannot afford to let our civil justice \n     system be dismantled by the provisions of S. 565. Vote NO on \n     S. 565! Vote NO on cloture!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       David West,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                               [[Page S6391]]\n\n                           West Virginia-Citizen Action Group,\n\n                                   Charleston, WV, April 24, 1995.\n     Re Proposed legislation concerning Civil Justice System (S. \n         565).\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller, IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller. On behalf of the twenty thousand \n     members of the West Virginia-Citizen Action Group (WV-CAG), I \n     am writing this brief letter to encourage you to rethink your \n     support for S. 565. However well-intentioned this legislation \n     may be, I honestly believe that the potential--and \n     unintended--consequences are so great as to offset any \n     perceived benefits.\n       I realize, of course, that the House-passed ``Common Sense \n     Legal Reform Act'' is more draconian than S. 565. This does \n     not ameliorate the many deficiencies contained in the Senate \n     bill, including the two most egregious (as follows):\n       By capping punitive damage caps at $250,000 or three times \n     the economic loss (whichever is greater), the proposed \n     legislation removes the ``punishment'' that is supposed to be \n     reflected in damages. As a result, it will become cheaper in \n     many instances to pay the damages than to rectify the \n     problem.\n       By eliminating joint and several liability for non-economic \n     damages, the proposed legislation unfairly discriminates \n     against women, children, and seniors. Non-economic loss is \n     much more than pain and suffering; it can also be loss of \n     reproductive capacity, loss of right or disfigurement.\n       After studying this, and related tort reform proposals for \n     many year, we are convinced that such efforts are contrary to \n     public policy and will jeopardize the hand-earned rights of \n     injured West Virginians. Accordingly, I would like to urge \n     you to reconsider your position and fight, as you have done \n     so often in the past, for the rights of West Virginia \n     consumers.\n       Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope \n     to see and/or talk with you again soon. If you need any \n     further information, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        State Senator David Grubb,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Wisconsin Consumers League,\n\n                                                    Milwaukee, WI.\n     Re SB 565 and 454.\n     Senator Herbert Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: We write to urge your opposition to the \n     so-called ``Common Sense Legal Reforms Act'' submitted as \n     part of the Contract with America. This package of bills \n     would substantially modify existing product liability and \n     medical malpractice laws. It is largely unsupported by the \n     vast majority of the rigorous evidence which has been \n     developed on these topics. Rather, it is seemingly being \n     swept along on a wave of anecdote, innuendo and, in some \n     cases, outright untruths.\n       There can be little doubt that product liability and \n     medical malpractice laws have evolved to reflect emerging \n     technologies. They have had the desired effects of modifying \n     behavior to the optimum end of preventing injury to consumers \n     and workers. The claims regarding the alleged stultifying \n     effects of these bodies of common law are generally \n     unsupported by credible, systematic evidence. For example, \n     the work of Professor Galanter, at the UW Law School, \n     compellingly refutes allegations regarding any alleged \n     `litigation explosion'. The punitive damages which S. 565 \n     would limit are only relatively rarely awarded. Such `sledge-\n     hammer' approaches to ``reforming'' such legal standards, \n     while politically satisfying, are only coincidentally related \n     to thoughtful policy-making.\n       It is, in our view, remarkably arrogant for legislators to \n     substitute their prospective judgments regarding equitable \n     outcomes for specific factual cases yet to arise for the \n     judgment of juries, which, by definition, can examine each \n     case on its own unique, and prospectively unknowable, facts. \n     How can anyone think they can be more fair regarding \n     situations yet to occur than can juries with the benefit of \n     hindsight?\n       We repeat our opposition to these unnecessarily broad \n     attempts to weaken the preventative impacts of the common \n     law.\n            Very truly yours,\n                                                   James L. Brown,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Wisconsin Citizen Action,\n\n                                    Milwaukee, WI, April 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: On behalf of our 103,000 members and \n     our coalition of 110 labor, senior, religious, environmental, \n     women's, farm and community organizations, we are writing to \n     urge you to oppose S. 565 and to vote against cloture. We \n     very much appreciated your help last year in the defeat of S. \n     687, this bill's predecessor. We're confident we can count on \n     you again.\n       This bill is very similar to the product liability \n     ``reform'' Bob Kasten used to push when he represented \n     Wisconsin in the United States Senate. We like to think that \n     one of the reasons why Wisconsin voters chose not to re-elect \n     Bob Kasten to the Senate is because they repudiated his \n     consistently anti-consumer positions. S. 565 is similarly out \n     of step with the interests of Wisconsin consumers.\n       The provisions in this bill cannot claim to be \n     ``moderate.'' A punitive damage cap of $250,000 or three \n     times the economic loss to a victim of an injurious product \n     is no more than a slap on the wrist to the corporations \n     responsible for the deaths and injuries caused by products \n     like the Ford Pinto, the Dalkon Shield, silicone-gel breast \n     implants and flammable baby pajamas. The manufacturer of the \n     ``Slip 'N' Slide'' water slide, which caused a 35-year old \n     Wisconsin mechanic to break his neck, become temporarily \n     quadriplegic and suffer permanent spasms, would have had its \n     punishment reduced to one-thirtieth of what a jury thought \n     appropriate. The U.S. Senate would be changing the punishment \n     so that it cannot possible fit the crime in an era of public \n     sentiment to get tough on wrongdoers.\n       We have no idea how many similar horror stories like those \n     are waiting to happen. Corporate wrongdoers would face a \n     dollar and cent deterrent too cheap to stay their pursuit of \n     profit without regard for consumer health and safety. The \n     temptation for corporations to proceed with dangerous \n     products, even if they are eventually found guilty in a \n     lawsuit, would get that much easier. S. 565 will weaken the \n     ability of our civil justice system to act as both deterrent \n     and remedy.\n       The elimination of joint and several liability for \n     noneconomic damages discriminates against the most vulnerable \n     populations in our society--women, children and seniors. \n     These are the members of our society who are usually forced \n     to claim noneconomic losses, and these constituencies would \n     now be forced to shoulder the burden of being only partially \n     compensated. Noneconomic damages include the loss of \n     reproductive capacity, loss of sight and permanent \n     disfigurement, not just ``pain and suffering.'' It is simply \n     unfair that a party found to be negligent should not be \n     required to make these vulnerable people whole after they \n     have been injured.\n       The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission once estimated \n     that some 33,000,000 people are injured by defective or \n     dangerous products every year. 29,000 of them die. Only 1.6% \n     of the injured parties sue. S. 565 solves no problem in our \n     civil justice system, but it will create a very real human \n     toll if it is allowed to pass. We respectfully urge you to \n     vote against the bill and to vote against cloture.\n       Thanks once again for your outstanding leadership in \n     defeating the anti-consumer product liability ``reform'' bill \n     in last year's Congress. We appreciate all your help in \n     continuing that effort by defeating this bill again, albeit \n     in a tougher political climate. Thank you for attention in \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Larry Marx,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Center for Public\n\n\n                                         Representation, Inc.,\n\n                                      Madison, WI, April 21, 1995.\n     Re Senate bill 565.\n     Senator Herb Kohl,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: As you know S. 565, the misleadingly-\n     named ``Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act \n     of 1995'' will soon be considered by the Senate. As one of \n     the major consumer advocacy groups in Wisconsin, we urge you \n     to oppose this anti-consumer measure.\n       While certain aspects of our tort system are certainly in \n     need of reform, this bill totally misses the mark. Instead of \n     protecting consumers from some of the excesses of our legal \n     system, it would protect manufacturers of defective products \n     from assuming full responsibility for their actions. Seizing \n     upon such highly publicized and distorted cases like the \n     ``burning McDonald's coffee'' proponents of this measure (as \n     well as similar proposals in numerous state legislatures \n     including Wisconsin) would eviscerate the ability of our \n     legal system to effectively enforce rules on product safety \n     and punish those who violate them.\n       The proposed restrictions on punitive damages are \n     completely counter-intuitive. By encouraging corporations to \n     produce safe products, punitive damages (which, insurance \n     industry rhetoric notwithstanding, are rarely awarded by \n     juries or upheld on appeal) actually help corporations save \n     money. Safe products mean fewer, not more lawsuits. Safe \n     products mean fewer, not more medical insurance claims filed \n     by consumers. Safe products mean fewer government recalls. \n     And safe products mean an improved quality of life for all \n     consumers.\n       The elimination of joint and several liability for non-\n     economic damages is also misplaced. On first blush, this \n     common law concept may seem unfair; why should one \n     corporation that is only slightly liable have to pick up the \n     tab for a more culpable corporation that happens to be \n     insolvent? But when you look closer, joint and several \n     liability is the fairest resolution to a difficult dilemma. \n     It looks at all of the parties involved in a products \n     liability lawsuit and decides that the costs should be spread \n     so as to fully compensate the victim who, after all, is the \n     only innocent party. And since non-economic damages are \n     frequently awarded to the most vulnerable members of society; \n     the poor, young children, senior citizens, this provision \n     would affect such groups disproportionately.\n       The elimination of liability for products more than twenty \n     years old is also unfair to consumers. Again, this provision \n     would disproportionately harm the most vulnerable consumers, \n     since they rely more heavily on \n      [[Page S6392]] older, used products. The anti-consumer \n     nature of this bill is especially apparent in this provision, \n     since it exempts companies who suffer commercial losses.\n       Another particularly disturbing provision in S. 565 from \n     the Wisconsin perspective is its preemption of state consumer \n     protection laws. As you know, Wisconsin is a national leader \n     in the area of consumer protection. Its well-deserved \n     reputation in this area has been built up over many decades. \n     S. 565 would tarnish that image and bring Wisconsin down to \n     the lowest common denominator in protecting its citizens from \n     consumer abuse.\n       There are other consumer-unfriendly aspects to S. 565, \n     including its exemption from liability for the sellers of \n     products and the special treatment provided for suppliers of \n     materials for medical devices. Moreover, the bill exempts \n     corporations from many of the restrictions on damages which \n     it imposes on individual consumers.\n       Consumer groups in Wisconsin and around the country have \n     fought long and hard over the past few decades to insure that \n     consumers have access to safe and effective products. S. 565 \n     would annul much of this hard work in one fell swoop. On \n     behalf of all of Wisconsin's consumers, we urge you to oppose \n     it.\n       Thank you.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                 Stephen E. Meili,\n                                    Director, Consumer Law Clinic.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There it is. I did not want to really fill up the \nRecord, but every responsible, credible consumer entity in any of the \n50 States is opposed to this initiative, and the other side knows it. \nBut they come around and talk balance and they talk consumers and they \nsay you cannot produce products.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record these two \nadvertisements by the pharmaceutical companies, February 23, 1995, and \nApril 5, 1995, in the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 1995]\n\n    Drug Companies Target Major Diseases With Record R Investment\n\n       Pharmaceutical companies will spend nearly $15 billion on \n     drug research and development in 1995. New medicines in \n     development for leading diseases include: 86 for heart \n     disease and stroke, 124 for cancer, 107 for AIDS and AIDS-\n     related diseases, 19 for Alzheimer's, 46 for mental diseases, \n     and 79 for infectious diseases.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 5, 1995]\n\n          Who Leads the World In Discovering Major New Drugs?\n\n       Between 1970 and 1992, close to half of the important new \n     drugs sold in major markets around the world were introduced \n     by U.S. pharmaceutical companies. And here at home, the drug \n     industry has been making 9 out of every 10 new drug \n     discoveries. So when a breakthrough medicine is created for \n     AIDS, heart disease, Alzheimer's, stroke, cancer or any other \n     disease, chances are it will come from America's drug \n     research companies.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just the one in February, one statement:\n\n       Pharmaceutical companies will spend nearly $15 billion on \n     drug research and development in 1995.\n\n  According to the Senator from Washington, they cannot spend. They \njust cannot work anymore with this law. And right here in April:\n\n       Between 1970 and 1992, close to half of the important new \n     drugs sold in major markets around the world were introduced \n     by U.S. pharmaceutical companies. And here at home the drug \n     industry is making nine out of every ten new drug \n     discoveries. Breakthrough medicines that are going to be \n     created for AIDS, heart disease, Alzheimer's, stroke, cancer, \n     or any other disease will come from the American drug \n     companies.\n\n  But according to the Senator from Washington, they cannot bring out \nproducts. Come on. They have tried every trick in the book.\n  What we really have afoot, Mr. President, when they cite the \nConstitution is just that--an assault against the constitutional right \nof trial by jury guaranteed by the seventh amendment. People who say \nthey do not trust politicians anymore are waiting for the politicians \nto behave as though they trust the people. You and I trust them to \nelect us, but when they get us 12 men and women on a jury sworn to \nlisten to the facts and make their finding, according to their sworn \noath, ``They do not know what they are doing; they have gone ape; they \nare just runaway juries,'' and everything else of that kind.\n  But we up here, the bureaucracy in Washington, we should decide \nrather than letting the juries decide back home.\n  We have a right, Mr. President, that has worked over the many, many \nyears. You have safe drug products. Thank heavens, we have product \nliability and we have taken off Dalkon shield and all the rest of these \nother things--cancer causing products. We have safer automobiles.\n  Why do you think Chrysler the other day said they were going to \nrecall I think some 350,000 or several million cars? I had the \nsummation. Seventy-one million automobiles in the last 10 years, \nAmerican and foreign manufacture, have been recalled. They do not \nrecall them because of the goodness of their heart. They recall them on \naccount of product liability. What we have in hand here they want to \ndestroy. We have always had in this land ``salus populi suprema lex.'' \nSafety of the people is the supreme law.\n  Now they come with this measure, the profits of the manufacturers is \nthe supreme law, and whine that they are for the consumers and they \ncannot put out products.\n  How does this come about? I have been in this for 40 years and I have \nwatched it develop: Pollster politics. They tell you when you come to \nthis national office up here that you have to get a poll and get to \nfour or five hot-button items and then you have to identify with them. \nYou are for jobs, everybody is for jobs; you are against crime; you are \nagainst taxes. They just go down the list.\n  Then they tell you, and in fact GOPAC puts on a school over there for \nthe young Congressmen that are elected, they say, ``You have only got a \n20-second time bite to give your message, so you need words that count, \nwords that excite, inflame.''\n  And do you know what they call us up here now? I quote the Speaker. \nHe terms the U.S. Government that pledged to preserve, protect, and \ndefend, he calls it the corrupt liberal welfare State.\n  And when you can come in this anti-Government drive with the Contract \nWith America and you see it in the morning paper and if you read it \nclosely, it is gone: ``Get rid of the Government. The Government is not \nthe solution, the Government is the problem. The Government is the \nenemy.''\n  That has been the drumbeat. If you can wrap it together in tort \nreform, you can get against the lawyers and against the Government both \nand you can really have a winner.\n  Well, for 15 years we have defended against this assault. President \nFord helped us 15 years ago. He appointed a commission. And when \nPresident Ford appointed that commission, they had a 4-year study that \ncame out and found that the States for 200 years have been handling \nthis properly, basic tort law.\n  Incidentally, of all the civil findings, only 9 percent are tort. And \nof all the tort, only 4 percent of the 9 percent, or 0.38, thirty-eight \none-hundredths of 1 percent of what we are supposed to be dealing with. \nIt is not a problem at all.\n  They said the States were handling it. And now we know by record in \nthe hearing that the States have reformed, they have acted. The \nlegislators are not asleep, the Governors are not asleep, the attorneys \ngeneral are not asleep back in the States. They can handle this \nproblem. That is the plea of the contract in reality. Get all of these \nthings, housing grants, block grants to the States, welfare block \ngrants, whatever it is. Give it back to the States.\n  Not on this one. You are in the hands of the Philistines, that \nmanufacturing crowd out there--the Conference Board, the NFIB, the \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I have been elected six times and they do not come running.\n  That crowd that we have, they come running. Yes, the Chamber wants to \nknow where you stand, the NFIB, the Conference Board, everything else. \nThey talk about trial lawyers giving you money. They give money but the \nothers, the manufacturing and insurance crowd, they give more money and \nthey have the votes.\n  And the people who really oppose this bill do not have a PAC. Have \nyou ever seen a PAC for the American Bar Association? Have you ever \nseen a PAC for the Consumer Association, Public Citizen, Association \nfor State Supreme Court Justices, Association of State Legislators, law \nschool deans--they have all appeared in the polls--the State attorneys \ngeneral? They do not have PAC's.\n   [[Page S6393]] But there they come with all this. And we have been \nworking with them, but we have the contract now. And we have had many \nof these Senators that finally changed their votes who said, ``You \nknow, I got in trouble. I committed a year ago.''\n  That is how it happens, if people want to know. When all the powerful \norganizations come to you in a campaign and you are for reform--``Yeah, \nI'm for reform. I'm for reform.'' They have been reminded in the last \nseveral days in this debate here how they gave their commitment.\n  So I went to them, I said, ``How do you change your vote?'' They \nsaid, ``Well, I got in trouble a year ago or 2 years ago when I was \nrunning.'' And that explains it. But it does not change the lack of \nmerit in this particular initiative and the danger of it all.\n  So what we have is ``Kill all the lawyers.'' You could see it in the \namendments. That is what they have.\n  Our friend Dan Quayle started that before the American Bar \nAssociation some 4 years ago and we still have it going. If you can \nvote against the lawyers and say they are running away and getting all \nthe money and everything else like that, you have mob action on foot \nand you can get it moving.\n  Well, Mr. President, it is bad law. What happens is they do not give \nyou a Federal cause of action. If they had come in--and I have been \ninsisting for the 15-year period, if you want to make a finding under \nthe interstate commerce clause that they plea, that we are going to \nmake a congressional finding that there is a national problem and give \na Federal cause of action, that is one thing. No, that is not what they \nwant. They say they are trying to get simplicity, eliminate complexity, \nget uniformity. But then they put guidelines down for the 50 States to \ninterpret and then can go into the Federal court and, by the way, \nexempt the manufacturer. Any of these things that I have talked of, any \nof these initiatives, any of these amendments, just exempt the crowd \nthat wrote the bill.\n  Now I can tell you here and now if that is not hypocrisy, I do not \nknow what the heck is. And yet they are saying they are proud now and \nthey want to thank everybody, tell them about their balance and \neverything else like that.\n  This is one of the most dangerous initiatives. It has been held up \nfor 15 years by all of these organizations. It is a nonproblem. They \nknow it. It is a solution looking for a problem, in all reality.\n  And we are headed, yes, with the English rule, we are headed with two \nlevels of society. ``Get rid of the jurors and people with common sense \nback home. We know it all up here.''\n  They started over 130 years ago diminishing that guaranteed right of \ntrial by jury. So today, less than 2 percent of civil cases go to a \njury trial in England. And you are told that the issues are too \ncomplex, you do not have sense enough to understand and what have you. \nAnd that is the initiative that starts today on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  They know in their hearts it is bad law. They have tried everything \nfrom the Girl Scouts, and had to withdraw that; they tried the Little \nLeague and had to withdraw that. They put George McGovern on TV and had \nto pull him off. They tried everything--the McDonald's case, then when \nthat was explained to them, you do not hear them talk about the \nMcDonald's case. Always these little anecdotal things that they bring \nup.\n  But they got one winner: ``Let's get rid of the lawyers.'' We can get \na majority vote on that. We can get a majority vote on that. And so it \nis.\n  In essence, what you are really doing is getting rid of the jurors. \nThe trial by jury, they are eroding it, nibbling at it bit by bit is \nthe intent and purpose, just like they had in England where you do not \neven get a review of facts or anything else. You cannot even ask the \njurors any questions; you cannot find the background.\n  I could go down the list, but my time is now limited and I am \npractically out of time.\n  I simply say that it is a sad day in the history of government \nbecause it brings to culmination the so-called contract of reform which \ngoes totally in contradiction to the entire theme of the contract back \nhome. The people know--you are going to hear it now in the budget. The \npeople back home need a tax cut because they know how to spend the \nmoney better than the Government up here. All of these pleas and \neverything. The people back home know this, they know that, they know \neverything except the facts of the case that they are sworn to uphold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, again, for the information of Members, we \nwill now have the vote on my motion to table the Dorgan amendment.\n  There are then two other amendments, all amounting to the same thing, \nthat will come before final passage. I hope that those two amendments \nwill be adopted by voice vote. I will then ask for a rollcall on final \npassage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 629 offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Are asbestos-related injuries and deaths covered by the \ntoxic harm exception to the statute of repose in S. 565?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes, asbestos-related injuries and deaths are \ncovered by the toxic harm exception to the statute of repose.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 790\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to discuss language in the Gorton-\nRockefeller-Dole substitute amendment concerning punitive damages. The \nsubstitute language includes a formula for calculating the amount of \npunitive damages allowed to be awarded to a claimant against a \ndefendant. This formula originated with Senator Snowe and was added to \nthe Dole-Exon-Hatch amendment last week, with my support. It remains \npart of the underlying substitute amendment. The formula to which I \nrefer provides generally that the amount awarded to the claimant for \npunitive damages in a products liability action shall not exceed the \ngreater of two times the sum of the amount awarded for economic loss \nand \n [[Page S6394]] noneconomic loss, or $250,000. In the case of a small \nbusiness, a special rule provides that the amount of punitive damages \nshall not exceed the lesser of two times the sum of the amount awarded \nto the claimant for economic loss and noneconomic loss, or $250,000.\n  It is my understanding that the formula for calculating the amount of \npunitive damages is intended to take into account the separate \nprovision in the bill that makes a defendant only severally liable for \nnoneconomic losses. Thus, when doubling the amount of noneconomic \nlosses in computing the upper limit of punitive damages which may be \nawarded against a defendant, it is appropriate only to consider the \nshare of noneconomic loss attributable to that defendant. It would be \nunfair and inconsistent with other provisions in this act to expand the \nbase multiplier in the punitive damages section of this bill to include \nnoneconomic losses not attributable to a defendant.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending Product Liability Fairness Act, \neven though it has been watered down considerably by our Democrat \ncolleagues, is nonetheless needed to remedy the morass of product \nliability laws plaguing our judicial system today. We have a duty to \nensure that Americans are fairly compensated when they are injured by \nfaulty products. But today's legal system has been maneuvered into a \nposition of encouraging many people to file frivolous suits demanding \nunreasonably high damage awards.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the medical malpractice provisions, \napproved by the Senate on May 2, were deleted because of threats by the \nDemocrats that they would block passage of the entire bill.\n  Americans are suing each other too often, for too much money and for \ntoo little reason. Last year, more than 70,000 product liability \nlawsuits clogged U.S. courts. And by 1992, lawyer fees accounted for 61 \npercent of the total amount spent on product liability claims.\n  In so many cases, those who are injured least tend to receive the \nlargest settlements, while many of the most severely injured spend \nyears in the legal system, sometimes never receiving the compensation \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, the pending legislation will be a first step toward \nremedying these problems with the current system by:\n  First, giving manufacturers and consumers certainty as to the rules \nof the game when it comes to product liability lawsuits;\n  Second, allowing consumers with valid claims to receive fair awards, \nand receive these awards faster;\n  Third, reducing costs of litigation and insurance premiums, which in \nturn, will lead to lower prices for consumer products;\n  Fourth, giving consumers with valid claims more time to file \ncomplaints against negligent manufacturers; and\n  Fifth, eliminating unwarranted lawsuits which threaten to bankrupt \nsmall businesses--the segment of our economy that provides most of the \njobs in this country.\n  Mr. President, rather than expound on the problems with the current \nsystem, I will share with my colleagues a letter from the plant manager \nof Butler Manufacturing, a small business in Laurinburg, NC. His letter \nis similar to many I have received from 99 other small businessmen from \nmy State. It reads:\n\n       Dear Senator Helms: As you know, Butler Manufacturing has a \n     plant in Laurinburg, North Carolina which employs two hundred \n     workers. We urge your support of S. 565, the Product \n     Liability Fairness Act, which offers some of the reforms \n     needed in the product liability area.\n       Our company spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each \n     year for product liability insurance and legal fees and our \n     employees devote hundreds of hours of their time to help our \n     attorneys defend unwarranted product liability claims.\n       Many times we settle a claim which we honestly believe has \n     little merit because it is less expensive to settle than to \n     litigate or to expose the Company's assets to punitive \n     damages.\n       Our Company competes in the international market place. To \n     be competitive we cannot bear the cost of product liability \n     insurance, huge punitive damage expense, and large costs to \n     defend unwarranted claims which our competitors do not bear.\n       We believe persons injured by faulty products through no \n     fault of their own ought to be compensated for their out-of-\n     pocket losses. However, current court-made rules allow much \n     greater compensation than is justified and also make it \n     difficult for companies to properly defend themselves.\n\n  Mr. President, this explains why small businesses--not the Fortune \n500 companies--are the ones most threatened if nothing is done to \nreform the current legal system.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the \ncost and availability of liability insurance rank No. 5 out of a list \nof 75 problems facing small businesses today. They are constantly in \ndanger of being pulled into unwarranted\n lawsuits, where the fear of punitive damages forces them to settle in \ncases in which they should never have been involved.\n\n  About half of all small business owners earn about $50,000 a year. \nHowever, a Rand Institute study shows that it costs the same small \nbusinessman an average of $100,000 to defend against a lawsuit--\nregardless of the suit's merit. Thus, defending even a single \nunwarranted lawsuit costs twice as much as the average small business \nowner earns in a year.\n  Perhaps the most critical problem for small businesses is something \nlawyers know as joint and several liability, which permits plaintiffs \nto recover the full amount of damages from any one of the defendants--\nregardless of the amount of fault of the individual defendant. So, even \nif a small businessman is responsible for only 10 percent of the damage \ncaused the plaintiff, under the current system, that businessman can \nstill be held liable for 100 percent of the damages. The pending bill \nfixes this problem by holding a defendant liable for the percentage of \nnoneconomic damages for which he or she is responsible.\n  Mr. President, I have many friends who are trial lawyers. They have \nmade some compelling arguments in favor of the current system; however, \nin this matter, we have had to agree to disagree.\n  For example, trial lawyers argue that: First, limits on punitive \ndamage awards are unnecessary because courts don't frequently award \npunitive damages; and Second, when they are awarded, punitive damages \ngenerally do not amount to very large sums.\n  As every first year law student knows--or should know--there are \nthree kinds of damages awarded in civil lawsuits.\n  The first--economic damages--reimburses an injured person for lost \nwages, medical care, and out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of \nthe injury.\n  Second--noneconomic damages--are awarded for things such as pain and \nsuffering, and\n  Finally, there are punitive damages. The purpose of punitive damages \nis not to compensate the injured person, but rather to punish the \ndefendant for his or her negligent behavior. Most of the disagreement \nin the pending bill surrounds punitive damages.\n  Mr. President, are punitive damages rarely awarded as trial lawyers \nclaim? No. Injured parties routinely request punitive damages in \nproduct liability and other tort claims. They do so because they know \nthat's where the big bucks are. Not only are punitive damages routinely \nrequested, the amount of punitive damages awarded is increasing. In \nCook County, IL, the average punitive damage award was $6.7 million. In \n1984, the average punitive award in San Francisco was $743,000.\n  In North Carolina punitive damages have been awarded only once. \nDespite this fact, any time a product manufactured in North Carolina \nends up in another State, the North Carolina manufacturer can still be \nhauled into an out-of-State court and sued for outrageous punitive \ndamage amounts.\n  Mr. President, trial lawyers also assert that product liability \nreforms are unnecessary because so very few lawsuits filed today are \nproduct liability cases. They claim that contract disputes and domestic \nrelations cases make up more of the current case load in today's \ncourts.\n  That product liability cases make up a small piece of all tort cases \nignores one important and critical point: It only takes one product \nliability lawsuit to bankrupt a small manufacturing firm. Even if the \nmanufacturer is not found negligent, it still costs that small business \na small fortune to defend the lawsuit.\n  Lastly, lawyers argue that product liability reform will not lower \nliability \n [[Page S6395]] insurance premiums that manufacturers pay. I disagree. \nOver the past 40 years, liability insurance costs have increased 4 \ntimes the rate of growth of the national economy.\n  Moreover, for every extra dollar a company pays in product liability \ninsurance, that's a dollar less in an employee's pocket, or a dollar \nless used to develop new products.\n  In closing, let me return to the letter from the plant manager in \nLaurinburg, NC. This is a small business pleading for fairness and for \nan opportunity to compete fairly for business. If this plant, and the \nother 99 small businesses who've written me, are to prosper, they \ncannot afford to defend unwarranted claims every time they turn around.\n  We cannot continue to tie the hands of small businesses by forcing \nthem to defend case after case in a legal system that is unfair, \ninconsistent, and unpredictable. The pending bill does nothing to \nimpede an injured person's right to recover reasonable damages for his \nor her injuries. Nor does the bill favor any particular industry. It \nsimply weeds out frivolous and unwise lawsuits, making it easier and \nfor injured individuals to obtain the recovery they deserve.\n        product liability--states' rights and one-way preemption\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss one of the \nmore interesting--and most distressing--components of S. 565, the so-\ncalled Product Liability Fairness Act. That, Mr. President, is the \nconscious and flagrant expropriation of the rights of the State and \nlocal governments to fashion their own civil justice systems.\n  Over and over in the early months of the 104th Congress we have heard \nthe distinguished majority leader announce his intent to ``dust off the \n10th amendment''. That amendment, part of the Bill of Rights and \nsometimes thought of as the forgotten child of the Bill of Rights, \nstates that:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Well, here is a power that has been reserved by the States for over \n200 years. And I cannot help but note the hypocrisy present here. We \nhave heard the thunderous voices of States rights advocates, railing \nagainst Washington bureaucrats and proclaiming that this new Congress \nis committed to the proposition of shifting control of policies from \nWashington back to the States.\n  But then many of the same advocates of States rights also support \nlegislation such as this that is designed to seize control over a \npolicy area that has been the domain of the States since our Nation's \nfounding and turn it over to 535 Members of the Congress.\n  Make no mistake about it: Under this legislation, we are going to \ntell the States--even in instances where there is no Federal \njurisdiction over a tort case--the parameters within which they are to \nconduct their judicial proceedings.\n  That means that if a consumer in Sheboygan sues a manufacturer in \nGreen Bay, they will have to litigate under Federal standards, such as \na Federal cap on punitive damages, even though this is a completely \nintrastate judicial question.\n  There is also a provision that states that a decision of a U.S. \ncircuit court of appeals interpreting the provisions of this \nlegislation shall be controlling precedent to be followed by each and \nevery Federal and State court within that circuit unless overruled or \nmodified by the Supreme Court.\n  This provision was denounced by Stanley Feldman, chief justice of the \nArizona State Supreme Court in his testimony to the Senate Commerce \nCommittee on April 3 on behalf of the conference of chief justices. \nChief Justice Feldman said that:\n\n       . . . This provision will be the first time in the history \n     of America that any Federal court has been given the \n     authority to decide a question of State law, a subject which \n     raises the chills on the back of every member of the \n     conference of chief justices.\n\n  What happened to the commitment of those on the other side of the \naisle to return power back to the State governments? What happened to \nall of those criticisms we heard of health care reform and other \ninitiatives last year where the other side derided the one-size-fits-\nall approach to solving problems?\n  When I made my opening statements on this bill I mentioned a \nstatement made by the Speaker of the House in his address to the Nation \non April 7 about the intent of the congressional Republicans in the \n104th Congress. The Speaker stated that:\n\n       We must restore freedom by ending bureaucratic \n     micromanagement here in Washington . . . This country is too \n     big and too diverse for Washington to have the knowledge to \n     make the right decision on local matters; we've got to return \n     power back to you--to your families, your neighborhoods, your \n     local and State governments.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't say this very often, but when the Speaker of \nthe House says: ``This country is too big and too diverse for \nWashington to have the knowledge to make the right decision on local \nmatters,'' I tend to agree with him.\n  That is precisely why I opposed last year's crime bill. Enforcement \nof our criminal laws is best left in the hands of our local police and \nsheriffs' departments, because what works and is needed in the inner \ncity of Milwaukee is not necessarily what works and is needed in the \nrural confines of Rusk County. It is problematic enough for a Senator \nfrom Wisconsin to understand these regional distinctions, but to \nsuggest that 524 Members of Congress from 49 other States will know how \nto address the idiosyncrasies of fighting crime in Onalaska, WI, seems \na bit farfetched to me.\n  This same principle holds true for our tort systems. Maybe one of our \nrural farming States has purposely fashioned their legal system so as \nto protect farmers from defective machinery that is commonplace in that \nState. Maybe another State that attracts large numbers of retired \npersons has used the availability of punitive damages to deter certain \nproducts from being sold that are unsafe and would disproportionately \naffect the elderly.\n  The other side talks a good game when it is expressed over and over \nagain that State legislatures and governments are best equipped to \nsolve problems that are local in nature. But whether it is crime \nlegislation, or civil justice reform, or even term limits, there is a \nclear assumption that local or private decisions are best made by those \nin Washington, DC.\n  I served in the Wisconsin State Senate for over 10 years and I know \nhow the various State legislatures around the country would react to \nthis bill. In fact, the national conference of State legislatures \nstrongly opposes the Product Liability Fairness Act. In a letter sent \nto all Members of this body, the conference states:\n\n       State civil justice systems are expressions of local values \n     and needs, as the Founders intended when they established our \n     system of Constitutional federalism. National product \n     liability standards put at risk this fundamental expression \n     of self-government and federalism.\n       Moreover, the confusion resulting from superimposing a one-\n     size-fits-all Federal standard for product liability over \n     existing State tort law presents a risk to the efficient \n     administration of justice in State courts.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is abundantly clear that the notion of \nStates' rights is about to go right out the window as we usurp over 200 \nyears of State control over their tort systems. Another organization \ncomprised of those who are involved in local judicial systems is the \nconference of State chief justices. Let me quote from a statement \nsubmitted by the chief justices expressing their opposition to Federal \nproduct liability legislation. They say;\n\n       The negative consequences of S. 565 for federalism are \n     incalculable. With the proposed legislation reaching so far \n     into substantive civil law, States will be forced to provide \n     the judicial structure, but will not be permitted to decide \n     the social and economic questions in the law that their \n     courts administer. Enactment of S. 565 would alter, in one \n     stroke, the fundamental principles of federalism inherent in \n     this country's tort law. . . .\n       S. 565 is a radical departure from our current legal regime \n     and is neither justified by experience nor wise as a matter \n     of policy.\n\n  So I think it is clear what a dramatic and radical arrogation of \npower this legislation represents. But even if you\n accept this notion that we should have Federal standards with regard \nto product liability actions--and I don't--but even if you do believe \nsuch standards are necessary, this legislation is light-years away from \nbringing any sense of uniformity to our civil justice system.\n\n  The supporters of this legislation have made it clear that they \nbelieve Federal uniform standards for our product liability laws are \nwarranted, \n [[Page S6396]] presumably to address the supposed uncertainty and \nunpredictability of our legal system.\n  Those of us on the other side disagree. We believe the system was \ndesigned to protect innocent consumers who have been injured by \ndefective products, and more importantly, we are reluctant to usurp the \nauthority of the States over an area that for 200 years has been the \ndomain of the State legislatures.\n  As I stated earlier, many of us are also bewildered as to why some \nwould make changes to the legal system that are opposed by the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the Conference of Chief Justices, the \nAmerican Bar Association and law professors throughout the country.\n  But I think it is important to point out the great fallacy in the \nnotion that this bill provides uniform Federal standards. It clearly \ndoes not. What it does provide, is a line in the sand. This bill says \nthat State laws and State reforms that are designed to protect \nconsumers, children, working people, and the elderly are no longer \napplicable.\n  It says that those States do not know how to protect consumers--we \nhere in Washington, DC know best how to do that. If you are on that \nside of the line in the sand, well sorry but you are out of luck \nbecause apparently it is the Congress that knows best how to protect \nfarmers in Iowa, factory workers in Michigan, and children in \nCalifornia.\n  But if you are on the other side of that line, if there are State \nlaws or State reforms that are designed to protect the interests of the \nbusiness and manufacturing communities, well those are OK. This bill \nsays that those State legislatures know exactly what they are doing and \nwe should not preempt any of their efforts.\n  These are uniform Federal standards? Let me raise a couple of \nexamples to illustrate just how unfair and unbalanced the bill is in \nthis regard. The punitive damage cap is an obvious example. The \nunderlying bill calls for a cap on punitive damages equal to the \ngreater of two times compensatory damages of $250,000. In addition, \nunder certain circumstances a judge may award supplementary punitive \ndamages above the amount the jury has rewarded.\n  I think the layperson would look at this provision and assume that \nthis cap--a Federal cap of $250,000 or two times compensatory damages--\nwould apply across the board. In other words, whether you were injured \nby a defective product in Wisconsin, New York, or Mississippi and filed \nsuit in any of those State courts, a jury would be able to award \npunitive damages of up to $250,000 or two times compensatory damages.\n  Unfortunately, especially for those who support uniformity, that is \nnot what this legislation would do. Under the now-amended bill, the \npunitive damage cap would not preempt, supersede, or alter any State \nlaw to the extent that such law would further limit the availability or \namount of punitive damages. Those State laws would not be preempted.\n  In other words, if a State allowed unlimited punitive damages, or \neven had a cap but that cap was higher than this new Federal cap, that \nState law would be preempted by this legislation.\n  But if a State prohibited punitive damage awards, or had a cap lower \nthan the cap in the underlying bill, that State law is hailed as \nresponsible and fair and allowed to continue under this legislation.\n  I wonder if any of my colleagues are familiar with the ``Slip 'n \nSlide'' case we had in Wisconsin just a few short years ago. The Slip \n'n Slide is a sort of water slide that is spread out over the ground. \nYou are supposed to get a good running start, jump head first on the \nwet plastic and then slide along the rest of the wet plastic. It was a \nproduct that was manufactured for families and obviously, targeted \nespecially for children.\n  The plaintiff in this case, a 35-year-old father of two, dove onto \nthis water slide, struck his chin on the ground and broke his neck. He \nwas rendered an incomplete quadriplegic. The plaintiff was unable to\n return to his $12,000 a year job and had no means to pay the $46,000 \nin medical bills he was saddled with.\n\n  During the trial, the plaintiff alleged that the product was \nunreasonably dangerous for its intended purpose. This was compounded by \nthe fact that the water slide's warnings were inadequate because they \nwere not prominently displayed among the product's list of instructions \nand warnings.\n  Testimony was presented showing that other users had experienced \nsimilar injuries and one individual had even died from such an \naccident. It was also made clear that the manufacturer continued to \nmarket the product even after it was made aware that numerous neck \ninjuries such as this were occurring.\n  Let me say that again; the facts showed that the manufacturer knew \nthe product was causing neck injuries and yet still continued to market \nthe product.\n  The jury in this case, in a Wisconsin State court, found that the \nmanufacturer was 100 percent at fault and awarded over $12 million to \nthe plaintiff, including $10 million in punitive damages. This judgment \nwas later reduced so that the plaintiff and his family in the end \nreceived about $5 million.\n  We know what the other side's response to this is; ``$10 million? \nThat jury must be out of control.''\n  Some of us, however, have faith in the ability of the American people \nto serve on juries and administer justice in a fair and equitable \nmanner.\n  You can bet, Mr. President, that the manufacturer of the Slip 'n \nSlide is thrilled about this legislation. Those on the other side want \nto insulate such companies from juries and the threat of extensive \npunitive damages. Why? Because such a large punitive damage award might \nforce the manufacturer to take a product off the market that has been \nconsiderably profitable for that manufacturer.\n  But I would contend, Mr. President, that our civil justice system is \ndesigned to do just that--to sanction parties that knowingly market a \ndefective product and to protect the consumers that are victimized by \nthese products.\n  That Wisconsin jury awarded a large punitive damage award for two \nreasons: One, to get a dangerous product off the market that is often \nused by young children and that was causing numerous neck injuries and \nparalysis; and second, to punish the manufacturer for continuing to \nmarket the product with knowledge of its very serious defects and to \ndeter other manufacturers from engaging in similar conduct.\n  I would say that in this case, the jury--in a State court--knew \nexactly what it was doing and justice was served.\n  Mr. President, the Wisconsin jury in this case awarded $10 million in \npunitive damages in the slip 'n slide case. I have no doubt that most \nof the proponents of this bill believe that this is a classic case of a \njury run amok.\n  Here is what I find interesting though. That jury found the \nmanufacturer in this case 100 percent at fault. Suppose this was a \ncriminal defendant on trial for assault with a deadly weapon. After \nall, the manufacturer in this case was marketing a product that they \nknew was causing neck injuries and paralysis.\n  The fact is, if this had been a criminal defendant I have no doubt \nthat there would have been a bidding war on the other side to see who \ncould propose the stiffest criminal sentence for this defendant.\n  We can only speculate about what the fate of the Slip 'n Slide would \nhave been had this accident and litigation occurred in a State that \ncurrently prohibits punitive damage awards. Most likely, more neck \ninjuries and maybe some fatalities would have occurred until a suit had \nbeen filed in a court where punitive damages were permitted.\n  Had the underlying bill been in effect 4 years ago, that Wisconsin \njury would have had to award an amount consistent with the arbitrary \ncap. One can only wonder if the manufacturer would have pulled this \ndangerous product because of a $250,000 slap on the wrist.\n  Let me say this one more time: The jury in this case--a State jury--\nfound the manufacturer to be 100 percent at fault. The jury found that \nthe manufacturer continued to market the product--a product targeted \nmostly at children--even after the manufacturer discovered that the \nproduct was causing numerous neck injuries and paralysis.\n  The jury elected to award substantial punitive damages to punish the \nmanufacturer for this reprehensible behavior \n [[Page S6397]] and to deter other manufacturers from engaging in \nsimilar conduct.\n  I say to my colleagues that this is exactly what our civil justice \nsystem, grounded in the principle of trial by jury, was designed to do \nand I am confounded as to why the supporters of this bill are unwilling \nto trust those Americans that meet their civil duties by serving on \njuries.\n  How troubling that at a time when Americans are so distrustful of \ntheir Government that we in Government are not willing to trust \nAmericans to administer civil justice.\n  Mr. President, I am somewhat mystified as to how supporters of this \nbill can suggest that this bill is proconsumer when they want to place \nthis kind of a straightjacket on juries. In addition, I find it \nabsolutely ludicrous that the supporters of this bill would suggest \nthat we are providing uniformity when we are going to have completely \ndifferent punitive damage standards throughout the 50 States.\n  Let me provide another example of how this bill would pre-empt State \nlaws to the extent that those laws are proconsumer.\n  S. 565 creates a new Federal standard for the number of years a \nmanufacturer or product seller can be held liable for a harm caused by \na particular product. Known as a statute of repose, that period is 20 \nyears under this bill. Why 20 years? Good question.\n  The product liability legislation considered in the last Congress, \nwritten by the same two principal authors, contained a 25-year statute \nof repose--5 years longer. Why? Well a footnote in the committee report \nfrom last year justified 25 years by pointing out that according to \ntestimony received by the Commerce Committee, and I quote,\n\n       Thirty percent of the lawsuits brought against machine tool \n     manufacturers involve machines that over 25 years old.\n\n  Therefore, presumably, the authors of this bill selected 25 years as \nthe life expectancy of all products manufactured in the United States.\n  But now we have a new bill that the supporters have tried to \ncharacterize as much more moderate and much narrower than either the \nHouse-passed legal reform legislation or the product liability bill \nconsidered by the Senate just last year. But remarkably, the 25-year \nstatute of repose has been dropped to 20 years.\n  Why? Once again, good question. This year's committee report \nconspicuously leave out that footnote about the machine\n tool testimony, and makes absolutely no mention whatsoever as to why \n20 years was selected.\n\n  Instead, the committee report promotes the consistency of this \nstatute of repose with the General Aircraft Revitalization Act of 1994, \npassed by this body last year. Mr. President, I voted for that \nlegislation. But that legislation provided an 18 year statute of repose \nfor a very narrow segment of our manufacturing base.\n  This body came to the conclusion, the overwhelming conclusion as I \nrecall that vote, that 18 years was a reasonable length of time for \nliability claims associated with the general aviation aircraft.\n  This statute of repose, however, is entirely different. His 20-year \nperiod would apply to all durable products across the board with a few \nlimited exceptions. Machine tools, farm equipment, football helmets--\nyou name it. This Congress is going to decide that the life expectancy \nof virtually every product in America is 20 years.\n  But this takes us back to the issue of selective preemption of State \nauthority over liability laws. Section 108(B)(2) reads;\n\n       . . . If pursuant to an applicable State law, an action \n     described in such paragraph is required to be filed during a \n     period that is shorter than the 20-year period that is \n     shorter than the 20-year period specified in such paragraph, \n     the State law shall apply with respect to such period.\n\n  In other words, if a state legislature has decided against having a \nstatute of repose, or has decided on a statute that is longer than 20 \nyears, this new Federal law will override the judgment of that State \nlegislature. Again, so much for uniform Federal standards.\n  Ironically, this year's committee report also justifies a Federal \nstatute of repose on the basis that Japan is poised to enact a short \n10-year statute of repose. So now apparently the Japanese Government \nknows better than the State of Wisconsin how to properly administer \ncivil justice in cases involving Wisconsin litigants. I wonder how the \nFramers of the Constitution would feel about that assertion.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, Mr. President, I would like to remind \nmy colleagues of the giant precedent we are about to set, or the \nradical departure from our current system as the Chief Justices put it. \nThis legislation would make dramatic alterations to some of the oldest \nand most fundamental underlying principles of our judicial system.\n  Product liability is just a first step--the majority has made their \nintention clear to pursue legislation that would overhaul our entire \ncivil justice system.\n  As we make these sort of tremendously consequential decisions, there \nare a variety of groups and individuals we can seek advice from. Those \nof us that oppose this legislation have chosen to listen to the experts \non this issue--whether it is Chief Justices, the American Bar \nAssociation or the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  But those who support this legislation do not want to listen to State \nlegislators, judges or even the consumer organizations that this bill \npurports to protect. Instead, the other side has chosen to listen to \nthe advice of corporate America on how to best to shield those who \nmanufacture and sell defective products from any sort of liability. \nThat is unfortunate for all of us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the efforts of \nmy colleagues today to reform our system of products liability \nlitigation. The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], the Senator from \nUtah [Mr. Hatch], and the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] \ndeserve a lot of credit for putting together a bipartisan approach to \nsolving the problems associated with products liability.\n  I have watched this debate over the past 2 weeks with great interest. \nI was pleased to see that there was some interest in expanding this \nbill in order to achieve general across-the-board legal reform, and I \nsupported many of the thoughtful amendments which were brought to the \nfloor. I would have preferred to include the rule 11 amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator From Colorado [Mr. Brown] and the \namendment on joint and several liability offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] in any bill we might eventually \npass. But I realize that in the interest of compromise, changes had to \nbe made in order to get something passed, and unfortunately that \ncompromise will not include comprehensive legal reform.\n  I am no stranger to legal reform. I have been trying to fix our \nbroken securities class action system for several years, and many of \nthe problems associated with securities litigation are inherent to our \ngeneral tort system. I also have introduced legislation in past years \nto fix some of the problems associated with medical malpractice.\n  I am disappointed that we will not address medical malpractice \nlitigation reform in this bill. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell] and the chairperson of the Labor Committee, the \ngentlewoman from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], did a fine job putting \ntogether a comprehensive and fair overhaul of our medical malpractice \nsystem. There were several provisions in the medical malpractice \namendment which I included in my health care reform bill last Congress, \nand I believe that the amendment would have gone a long way toward \nreducing health care costs for all American citizens. For that reason, \nI hope that we will take up medical malpractice reform later on in this \nCongress.\n  Particularly, I would like to address collateral source reform, which \nwould prevent duplicative payments by insurance companies for the same \ninjuries. I heard just last week from an individual who works for a \ncompany that sells insurance in my home State of New Mexico. He told me \nabout a case that he just handled where a claimant was paid five \ndifferent ways for the same injury. He told me that four ways was \ncommon, but that this was his first five-way case. He told me that if \nwe want to achieve significant reform, preventing \n [[Page S6398]] this sort of duplicative payment and the litigation \nthat goes along with it will substantially strengthen our system. I \nhope we will continue to pursue collateral source reform later this \nyear.\n  I also had hoped that we would be able to include general rule 11 \nreform in this bill and the Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, \nshould be commended for bringing his important amendment to the floor. \nPrior to 1993, courts were required to sanction attorneys who filed a \nfrivolous complaint, and rule 11 served as a healthy deterrent to \nstrike suits. However, rule 11 was weakened in 1993 and judges were \ngiven the discretion to impose sanctions even when they found that a \ncomplaint truly was frivolous. Senator Brown's amendment would return \nus to the pre-1993 standard and adopt a preference for the sanction to \nbe payment of the attorneys fees and costs of the opposing party.\n  It also would limit fishing expedition lawsuits by requiring \nattorneys to make an adequate inquiry into the facts prior to the \nfiling of a complaint. Attorneys should be required to stop, think and \ninvestigate the facts before filing lawsuits which could have a \npotentially devastating effect, and Senator Brown's amendment would \nhave done just that. I believe that this issue also should be re-\nvisited later in the year.\n  As for products liability, there can be no doubt that the current \nsystem in place in this country extracts tremendous costs from the \nbusiness community and from consumers. The great expense associated \nwith products liability lawsuits drives up the cost of producing and \nselling goods, and these costs are passed on to the American consumer. \nWe have heard several Senators talk about how half of the cost of a \n$200 football helmet is associated with products liability litigation, \nand how $8 out of the cost of a $12 vaccine goes to products liability \ncosts. We can no longer afford to require our consumers to pay this \ntort tax.\n  Because of the high costs associated with products liability \nlitigation, American companies often find it difficult to obtain \nliability insurance. The insurance industry has estimated that the \ncurrent cost to business and consumers of the U.S. tort system is over \n$100 billion. Insurance costs in the United States are 15 to 20 times \ngreater than those of our competitors in Europe and Japan. Much of this \nmoney ends up in the pockets of lawyers, who exploit the system and \nreap huge fee awards while plaintiffs go undercompensated and our \nbusinesses suffer.\n  For companies involved in the manufacture of certain products, like \nmachine tools, medical devices, and vaccines, this means that \nbeneficial products go undeveloped, or after they are developed, they \ndo not make it to the marketplace out of fear of being sued. This \nhampers our competitiveness abroad, and limits the products available \nto consumers. Harvard Business School Prof. Michael Porter has written \nabout how products liability affects American competitiveness. He \nwrote:\n\n       In the United States * * * product liability is so extreme \n     and uncertain as to retard innovation. The legal and \n     regulatory climate places firms in constant jeopardy of \n     costly, and, as importantly, lengthy product liability suits. \n     The existing approach goes beyond any reasonable need to \n     protect consumers, as other nations have demonstrated through \n     more pragmatic approaches.\n\n  In the case of manufacturers of vaccines and other medical devices, \nthe cost of our unreasonable and certainly unpragmatic products \nliability litigation system often means that potentially life-saving \ninnovations never make it to the American public. Products liability \nadds $3,000 to the cost of a pacemaker, and $170 to the cost of a \nmotorized wheelchair. It also has caused the DuPont Co. to cease \nmanufacturing the polyester yarn used in heart surgery out of fears of \nproducts liability litigation. Five cents worth of yarn cost them $5 \nmillion to defend a case, and DuPont decided that they simply could not \nafford further litigation costs. Now, foreign companies manufacture the \nyarn and will not sell it in the United States out of fear of also \nbeing sued.\n  In cases where a truly defective product has injured an individual, \nthe litigation process is too slow, too costly, and too unpredictable. \nThis bill, because it creates a Federal system of products liability \nlaw, will return some certainty to a system that now often \nundercompensates those really injured by defective products and \novercompensates those with frivolous claims.\n  Those injured by defective products often must wait 4 to 5 years to \nreceive compensation. This leads victims to settle more quickly in \norder to receive relief within a reasonable time. Companies must expend \nhuge amounts of money in legal fees to settle or litigate these long, \ncomplicated cases. These again are resources that could be better spent \ndeveloping new products or improving the designs of existing ones.\n  Another major problem with our tort system is with punitive damages. \nAs their name implies, punitive damages are designed to punish \ncompanies and deter future wrongful conduct. They are assessed in these \ncases in addition to the actual damages suffered by injured victims.\n  Unfortunately, these damages have little effect except to line the \npockets of lawyers. They serve relatively little deterent purpose and \nled former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell to describe them as \ninviting ``punishment so arbitrary as to be virtually random.'' Because \njuries can impose virtually limitless punitive damages, in Justice \nPowell's words, they act as ``legislator and judge, without the \ntraining, experience, or guidance of either.'' Justice Powell is \nabsolutely correct, and I applaud the drafters of this bill for dealing \nwith the problems associated with these types of damages.\n  Reform of punitive damages will return some common sense to the \nsystem. Under the current system, punitive damages do little to deter \nwrongful conduct and merely serve to line the pockets of contingency \nfee lawyers. Huge punitive damage awards also threaten to wipe out \nsmall businesses and charitable organizations. By limiting the amount \nof punitive damages available in these cases and raising the legal \nthreshold for an award of punitive damages, this bill will relieve some \nof the pressure on even the most innocent defendant to settle or face \nan award which could potentially bankrupt the company. It also will \nprovide some uniformity and certainty in States which still allow \npunitives. Finally, for those States which do not allow punitive \ndamages, I think the bill makes it clear that they may continue to do \nso.\n  The drafters of this bill also have taken the wise step to reform \njoint liability, without limiting the ability of plaintiffs to recover \ntheir economic damages. The bill abolishes joint liability for \nnoneconomic damages, like pain and suffering, but allows States to \nretain it for economic damages like hospital bills. This will reduce \nthe pressure on defendants who are only nominally responsible for the \ninjury to settle the case or risk huge liability out of proportion to \ntheir degree of fault, while ensuring that injured victims get \ncompensated for their out-of-pocket loss.\n  I would have liked to see this extended across the board to all civil \ncases and I voted for the Abraham amendment, but at least in the area \nof products liability, this provision strikes a fair balance between \nthe rights of injured plaintiffs and those of those defendants brought \ninto cases merely because of their deep pocket.\n  The bill also limits liability in cases where the victim altered or \nmisused the allegedly defective product in an unforeseeable way. It \nsimply is unfair to hold manufacturers liable in cases where consumers \nuse products in ways for which they were not intended. It also is \nunfair to hold defendants liable in cases where the plaintiff's use of \nalcohol or drugs significantly contributed to their injury. I am happy \nto see that this bill provides an absolute defense in such cases.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, I am no stranger to legal reform. \nMany of those who are responsible for this important and well-crafted \nlegislation are cosponsors of the securities reform bill Senator Dodd \nand I hope to bring to the floor soon after this bill. I hope that we \ncan follow our colleagues in the House and enact comprehensive but fair \nlegal reform in the 104th Congress. I appreciate all of the hard work \nthat went into this bill and hope that we will pass it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, product liability reform is long overdue \nand I am pleased that the Senate is acting \n [[Page S6399]] favorably on this bill. I have cosponsored product \nliability reform legislation in three previous Congresses.\n  I believe that this legislation is good for both consumers and \nbusinesses. Our product liability system is out of control and reform \nis desperately needed. Under our current system manufacturers of \nproducts are subject to a patchwork of varying State laws whose \nbeneficiaries are most often lawyers instead of litigants.\n  The Congress is currently debating the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment across a broad range of issue areas. Many believe that \nfunctions now conducted at the Federal level should be moved to the \nStates. On this issue I believe that we need a more uniform system of \nproduct liability and therefore Federal standards are necessary.\n  The current system is unfair to consumers. Much too much of the money \npaid by manufacturers goes to attorneys' fees instead of the injured \nparty. the high cost of product liability insurance means higher costs \nfor consumers. Because of the unpredictability of the current system, \nmany severely injured consumers receive less than they deserve while \nmildly injured consumers often recover more. Furthermore, because of \nunpredictability, cases which are substantially similar receive very \ndifferent results. Product liability cases often require a great deal \nof time and many claimants are forced to settle because of economic \nnecessity.\n  The current system is unfair to manufacturers. The cost of litigation \nis a substantial expense to companies. Companies spend more on legal \ncosts and less on other important areas such as research and \ndevelopment. In some cases manufacturers decide not to invest in or \ndevelop new products because of product liability concerns. Ultimately \nthis burden or product liability makes our companies less competitive \nin world markets than foreign companies.\n  During the debate on this legislation, I have been particularly \nconcerned that as we reform our product liability laws we do not affect \nthe rights of individuals to bring suits when they have been harmed. On \nthe contrary, it is my intent to bring rationality to a system that has \nbecome more like a lottery. For me, legal reform does not mean putting \na padlock on the court house door.\n  There are several very important improvements that this legislation \nwill provide. A statute of repose of 20 years is established for \ndurable goods in the workplace. After 20\n years no suit may be brought unless there is an expressed warranty.\n\n  Joint liability is abolished for noneconomic damages in product \nliability cases. Defendants are liable only in direct proportion to \ntheir responsibility for harm. Therefore, fault will be the controlling \nfactor in the award of damages, not the size of a defendant's wallet.\n  Another important area is punitive damages. I am supportive of \nraising the standard of proof to clear and convincing evidence. I am \nvery concerned, however, about the establishment of caps on punitive \ndamages and that the bill not impose a one size fits all prescription. \nIn fact this is the issue that kept me from cosponsoring this \nlegislation during this Congress. The bill originally provided for a \nproportional cap based on economic damages. During the amending \nprocess, that cap was improved by including all compensatory damages. \nEven with that improvement, however, the bill remained too restrictive. \nI support the further inclusion of the judge additur provision allowing \nan increase in punitive damage awards in especially egregious cases.\n  However, I believe that an additional provision in the additur \nsection is without merit. That provision would allow a defendant \nanother trial on damages should additur occur. This goes against the \nfundamental principles behind product liability reform--fairness, \nsimplification and streamlining the system. Instead, this provision \ncould provide a never ending litigation cycle which will insure full \nemployment for all lawyers. And it increases the burden on an already \noverburdened legal system. This one provision is so egregious, that it \nprompted my vote against cloture on the Gorton-Rockefeller compromise \nwhich I found otherwise acceptable. I am pleased that Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton intend to address this language in conference.\n  Unfortunately, the product liability legislation this year turned \ninto a Christmas tree attracting numerous unrelated items that had \nnever been in the bill before. The expansion of the legislation to \ninclude medical malpractice and general civil liability litigation, as \nSenator Rockefeller has accurately pointed out, caused the tree to \ntopple over. Those matters should and will be addressed more completely \nin separate legislation.\n  During the debate, the Senate considered several amendments \naddressing medical malpractice. I believe action is needed to ensure \ntimely and appropriate awards for patients who are harmed by negligent \nmedical care, while at the same time protecting health care providers \nfrom unwarranted lawsuits and the need to practice costly defensive \nmedicine.\n  I supported a medical malpractice amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy which was based on provisions contained in comprehensive health \ncare reform legislation in the last Congress. This approach requires \nStates to establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms so that \ncases can get an early hearing, and it limits attorney's contingency \nfees to one-third of the first $150,000 awarded and 25 percent \nthereafter. I regret that this amendment, which would have modified \nSenator McConnell's medical malpractice amendment, was defeated.\n  I oppose Senator McConnell's medical malpractice amendment, for both \nsubstantive and procedural reasons. I was concerned that the amendment \ndid not allow States to adopt their own medical malpractice laws if \nthey were more beneficial to consumers, and I opposed its caps on \npunitive damages.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will return to the important issue of \nmedical malpractice reform when the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nreports the bill it has approved and during debate on health care \nreform measures.\n  With the addition of medical malpractice and general civil liability, \nefforts to pass product liability bill reform were diminished. All of \nthese extraneous items have threatened passage of a good product \nliability bill and the White House has also made it clear that they \nwould veto such Christmas tree legislation.\n  In an effort to pare the bill back to its core principles, I opposed \nmotions to cut off debate on the bill. I believe that through this \nprocess, the bill now provides effective product liability reform and \nits chances of enactment are improved. I applaud the efforts of \nSenators Rockefeller and Gorton in the enormous amount of work \nundertaken to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate's debate on product liability \nreform has revealed that many citizens and many members of the business \ncommunity strongly favor legislation that would alter significant \naspects of tort law. Products liability law traditionally has been a \nmatter of State law, and the primary venue for products cases \ntraditionally has been the State courts, which are our Nation's courts \nof general jurisdiction. Proponents of the products liability \nlegislation have asked us, then, to change the laws of each State by \ncreating Federal standards that would apply in all products cases, \nwhether they are brought in Federal or State courts.\n  I oppose Federal products liability legislation because it will \npreempt whole areas of State law that have been developed incrementally \nover many, many years. The legislation does not deal with Federal \nquestion jurisdiction or any Federal cause of action. Instead, it \npertains to an area of law that has long been the primary \nresponsibility of State courts. If it is to occur, the reinvention of \ntort law should occur through the State courts and legislatures, which \nare best situated to determine and control the impact of reform within \ntheir own communities.\n  We are not dealing in an area where the States have proven incapable \nof enacting change. The vast majority of States have already adopted \nsome type of tort reform, and many States are considering further \nchanges. These reform measures have varied widely. Some have involved \nmore dramatic changes than the Senate has debated; some have involved \nmore modest \n [[Page S6400]] changes; and some have involved referendums on \nimportant Sate constitutional provisions. In my own State of Delaware, \nthe State legislature has before it several different tort reform \nproposals.\n  The impact of the reforms passed so far at the State level is \nunclear, but at least by one measure, the State reforms appear to be \nhaving a positive effect. In a recent survey involving 1993 data, \nAmerican businesses for the first time in many years reported that they \nspent less on insurance and other risk-related expenses than they did \nthe year before. Much of the savings came from changes enacted by \nStates to their workers compensation laws, which have enabled employers \nto contain their workers compensation costs in various ways. The survey \nreported that the cost businesses paid for liability risks, which \nincludes products liability, had leveled out. This is encouraging news.\n  The patchwork course of tort reform at the State level has not \nhappened with the alacrity or the uniformity that many reform \nproponents would like to see. But the State efforts demonstrate why \nFederal legislation in this area is so profoundly misguided. In the \nbest tradition of our Federal form of Government, the States have \nbalanced, and in many instances are still considering how to balance, \nthe competing interests in the tort reform debate for their own \ncommunities. We stand poised to upend that State-based process in favor \nof legislation that purports to create uniform Federal standards. In \ndoing so, we are involving the Federal Government intimately in an area \nwhere it does not belong.\n  The Supreme Court's recent ruling in United States versus Lopez, the \ncase which struck down as unconstitutional the Federal Gun Free School \nZones Act, raises a serious question as to whether the Federal \nGovernment is permitted to take over the law of products liability.\n  I oppose the products liability legislation not because of any \nspecific provisions being debated, but because the federalization of \nthis area of the law is a bad idea. Federalizing products liability law \nembarks us, I fear, on a course where over the years Congress will \nsuccumb to a creeping temptation to federalize other areas of State law \nsolely, as in this case, on the grounds of convenience. I am wary of \nwhere that course leads.\n  (At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the following statement was \nordered to be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, due to the death of a close \nfamily member, I am regrettably unable to be present on the Senate \nfloor today to join my colleagues in passing product liability \nlegislation. It is day long awaited by those of us who have been \nworking on behalf of reform for years only to be denied, not only \npassage of a bill, but full and open debate. I was proud to be a \ncosponsor of past product liability bills, including this year's bill, \nS. 565.\n  Credit for this remarkable turn of events is due to Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton, who have labored long and hard on the Senate \nfloor over the last 2 weeks and, quite literally, for years to produce \na fair bill. It is their perseverance and fair treatment of all that is \nresponsible for our success today. Their staffs have done extraordinary \nwork on their behalf and deserve all of our thanks--Tamera Stanton, \nEllen Doneski, Lance Bultena, Trent Erickson, and others.\n  Were I present today, I would have voted to table Harkin amendment \nNo. 749, to table Dorgan amendment No. 629 and, of course, I would have \nenthusiastically voted ``yes'' for final passage.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor of the bill as passed by the Senate today. This is an \nimportant first step toward comprehensive reform of our legal system. \nIt is incremental reform, but it's significance should be understated. \nIt establishes some important principles for further reform: parties \nresponsible for harm must be held fully accountable and parties who \nhave caused no harm should not be bullied into settlements by a system \nthat does more to compensate lawyers than to achieve justice for \ninjured people.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as we conclude the debate over S. 565, \nthe Product Liability Fairness Act, we have come full circle.\n\n\n                            committee action\n\n  On March 15 I joined with Senators Gorton and Rockefeller in \nintroducing legislation designed to reform that portion of America's \ntort system dealing with products liability. Two days of hearings were \nconducted on the bill and on April 6 the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, of which I am chairman, met in executive \nsession to consider the legislation.\n  During the committee process there was talk of expanding the bill to \nencompass a broader array of tort reform. As chairman, I resisted \nefforts to expand the legislation into any areas that did not fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. Do not get me wrong. \nI support more broad-based tort reform. My voting record over the past \n2 weeks proves that fact. However, during committee consideration I \nbelieved it was important not to add provisions that fall under the \nprovince of other Senate committees. As a result, on April 6 the \nCommerce Committee voted 13 to 6 to send a products liability reform \nbill to the full Senate.\n\n\n                          senate consideration\n\n  On April 24 the full Senate took up the measure. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks the legislation has consumed some 90 hours of Senate debate. It \nhas been a constructive process. No one can say this body did not fully \nexplore the issues involved. No one can say we blocked any attempts to \nmake changes to the legislation. Indeed, it was those--like myself--who \nfavored a broader bill that found themselves blocked.\n  Since April 24, we have debated and voted upon over 30 amendments. \nRoughly a dozen of those dealt with reforming the medical malpractice \nsystem. Senator McConnell introduced a broad\n reform amendment similar to legislation that had been fully debated by \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources. That major amendment, \ntogether with a number of smaller malpractice reform measures passed \nthe Senate and became part of the bill. I was proud to support these \nefforts and voted for many of the malpractice initiatives.\n\n  Next the Senate turned its attention toward broadening reforms \nconcerning punitive damages. By considering some half dozen punitive \ndamages amendments and adopting several--including major provisions \noffered by Senators Dole and Hatch, by Senator Snowe and by Senator \nDeWine--a majority of the Senate worked its will to expand the reform \nof punitive damage awards from product liability cases to include all \ncivil cases. Again I supported these efforts and worked for their \npassage.\n  Finally, the Senate turned to a consideration of joint and several \nliability. S. 565 as reported contained a provision abolishing joint \nliability for noneconomic damages. As to these damages, defendants \nwould be liable only in direct proportion to their responsibility for \nthe claimant's harm. They would not be responsible for the harm caused \nby another defendant who later was found unable to pay the compensation \nawarded. In other words, with regard to noneconomic damages, a \ndefendant's liability would be several and not joint. Senator Abraham \noffered an amendment on the floor to extend this concept to all civil \ncases. Unfortunately, that amendment was tabled.\n  Mr. President, these actions brought us to Thursday of last week. \nThey also put a majority of the Senate on record in favor of broad-\nbased legal reform. Most importantly, our efforts produced a fair, \nreasonable, and balanced bill.\n  Sadly, our efforts were not enough. Last Thursday the Senate failed \nin two votes to end debate, allow a vote on final passage of the bill, \nand move to a conference with the House of Representatives to work out \nthe difference between our bill and the much more sweeping legislation \npassed by the House earlier this year.\n  As a result, Senate leadership crafted an alternative bill. That \nmeasure, introduced Friday as a substitute to the pending legislation, \nreturned the reform initiative to its Commerce Committee roots. That \nproposal, along with the amendment we are debating today, is very \nsimilar to S. 565 as reported by the Commerce Committee.\n  How did this happen? Quite simply the opponents of broad-based tort \nreform were highly effective in their \n [[Page S6401]] campaign against the legislation. Like much of the \ndebate over the issue of civil justice reform, the rhetoric tended to \nget very emotional and often strayed off course.\n\n\n                        the truth about the bill\n\n  Mr. President, the truth is this legislation would not change any of \nwhat is right with our current legal system. The courthouse doors would \nremain open. Consumers would still have a full range of rights. Persons \nwrongfully injured still would be compensated. Tort cases could be used \nto provide a strong check on corporate behavior. Contingent fees would \ncontinue to allow ordinary citizens with limited means the ability to \nbring suit. What would change is that frivolous lawsuits would be \ncurtailed--pure and simple.\n  In an earlier statement I outlined how the bill's provisions \nconcerning punitive damages, the statutes of limitations and repose, \njoint and several liability, defenses for alcohol and drug abuse, and \nbiomaterial suppliers would benefit small business, consumers, and \nthose injured by products. Therefore, I will not take the Senate's time \nto reexamine those issues today. It is not necessary. Under the latest \nalternative we have before us today, the things I said in that \nstatement continue to apply.\n  I would add only a few comments concerning the views of the American \npeople--specifically the citizens of my home State of South Dakota--\nwith regard to our legal system. A recent poll conducted in my State \nfound that 83 percent of survey respondents say that ``the present \nliability system has problems and should be improved,'' while only 10 \npercent say that ``the present liability lawsuit system is working well \nand should not be changed.''\n  In addition, this is not a partisan issue: 78 percent of Democrats, \n83 percent of Independents, and 88 percent of Republicans in South \nDakota responding to the survey say there are problems that need to be \nimproved. of those who had served on a civil trial jury, 79 percent say \nthe system has problems and needs improvement.\n  Mr. President, the pending measure is not as broad as I would like. I \ntruly wish we could have done more to address the problems of the tort \nsystem generally and not limit ourselves simply to product liability \ncases. However, I am gratified the model used by the Senate for product \nliability reform continues to be the bill reported to this body by the \nCommerce Committee. It represents an excellent move forward and I \nstrongly urge all of my colleagues to vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 956, \nthe Product Liability Act of 1995.\n  I have closely followed the debate on this legislation over the past \n2 weeks and I have come to the conclusion that despite the efforts of \nmany of this Chamber, including my good friend from West Virginia, to \ncraft a balanced bill, the bill we are voting on today falls short of \nthat goal.\n  Mr. President, the issues we have debated over the course of the past \n2 weeks are complex and far reaching. Contrary to what some would have \nthe American public believe, the solutions to the problems facing our \nlegal system cannot be explained away in 30-second sound bites or by \nanecdotal evidence. Each day throughout this country, judges and juries \nstruggle to determine what is meant by justice, and, I believe in the \nvast majority of cases, these people, our neighbors, friends, coworkers \nand family, do a remarkable job of determining what is fair and what is \njust.\n  I have supported reforms to our legal system in the past and was \nprepared to support a reasonable reform measure at the end of this \ndebate. I am a cosponsor of S. 240, the Securities Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995, authored by my colleagues from New Mexico and Connecticut. \nI have supported my own State's efforts at reform in the area of \nproduct liability and medical malpractice, and I worked with my \ncolleagues on the Labor and Human Resources Committee last year to \nfashion reasonable medical malpractice reform during the health care \nreform debate. Last week, I voted for an amendment by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, that was a reasonable approach to \nmedical malpractice reform and would have protected the rights of \nStates such as New Mexico to enact their own reform.\n  Indeed, a proposal that would have significantly improved this \nlegislation was considered by Senator Breaux. This amendment would have \ncreated a truly uniform statute of repose and addressed the concerns \nabout the elimination of joint and several liability in a reasoned and \nbalanced matter. The amendment also would have allowed a jury to \ndetermine whether or not punitive damages are warranted in a particular \ncase and would have allowed the judge to determine the amount of \npunitive damages that should be awarded. Unfortunately, Senator Breaux \ndid not have the opportunity to offer his amendment and the Senate did \nnot have the opportunity to debate it as a result of cloture being \ninvoked yesterday.\n  I have come to the conclusion that the bill that we vote on today \ntilts the scales too heavily against protection of the rights of \ninjured victims and against just punishment of dangerous practices. \nAlso, Mr. President, I am concerned about the provision limiting the \naward of punitive damages in cases filed against a small business. I \ntake a back seat to no one in my concern for small businesses and have \nworked throughout my career in the Senate to promote the growth and \nprosperity of small businesses especially in my home State. However, \nthe provision contained in this bill is not well considered; I am \nafraid that it would lead to more litigation, not less, and arbitrarily \neliminate the opportunity for injured plaintiffs to recover fair and \njust compensation for damages inflicted as a result of conscious and \nflagrant indifference to their safety. That is what we are talking \nabout Mr. President, not simply a mistake, but a conscious and flagrant \nindifference to the safety of consumers.\n  Mr. President, I would say to my friend from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, and my friend from Washington, Senator Gorton, that I \ncommend them for their efforts during this debate to bring reason to \nour deliberations. I know that they have worked diligently and in good \nfaith to develop meaningful and balanced legislation in this area. \nUnfortunately, I do not believe that the bill before us reaches those \nobjectives and for that reason I intend to vote against this bill and \nurge my colleagues to join me.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, when we talk about reforming product \nliability law, we are talking about taking away the rights of U.S. \ncitizens. This is serious business--among the most serious things we \ncan do in the Senate, and it is from this perspective that we must \napproach this debate.\n  Cloture has been invoked and we are about to vote on final passage. \nBut before we haphazardly strip citizens of their rights, we need to \ntake a long, hard look at what this means to people--how it affects \nfamilies and children and average, hard-working people who have \nsuffered.\n  Let us take a representative case. It is a wrongful death case.\n  A woman drives a Pinto to the super-market. Someone bumps into the \nrear of the car, and the car explodes--it explodes. She is tragically \nburned alive--a wife, a mother, a human being burned alive because of \nwhat, after years of legal hassling and thousands of dollars in legal \nfees, lawyers hours, and a legal battle that has become part of tort \nhistory, Ford had calculated that it was cheaper to settle than to \nprotect the lives of every Pinto owner with a recall.\n  It made good business sense to take the risk of people dying.\n  Mr. President, that kind of business sense is exactly what I am here \nto fight against.\n  I am here to fight for the husband of that woman in the Pinto. I ask \nmy colleagues--would you settle for $250,000 in exchange for losing \nyour spouse and destroying your life?\n  Is that fair? Is that just?\n  Mr. President, if this bill were to become law, you would not even \nget the $250,000 because there is not a lawyer in the country who would \ntake the case.\n  No law firm could afford to go up against the Ford Motor Co., with \nits host of attorneys and huge legal budget, and an infinite ability to \npush motions and appeals to the limit and slow down the process to \ntheir advantage. It just would not happen.\n  Mr. President, I cannot sanction stripping this legal right from even \none American. I cannot do it. And anyone who can, should look into the \neyes of \n [[Page S6402]] that husband. They should look into the face of the \nthousands and thousands of victims across this country who seek simple \njustice and fairness and ask only to be given a chance to fight the big \nguys.\n  It is a matter of fairness. It assures that those who do not have the \nresources to fight the richest and most prominent American corporations \nwhen they are wrong will have a chance for simple justice.\n  I am here to fight for average hard-working Americans and to put a \nface to this legislation--to talk about how this bill will affect real \nAmericans. Real Americans, like the 5-year-old boy in New Bedford, MA, \nwho died in a house fire after the flammable material on a couch \nignited, or the 8-month-old baby who suffered second- and third-degree \nburns on his arms, legs, and back in a house fire that started when the \nbedding in his crib was ignited by a portable electric heater.\n  Or, the eight working-class families in Woburn who sued two of our \nNation's biggest corporations because they suspected the companies had \npolluted the East Woburn water supply with highly toxic industrial \nsolvents, causing death and injury to their children.\n  The Woburn case took 9 years, and the attorney that pleaded the case \nspent $1 million of his own money on it. The jury ultimately found one \nof the companies negligent, and the scientific research done during the \n9-year trial demonstrated the link between the industrial solvents in \nthe water supply and human disease. The company is now helping to clean \nup the polluted aquifer. The attorney has said that if this bill were \nlaw today, he would never have considered the case.\n  If we pass the Dole substitute to H.R. 956, I fear we will be doing \ngreat harm. Our votes will have a serious impact on real Americans.\n  Mr. President, our laws play a critical role in fostering a \ncompetitive economic environment by establishing groundrules for fair \ncompetition and by helping to reduce the costs of doing business. But I \nbelieve Congress has a special responsibility to ensure the laws we \nwrite are reasonable and fair; we must weigh the impact of laws will \nhave on both consumers and business.\n  In the 10 years I have considered product liability reform at the \nFederal level, I have heard proponents of reform argue that consumers \nlose under the present system. They have argued that injured consumers \nreceive inadequate compensation, and that injured consumers wait \nunreasonable amounts of time in litigation--on the average of 3 years--\nbefore they receive compensation. They have also argued that injured \nconsumers face closed courthouse doors because the statutes of \nlimitation have expired on their cases.\n  Proponents of reform have stressed that companies in the United \nStates also lose under the current system. They have pointed to \ninsurance rates that disable American manufacturers by forcing them to \npay 10 to 50 times more for product liability insurance than their \nforeign competitors. They have claimed there is an explosion in \nproducts liability litigation, with uncontrollable punitive damages \nawards. They have argued that the present system of lottery liability, \nwhere liability differs from State to State, does not enhance the \nsafety of U.S. products.\n  Each time the Senate has considered products liability legislation, I \nhave measured the legislation against four tests: Is it fair to injured \nconsumers; will it help lower insurance rates for American business; \nwill it help reduce the number of tort cases and lower the cost of \nlitigation, the transaction costs, for American business; and will it \ncreate uniformity in the laws covering products liability or generate \nmore confusion in the legal system?\n  In my examination of whether S. 565, the products Liability Fairness \nAct, and the Dole substitute satisfy these tests, I have concluded that \nthis legislation fails on each account. It does not address the real \nconcerns of business, nor is it fair to consumers.\n\n\n                 is the legislation fair to consumers?\n\n  Consumer products are responsible for an estimated 29,000 deaths and \n30 million injuries each year. But, according to the most authoritative \nstudy on punitive damages, conducted in 1993 by professors at Boston's \nSuffolk University Law School and Northeastern University, there were \nonly 355 awards in products suits from 1965 to 1990, and half of these \nawards were reduced or overturned. In my own State of Massachusetts, \nthere were absolutely no punitive damages awarded in products cases.\n  Contrary to ensuring that injured consumers will receive adequate \ncompensation in relation to their actual damages, this legislation \nimposes a cap on punitive damages. This is perhaps the most damaging \naspect of this legislation to consumer interests. Although the cap has \nbeen amended to equal the sum of economic and noneconomic damages, a \ncap is still a cap.\n  In our civil justice system compensatory damages--economic and \nnoneconomic for pain and suffering--compensate victims; in addition, \npunitive damages may be awarded by juries to punish the wrongdoer.\n  As such, punitive damages are often the only way individual Americans \ncan force reckless defendants to change their conduct. However, despite \nthe effectiveness of punitive damages as deterrents, they are \nexceedingly rare.\n  And the new standards imposed for punitives in this bill will make \nthem more rare than the Alabama sturgeon.\n  Under most State laws, the defendant can be found liable for punitive \ndamages if they engaged in reckless or willful and wanton or grossly \nnegligent type of behavior.\n  But under this bill, Mr. President, such behavior is not enough. A \nplaintiff must show that a company engaged in conduct manifesting a \n``conscious, flagrant, indifference to safety''. I have no idea what \nthat means, Mr. President. but it certainly appears to be a tougher \nstandard to meet.\n  Moreover, it is unclear how the cap on punitives in this bill would \naffect the 39 States that presently either do not permit punitive \ndamage awards or have enacted measures that significantly reduce the \nsize and frequency of such awards.\n  Far from ensuring injured consumers will enjoy expeditious resolution \nof their case, this legislation could prolong litigation by allowing \neither party to request a separate hearing in order for punitive \ndamages to be awarded. Far from ensuring courthouse doors remain open \nto injured consumers, this bill imposes a 2-year statute of limitation \nand shortens the statute of repose by 5 years from last year's bill.\n  If this bill truly protects consumers interests, why is it opposed by \nevery major consumer group in America?\n  If this legislation had been in effect, many cases would simply not \nhave been possible. Let me give just one more example here:\n  In 1988, Playtex removed from the market its super-absorbent tampons \nlinked to Toxic Shock Syndrome only after a $10 million punitive \ndamages award following the death of a woman who used the tampons.\n  The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found ``Playtex deliberately \ndisregarded studies and medical reports linking high-absorbency tampons \nfibers with increased risk of toxic shock at a time when other \nmanufacturers were responding to this information by modifying or \nwithdrawing their high-absorbency tampons.''\n  Playtex subsequently strengthened its warnings and began a public \nawareness campaign about the dangers of toxic shock. It is doubtful \nwhether a cap of $250,000 on punitive damages would have caused Playtex \nto alter its behavior.\n  If the cap on punitive damages contained in this legislation is \nenacted, wrongdoers may find it more cost effective to continue their \nbad behavior and risk paying punitive damages. I do not believe we \nshould pass a bill that reduces the incentive for companies to produce \nthe safest products.\n\n\n      will this legislation lower insurance costs for businesses?\n\n  In testimony before the Commerce Committee several years ago, the \nAmerican Insurance Association stated:\n\n       The bill is likely to have little or no beneficial impact \n     on the frequency or severity of product liability claims * * \n     * And it is not likely to reduce claims or improve the \n     insurance market.\n\n  So, this legislation will not provide businesses with cheaper \ninsurance rates. Insurance premiums for most industries account for \nless than 1 percent of a business' gross receipts. Such a small \npercentage hardly threatens the \n [[Page S6403]] viability of business and should not result in \nincreased costs to consumers.\n  Over the last decade, product liability insurance cost 26 cents per \n$100 of retail product sales, which would account for $26 on the price \nof a $10,000 automobile. Since 1987, according to a study by the \nConsumer Federal of America, product liability insurance premiums have \nactually dropped by 47 percent, from $4 billion to $2.7 billion, a fact \nthat was confirmed by a 1992 Commerce Department study.\n  Let us take a look at Florida. In Florida's 1986 tort reform law, the \nState eliminated joint and several liability, limited noneconomic \ndamages to $450,000, limited punitive damages, and required the \ninsurance industry to make rate filings indicating the effect of the \nchanges in its tort laws on product liability insurance rates.\n  Yet, Aetna's subsequent rate filing listed the effect of each change \non its rates as zero. If such dramatic changes in Florida's tort reform \nlaw resulted in no lowering of liability insurance costs for a major \ncarrier like Aetna, where is the evidence to suggest this bill will \nproduce different results?\n\n\n will the legislation lower the cost of products liability litigation \n                            for businesses?\n\n  Proponents of this legislation speak in terms of an explosion in \nproduct liability litigation. However, the evidence belies this \ncharacterization. In fact, the number of nonasbestos products liability \nsuits in Federal courts has declined almost 40 percent since 1985. In \nState courts, where most products liability claims are filed, lawsuits \nhave remained constant since 1990, according to testimony presented to \nthe committee on April 3, by the National Center for State Courts.\n  The 1992 annual report of the National Center for State Courts found \nthat tort cases are approximately 9 percent of the 10 million civil \nfilings in State courts and products cases are 4 percent of these--\n40,000.\n  Only one-third of 1 percent of all tort filings in State courts are \nproduct filings.\n  Of all tort filings in 1991, 58 percent were related to automobile \nliability; 33 percent were miscellaneous; 5 percent were malpractice; \nand 4 percent were products. Since 1990, the national total of State \ntort filings has fallen by 2 percent.\n  In 1990, the Rand Corp. found that most injured Americans never file \na lawsuit for their injuries: only 10 percent of injury victims ever \nuse the tort system to seek compensation for their injuries.\n  This report also found that only 7 percent of all compensation for \naccident victims is paid through the tort system. The report observed:\n\n       Americans' behavior does not accord with the more extreme \n     characterizations of litigiousness that have been put forward \n     by some.\n\n  If there has been a litigation explosion, it is not in the area of \nproducts liability. Once again, this legislation misses the target in \naddressing the real litigation problems facing business.\n\n\n    will this legislation bring uniformity to product liability law?\n\n  Tort law has traditionally been a State responsibility, and the \nimposition of Federal products standards upon State tort law would, \naccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, ``create \nconfusion in State courts.''\n  Testimony by the Conference of Chief Justices was even more emphatic:\n\n       If the primary goal of this legislation is to provide \n     consistency and uniformity in tort litigation, we are \n     concerned that its effect will be the opposite.\n       Preempting each State's existing tort law in favor of a \n     broad Federal product liability law will create additional \n     complexities and unpredictability for tort litigation in both \n     State and Federal courts, while depriving victims of \n     defective products of carefully reasoned principles and \n     procedures already developed at the State level.\n\n  This bill will not end the search of the sponsors for a single \nsettled law because it does not create Federal question jurisdiction. \nThe legislation would preempt all related State law and substitute \nFederal standards, but it would impose the Federal standards in a \nsingle overlay upon the 56 existing State court systems as well as the \nFederal courts.\n  The result will be both State and Federal courts applying a mix of \nState and Federal law in the same case; State supreme courts will no \nlonger be the final arbiters of their tort law. The U.S. Supreme Court, \nwhich many experts argue is already overburdened, will become the final \narbiter of this new legal thicket.\n  So, here we have what is indeed an irony: Those who ordinarily preach \nthe virtue of reserving power to the States are instead advancing \nlegislation to usurp the legitimate authority of States.\n  At a time when many in Congress are intent upon returning \nresponsibility for many Federal programs to the States, this \nlegislation would preempt State law.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of this legislation have worked extremely \nhard, and I particularly wish to commend my friend from West Virginia \nfor his tireless efforts on behalf\n of this legislation. I also commend the ranking Democrat on the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Hollings, for his stalwart defense of \nconsumer interests.\n\n  For all of this effort, I regret that I cannot support this bill. I \ncannot support it for two very simple reasons. The legislation is \npatently unfair to consumers, and it will not resolve the products \nliability problems businesses tell me they face.\n  It will remove from ordinary Americans the power they retain in the \njury box to force accountability for dangerous, careless, or reckless \nbehavior. In the jury box, each American can bring about positive \nchange. If we undermine the ability of our citizens to force changes in \nbad behavior, we will have compromised our Nation's core values.\n  While many Americans increasingly sense an erosion of personal \nresponsibility, our civil justice system remains one institution that \nholds individuals and organizations accountable for their behavior. \nMake no mistake, by restricting the civil justice system, this bill \nwill take rights away from Americans.\n  All of the available evidence on this legislation shows it will not \nmake businesses more competitive by reducing insurance rates or the \ncosts of corporate litigation, and it will not create national \nuniformity in products liability law.\n  A great deal of hype has been generated about this issue, and after \n15 years, it appears to have taken on a life of its own. But all the \nlobbying and advertising cannot convince me that this legislation will \naccomplish its stated goals.\n  The Dole substitute to H.R. 956 fails to strike a reasonable balance \nbetween promoting the competitive interests of business and protecting \nthe rights of consumers. It will create a nightmarish new legal thicket \nthat should be avoided rather than embraced. It is unfortunate that \nafter all the effort we could not have achieved a reasonable balance.\n  After we have argued all the complicated points of law, after we have \npoured over horror story after horror story, the issues boil down to \none simple point: This bill is not fair, and it should be rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I \nreceived from the National Federation of State High School Associations \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      National Federation of State\n\n\n                                     High School Associations,\n\n                                     Kansas City, MO, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: On behalf of the National Federation \n     of State High School Associations, I want to commend you for \n     your leadership on legislation to address the long overdue \n     reform of our civil justice system. We applaud your efforts \n     to rein in the exploding costs of litigation that, if \n     unchecked, threaten to bankrupt non-profit organizations such \n     as ours and our member affiliates. The National Federation is \n     comprised of 51 state high school associations, with the \n     primary purpose of promulgating sports and non-sports playing \n     rules, including those specific to safety issues, for more \n     than 20,000 schools and approximately 10,000,000 students \n     each year. Additionally, our member associations establish \n     and enforce the eligibility rules under which all boys and \n     girls compete in high school athletics.\n       The legislation pending before the United States Senate, \n     The Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995 (H.R. 956), sets \n     limits on all product liability cases. Furthermore, the bill \n     as currently amended, would eliminate joint \n      [[Page S6404]] liability for non-economic damages. Instead, \n     only several liability would be allowed which means that each \n     defendant would be liable only for his, her, or its portion \n     by reason of its proportion of the fault causing the injury. \n     Economic damages, i.e. lost wages, medical costs, etc. would \n     remain joint and several at the discretion of each state.\n       We strongly agree with your comment on the floor this past \n     week stating ``it is unfair and unproductive to make \n     defendants pay for damages of a nature that are literally \n     beyond their control or beyond their fault.'' This \n     fundamental concept should apply to the civil justice system \n     as well.\n       Let me cite two examples of costly litigation we recently \n     incurred which epitomize the unfairness and counterproductive \n     nature of current civil law. Both occurred in school swimming \n     pools.\n       First, in Indiana a high school boy was ``leap frogging'' \n     off the starting platform, prior to the start of practice, \n     despite repeated warnings from his\n      coach. On one such leap, his foot got caught under the \n     platform; he fell head first into the water and struck his \n     head on the pool bottom. Tragically, he suffered a neck \n     injury that ultimately resulted in quadriplegla. While \n     this unimaginably horrible accident was not related to any \n     swimming competition, the National Federation was sued \n     simply because it writes the rules for interscholastic \n     swimming, including rules related to standards for \n     equipment and facilities such as the depth of swimming \n     pools.\n       Yet another incident occurred in Michigan during a water \n     polo practice. This incident involved a high school boy who \n     jumped off the platform over a lane designation rope and \n     struck his head on the pool bottom. This seemingly harmless \n     leap resulted in a lifetime of paralysis from the neck down. \n     While the National Federation does not even write water polo \n     rules, nor rules for the practice sessions for any sport, we \n     were included in the law suit and incurred exorbitant legal \n     fees for a defense that should not have been necessary.\n       These are but two examples of what has become a nightmare \n     of litigation for the National Federation and its member \n     affiliates. Without radical reforms to our system of civil \n     justice, organizations such as ours whose sole mission is to \n     build a consensus for safe sports competition will be \n     unfairly jeopardized and possibly destroyed.\n       Unfortunately, lawyers often join sanctioning bodies such \n     as ours in law suits as a trial strategy rather than because \n     of a reasonable belief that the injury was caused in any way \n     by the action of the sanctioning body. Current law \n     discourages sanctioning bodies from setting minimum safety \n     standards because of their fear of being joined in subsequent \n     litigation. This is bad public policy.\n       Therefore, in addition to holding firm in your effort to \n     reform the civil justice system, we urge you to include an \n     exemption in the law for sanctioning bodies such as ours who \n     are joined in law suits solely because they recommend minimum \n     standards for facilities and equipment for the purpose of \n     reducing risk inherent in participation in almost any given \n     sport. This exemption would be consistent with your stated \n     belief that it is unfair and unproductive to make defendants \n     liable for incidents that are ``literally beyond their \n     control or beyond their fault.''\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this vital issue. \n     The members of the National Federation of State High School \n     Associations and I look forward to assisting you in achieving \n     these needed reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert F. Kanaby,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has been considering legislation \nrelated to product liability for almost 2 weeks. During that time I \nhave heard from a number of West Virginians who have been harmed or \ninjured by defective products, as well as from businesses that have \nbeen seriously impacted by lawsuits brought against them--at times \nsomewhat unfairly. I have listened to the debate and considered how the \nSenate can best balance these competing interests, and have concluded \nthat the substitute amendment offered by Senators Gorton and \nRockefeller does not adequately protect the rights of injured parties \nand consumers in two critical areas.\n  The first involves the issue of several or proportional liability, \nversus joint and several liability. Under the concept of proportional \nliability, a defendant is only responsible for a percentage of \nliability directly contributing to the injury or harm caused by the \ndefective product. On the other hand, joint and several liability \nprovides that each defendant who contributes to causing a plaintiff's \ninjury may be held liable for the total amount of damages. Joint and \nseveral liability, by enabling a plaintiff to recover all of his or her \ndamages from a single defendant with the greatest financial assets or \nresources--the so-called ``deep pocket''--makes it more likely that the \nplaintiff will obtain full recovery in the event that one defendant \ndoes not have the assets to pay part of the judgment.\n  The proposed legislation completely eliminates joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, while \nretaining it for economic damages. This means that victims would fully \nrecover their economic damages in the form of lost income or medical \nexpenses, but victims with higher lost incomes, such as business \nexecutives, would receive greater compensation. Victims would fully \nrecover their economic damages, even if only one defendant among \nseveral defendants is still solvent, because the ``deep pocket'' would \nprovide full compensation for economic damages; however, due to the \nelimination of joint and several liability for noneconomic damages the \nparties would only receive partial compensation for pain and suffering.\n  This provision could significantly reduce compensation in cases where \nthe individual could still earn a livelihood, and thus not have large \neconomic damages, yet that same individual could still have significant \nnoneconomic damages. In this context, noneconomic damages could include \nnot just pain and suffering, but also any diminishment of the quality \nof life, such as infertility or the loss of a limb.\n  The result of completely eliminating joint and several liability for \nnoneconomic damages, then, would be that the innocent victim might not \nreceive a majority of the compensation due if the other wrongful \ndefendants were insolvent. I have concluded that this\n provision in the legislation shifts the balance too far in the \ndirection of defendants at the expense of the victims of wrong doing in \nthe form of defective products.\n\n  The other key provision of the legislation is the section dealing \nwith punitive damages. Punitive damages are intended to punish willful \nor wanton misconduct on the part of a manufacturer or business. \nFurthermore, by punishing misconduct, punitive damages are intended to \ndeter such behavior in the future.\n  Punitive damages therefore must take into consideration the financial \nassets of the defendant or guilty party. A punitive damage judgment of \n$250,000 may be both harsh punishment and a significant deterrent to a \nsmall business, but it is insignificant to a large corporation. Any cap \non punitive damages can only serve to benefit, if not condone, \negregious and wanton behavior by large corporations.\n  The legislation limits punitive damages to the greater of $250,000 or \ntwo times the total economic and noneconomic damages. The bill also \nstipulates that a judge may add to these punitive damages, and exceed \nthe cap, at his discretion. I am concerned that this ``judge additur'' \nprovision does not fully resolve the problem of capping punitive \ndamages for large corporations. First, many judges may be reluctant to \noverrule a jury's decision, and add to the punitive judgment. Second, \nthe effect could be arbitrary, as some judges may opt to add to \npunitive judgments, while others may not. Third, the burden of proof \nwould be on judges to demonstrate why a larger punitive judgment that \nwould exceed the cap is necessary, which could discourage judges from \nadding to punitive judgments. Fourth, it strikes at the heart of our \ntradition of jury judgments in such product liability and civil \nlitigation.\n  I recognize that the current product liability system, which involves \ndifferent laws in each of the 50 States, imposes a considerable \nhardship on some manufacturers, particularly in the case of small \nbusiness. I endorse the goal of establishing some type of national \nuniformity in this area. However, I regret that I cannot support the \nlegislation that is now before the Senate. While national uniformity is \na laudable goal, any national standard must also fully protect the \nrights of consumers and victims of harm caused by defective products.\n  While I may disagree on several of the provisions included in this \nmeasure, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge and salute the hard \nwork and leadership of Senator Rockefeller. He believes in this \nlegislation. He has put his heart into working on it, and I believe \nthat he is correct in that there are inequities in the present system \nwhich need to be addressed. My opposition notwithstanding, I want to \ncommend both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton for their tireless \n [[Page S6405]] efforts on behalf of product liability reform.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe that there is a strong argument \nto be made for uniformity in product liability law since so many \nproducts are sold across State lines.\n  But there is no uniformity in this bill. This bill contains limits \nand restrictions on compensation for injuries caused by defective \nproducts, but those limits and restrictions are not uniform. On the \ncontrary, the bill contains a one-way preemption provision, which \nallows States to adopt virtually any law that differs from the so-\ncalled national standard, as long as that law is more restrictive than \nthat standard. A patchwork of State laws is still permitted, provided \nthat the divergences are in the direction of greater restrictions on \nthe injured party.\n  As I pointed out earlier in this debate, every single provision of \nthis bill is written to prohibit State laws that are more favorable to \nplaintiffs. But the only provision of the bill that would prohibit \nState laws that are more favorable to defendants is the statute of \nlimitations. We are not adopting true national standards at all.\n  This bill is not balanced, it is not uniform, and I cannot support \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table demonstrating the one-way nature \nof the preemption in this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  PREEMPTION OF STATE PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWS UNDER S. 565, AS REPORTED  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  State laws  State laws\n                                                     more        more   \n                                                   favorable   favorable\n                                                      to          to    \n                                                  plaintiffs  defendants\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiability of product sellers....................

Do.   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I voted for cloture on the product \nliability bill because I believe it is important to the economy, job \ncreation, international investment, and our ability to do research, \nespecially on issues of women's health.\n  Mr. President, much has been said about caps. I do not like caps--\ncaps on job creation or caps on innovative research. I do not like caps \non technological advancement or caps on our ability to go global. I am \nopposed to caps on profits, caps on wages, or caps on opportunity.\n  My job as a U.S. Senator is to save jobs, save lives and save \ncommunities. I support efforts to reduce frivolous law suits and \nimprove the efficiency of our legal system.\n  I have heard of cost estimates for cases that are in the millions. \nThat's outrageous. We should make every effort to establish consistency \nand uniformity, but not at the price of people's fundamental right to \nredress.\n  When it comes to public health and safety I want to ensure that those \nresponsible are in fact held accountable for their actions. For that \nreason, I will not support any legislation which closes the courthouse \ndoor to citizens with legitimate cases.\n  This is the kind of balance I support and that I believe we, as \nMembers of Congress, need to achieve with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, today's cloture vote was a difficult decision for me. \nProduct liability involves very complex and complicated issues, \nincluding joint and several liability, noneconomic versus economic \ndamages, statute of repose, punitive damages, and alternate dispute \nresolution. To help me better understand product liability and its \nimpact on people's day to day lives, I met with people on both sides of \nthis issue. I met with business organizations and consumer \norganizations. All the groups made legitimate arguments expressing \nworthwhile and important concerns.\n  Some businesses are concerned about how our current system ultimately \nimpacts their decisions about innovation and competitiveness, small \nbusinesses are concerned about going out of business all together. We \nshould take every step we can to cut unnecessary liability costs and \nencourage innovation. Innovation will ultimately lead to jobs today and \njobs tomorrow. We must acknowledge that innovation, particularly in the \nhealth field, is critical for out Nation's economic stability and \ncompetitiveness, and it is critical to the health and safety of \nAmerican citizens.\n  I was particularly moved by the National Family Planning and \nReproductive Health Association's position that tort reform is needed \nto increase investment in women's health research and technologies. Mr. \nPresident, the product liability issue has been around for quite some \ntime. There was no doubt that I could not sign on to previous product \nliability reform bills introduced in the early 1980's. But, I believe \nthe current legislation is an attempt to achieve a reasonable balance \nat this point.\n  Is this bill perfect? Of course, it is not. In this case, it is hard \nto put forth a perfect bill. There is no doubt that we should review \nthis issue in the coming years and make sure it is working. If it is \nnot working, we in Congress have the option to review it and make \nchanges. Looking at our current system, I believe there are areas that \ncan be improved. For that reason, I am willing to support Federal \nproduct liability reform. Many of the reforms proposed by this \nlegislation have already been done at the State level. So, in many ways \nwe are acting consistently with respect to the States.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear. The House bill goes too far. \nIt includes a number of bad provisions, including severe caps on pain \nand suffering. To move beyond the Senate bill would be a mistake. The \nscales on this issue are delicately balanced. If those scales are \ntipped, it is unlikely I will support this bill.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed by a convincing \nmargin the product liability bill. It was a difficult and contentious \neffort, much akin to the debate that this area has generated over the \nlast decade. I was pleased that the Senate saw fit to pass this \nlegislation and am hopeful that a productive and successful conference \nwith the House will follow and eventually that the President will sign \nthis legislation into law.\n  I have long supported product liability reform even when it began as \na somewhat lonely effort over a decade ago. Finally, with a supportive \nCongress, it seems that we may be coming up with a bill that can \nactually become the law of the land. It must be noted that in order to \npreserve the best possible chance of reaching that result, other areas \nof legal reform, such as medical malpractice and broad tort reform, \nhave been excluded. I joined in the effort to keep this bill clean from \nthose additions but I want to state that I support reform in those \nareas as well and look forward to addressing them in the future. I \nsimply felt that this legislation was an inappropriate forum for \ndealing with those issues. In the end, this bill represents a workable \nand reasonable balance for reforming the legal procedures and standards \ngoverning how one can seek redress for harm caused by faulty products.\n  I congratulate the hard work of my colleagues, in particular Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton, who artfully and doggedly crafted a compromise \nthat was acceptable to the Senate. They have worked hard and long, \nindeed for years, on this legislation and they are to be commended for \ntheir accomplishment. I await the conference report on this legislation \nwith anticipation and express my hope for speedy final consideration.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Product \nLiability Fairness Act of 1995. Let me first say, Mr. President, that I \nshare the concerns of the people of New Jersey and this country that \nour society is too litigious. I share the concerns of my colleagues and \nthe American people that the cost of this litigation explosion is \ninjurious to the social and economic future of this country. However, \nafter reviewing this bill and assessing the arguments, both pro and \ncon, I do not think that this bill strikes the appropriate balance \nbetween the desires of manufacturers and product sellers to streamline \nthe product liability process and the ability of ordinary Americans to \nbring lawsuits seeking relief from injuries resulting from defective \nand dangerous products.\n  Mr. President, I favor a cap on punitive damages for small \nbusinesses. I supported the amendment of my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, \n [[Page S6406]] which provides for a cap on punitive damages for small \nbusinesses with 25 or fewer employees and individuals with assets of \nless than $500,000. Small businesses are the engine that drives the \nAmerican economy and provide for at least half of this country's new \nemployment opportunities. While a cap on punitive damage awards should \nbe sufficient to punish and deter future action, it should also reflect \nthe fact that a cap that may be sufficient to punish a large \ncorporation may in fact push a small business into the abyss of \nbankruptcy.\n  However, Mr. President, I have grave concerns about the overall cap \non punitive damages. The purpose of punitive awards is to punish the \nwrongdoer for egregious behavior and deter such behavior in the future. \nI believe that if we place a low cap on punitive damages, some \ncorporations will not be discouraged from exposing consumers to \ndangerous products. Indeed, with predictable caps, Mr. President, \nwrongdoers may find it more cost effective to make dangerous decisions \nand risk paying punitive damages. Moreover, Mr. President, while this \nbill authorizes judges to increase an award of punitive damages beyond \nthe limits of the cap, this safeguard is illusory because defendants \nhave the right to receive a new trial--a right which they will surely \nexercise. Indeed, the provision in the bill will only lead to \nrepetitive litigation, increase costs and prevent deserving consumers \nfrom obtaining their awards in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I do not need to repeat the horror stories about women \nwho have tragically suffered and died from using dangerous products, \nchildren who have been burned by flammable clothing, or hard working \nAmericans, who have senselessly been injured and killed as a result of \ndefective automobiles. What needs to be repeated is that the one \nconstant in all of these horror stories is that the manufacturer knew \nof the dangerous defect and failed to take adequate steps to protect \nthe public. Mr. President, punitive damages are available to police \nconduct that is so egregious that the offender disregarded forseeable \ndangerous consequences. Indeed, as this bill provides, punitive damages \nare only available where there is clear and convincing evidence of a \nconscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of others. Given the \nnature of the offense, Mr. President, I firmly believe that placing a \ncap on punitive damages will be counterproductive to\n society's efforts to police and deter such egregious conduct.\n\n  Mr. President, under the present caps, cigarette manufacturers and \nthose who irresponsibly market alcohol to intoxicated persons or minors \nwho then kill or injure innocent victims in traffic crashes would \ncontinue to manufacture and market these products of destruction with \nless fear of having to one day pay the price for the massive damage \nthat their products inflict on society. Moreover, firearms and \nammunition are virtually the only unregulated consumer product in \nAmerica. As such, the tort system is the only check on the safety of \nconsumers. I am not willing, Mr. President, to place a cap on punitive \ndamages when the result will be that such action will lessen the \nliability of the manufacturers who profit from these destructive \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, while I also think that there is a need for joint and \nseveral liability reform, I cannot endorse the blanket elimination of \njoint and several liability for noneconomic damages that is in the \npresent bill. Instead, Mr. President, I favor the approach currently in \noperation in New Jersey, which provides for proportional liability if \nthe defendant is responsible for 20 percent or less of the harm, \nseveral liability for noneconomic damages if a defendant is responsible \nfor between 20 percent and 60 percent of the harm, and joint and \nseveral liability if the defendant is responsible for 60 percent or \nmore of the harm.\n  Mr. President, this bill would preempt State product liability law \n``to the extent that state law applies to an issue covered under the \nAct.'' Proponents of product liability reform argue that Federal \nlegislation is needed to establish uniformity. However, the bill does \nnot require States to have uniform State laws. For example, those \nStates that do not now allow punitive damages would not be required to \naward them, even though the bill provides for the award of such \ndamages. The effect of this provision is that States can offer their \nindividual citizens fewer rights, but not more.\n  Mr. President, this bill also excludes actions involving commercial \nloss. By excluding such actions, the bill places restrictions on the \nability of individuals to seek redress from defective products, but \ndoes not place any restrictions on corporations to seek redress. For \nexample, if a product explodes in a factory, the worker's recovery for \ninjuries is limited by this bill; however, the factory owner may sue \nthe product manufacturer or seller free from the restrictions of the \nbill for such speculative damages as the factory's loss of profits \nbecause of delays in production. Thus, the effect of this provision is \nto value material property over the health and safety of individual \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, we have been told that there is a litigation explosion \nwith respect to product liability and that corporations and the \nbusiness community are suffering under the weight of this explosion. \nHowever, Mr. President, excluding cases of asbestos, product liability \nclaims in Federal courts have declined by approximately 36 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1991. Moreover, in State courts, product liability \ncases are approximately 4 percent of all tort filings, .0036 percent of \nall civil caseloads and .00097 percent of the total State court \ncaseloads.\n  Mr. President, although there have been relatively few punitive \ndamage awards in product liability cases over the last 25 years, we \nhave been told that the threat of punitive damages\n encourages many product manufacturers to settle cases that they would \nhave no problem winning in an effort to avoid having claims for \npunitive damages go to juries unfamiliar with the precautions that are \nnow taken to insure that products are safe. However, Mr. President, the \nnumbers simply do not add up to the conclusion that the business \ncommunity is being treated unfairly by juries. Indeed, almost 60 \npercent of the product liability cases brought in 1993, plaintiffs were \nthe losing parties.\n\n  Mr. President, it has additionally been argued that these lawsuits \nincrease the costs of producing products in this country and thus hurt \nAmerican competitiveness. However, a 1987 Conference Board survey of \nrisk managers of 232 corporations shows that product liability costs \nfor most businesses are 1 percent or less of the final price of a \nproduct, and have very little impact on larger economic issues such as \nmarket share or jobs. In addition, the American Insurance Association, \nthe largest trade association representing the insurance industry, has \ntestified that this legislation will have virtually no effect on \ninsurance costs.\n  Mr. President, to put it succinctly, I do not think that the bill \nwill really do what its proponents say it will do. As mentioned \nearlier, the proponents of this bill argue that the business community \nis suffering under the weight of a litigation explosion. They contend \nthat this bill will decrease both the incidence and cost of litigation. \nMr. President, no one disagrees that we are an overly litigious \nsociety. However, I am not convinced that this bill can correct the \nproblem of litigiousness in society. Indeed, Mr. President, the fact is \nthat the punitive caps provision providing for the automatic right to a \nnew trial by defendants will serve to only increase the delay and cost \nof litigation. This bill tilts the scales of justice too far to the \ndisadvantage of individual consumers. Thus, I cannot support \nlegislation which will endanger the health and safety of hard working \nAmericans.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, because of the above stated concerns, I \nmust oppose the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995.\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 690, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The \n     discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be \n     limited to issues that are directly relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).\n       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant \n     a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 205 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such section 205(b) or seller subject to section 205(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 205(b); or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 205(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings \n     and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise \n     genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a \n     motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any \n     material fact for each applicable element set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 205(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists.\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section \n     205(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 205(d) solely to the extent permitted by the \n     applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against \n     nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     205(b) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not \n     issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay \n     all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such \n     time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the \n     petition.\n       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this title shall be permitted to file and conduct a \n     proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal \n     filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under \n     this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in \n     such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual \n     agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the \n     cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.\n       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to \n     compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer \n     appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f)) \n     for attorney fees and costs, if--\n       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier; \n     and\n       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials \n     supplier to be without merit and frivolous.\n\n     SEC. 207. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title shall apply to all civil actions covered under \n     this title that are commenced on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, including any such action with respect \n     to which the harm asserted in the action or the conduct that \n     caused the harm occurred before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  [[Page S6413]] Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would want to take this opportunity to \nfirst congratulate the majority of the Members of the Senate and \nMembers on both sides of the aisle for by far the most significant step \nin legal reform which has been taken by the Senate in many, many years, \nperhaps in the memory of the most senior of the sitting Senators. This \nhas been a project by members of the Commerce Committee which has \nlasted for a decade and a half. It also, I may say, after 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nof debate, has been one in which the views of the Members had an \nimpact, had an impact in showing that a majority of the Senate, a bare \nmajority, wants a broader legal reform package than is included in this \nbill, but that others worried about particular details were willing to \nwork on those details, and to cast their votes accordingly. So I \nbelieve that the Senate has worked its will in a particularly fine \nfashion.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague, the Senator from \nWest Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller]. In many respects this has been a far \nmore difficult task for him than it has been for me. I represent a \nbroad coalition of views within my own political party with only a few \nhaving had differences. Senator Rockefeller throughout this entire \nperiod of time has spoken for a significant number of Members of his \ncolleagues but by no means a majority of them. But his dedication to \nthe cause of this reform has been exemplary, and his persuasive ability \nwith many of those colleagues has constantly left me in awe and with a \ngreat deal of inspiration. I believe that his persistence has paid off, \nand how wonderfully that it has done so.\n  I have gotten to know Tamera Stanton, his legislative director, and \nEllen Doneski, his legislative assistant, very well during the course \nof this period of time and know how much they have contributed to his \nsuccess, as has Trent Erickson, Lance Bultena, Jeanne Bumpus for me, \nand the majority leader's assistant, Kyle McSlarrow.\n  Other Senators have contributed significantly to this result, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, Senator \nCoverdell, and Senators Snowe and DeWine who came up with the formula \nfor punitive damages which appealed to the majority of Members of this \nbody.\n  I only regret that Senator Lieberman, the other principal cosponsor \nof this bill, through a family emergency is absent today. I know that \nhe would like to have been in on the end of this. But his contributions \nare greatly appreciated. And he is one of the primary authors of the \nportion of this bill that deals with medical devices.\n  Now we go on to try to get a final proposal passed by the Congress \nand through the President of the United States.\n  The majority leader has been patient in allowing us 2\\1/2\\ weeks on \nthis, and was an absolute key to its success as well.\n  With that, I think he wishes us to go on to another subject.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I too want to at this moment thank those \nwho have been in the trenches over the years and, of course, most of \nall my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Alabama. It is always \ngood to get in behind the chief justice because you know you are on the \nside of the law and of equity, and you know you are on the side of the \njudgment. Certainly it is, as we all revere him ethically, that you are \non the side of ethics and equity.\n  I thank publicly Senator Heflin for his leadership, and particularly \nWinston Lett, a member of his staff. On my staff, Kevin Curtin, Jim \nDrewry, Moses Boyd, James Leventis, and Lloyd Ator. They have been \nworking around the clock, Kevin and Moses and others have been working \nin sort of a minority position on this measure.\n  The record would show that my particular Commerce Committee has over \nthe past several Congresses voted by a majority to report this bill. So \nwe have had a sort of uphill fight. I still feel that, of course, we \nhad the merit. I guess they feel they had the merit. But in any event, \nI think the 15-year holdup was because of that on our side. I also \nwould like to thank Senator Biden's staff, the Senator himself, Sean \nMoylan, Karen Robb. And then with respect to, of course, the medical \nmalpractice part, we did not have hearings but Health and Human \nResources did. The distinguished former chairman, Senator Kennedy, was \nthe leader on that.\n  We had, of course, the vigorous help of Senator Boxer and Senator \nWellstone. So it has been thoroughly aired and properly heard. The \nSenate has voted. But let us see what the House crowd comes up with in \nthe contract.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator \nHollings for his outstanding work in regard to it, although we did not \ncome out victorious. He is a great comrade in arms and has had a vast \namount of experience on this matter. I suppose that looking back over \nthe years, 15 or more years, he has fought these battles and I have \nbeen with him throughout, and he has tremendous knowledge in this area.\n  Originally, this bill was designed not to go to Judiciary. It was \ndesigned to go to Commerce. At that time, Senator Hollings was not \nchairman. But obviously, it is a bill that deals with the judicial \nsystem. From the very beginning it was designed to avoid a careful \nscrutiny in regards its judicial impact. Fortunately, over the years, \nwe had an individual who was an outstanding lawyer, and who had been an \noutstanding trial lawyer, Senator Hollings in the State of South \nCarolina, and who has been there to deal with this matter.\n  I would also like to thank the staffs of Senator Hollings and others \nwho have been so important. They have really exhibited tremendous \nknowledge of the law. They have followed this legislation diligently \nand have done a tremendous job. Senator Hollings has named them, and I \nwill not repeat their names. But on my staff, Winston Lett and Jim \nWhiddon have worked tirelessly and diligently on this legislation, and \nI thank them for their great service in our legislative efforts.\n  I also want to congratulate Senator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton \nfor their advocacy in pushing forward on their bill. They just seem to \nhave better allies than we did. I always at the end of a lawsuit, \nwhether I won or lost, went over and congratulated my opposing counsel, \nand do so today. We will be having other battles as they come down the \nroad, and sometimes we will be compatriots. We will be cosponsors and \njoint fighters in the same cause. Then, as it is with all Senators, we \nwill be on opposite sides again in the future on some issue. But that \nis the way the Senate works; that is the way democracy works. During \nthe debate on a great issue, you can disagree but you do not have to be \ndisagreeable.\n  I think that Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller never showed any \ndisagreeable nature. I disagreed with them with respect to the cause \nthe were advancing, but not in the manner they advanced it; they played \nfair and square. I want to thank them particularly for working out a \nsettlement in regard to the unique and different situation as to \nAlabama's wrongful death statute.\n  We worked out a situation by which the amendment was adopted giving \ntime to our State legislature or to our courts or to both to find a \nsolution to be able to fit into this bill, if it is finally passed.\n  Then I want to say, while I will congratulate them, please do not \ntake that as any indication that I have ceased to fight. I have not \nsurrendered and will not give up in my efforts to maintain the \ntraditional role of the 50 States in allowing them to fashion their own \nsolutions to problems which may arise with regard to product liability \nlaws. I believe the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution still has \nsome meaning, and I will continue to assert the primacy of the States \non these matters.\n  There are appeals. There are appeals to conference, there are appeals \nto the White House, there are appeals to the President to eliminate the \nunfairness of the bill or to see the death of this unfair bill. So we \nwill continue to fight. The battle is not over. We have not \nsurrendered, and we will continue to battle in the future because we \nfeel we are battling for the injured parties, \n [[Page S6414]] the consumers of America, and that we have right on our \nside. And we ask the Lord to give us a little more guidance in regard \nto these appeals as we move forward.\n  So I thank everybody concerned who has put up with me, and we will \ncontinue to battle on this issue as well as other issues that come up \nthat affect the rights of the people.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me thank all of my colleagues for the \nfact we finished this bill. It has been 2 weeks and 2 days, but there \nwere a couple of interruptions--the death of former Senator Stennis and \nother matters. So it was not solid. We probably did it in about 8 or 9 \ndays.\n  We have had a lot of good debate on both sides. I congratulate all \nthe principal players, Senators Heflin and Hollings, also Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Gorton, who were on the winning side of this \nissue. I think they did a remarkable job in keeping a very fragile, \nnarrow coalition together. We broadened the bill with narrow margins. I \nthink we knew at the time those provisions would not be in the bill or \nwe could not obtain the 60 votes we needed for cloture, so adjustments \nwere made. But at least we made a record on medical malpractice, on \npunitive damages, and on other issues that we believe are very \nimportant and we believe will be back before the Senate.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Coverdell for his work with outside \ngroups as sort of the coordinator, and my colleague, Senator Lott of \nMississippi, the majority whip, who did an excellent job, along with \nhis staff and members of my staff and others because we had some very \ndifficult votes.\n  I think we have had a dramatic step forward. The product liability \nbill has been introduced in every Congress for the last decade. In most \ncases, however, we could not even muster the votes to consider the \nlegislation. We could not get the 60 votes to even talk about it \nbecause we had strong opposition and we had a lot of what we thought \nwere distortions. The other side would say not.\n  So I think passage today is an important victory for common sense and \nthe American people. It is also important to note that we have just \npassed a bill that was stronger than bills introduced in previous \nyears, stronger because of the efforts of some of our Members in the \nChamber that added small business protections.\n  I wish to pay tribute to our newest Members, who as a group provided \nenergy, ideas, and determination in this debate. Senators Snowe and \nDeWine made a significant contribution that allowed us to obtain \nmeaningful protection from abusive punitive damages while protecting \nsmall businesses.\n  Senators Abraham and Kyl responded to the call of the American people \nin last year's elections by their efforts to expand these protections \nto include volunteer and charitable organizations and to add needed \ncivil justice reforms. Together with Senators Kassebaum and McConnell, \nwho introduced medical malpractice reforms, they produced something \nnever before seen on the Senate floor--clearer majorities for broader \nreform. For various reasons, we could not get the 60 votes to bring \ndebate to a close on these broader reforms, but we have had the \nopportunity and I think it is certainly important.\n  Just 3 days ago, I received a letter from the head of the Boy Scouts \nof America, Mr. Jere Ratcliffe. In just the second line of his letter, \nMr. Ratcliffe says something that ought to cause all of us to pause. I \nquote:\n\n       The civil justice system, as it now exists, has \n     consequences which worked a chilling effect on our \n     willingness and ability to continue to pursue activities that \n     are beneficial to all of us. . . . This is particularly so in \n     the case of volunteer service organizations.\n\n  That is what he believes. That is what many of us believe. So we have \nheard from the trial lawyers. They say everything is fine, but the \nvolunteer organizations tell us a different story.\n  I would just say that we hope to bring up sometime later this year \nor, if not, next year the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum health care \nliability bill--hopefully, later this year. The amendment was added by \na 53 to 47 vote. In addition, some Senators support medical malpractice \nreform but voted against that amendment last week because they wanted \nto pursue only a product liability bill. So we are going to revisit \nthat later in the year. We have a lot of work to do. I do not know how \nlate it is going to be. But in any event, we will be taking a hard look \nat that legislation, hopefully this year; if not, early next year.\n  So, again, I thank the managers, Senator Gorton and Senator \nRockefeller. This is a bipartisan effort, as are most things in the \nSenate because without a bipartisan effort, you cannot get the 60 votes \nto shut off debate and pass the bill. That is the way it works. Some \npeople may not totally understand it, may disagree with it, but that is \nthe way it works. So now we move to another legislative matter, which I \nwould ask the Chair to report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6370-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6414-S6418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I would say, as we start S. 534, keep in \nmind it came out of the committee by a vote of 16 to 0. And I hope this \nis something we can complete before the week is out, sometime by late \nFriday afternoon. I know there are amendments. We can dispose of \namendments. But I hope that in many cases the amendments can be \nresolved by agreement, by working them out. And I know we have \nreasonable managers on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is important legislation, and I am happy to have it before the \nSenate. I hope we can complete action on it before the week is out \nbecause next week we will go to the budget and, hopefully, following \nthat to telecommunications. So we have our next 2 or 3 weeks laid out \nfor us before a very brief Memorial Day recess.\n  I will also be sending a letter to Senator Daschle today with \nreference to the August recess, and unless we can reach some \naccommodation, I then will announce in the next week whether or not \nthere will be an August recess and, if so, the length of that recess.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the leader would yield to a question.\n  I heard the ominous words ``a very brief Memorial Day recess.'' What \ndoes that mean?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is a week.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOLE. It may be longer than the August recess.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to commend so many Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle for their efforts over the last couple of weeks \non product liability. This has been a vigorous debate, and a debate \nthat obviously has required a good deal of compromise and concession on \nboth sides.\n  I believe there was another opportunity that we could have had to \nreach greater consensus on the bill, and I am sorry we missed that \nopportunity in the final days of this debate.\n  But I do believe that as a result of the decisions made by this body \nover \n [[Page S6419]] the last couple of weeks, the message ought to be very \nclear. The message is this: Members of the Senate are not willing to \naccept the extreme measures that have been proposed by the House. If \nthose more extreme measures are added to the bill in conference, it is \nvery unlikely that anything will ultimately pass.\n  It is critical, as we look to the conference report, that we keep \nthis bill modest, that we not load it up with expansionist amendments, \nthat we seek to ensure that what has been passed is all that comes back \nto the Senate.\n  I will say unequivocally that I believe this legislation will again \nbe in trouble if it comes back vastly different from what it is right \nnow. Many of us felt very strongly we could have improved upon this \nbill, especially with regard to punitive limits and with regard to the \nlimitations on joint and several liability. For many of us who opposed \nthe bill, there were provisions that we supported and would have liked \nto have been able to vote for, but, unfortunately, we could not resolve \nthe issues that, in our view, were still too onerous to support.\n  But let me say, in spite of the fact that there was a very strong \nvote, that vote is directly dependent upon the degree to which the more \nextreme measures that were initially added are kept off the bill. We do \nnot want to see them when this comes back. We will continue to fight \nthis in a consequential way if they do come back, and I hope that that \nmessage was loud and clear.\n  I was very pleased with the comments made by both Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton yesterday as they commented about what they \nexpect to see in conference. Senator Gorton said that he does not think \nthere is one semicolon that is negotiable, and I think that is an \naccurate reflection of where the Senate stands.\n  So, indeed, we passed a piece of legislation today that may reflect \nthe views of three-fifths of the Senate, but I think that it is a very \ntenuous victory, depending upon what may or may not occur in the \nconference report. So we look to that at some point in the future. But \nI must say that while those on both sides of the aisle who supported \nthe legislation can claim victory, I think it is also important that \nthey appreciate how tenuous that victory is and how important it is \nthat we come back to the floor with something meaningful, something \nnarrow and focused, and something that directly addresses the concerns \nraised on this floor for the last 2 weeks.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up S. 534.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending business.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith, in presenting S. 534 to the Senate. This is \nlegislation dealing with interstate waste and flow control authority.\n  I want to acknowledge Senator Smith's efforts as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Superfund, \nWaste Control, and Risk Assessment. Senator Smith has taken the lead in \ndrafting this legislation, targeting issues that went unresolved last \nyear.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work of the distinguished ranking \nmember of our committee, Senator Baucus, for his help in the framing of \nthis legislation which we will now be discussing over the next day or \nso.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is straightforward and attempts to \ndeal with the issues of interstate waste and flow control, balancing \nthe interests of the States that import waste, trash that comes into \nStates for disposal, and the exporters, States that do not have \nlandfills or incinerators and thus ship it out. We try to deal with \ncommunities with outstanding revenue bonds as they deal with the issues \nof construction of waste facilities the local individual who dispose of \nhis or her garbage.\n  This bill includes three titles. Title I deals with interstate waste \nand is similar to the bill approved by the Senate last year. I would \nlike to stress that. The interstate waste portion is one that was \napproved unanimously by this Senate last year.\n  Title II focuses on flow control, which we will discuss in a few \nminutes. And title III reinstates the ground water monitoring exemption \nfor small landfills in the municipal solid waste landfill criteria.\n  Let me turn to title I. This is a very contentious area. Indeed, I \nguess we have dealt with this, on and off, over the past 5 years. And \nno one has been more ardent in trying to get this problem solved than \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats.\n  Now, on interstate shipments, the bill before us, as I say, is \nsimilar to S. 2345, which was approved unanimously last year by the \nSenate.\n  I want to make it clear that the bill before us deals exclusively \nwith the transport, across State borders, of municipal solid waste. \nThat is what we are talking about. We are not talking about \nrestrictions on hazardous waste or industrial waste or even \nconstruction and demolition debris. Those items involve an entirely \ndifferent set of problems and would require different approaches than \nwe are dealing with here.\n  We are dealing here with municipal solid waste, sometimes referred to \nas MSW; what the rest of us, in layman's terms, would call garbage or \ntrash.\n  Specifically the bill provides the following. There is an import ban. \nA Governor may, if requested by the affected local community, as \ndesignated by the Governor, ban out-of-State municipal solid waste at \nlandfills or incinerators that did not receive out-of-State waste in \n1993.\n  Now, this gets a little bit complicated, but these are provisions \nthat we have worked out with Governors and municipalities, particularly \nthe ones that cross borders.\n  So the first point is there can be an import ban that the Governor \ncan impose, if he is requested by a local community and if that \ncommunity did not receive out-of-State waste in 1993. Or he can impose \nthis same ban at those facilities that received municipal solid waste \nin 1993 but are not in compliance with applicable Federal or State \nstandards. So there is a power in the Governor. Now that is an import \nban.\n  Further, a Governor may unilaterally freeze out-of-State waste at \n1993 levels at landfills and incinerators that received waste during \n1993 and are in compliance. In other words, the Governor can put a \nclamp on limiting it to the amount that came in in 1993, at those \nlevels.\n  Now, there is an export ratchet, likewise. A Governor may \nunilaterally ban out-of-State waste from any State exporting more than \n3.5 million tons in 1996. This declines to 3 million tons in 1997 and \n1998, drops to 2.5 million tons in 1999 and the year 2000, 1.5 million \ntons in the year 2001 and 2002, and 1 million tons in 2003 and every \nyear thereafter. So the Governor has this power to ban out-of-State \nwaste coming from a State that is exporting very substantial amounts. \nThat is the power in the importing State Governor.\n  There is also another ratchet. A Governor may unilaterally restrict \nout-of-State waste imported from any one State in excess of certain \nlevels.\n  There is a cost recovery surcharge provision. States that imposed a \ndifferential fee on the disposal of out-of-State waste on or before \nApril 3, 1994, are allowed to impose a fee of no more than $1 per ton.\n  So there is that $1-per-ton limitation, a differential that a State \ncan impose, as long as the differential fee is used to fund solid waste \nmanagement programs.\n  What we are dealing with all through here are the limitations that \nare imposed by the commerce clause of our Constitution. The bill we are \ndealing \n [[Page S6420]] with today explicitly prohibits a Governor from \nlimiting or prohibiting solid waste imports to landfills or \nincinerators that have a host community agreement to receive out-of-\nState waste.\n  In addressing the problem of interstate waste, I, as chairman, and \nSenator Smith, likewise as chairman of the subcommittee, have tried to \nfind a solution that will reduce unwanted imports yet give exporting \nStates some time to reduce the amount of waste generated, to increase \nrecycling, and to site new in-State capacity.\n  What we are trying to do is to take into account the large exporting \nStates' problems, but we are not going to let them export forever.\n  What can they do? As I say, they can reduce the amount of waste \ngenerated, they can increase recycling, and they can set up their own \nsites in their States to deal with the problem--incinerators, \nlandfills, or whatever they might be.\n  Title II deals with what is known as flow control. Flow control \nrefers to the legal authority of States or local governments to \ndesignate where waste must be taken for processing or treatment or \ndisposal. Over the past 20 years, State and local governments have used \nflow control as a financing mechanism for the development of municipal \nsolid waste disposal facilities.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about incinerators and \nlandfills, for example. A municipality says, ``We have to have an \nincinerator to take care of the waste within our municipality.'' So \nthey say, ``Well, we'll build one. And where do we get the money? We \nissue bonds. All right, but how are we going to make certain that we \nare going to have the waste flowing in and the so-called tipping \nfees?'' So the municipality passes an ordinance which says: Everybody \nin this municipality must take trash to this central facility, and \nthere they pay a tipping fee and you are not allowed to ship it \nelsewhere. BFI or other commercial firms cannot come in and say, ``I'll \ntake your waste for a lower price.'' No.\n  The way it works is the locals say you can only take it here, because \nthat is the way we can pay off our bonds.\n  Flow control guarantees that a projected amount of waste will be \nreceived at a designated waste facility. Thus, a predictable revenue \nstream is generated for the retirement of the cost of the facility, the \ncapital cost, and the operating expenses.\n  Flow control, as you can see, distorts the waste market by creating \nState or municipally controlled waste monopolies. Obviously, it becomes \na monopoly. If the city of St. Louis says that no trash can be taken \nelsewhere but to the city incinerator, that is a monopoly. But the city \nof St. Louis might say, well, we spent a lot of money to build this \nincinerator and the only way we can pay off our bonds is with a \nguarantee flow from our municipality so when the big trucks, private \ntrucks pick up, they can only take it to the city of St. Louis \nincinerator.\n  Communities across the country have made investments predicated on \nflow control, but I, and likewise Senator Smith and Senator Baucus, do \nnot believe in perpetuating that kind of system into the future. \nDesignating where waste must go will only drive up the cost of waste \ndisposal for our citizens.\n  Not unlike the interstate transport of municipal solid waste and its \nimplications on interstate commerce, flow control has emerged as a \ncontroversial legislative issue because of several recent Federal court \ndecisions. Over the past 5 years, Federal courts have ruled that flow \ncontrol laws in no fewer than four States violate the commerce clause \nof the U.S. Constitution. Similar to restrictions on interstate waste, \nflow control undermines the commerce clause by barring States and \npolitical subdivisions by placing undue burdens on interstate commerce.\n  This case all came up May 16, 1994, just a year ago. It was called \nthe Carbone case, Carbone versus Town of Clarkstown, NY, which the \nSupreme Court decided just a year ago. The Supreme Court's ruling in \nthe Carbone case has made it clear that absent congressional action, \nthe exercise of flow control by States and political subdivisions is \nunconstitutional; it interferes with interstate commerce. The city of \nSt. Louis no longer can say to all its citizens, ``You must bring your \ntrash to this central facility.'' That is interfering with interstate \ncommerce and is unconstitutional, unless Congress decides otherwise.\n  So we are here today to override the constitutional provisions on \nState laws that interfere with interstate commerce and so as to provide \nnew authority to the States. We are beset with communities, such as the \nillustrative one I gave of St. Louis, that has invested substantial \nsums of money in their incinerators and are counting on paying off \nthose bonds through the fees that come in and suddenly the whole ground \nrules are changed by the Supreme Court decision. So they come to us and \nsay, ``Grandfather us. We issued those bonds dependent upon this flow \nof trash.''\n  The Supreme Court has said Congress can do this. We can provide new \nauthority to the States by declaring that the impact of such laws on \ninterstate commerce is reasonable.\n  Should we move in this direction? I say yes, but a qualified yes. We \nshould tread carefully, and this bill does that.\n  This Senator believes that Congress was granted the power to regulate \ncommerce in order to ensure the free flow of goods and to protect \nagainst economic warfare among the States. We must not create a system \nthat builds walls around our States and our communities. The economy of \nour country has been successful over the past 200 years because of the \nfree flow of goods and services among our States. Let us not go \noverboard today loading up this bill with discriminatory amendments. \nUnnecessarily restricting the interstate transport of waste and \nproviding unlimited flow control will limit competition in the waste \nmarket. It will discourage the selection of less costly waste disposal \noptions, and it will force duplicative infrastructure investments in \nour communities.\n  The intention of the bill before us today is to provide States and \npolitical subdivisions with flow control authority in order to meet \nfinancial obligations with respect to solid waste management facilities \nand to maintain their creditworthiness.\n  Title II provides limited flow control authority under certain \nconditions to States and subdivisions that have embarked on these \ncommitments, these financial investments that, rightly or wrongly, were \npredicated on the expectation or implementation of flow control. They \nbuilt these facilities and issued the bonds believing that what they \nwere doing was right, was legal and was dependent upon restricting \nwhere the trash within their communities could go. It could only come \nto the municipal landfill or incinerator.\n  We are not, in grandfathering these provisions, reflecting any \nposition on the appropriateness of flow control as a policy option. In \neach instance in which flow control authority is granted under this \nlegislation, that grant is predicated on meeting debt obligations.\n  The final part is title III, which is called groundwater monitoring. \nIn it, we reinstate a groundwater monitoring exemption for small \nlandfills in the municipal solid waste landfill criteria. All of this \nreflects back on the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, section \n4010(c). One of the most significant issues raised during the revision \nof the criteria was the impact on small community landfills.\n  As a result, the October 9, 1991, final rule for the criteria \nincluded a groundwater exemption of owners and operators of certain \nsmall landfills.\n  In January 1992, petitions were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor review of the new landfill criteria. The court, in its review, \nvacated the small landfill exemption as it pertained to groundwater \nmonitoring.\n  The purpose of title III of the reported bill is to reinstate the \nexemption.\n  As many of us remember from the debate on interstate waste in 1992, \nthe flow of garbage raises intense local and regional concerns. In some \nareas of the country, this seemingly mundane issue is politically \npotent. Who would have thought that so much heat could be generated by \ngarbage disposal?\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation represents a good-faith \neffort to bring the various parties together on the issues of \ninterstate waste and flow \n [[Page S6421]] control. It provides additional authority to waste \nimporters without overriding the needs of waste-exporting States.\n  It protects past community financial investments with respect to flow \ncontrol; yet, it provides opportunities for the private sector. I \ncommend the Senator from New Hampshire and look forward to working with \nhim and other Members of the Senate to approve this legislation in an \nexpeditious fashion.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to yield the floor, without losing \nthe same, to Senator Baucus for his opening statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am pleased to be here considering legislation to give \nour States and communities the right to say ``no'' to out-of-State \ntrash. That is basically what the major portion of this bill is all \nabout--that is, enabling States to say, ``We do not want this stuff and \nwe have the right to say, no, we do not want the garbage.'' We need \nthis legislation to allow States to do that, and that is basically \nbecause of the U.S. Constitution, commerce clause, article I, which \nbasically states that only Congress can regulate interstate commerce, \nStates cannot. So we are now acting in Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have been working on this issue for a long time--6 \nyears. We have explored a lot of options, we have held many hearings, \nand we have debated this issue frequently. We passed interstate waste \nbills in each of the last three Congresses here in the U.S. Senate. I \nbelieve it is finally time to finish the job.\n  I will have more to say on that subject later. Let me say a little \nbit about this legislation.\n  Garbage is big business. Each year, the United States throws out more \nthan 200 million tons of municipal waste. That is enough to build a 30-\nfoot wall of trash from Los Angeles to New York. About 1 ton in 14 goes \nto a landfill or incinerator in another State. Nearly every State is a \nseller or a buyer in the municipal waste market; 47 States export some \ngarbage, and 44 States import some garbage.\n  Some interstate movement of garbage makes sense. In Montana, for \nexample, two towns have made arrangements to share landfills with \nwestern North Dakota towns. Some trash from Wyoming areas of \nYellowstone Park is disposed of in Montana. These arrangements save \nmoney for the communities involved. And the establishment of shared \nregional landfills can be a policy that does make sense.\n  But it only makes sense when the communities involved agree to it. No \nplace should become an unwilling dumping ground. Nobody should have to \ntake garbage they do not want from another community.\n  The legislation before us takes us a step closer to preventing \nMontana and other rural States from becoming a national dump. It lets \nGovernors freeze imports at 1993 levels, and stop new imports if \naffected communities want them stopped. It is not perfect, but it is a \ngood start.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senators who have worked so \nhard over the years on this issue trying to develop a balanced bill. \nSenator Coats has been particularly helpful and particularly committed \nto enacting interstate legislation. Senators Lautenberg, Moynihan, and \nour new chairman, Senator Chafee, and many others have worked \ntirelessly.\n  This issue has been around Congress long enough. I think it is time \nto stand up for the small towns and finish the job.\n  Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the relevant subcommittee, \nis now in the Budget Committee and is not able to be here. He worked \nhard, along with Senator Smith, and at a later time he will want to \nmake a statement.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Chafee.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a compromise bill. It is not going to \nplease everyone, and maybe that is the reason why it is a good piece of \nlegislation, I do not know. But a little more than 2 months ago, the \nSuperfund Waste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, which I \nchair, held a hearing to consider proposals to regulate the interstate \ntransportation of solid waste and whether to provide local control \nauthority to State and local governments.\n  The controversy here surrounding the interstate transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste is one that the Senate has been considering since \n1990. Today, 47 States export approximately 14 to 15 million tons of \nmunicipal solid waste per year for disposal in other States--14 to 15 \nmillion tons.\n  While short-distance waste exports have been occurring for some time, \nthe development of a long-haul waste transport market has been a more \nrecent development. With tipping fees as high as $140 per ton in some \nlarge cities, compared with the national average of between $30 and $50 \na ton, there is an incentive, obviously, from municipalities to \ntransport these wastes by truck and rail to distant States for some \npermanent disposal.\n  That is a pretty big incentive. Anywhere from $30 to $50 to $140 a \nton is a huge disparity.\n  Those States that have recently been the recipients of large amounts \nof long-haul waste have raised a concern that their limited capacity \nfor solid waste is being filled and that they have become a dumping \nground for somebody else's waste problems. So over the last few years, \n37 States have passed laws to prohibit, limit, or severely tax waste \nthat enters their jurisdiction. However, almost all of these laws have \nbeen struck down by the Supreme Court for violating the commerce clause \nof the Constitution.\n  So while there has been a recent easing of disposal and the capacity \nto dispose nationwide, there is still significant concerns about the \nfuture consequences of this long-haul system. Congress needs to define \nwhat the future is, whether we are going to honor the interstate \ncommerce clause or not, or whether we are going to adjust it or \nmicromanage it, or do something with it. But there are people out there \nwho are impacted, as we speak, by the fact that this decision is still \nin limbo.\n  So to address these concerns, Congress--specifically the Environment \nand Public Works Committee--has been attempting to strike a balance \nbetween importing and exporting States. Last year, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, of which I am a member, unanimously \nreported S. 2345 to address this problem. A number of Members, both on \nand off of the committee, including very prominent Members who will be \ninvolved in this debate over the next couple of days, like Senators \nCoats, Specter, Lautenberg, Moynihan, and others, took a very active \nrole in attempting to develop a compromise that importing and exporting \nStates could live with. While the Senate easily passed this compromise \nby a voice vote on September 30, 1994, it was the end of the session \nand time ran out before this issue could be finally resolved.\n  So this legislation has been a balancing effort, a real balancing \neffort. In regard to the interstate transportation of municipal solid \nwaste, we have tried to carefully balance the issues of both the \nimporters and the exporters, and nobody is happy with the interstate \nlanguage. Perhaps that indicates to me, as I said earlier, that we \nmight be on to something.\n  The bill that Senator Chafee and I introduced incorporates the \ninterstate waste bill that unanimously passed the Senate last year.\n  Let me repeat that, because I think in the debate, as the chairman, \nSenator Chafee, knows, it is getting lost. What Senator Chafee and I \nare offering in the area of interstate waste transfer unanimously \npassed the Senate last year. That is what we put in our bill. That is \nsimply all we are offering this year.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, could I ask a question to make a point?\n  When it passed unanimously last year, that was when the other party \nwas in charge, had the majority. So not only did all of the Democrats \nvote for it in a bill that was drafted by a majority of the Democrats \nin the committee and approved on the floor, but every Republican \nlikewise voted for it.\n  So two different parties have worked on this legislation over 2 \nseparate years and come to exactly the same result. Having passed \nunanimously last year, I certainly hope we can get on with the same \nlanguage, get the same \n [[Page S6422]] approval this year of the same language.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank Senator Chafee for making that point. He is \ncorrect. This is not a partisan issue. It is a carefully crafted \ncompromise to try to accommodate some genuine concerns out there among \nmany individuals.\n  Again, in the Senate, controlled by the Democratic Party last \nsession, it was passed unanimously. The Republicans are now under \ncontrol, and we are offering the same language again on interstate \ntransfer. There is not any reason why we should have a huge fight here, \nunless people, for whatever reason, are trying to capitalize on \nsomething or take unfair advantage.\n  We felt it was fair and we continue to feel that now. Senator Chafee \nand I are in agreement on that, and I know there will be Senators from \nboth the importing and exporting States that will try to weaken or \nstrengthen, depending on their position, the interstate portions of \nthis bill. The bill is in two sections--both interstate as well as flow \ncontrol. There are two sections to the bill.\n  My response is, we struck this compromise last year, all parties \nagreed, and there have been no significant changes. What would be the \nfight?\n  Let me move to the issue of flow control, because we have heard \nstatements from a variety of individuals before our committee, very \nprominent individuals. Senator Bill Cohen, Governor Christine Whitman \nof New Jersey and others, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, who \nasked Members to move quickly to address the issue of flow control. And \nwe did. We moved very quickly at the behest of those individuals.\n  Frankly, ever since we moved quickly at their behest, we have been \ngetting beat about the head and shoulders by some who asked Members to \nmove at their behest. A number of witnesses expressed a strong concern \nthat without prompt congressional action to provide for continued \nauthority in this area, many communities would be in danger of having \ntheir bond ratings lowered. That is true.\n  For those of my colleagues who may not have heard me speak to this \nissue on the subject of flow control, let me be clear. This bill is in \nmy subcommittee, the Superfund Committee, which I chair. It is in my \njurisdiction.\n  I tried to craft a compromise, which I think we did successfully, to \nget the bill to the floor and help those people who did have a problem. \nI oppose flow control. I think it is wrong. I do not support walking \naway from the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. I believe \nthat we ought to stand firm on that.\n  There is a situation that has developed, as Senator Chafee has \nalready outlined, where individuals--municipalities--have let bonds, \nand there are people who stand to lose on this. So we tried to craft a \ncompromise. In that compromise, we basically grandfathered, with \nreasonable grandfathering provisions, those communities.\n  I do not believe that flow control is necessary to deal with the \nproblem of solid waste. We do not--I think the private sector can do it \njust fine. I do not believe the free market is broken. There is no \nevidence that the free market is broken in this area.\n  There are many people who are involved in the transport of this \nmaterial, and I refuse to believe that recycling cannot be accomplished \nwithout flow control. I simply do not believe it. I do not think there \nis any evidence to say that. But some States and some communities got \nthemselves in a bind, and we are trying to help them out of that bind.\n  Instead, we are being attacked for trying to help them, in many ways \nby those who wanted it and now have dramatically changed or moved their \nposition. That is the reason why nothing has happened, because \neverybody wants their position.\n  This is a compromise. That is the point. I am sympathetic to the \ncommunities that feel they need congressional assistance on this \nmatter. There are some. If we are starting from ground zero and there \nwere no bonds let, no contracts signed, Mr. President, I would be here \non the floor saying no flow control, period.\n  However, it was because of this plea, that Senator Chafee and I moved \nforward to introduce this legislation, S. 534, that would provide the \nflow control authorities to those municipalities that imposed flow \ncontrol and either constructed or began construction of facilities \nprior to May 15, 1994, the Carbone decision.\n  While our bill provides limited grandfather protection for flow \ncontrol, it also--and this is the key issue--it gives finality. This is \nfinal. At the end of 30 years it is over. There is no flow control \nanymore. We now have the free market kick in. We have help during this \n30-year period which I think is more than ample. There are not any \nbonds I am aware of beyond the 30-year period. So precisely 30 years \nafter the legislation is adopted, no further flow control measures will \nbe allowed--none, zero, zilch.\n  Both my subcommittee as well as the full committee moved very quickly \nto mark up this legislation. We did so primarily to help those \ncommunities whose bond ratings are endangered as a result of the \nSupreme Court's recent action. They are. We agree they are. They should \nnot have gotten themselves in that position, but they did. Rather than \nget into whether or not they should not have gotten into that decision, \nwe did not use that as a criteria. We simply said for whatever reason, \nthey made some decisions that maybe they should not have made, but they \nare in that position so we will help them out.\n  Speaking for myself, I am very uncomfortable with providing flow \ncontrol authority. I do not want flow control authority. I felt that \nthe bill of Senator Chafee and myself struck a fair balance in \naccommodating those who are strong proponents of States rights and \nthose who are strong proponents of the free market. It is a compromise \nfor both of those positions.\n  During the course of the last 2 months, I have continued to work to \naccommodate Senators who had concerns about various proceedings in the \nbill. Everyone wants a fix. We are now hearing from the sublime to the \nridiculous. ``Well, we might have a contract in 5 years, we are \nthinking about it. Could we be exempted?'' No, absolutely not. We are \nnot going to exempt them, if I have anything to say about it. That is \nwrong. It defeats the spirit and intent of what we are trying to do.\n  We cannot satisfy everyone. We have tried. We tried hard to address \nthe legitimate concerns, and we will address those concerns. Some of \nthe amendments we will accept. Some we will not.\n  As a result of our efforts, the EPW Committee ordered this reported \nas amended on March 23 by a rollcall vote of 16-0. Again, the whole \nsequence of events here: Last year it was unanimous, no objection by \nRepublicans or Democrats in the Senate in a Democrat Congress. We have \na Republican Congress, it passes the committee 16-0.\n  That says something about this bill. It says that those people out \nthere who are trying to dramatically alter the bill are simply on a \ncourse that is not going to be in the best interest of those people who \nare sitting out there right now waiting for help, which is why we mark \nthis bill up.\n  I have to say if we ask Senator Smith, ``What are your priorities in \nthe subcommittee of the Superfund?'' It is Superfund reform. That is \nwhat we are working on. We have had six hearings on it. We have another \nhearing tomorrow. We had one yesterday. We will try to draft a bill in \nthe next 6 weeks to 2 months, and that is a high priority.\n  Because people came to me, including the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, and outlined these problems, we \nagreed--Senator Chafee and I and others--- that we would bring this \nbill to the floor as quickly as possible.\n We have done that and, frankly, with great difficulty, simply because \nwe have been focused on the Superfund issues. I did not anticipate the \namount of amendments and the amount of opposition that would be \ngenerated on this bill.\n\n  But let me just make this very clear to my colleagues. I believe this \nis an emergency bill for those communities or individuals or entities \nthat have let those bonds. There are communities in a number of States \nthat need quick passage of this legislation to provide them with the \nfinancial relief for their previously flow-controlled facilities. If \nthis bill gets bogged down because of amendments, everyone trying to \nget \n [[Page S6423]] their way--they want total flow control or no flow \ncontrol or no grandfathering or we move into the interstate waste \ntransfer and they want no exporting or total exporting or the Governor \nhaving the total right to make decisions and communities having no \nrights or whatever--whatever the position may be, if they insist on \nthat, this bill will get bogged down. It will not get passed by the end \nof this week, this legislative week, on Friday. And the budget will be \nup next week.\n  After that, I cannot imagine where there will be a window of time to \ndeal with this again. So I appeal to my colleagues who desperately want \nthis bill to help them and their communities in their States with this \nflow control to not hold this bill up by adding amendments or trying to \nadd amendments that may in fact derail it. Because once it is derailed, \nin my opinion, it is going to be a long time until it gets back here.\n  It is the leader's decision, of course, when it comes up. But the \npoint is there is so much on the table after Monday when the budget \ncomes up, any discussion of flow control, with all due respect, is \ngoing to be way down here when the budget and the numbers in that get \nout and the American people begin to interact with their Senators and \nCongressmen on that.\n  So I think there is going to be a lot of discussion. If Members \nchoose to oppose this or dilute it or whatever they choose to do, or \neven--maybe they would like to strengthen it--they will do it at their \nown peril. This issue, which has been simmering for the last 6 or 7 \nyears, will continue to remain on the back burner during the 104th \nCongress.\n  I hope that does not happen, but the choice is clear. Either vote to \npass this bill which has the overwhelming majority support, maybe \nunanimous support, in the Senate and protect those facilities that come \nwithin the scope of this bill, or risk it all to protect a small \nhandful of communities that do not fit within this legislation, who are \ntrying desperately to create a situation where, if they want to have \nflow control at some point in the future, they can have it, or if they \nhave let a little bit of money out there somewhere, a relatively \ninsignificant amount, and they are not sure what they are going to do--\nthat violates the spirit and intent of this bill and I hope it does not \nhappen.\n  We will be down here as long as it takes to deal with the amendments. \nI appeal to colleagues, if they have amendments, let us try to work \nthem out. We will try to work out the ones we agree with, and if we can \nagree with them, we will accept them. If they violate the spirit and \nintent of what we tried to do in drafting this bill, we will oppose \nthem forcefully on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let me conclude with a brief summary as follows. Communities out \nthere, as far as flow control is concerned, are in a tough situation. \nAccording to the public securities situation, $20 billion in bonds have \nbeen issued to pay for flow-controlled facilities. That is not the \nfault of the U.S. Senate. The interstate commerce clause, I believe, \nwas in effect when that happened. But somehow it got ignored and they \ngot into this bind and they have $20 billion in let bonds.\n  We are going to try to help them and we do help them with this \nlegislation. We grandfather them, we protect them. We protect the \ninvestors, the bondholders, the taxpayers, the individuals out there \nwho have in whatever way participated in these bonds.\n  As a result of the Carbone decision, the Supreme Court invalidated \nflow control, so it is in limbo. Here we are in limbo. Nobody knows \nwhat to do. They do not know whether to proceed or not to proceed, \nbecause they do not know what Congress is going to do in regard to the \ninterpretation of that decision.\n  Six incinerators in New Jersey have had their bond ratings lowered, \nand I am sure that is the case in other States, because flow control \nwas invalidated. Again, we are trying to help those communities. That \nis the goal. Dozens of incinerators and landfills are in immediate \ndanger if flow control is not reauthorized immediately, and every bond \nbased on flow control authority is threatened, every one. Every single \nbond out there is threatened unless we do something soon. The longer it \ngoes on the worse the threat gets.\n  So the bill provides a narrow flow control authority to protect those \nbonds. Again, it is a compromise. It is a fair compromise. It is not my \nposition totally. I would be for no flow control. That is not my \nposition. But it is a compromise position to help those individuals.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and indicate I hope we \ncould get some time agreements and some reasonable information \nregarding these amendments. If Members who have amendments could come \nto the floor and offer them in a timely manner so we do not get bogged \ndown and not pass this bill by the end of the week.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6419-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR--S. 534\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nas an original cosponsor of the Endangered Species Act Reform \nAmendments of 1995. This bill is the result of several years' work. The \nbill represents the culmination of a broad, grassroots effort to bring \nbalance to the Endangered Species Act. This coalition consists of \nminers, ranchers, loggers, refiners, manufacturers, the fisheries \nindustry, and organized labor.\n  There are problems with the current Endangered Species Act. The \nEndangered Species Act is an act that has gone awry. It is wreaking \nhavoc on our communities and economies, particularly in the Pacific \nNorthwest, but increasingly nationwide. It is devastating entire \nregions and industries. In the Pacific Northwest alone, since the \nspotted owl was listed as threatened in 1990, millions of acres of \nFederal timberland and thousands of private acres have been set aside. \nIt takes about 1,300 acres for a pair of owls to breed, so we are told. \nWe have set aside thousands and thousands and thousands of acres in \nhopes of the owl being saved. No guarantee it will, no guarantee it \nwill not, but a tremendous damper on legitimate economic activity.\n  It has impacted tens of thousands of human beings and hundreds of \nrural communities. The estimates on job losses range from a low of \n35,000 to a high of 150,000 in the Pacific Northwest.\n  I was here when the act was originally passed, and I remember what \nour intention was. We were thinking ``a'' project: a dam, a road, a \ncanal versus a species. When you read the debate, when the original \nEndangered Species Act was passed, I do not recall the word \n``ecosystem'' being mentioned in the debate. None of us was thinking of \nan entire section of the country being affected by one species. Yet \nthis act is now being used as a tool by environmental groups to further \ntheir agenda of locking up not only all public land but much private \nland as well.\n  I want to emphasize again, this act applies to private land. For a \nlong time I think people thought this was a public land issue in the \nWest, that while it might limit the activities of the U.S. Forest \nService or the Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Park Service, it \ndid not affect private land. It does. It affects your right in \nownership. It can diminish the value of your land in every sense. The \nGovernment can take your property under the current Endangered Species \nAct and not pay you. Private property owners are increasingly losing \nthe right to use their property as they intended.\n  Let us look at the economic cost of the Endangered Species Act. \nEdward O. Wilson, a renowned entomologist, has observed that there may \nbe something \n [[Page S6424]] on the order of 100 million species and yet only 1.4 \nmillion have been named. How many billions of dollars are we willing to \nspend attempting to save insects, bacteria, fungi--that we have never \nheard of, never identified, for which there may be little or no chance \nof recovery. Yet in the effort, we will cause dislocation and hardship \nfor thousands and thousands of people.\n  The social impacts are no less devastating. Professor Lee, Robert \nLee, at the University of Washington in Seattle in the College of \nForestry Resources, has an interesting background: an undergraduate \ndegree from the University of California in sociology and then a \ngraduate degree in forestry. He has done extensive work on the social \ntrauma that affects timber towns. He points to the destruction of \nfamilies, long-lasting social fallout. He can identify it, pinpoint it. \nHe points out that, if you are going to go ahead and apply the \nEndangered Species Act and close the mill in this town--and it does not \ntake a very big mill if you have a town of 2000 and you have a mill \nthat employs 150 people--that mill is in essence the backbone of the \ntown. If you close it, he says he can guarantee that you will see an \nincrease in suicides, homicides, divorce, juvenile delinquency, drug \nabuse, spousal and child abuse.\n  He is not saying that in this town this is all going to happen. What \nhe is saying is when you take a 45- or 50-year-old mill worker who \nmarried his childhood sweetheart in high school, lived in town all of \nhis life, his children are in the school, he is making $25,000, \n$26,000, or $28,000 in the mill, it is the only job he is trained for, \nand the only principal occupation in town is the mill. It is closed. \nHis mother is still alive and he does not want to leave the town. You \ntake away his livelihood. The Federal Government takes away his \nlivelihood.\n  Professor Lee says you can bank on it, as sure as we are here, that \nyou are going to have the increases that I talked about in the \nsuicides, homicides, the abuses, the divorces, and alcoholism. It is \nunderstandable when you think about it. A 45- or 50-year-old is not \nlikely retrained, does not want to move from town, has lived there all \nof his life. Those things are as likely to happen as you and I being in \nthis Chamber today.\n  It is ironic that for years we considered the needs of humans as \nthough nothing else mattered. During that period, probably a long \nperiod in our country when we developed this country, from \napproximately 1800 to 1960, we moved west. We gave no thought to \nlimitation of resources because we thought the resources were \nunlimited. I am old enough to remember in the Pacific Northwest within \nthe last 30 to 35 years when the electric companies advertised: ``Use \nmore electricity. The more you use, the less per unit you will pay. \nHave an all-electric house, electric furnace, electric air \nconditioning.'' The theme was, we will never be able to use all of the \nelectricity we generate. If we ever have to have more, we will build \nanother dam. Or, as we got into the seventies, we will build nuclear \nplants. But it was use, use, use.\n  As we moved across the West, the pioneers came over those mountains \nand they looked at valleys and mountains of timber, timber, and more \ntimber. It is understandable why they thought that those resources \ncould never be used up. These resources were plentiful. The pioneers \nwere not malicious people; they were not greedy; they were not selfish. \nBut they saw the land and thought it was good and right to develop it.\n  Mr. President, if 100 years ago, 150 years ago, we had on the books, \nonly two laws, the Endangered Species Act and the Wetlands legislation, \nwe would not have developed the West. Every railroad you see, once you \nget across the Great Plains, is built on rivers and fill. We never \nwould have cleared the valleys, never would have cut the trees and \npried out the rocks and farmed it. You would have been prohibited from \ndoing it by just those two acts. But as people moved west, they saw \nnothing wrong with clearing the land. As a matter of fact, the native \nAmericans, and the early settlers, when they were there saw nothing \nwrong with burning the trees. They did this not for any kind of \nmalicious intent; they burned for ecological reasons. I doubt if you \ncould do that today.\n  Things changed. I understand why. You had the century and a half of \nmoving west. You developed the resources, harnessed the rivers, and \nplowed the land. There was not much thought about the environment, and \ncertainly not much thought at all about endangered species. Then along \ncame Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, which I like to say is the \npivot upon which the environmental movement started. Basically, the \nbook dealt with agricultural pesticides and runoffs and the damage \nthese were doing. But from that moment forward, you could see the \npendulum, which had swung for 160 years toward development and \nexploitation of the resources, swing in the other direction. Now the \npendulum has swung completely the other way.\n  I do not level this charge at everybody who is a member of the Sierra \nClub or the Wilderness Society. By far, most of them are very \nreasonable, decent people. But they are accusing unjustifiably a group \nof people who are excellent stewards of the land, people who living on \nthe land and taking care of the land and replenishing the land. The \nirresponsible utilization of natural resources is wrong. But I do not \nknow anybody who is a farmer who wants to misuse and abuse his or her \nland and not have the option of passing it along to their children. I \ndo not know of anyone--if they used to exist, I do not know them now--\nin the timber industry who wants to cut and run. Everyone I know in the \ntimber industry who is in the industry wants to cut and plant and grow, \nand cut and plant and grow forever on an intelligent, sustained-yield \npractice of forestry.\n  There is only one group where I have seen a danger. And it is not \ntheir fault, and I do not blame them. You are a little woodlot owner. \nYou have 60 or 70 acres of land. You are not Weyerhauser. You are not a \ncommercial timber company. But you have 60 or 70 acres of land. You \nhave been managing it well, and you cut a bit, and you plant a bit. You \nwill use some of it to educate your kids, and maybe some of it to help \ntheir families, and maybe some of it for retirement. You are faced now \nwith the possibility, under the Endangered Species Act, that you may be \nprohibited from cutting on your land at all. Right at the moment, you \nare not cutting and had not intended to cut. Do you know what you are \nthinking to yourself? ``I had better do it now. I had better cut and \nrun and get out while I can still get my money to educate my kids and \ndo some of the other things I had planned to do, because maybe in 5 \nyears, the Endangered Species Act will not let me cut at all.'' This is \na person who is willing to and had planned to cut and plant land that \nwill be in the family for generations. These are the kinds of \nunintended consequences we face because of this act.\n  Under the Endangered Species Act, we have to remember that we must \nbalance both species and humans. But here is the problem with the \npresent act. I want to phrase this carefully. This is the present act. \nWhen you are determining whether or not a species is threatened or \nendangered--those are the two classifications under the act--you are to \nuse the best scientific evidence, and nobody quarrels with that.\n  Realizing science can be wrong, you may recall that science said if \nwe built the Tellico Dam, the snail darter would disappear. We went \nthrough a long battle on the Tellico Dam. Finally, the Endangered \nSpecies Committee--the God Squad, as we call it--said if we built the \ndam, the snail darter would disappear and that was to be the end of it. \nCongress overruled the Endangered Species Committee and said finish the \ndam, build the dam. We do not care if the snail darter disappears. The \ndam is all but done. We just have not dropped the gate. Go ahead with \nit. We were told we would run the risk of the snail darter \ndisappearing. The best scientific evidence said it would disappear. \nWhat happened? We dropped the gate, the reservoir filled up, and the \nsnail darter exists in all of the streams that flow into the reservoir. \nScience was absolutely wrong. This is no excuse not to use science, but \nscience is not perfect.\n  I have no quarrel with listing a species as threatened or endangered \nand using the best science that we know. I would like there to be good \nscientific peer review, and I would like a chance to appeal to the \ncourts should you have a really horrendously bad decision. But \n [[Page S6425]] I think the best science ought to be used.\n  Now you come to the issue of whether or not you are going to have a \nrecovery plan to try to save the species. And here, only the species \ncounts. If you cannot come up with a recovery plan under the present \nlaw, if you cannot come up with a recovery plan that will save the \nspecies, or, to put it the other way around, if every recovery plan \nthat you can think of by the best scientific evidence will lead to the \nextinction of the species, then nothing else counts. People do not \ncount. Revenues to counties do not count. Whether or not the schools \nhave enough money to keep going does not count. Nothing counts but the \nspecies, and that is where this act is not balanced.\n  So, Mr. President, I am glad to join a number of my fellow Senators \nin introducing amendments to the Endangered Species Act. We think these \namendments are a balance. We are not getting rid of the act. We are not \ngetting rid of science. As a matter of fact, we are asking for stronger \nscience, for better science, for better review. But this act finally \nallows people to be considered as much as bugs. And that has been the \nfailing of the present law.\n  I hope the Senate will favorably consider this. I am proud to join as \na cosponsor.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues as an original cosponsor of \nthe Endangered Species Act Reform Amendments of 1995.\n  This bill is the result of several years' work.\n  The bill represents the culmination of broad grassroots efforts to \nbring balance to the Endangered Species Act.\n  This broad grassroots coalition consists of miners, ranchers, \nloggers, farmers, manufacturers, the fisheries industry, and organized \nlabor.\n\n\n              problems with current endangered species act\n\n  The Endangered Species Act is an act gone awry. The act is wreaking \nhavoc on our communities and economies, particularly in the Pacific \nNorthwest, but increasingly nationwide. The act is devastating entire \nindustries and regions.\n  In the Pacific Northwest alone, since the spotted owl was listed as \nthreatened in 1990, millions of acres of Federal timberland and \nthousands of private acres have been set aside for owls.\n  The act has impacted tens of thousands of human beings and hundreds \nof rural communities.\n  Estimates of the number of jobs lost as a result of the listing range \nanywhere from 35,000 to 150,000.\n  The act was originally intended to ensure the survival of species \nthat were threatened by site-specific projects, such as roads, dams, \nand sewer systems\n  The act is now being used as a tool by environmental groups to \nfurther their agenda of locking up not only all public land, but \nprivate land as well.\n  Private property owners are increasingly losing the right to use \ntheir property as they intended.\n\n\n                         economic costs of esa\n\n  Edward O. Wilson, a renowned entomologist at Harvard observes that \nthere may be something on the order of 100 million species.\n  Yet only 1.4 million have been named.\n  How many billions of dollars are we willing to spend attempting to \nsave: fungi, insects, and bacteria we've never heard of, and species \nfor which there may be little or no chance of recovery in any case.\n\n\n                          social costs of esa\n\n  While the economic costs of protecting species is great, the social \nimpacts are no less devastating.\n  Robert Lee, sociologist with the University of Washington College of \nForest Resources, has done extensive research on the social trauma \nafflicting timber towns. He points to the destruction of families and \nlong-lasting social fallout in the form of suicide, homicide, divorce, \njuvenile delinquency, drug abuse, and spousal and child abuse.\n  It is ironic that for years we considered the needs of humans as \nthough nothing else mattered.\n  Now, under the Endangered Species Act, we are considering the needs \nof fish, wildlife, and plants as though nothing else matters.\n  Both policies are short-sighted and flawed.\n\n\n                            current efforts\n\n  We need a process which not only protects plants and animals, but one \nwhich recognizes legitimate human needs as well.\n  That is why, in the last Congress, I joined with Senators Gorton, \nShelby and others in introducing legislation to bring balance to the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  This year, with even stronger bipartisan support, we have again \nintroduced legislation to require that the economic and social impacts \nof Federal efforts to protect species be fully considered.\n                            summary of bill\n\n  Our bill contains several components essential to meaningful reform.\n  The bill reforms the process by which species are listed as \nthreatened or endangered:\n  Requires independent scientific peer review of the science;\n  Requires better data collection.\n  Provides for broader participation by affected States and the public;\n  Requires judicial review of listing decisions;\n  In place of intensive Federal management, the bill includes \nincentives to encourage private landowners to protect species, such as:\n  Encouraging the exchange of private land for Federal land to provide \nhabitat for affected species; and\n  Establishing a Federal cost-share program for any direct costs \nimposed on a private person.\n  Our bill requires the Secretary to set a ``conservation objective,'' \nranging from full recovery of the species to solely protecting the \nspecies from actions which would directly injure or kill the species.\n  In other words, the Secretary could decide to allow a species to go \nextinct.\n  Our bill requires that economic and social impacts are fully \nconsidered in the development of conservation measures.\n  Our bill changes the statutory definition of ``harm'' and ``take'' to \nmean the actual injury or killing of a member of a species.\n  ``Harm'' will no longer apply to the modification of a species' \nhabitat as the courts have broadly interpreted current law.\n  Our bill minimizes the impacts to private property.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  It is not our goal to abandon our national commitment to the \nprotection of endangered species; however, we cannot protect every \nimaginable species.\n  We can do a better job of balancing jobs and economic opportunity \nwith species protection.\n  While this bill does not go as far as I would like, it will begin the \ndebate which is long overdue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, President Clinton has gone to Moscow, \nand he has come home with nothing. I repeat: President Clinton has gone \nto Moscow, and he has come home with nothing.\n  There has not been much coverage yet of the summit over there in \nRussia, but it is pretty clear that President Clinton has in effect \ngone to Moscow, given President Yeltsin an opportunity to show that he \ncan deliver the President of the United States for a celebration of the \nend of World War II, and we have had no progress on stopping the sale \nof nuclear material to Iran, no apologies about the slaughter of 25,000 \npeople in Chechnya.\n  In summary, Mr. President, very little, if anything, has been \naccomplished at this summit that would benefit this country.\n  Now, arguably, our President showing up over there has helped \nPresident \n [[Page S6426]] Yeltsin and the Russians, but typically we think of \nthese summits as producing something beneficial for our side. It does \nnot seem to me there has been one single step in the direction that we \nwould like to see us go as a result of this summit.\n  The issue, of course, is not whether we have a relationship with \nRussia. We all want to have a relationship with Russia. The question \nis, What kind of relationship is it going to be?\n  During the past 2 years, we have seen a real change in the makeup of \nPresident Yeltsin's inner cycle or kitchen cabinet. He has fired \nreformers and replaced them with hard-line reactionary advisers who are \nsuspicious of free market reforms and suspicious of democracy. Some \nobservers have said there is only one reformer left in the cabinet and \nhe is the one they sent over here to the United States to talk to \npeople in the Senate.\n  In a recent hearing, I asked Deputy Secretary Talbott to identify a \nsingle voice of reason in the kitchen cabinet; just one. Secretary \nTalbott changed the subject.\n  Yeltsin's decisions are making it very difficult to sustain support \nfor assistance to Russia.\n  In February, Secretary Christopher said the President would not go to \nMoscow for a summit if Chechnya were unresolved. Well, the President is \nthere and Chechnya is unresolved. Almost as soon as that line was drawn \nin the sand by President Clinton, he backed down.\n  Current Russian policy test United States interests and principles. \nIn fact, current Russian policy makes no sense at all, Mr. President.\n  In Chechnya, basic principles of democracy and human rights are under \nsiege. It really begs the question: Does a democratic government turn \nits guns on its civilians, killing 25,000 men, women, and children?\n  Preliminary indications are we have accepted Yeltsin's determination \nthat this is basically an internal matter and is none of our business. \nEssentially, that is what President Yeltsin said: ``This is our affair. \nYou butt out, President Clinton.''\n  Both our security interests and our allies are threatened by the \npending sale of nuclear technology to Iran. The biggest current issue \nbetween ourselves and the Russians is the pending sale of nuclear \ntechnology to Iran. And the President has said earlier in the year he \nwould not go to Moscow for this celebration of V-E Day unless there was \nprogress on that issue. Well, there has been no progress. The nuclear \nsale continues to go forward.\n  This agreement that the administration has announced that there will \nbe no sale of the centrifuge technology is simply not adequate. That is \na figleaf to allow President Clinton to claim somehow that progress was \nmade on deterring the nuclear transfer to Iran when, in fact, no real \nprogress has been made.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, nothing has changed on the issue \nof NATO expansion and other European security questions. Everyone was \nsurprised by the Russian reversal last December when Yeltsin and \nKozyrev denounced NATO plans to enlarge itself and rejected the \nPartnership for Peace program. Combined with recent statements that \nMoscow has the right to use force to protect Russian minorities in the \nSoviet Republics, leaders across the region are justifiably concerned. \nIt should have been essential for the summit to produce a concrete \ncommitment by Yeltsin to respect the political, economic and \nterritorial sovereignty of those countries that used to make up the \nSoviet Union.\n  In summary, Mr. President, what is going on here is the Russians are \nsaying, ``We don't want you to expand NATO. And, oh, by the way, all \nthe countries that we used to dominate, that used to be part of the \nSoviet Union, are our business and none of yours.''\n  No progress has been made at this summit on any of these issues; not \na single shred of evidence of any progress whatsoever on any of these \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I, like many Members of the Senate, want to get along \nwith the Russians. Obviously, we have a better relationship than we did \nduring the cold war, but some days I wonder where this relationship is \ngoing. It seems to me, by pursuing this Moscow myopia, this view that \nwhatever Yeltsin wants Yeltsin gets, by pursuing that particular point \nof view, we stand no chance of having the opportunity to build a \ngenuinely constructive relationship with the Russians.\n  So let me just, in sum, Mr. President, say that I think this summit \nhas been a disappointment. I am sorry that President Yeltsin has been \nunable to commit to any of the progress that we had hoped for, but \nmostly I am sorry that President Clinton chose to go. Why is he there?\n  At virtually every summit in my memory, something has been brought \nback that was arguably in the interest of the United States. President \nClinton has gone to Moscow, gone to Moscow at President Yeltsin's \nrequest, given President Yeltsin an opportunity to look good, made no \nprogress on the nuclear sale to Iran, made no progress on the expansion \nof NATO, and comes home emptyhanded. So, by any standard, Mr. \nPresident, this summit is a disappointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6425-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6426-S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today has \nturned its attention relatively early in the session to a bill of \nprimary importance to my State of Indiana and to many other States in \nthis Nation. It is a bill that the Senate is very familiar with, one to \nallow States to limit the importation of out-of-State waste. We have \ndiscussed it on numerous occasions.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Smith of \nNew Hampshire, and the chairman of the full committee, Senator Chafee, \nfor bringing this bill to the floor, as well as the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, and, of course, Senator Dole for scheduling this \nlegislation.\n  Early in my Senate career, which has not been that long, I observed a \nphenomenon in Indiana as I was driving through the State. All across \nthe State homemade signs posted on telephone poles or stuck in the \nground appeared that said, ``Don't dump on us.''\n  I began to inquire what the subject was. We checked into that and \nfound that the citizens throughout Indiana, many small towns in \nparticular, found that, instead of the local garbage dump which \nreceived a truck or two of local community waste, garbage, a day, \nsuddenly they discovered that 18-wheelers were lined up for blocks \nwaiting to enter the local dump to dump their waste. And people said, \n``Where is all this coming from?''\n  You really cannot call these facilities landfills, because they were \ndesigned for receipt of small amounts of everyday household trash, \nwaste, that was picked up maybe a couple of times a week at most and \ndelivered to the local dump.\n  In a little more than a year, our State saw negligible volumes of \nout-of-State trash that were coming into the State explode to more than \n20 percent of our total waste disposal. Virtually overnight, the State \nof Indiana became a target for out-of-State trash.\n  The statistics do not begin to tell the story. Because, as I said, \nthe trash parade targeted many small communities in rural areas in \nIndiana.\n So the magnitude of the change was dramatic for the citizens of those \ncommunities.\n\n  Let me just tell you one story, the story of Center Point. This small \ntown in Indiana, a town of 250 people, had a local garbage dump. Not a \nlandfill, it was not certified as a big landfill. It was just a place \nwhere the local citizens were able to dispose of their local trash. A \ncouple of trucks picked up the trash in the community and surrounding \nareas and disposed of it in this area.\n  In 1989, the local landfill was purchased by out-of-State investors, \nand the site was doubled. Ads began appearing in national magazines \nthat said: ``Send us your trash.'' Narrow country lanes were clogged \nwith 18-wheelers loaded with trash and garbage from other States. Local \ncitizens, rightfully so, I believe, began to keep a watch on a daily \nbasis, on a 24-hour-a-day basis. They would log in the license plates \nof the trucks coming to bring the trash, \n [[Page S6427]] and we found that most of it was coming from just a few \nStates.\n  I heard about the incident. I asked my staff to take me there. We \nwent early one morning, and we stood on a hill overlooking the \nlandfill, which now had been expanded considerably. I saw on this \nnarrow, unpaved country lane a whole long line of 18-wheeler trucks \nthat had driven all night to bring east coast waste to Indiana because \nthe disposal fees were so much less than they were at the point of \norigin.\n  Suddenly, this little town of Center Point was overwhelmed, as its \nfragile country roads were torn up by the weight of the 18-wheelers, as \nsigns and posts were knocked over as the 18-wheelers tried to negotiate \nthe narrow turns, and as a landfill facility, a garbage disposal \nfacility designed to take care of the needs of that community for many, \nmany years in the future suddenly was the subject of unwanted and \nextraordinary volumes of trash, which became obvious were going to \nquickly fill up that local community's disposal site, leaving its local \ncitizens with no local option to deal with their own waste problem.\n  Capacity that was sufficient to meet local needs for years was \nsuddenly being used up in months. Hoosiers were understandably angry, \nand I was angry. We had a very clear message we wanted to deliver, and \nI delivered that on this Senate floor: That our State, which had \nmustered the political will to site landfill capacity in our own State \nborders, within those borders, to dispose of our own generated waste, \nwere overwhelmed by trash flowing from States that were unwilling to \nresponsibly handle their own waste.\n  Today, Mr. President, over 15 million tons of trash cross State \nlines. Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan have borne a \ndisproportionate share of receiving that capacity. We happen to be on \nan interstate route that runs east to west, Interstate 70. Interstate \n70 has become the trash corridor for the flow of east coast trash to \nlower fee landfills in the Midwest.\n  Americans throw away about 180 million tons of solid waste yearly. \nThat is enough trash to spread 30 stories high over 1,000 football \nfields. The question that confronts us is where are we going to put all \nthis? Some communities have been pretty creative. Ten miles from \ndowntown Detroit, there is an old landfill accommodating 21 years' \nworth of the city's garbage. It rises 150 feet into the sky. It no \nlonger receives trash, but city officials have covered it with some top \nfill and they make snow in the winter and they declared it a ski area. \nIt is colloquially called ``Mount Trashmore,'' and it attracts \nthousands of visitors a year. But for most, trash is not a recreational \nresource; it is a municipal nightmare. Landfills fill up, and there is \nnowhere else to take the waste.\n  So our Nation's heartland is becoming our Nation's wasteland as trash \nincreasingly moves across State lines following the route of cheap \ndisposal from the East to the West.\n  Of the 15 million tons of trash crossing State lines, Indiana, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan have borne, as I said, a \ndisproportionate share. This rising tide of trash wreaks havoc with our \nplanning efforts which, by our own State law, must ensure local \ncapacity for 20 years.\n  Some States have reacted to this influx of out-of-State trash by \nforbidding all new landfill sites. Others have taken measures which \namount to the nationalization of the trash industry by banning for-\nprofit disposal facilities in order to give States control over this. \nBecause public facilities may discriminate between in-State and out-of-\nState, one method of eliminating unwanted out-of-State trash is to \nrestrict the commercial sector altogether.\n  These are not feasible solutions. These do not go to solving the \nproblem. Our own legislature has tried to take care of the problem, but \nhas found that its ability to act effectively is extraordinarily \nlimited. We had a discussion of that this morning. The Senator from \nRhode Island, and others, talked about the fact that under the commerce \nclause of the Constitution, garbage waste is considered a part of \ninterstate commerce, and unless the Congress affirmatively acts to \ngrant States and local jurisdictions the authority to control the flow \nof waste, they do not have the power to do so. That is why we are here. \nThat is why we have been pursuing for these last several years the \nprospect of giving these States and these local communities the \nauthority to regulate the flow of out-of-State trash.\n  We passed laws in Indiana, for instance, that would impose additional \nfees, that allowed us to check the content of the material coming in. \nThe statute that we passed was on the books 4 days before it was \nchallenged in the court as a violation of the commerce clause, and that \ncase eventually was lost by the State.\n  Frustrated by the court decisions, Indiana has turned to bilateral \nagreements. Our Governor and the former Governor of New Jersey agreed \nto cooperate in stopping illegal waste from New Jersey. They agreed to \nshare information and to pursue joint investigations.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of waste shipped across State lines \nis not illegal waste, it is just ordinary garbage. It is the coffee \ngrounds and eggshells and orange peels, discarded Dr. Pepper bottles, \nthe newspaper, unless it is recycled--just the ordinary waste that each \nof us carries out to the trash bin in the garage and puts out once or \ntwice a week in front of the house.\n  In addition, we have no way to accurately count the amount of trash \nwe are receiving illegally to determine what that is. Many shipments \nare sent indirectly through collecting points in other States. To \ndetermine what came from a particular State to Indiana that might be \nlegal or illegal requires a procedure that is an investigative \nnightmare.\n  As our own Governor has indicated, and as many other Governors have \nindicated, and as I believe a solid majority of Senators and \nRepresentatives have indicated, the only hope for a solution lies with \nFederal legislation.\n  In November 1989, my first year in the Senate, the 101st Congress, I \nintroduced the first bill in the Senate which would allow States to \nban, regulate, or impose fees on the interstate transportation of solid \nwaste. After a strenuous debate, this bill passed by a very significant \nand, I think, surprising vote of 68-31. Unfortunately, in the \nconference with the House of Representatives, the bill which was passed \nhere was stripped from that bill and the legislation died before \nbecoming law.\n  In the very next Congress, I again introduced legislation and again \nforced the issue on the Senate floor. And, again, the Senate acted \ndecisively on the interstate issue, now by a vote of 89-2. The Senators \nbecame aware of the problem and realized that their States may not have \nbeen the current target of out-of-State waste, but a little bit further \ndown the road they were going to become targets. Many realized that the \nproblem we identified in Indiana in 1989 was now a problem in their \nState. Senator Exon came to me and said, ``Since you raised this issue, \nI have discovered communities in my own State that are becoming the \nrecipients of out-of-State trash and they are overwhelming our efforts \nto deal with this.''\n  That bill I introduced in the 102d Congress operated on three basic \nprinciples: First, it allowed communities that did not currently \nreceive out-of-State trash to prohibit new shipments without express \nauthorization. Second, it grandfathered facilities that were receiving \ntrash from other States in order to give the exporting States time to \nsite their own State capacity. It recognized that States in the crowded \neast coast corridor had significant waste disposal problems, and that \nto simply slam the door and say that, as of this date forward, you \ncannot export any trash whatsoever was simply not going to be a \nsolution to the problem. So in recognizing that, we grandfathered a \ncertain amount of shipment of out-of-State waste.\n  Third, it allowed Governors the authority to freeze volumes at \ncurrent levels at the grandfathered facilities, because we wanted to \ngive the Governors of the importing States the ability to say we can \ncontinue to take so much with this capacity but no more. Again, that \nlegislation, while it passed the Senate 89-2, did not pass the House of \nRepresentatives and it died in that Congress.\n  In the next Congress, the 103d Congress, I used those principles to \ncraft \n [[Page S6428]] legislation that the Senate again positively addressed \nand the House positively addressed, but unfortunately it died in the \nlast hours of the session coming very close to being enacted into law.\n  Now, here we are in the 104th Congress and I indicated back in 1989 \nthat this issue was not going to go away. They can kill it in \nconference; the House can kill it; it can die by procedural methods, \nbut I was not going to give up. I was like a dog who had his teeth sunk \ndeep in the bone and I was not going to let go; I was going to come \nback and back and back until we got this thing passed. And here I am in \nthe 104th Congress, and I hope this time we will be successful. I am \ngetting lockjaw from keeping my teeth locked onto this issue. I would \nlike to release that grip, send it to the President, get it signed into \nlaw, and move on to some other legislation.\n  Now, the bill before us today recognizes the principles upon which we \nhave operated. The bill, I think, is a reasonable compromise that \ngrants States and local communities the authority that they need to \nplan for their own needs, to say ``no'' to out-of-State trash. It \nrecognizes the problems of exporting States, and it gives them methods \nand ways in which to reduce significantly the amount of trash they send \nout of State. It balances a lot of different needs. As has been \ndescribed here, it deals with flow control and ground water monitoring.\n  The heart and soul of this bill, however, is the question of \ninterstate trash shipment. We are working now on some areas of the bill \nthat we feel may need some adjustment, as it has come out of committee. \nThere are negotiations underway, and I trust they will be successful \nand will allow us to avoid offering some amendments to clarify some of \nthese provisions.\n  We will talk a little bit more about that later.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if I can ask a question.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. First, I want to confirm that indeed the Senator has sunk \nhis teeth and jaws deep into this issue. I will second everything he \nsaid about his determination on this whole project. He has been at it \nfor, I guess, 5, 6 years, whatever.\n  Mr. COATS. Six years.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator mentioned he had some amendments which I \nguess he is going to discuss now.\n  Mr. COATS. Actually, I plan to defer discussion of those amendments \nnow because we are in negotiation with the Senator from Rhode Island, \nand other Senators of affected States, to try to reach a resolution on \nthese amendments, which we can hopefully put into a package that would \nbe acceptable and offer them as a package rather than as individual \namendments. So I would be premature in offering those amendments at \nthis particular time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am caught in kind of a bind in that I want to be here \nwhen the Senator makes his remarks and offers his amendment. But I may \nhave to step out for a minute or two. Who is working with the Senator \nin connection with his amendments? You mentioned ``we.'' Is it several \nof you?\n  Mr. COATS. I say to the Senator from Rhode Island that it is \nvirtually all of the affected parties, both from the exporting States \nas well as the importing States that are working together to try to \nresolve these issues.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine.\n  Mr. COATS. I will not bring up any amendments in the immediate time \nperiod ahead of us here, and certainly the Senator will have an \nopportunity to leave the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. OK. Because there is going to come a time when we are \ngoing to want amendments brought forward. If the Senator feels he is \nnot quite ready, we will try and complete any negotiations. As the \nleader has indicated, he wants to finish this bill by the end of the \nweek. My hope is that we can finish it tomorrow. So we will work with \nyour folks and see if we cannot come to some conclusion at least by the \ntime we go to work tomorrow.\n  Mr. COATS. I appreciate that very much. Obviously, the Senator's \ncooperation and input is necessary for this. I am anxious, also, to \nmove forward on this. I would be delighted if we can finish this bill \ntomorrow and not have to carry it over until Friday. We are working as \nwe speak on this matter and hope to have some answer to the Senator \nshortly.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. In conclusion, Mr. President, let me just say that we have \ntried several approaches. We have tried the path of patience. We have \nwaited our turn and bided our time. We have agreed to continue to \naccept some levels of out-of-State waste in exchange for having \nrealistic controls over how much waste we will receive from other \nStates. There is simply no other way for States to realistically plan \nfor their own future capacity, unless we can enact legislation that \ngives them the authority to regulate the volume of out-of-State trash \nwhich that State receives.\n  The problem here is very basic. There is no negotiation; there is no \narm's length or both-parties-at-the-table negotiation that takes place, \nbecause States are virtually powerless to sit at the table with the \nexporters and sit down and say, let us establish some reasonable \nvolumes, let us make sure that we have the capacity to receive what you \nare sending in; let us negotiate the fees on which this will be shipped \nback and forth; let us determine the terms of the contract.\n  Because of the Constitution's commerce clause, it is possible--and it \nis a practice that has been used over and over again--for someone \noutside the State, or even inside the State, to purchase a landfill and \nsuddenly open up that landfill, which was designed originally for local \nneeds, to massive volumes of out-of-State trash, which fills up the \nlandfill in a very short period of time and leaves the local citizens \nfew, if any, alternatives. In fact, it forces them to ship their waste \nout of State in order to find a place to dispose of it.\n  So we end up with a game of pass the trash. Everybody is passing it \non down the highway, generally from east to west. Not always. \nMetropolitan areas to rural areas, across State lines, it is pass the \ntrash.\n  As the landfills get filled up, no new ones get built, no new efforts \nput in place to dispose of out-of-State waste, to reduce the amount, to \nrecycle, to reduce the amount generated initially, to find other ways \nto dispose of the waste. So we just are moving it around the country to \ndifferent locations, filling up the cheapest hole in the ground that is \navailable for a certain fee for out-of-State trash.\n  In the 5 years that Congress has debated the issue, the trucks \ncontinue to roll. The garbage continues to mount. The changes that we \nare proposing here are not an attack on any particular State. They are \na defense of our own States. They are not rooted in bitterness, but \nthey are rooted in urgent need.\n  Again, I want to commend my colleagues on the Environmental Committee \nfor moving expeditiously in this new Congress on this legislation. I \nlook forward to working with them, to strengthening the bill to ensure \nthat we afford real protection to importing States while allowing \nexporters sufficient time to get their house in order.\n  That is our goal, Mr. President. I am confident that we can \naccomplish that goal in the time that we have in the next day or two. I \nam very, very hopeful that within 48 hours or so we will be able to \nreport that the U.S. Senate has, once again, taken action to deal with \nthis problem and that we will work carefully and closely with the House \nof Representatives, which in my understanding is moving forward on this \nexpeditiously also, and finally resolve this issue and send the \nlegislation to the President's desk for his signature, which in the \npast he has indicated he will sign.\n  Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take to the floor to discuss the \nprovisions of S. 534, the legislation to address the issue of \ninterstate transportation waste and flow control authority. Very often \nwhen one mentions flow control authority, I sense that heads \n [[Page S6429]] begin to drop because of the rather arcane subject but \na very important one.\n  If I can just take a moment to say that flow control--and perhaps it \nhas been discussed on the floor and I missed it but I think the \nimportance of the issue will bear some repetition--gives the States the \nability to control the flow of household trash, particularly trash \nwithin State borders. And while that does not sound like very much to \nask, the fact is that demands are being placed on external facilities' \navailability so that it can simply be trucked, often out-of-State to \nother States, where in many cases there is an objection to receiving \nvolumes of trash. Though there was a Supreme Court case decision not \ntoo long ago that dealt with this and said you cannot stop this, it \ndirects the Congress to resolve the problem and allowed the parameters \nunder which they were to operate to do just that.\n  So if it begins to inhibit the trucking or the transportation of \nwaste outside the State, then within a State, they have to have some \nway of controlling where it goes. Again, though the subject seems a bit \narcane, the fact is that it has enormous influence on States like my \nown who are trying to resolve the need, the ability to deal with their \nwaste in an orderly fashion.\n  Without significant changes to S. 534, my State is going to \nexperience a severe financial crisis precipitated by the Senate's \nfailure to delegate waste management decisions to the States. I am \nhoping through the amendment process that we can improve the bill so \nthat States can continue to handle their waste the way they deem \nappropriate.\n  Title I of the legislation, which addresses interstate restrictions, \nwhich I was talking about earlier, is essentially identical. Title I of \nS. 2345, which was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee last year, overturns the decision of the Supreme Court in the \ncase of New Jersey versus Philadelphia. The Supreme Court's decision \nsaid that interstate restrictions are unconstitutional because a State \ncannot discriminate against a commodity--in this case out-of-State \ntrash--from being transported. The court said that States cannot give \nunfair competitive disadvantage against out-of-State haulers, those who \nare trucking the material from one State to the other who are out of \nState, for example, Pennsylvania to New Jersey, who want to dispose of \ntrash where it makes the most economic sense.\n  So the first title will allow the Governors in each State to restrict \nimports of trash into their States. I have supported this title in the \npast and will support it in the future if States are given the \nauthority to find an alternative to this obstructive commerce to find \nin State solutions that now out-of-State exports would restrict.\n  Unfortunately, S. 534, while giving States new power over interstate \nshipment of waste, actually reduces the authority that they have \nenjoyed within a State to properly handle their waste. That is a \nprincipal problem that I have with title II of S. 534, the title that \ndeals with flow control authority within the State. Once again, I will \ntake a moment to explain why States use flow control.\n  Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1976. \nThe acronym is RCRA. RCRA made standards and improved solid waste \ndisposal methods and practices. Under subtitle (d) of that law, State \nand local governments developed comprehensive waste management plans \nthat meet minimum standards that are set by EPA. Although the law \ncreated national standards imposed through the solid waste management \nplans, Congress recognized that solid waste was a problem traditionally \nmanaged at the local level. Under the philosophy of local control, \nsubtitle (d) gave State and local governments the flexibility they \nneeded to determine the best way to meet the national standards.\n  In response to the Federal mandate that waste should be disposed of \nin an environmentally sound manner, it is hard to disagree with that. \nMany local governments constructed modern, state-of-the-art recycling \nsystems, waste-to-energy facilities, and sanitary landfills. Integrated \nwaste management systems were implemented to promote recycling, \nconsumer education and proper management and disposal of household \nhazardous waste.\n  While necessary and desirable, these facilities were also very \ncostly. The Federal Government does not share the cost of municipal \nsolid waste management disposal at the State and local level. States \nand local governments, therefore, adopted various means to finance \nmunicipal solid waste management services and facilities. The general \napproach taken by State and local government was to issue revenue \nbonds. These bonds were secured by long-term contractual promises which \nrely on a steady, dependable, and consistent quantity of waste for \ndisposal in new facilities. It was their revenue streams, necessary to \npay off the bonds and to meet the financial obligations, that were \nincurred in financing these facilities.\n To ensure guaranteed quantities of waste, cities and towns enact laws \nrequiring that trash generated within their borders be disposed of in \nthese recently financed facilities. Those laws are the ones we commonly \ncall flow control laws.\n\n  Now, these flow control laws were consistent with Congress' \ninstruction in subtitle D that State and local governments endeavor to \nsecure long-term contracts for supplying resource recovery facilities \nand other environmentally responsible waste disposal facilities. It is \nalso consistent with several courts of appeal and State supreme court \ndecisions. However, on May 16, 1994, the legal basis for flow control \nwas overturned by the Supreme Court in the case of Carbone versus \nClarkstown. In the 6-to-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a \nNew York municipality could not require that garbage generated in the \nlocality be sent to a designated waste management facility.\n  And again, though the language is common, I think it is important to \nunderstand what the outcome was, that is, if a community suddenly \nelected to abandon its responsibility to provide trash for a disposal \nfacility, then it left that facility, already financed, with \ninsufficient resources, insufficient revenues to continue to meet the \nfinancial obligations, as well as keeping the facility operating. They \nhad a choice in many cases. They could ship it out of State. But \ninterstate commerce, as we now know it, looks as if it is going to be \nobstructed by the first part of the law being proposed here, the bill \nthat is before the Senate.\n  The Court held that the Clarkstown, NY, flow control ordinance \ninterfered with interstate commerce and deprived out-of-State firms \naccess to the local trash market. Again, out-of-State firms are those \nthat cart the material to landfills that are licensed in other States.\n  As in the New Jersey versus Philadelphia case, States could not \ndiscriminate against out-of-State haulers. In other words, if New \nJersey did not want that garbage, that trash brought into their State, \nit would have been a violation of law, so said the Court in the case of \nNew Jersey versus Philadelphia.\n  The Court held that since Congress had not specifically delegated \nthis power to the States, these flow control laws violated the \ninterstate commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  The May 1994 decision in Carbone invalidated the historic right of \nlocal and State governments to manage solid waste. The case overturned \nalmost 20 years of sound solid waste management policy and is \njeopardizing the solid waste management systems of the over 40 States \nthat rely on flow control authority to manage their solid waste.\n  The Carbone decision makes it difficult for cities to guarantee a \nsteady stream of waste to disposal and processing facilities. Without \nthis guaranteed steady stream of revenues, it will be virtually \nimpossible for the communities to get financing to build solid waste \nmanagement facilities.\n  Second, this decision could result in localities losing the revenue \ngenerated by having garbage sent to municipal disposal facilities.\n  This would eliminate their ability to subsidize nonprofitable waste \nmanagement activities such as recycling and household hazardous waste \nprograms, which have been very effective in many communities, \nespecially in New Jersey. As we have seen in the District of Columbia, \nthe loss of flow control authority threatens existing recycling \nprograms. This article, entitled ``District to Suspend Curbside \nRecycling,'' from the Washington Post of April 12, about a month ago, \nclearly makes the case \n [[Page S6430]] that private haulers taking trash to out-of-State \nlocations to avoid the recycling fees led to this financial crisis.\n  Finally, the Supreme Court decision puts existing bonds used to \nfinance waste management facilities at risk. If localities cannot send \nan adequate level of garbage to a facility to generate the revenue \nneeded to pay off the bonds, those communities face default. Citizens \nin the affected communities could find the possibility of \nextraordinarily high taxes and the inability to go to the financial \nmarkets for any of their needs.\n  The Public Securities Association estimates that $23 billion of bonds \nare in jeopardy because of the Carbone decision and every citizen, \nevery taxpayer in almost every State, has to worry about this because \nsuddenly they could be faced with having to make up the revenue that is \nlost as a result of the decision to ship the material out of State \nbecause there is no flow control on this.\n  In last year's bill, in difficult negotiations with importing States, \nexporting States, and the waste industry, accommodation was reached. S. \n2345 overturned both the Philadelphia case and the Carbone case. It \nrecognized that trash was a local issue and one where States should \nmake the rules, not the Supreme Court and not the Congress.\n  Some amendments were made to assure the maximum amount of competition \nwas included in any flow control program, competition between simply \nshipping it out of State and the need to furnish the local facility \nwith appropriate revenue opportunities. Certain restrictions were \nplaced on Governors' ability to overturn existing contractual \nrelationships. Because of concerns of the waste industry, flow control \ncould not be expanded to States that had not used it before the Carbone \ndecision. Unfortunately, at the last minute, the bill failed to win \nunanimous support.\n  Instead of starting from last year's compromise, this year's bill \ngoes in two different directions. Almost identical to last year's bill, \nGovernors are given the power to shop interstate shipment of waste. \nHowever, the bill goes in the other direction as far as waste within \nStates. Title II, the flow control title, only allows existing flow \ncontrol where default is likely. The title is based on the philosophy \nthat flow control is wrong and anticompetitive, and that protection \nshould be provided for only those communities that are in immediate \nfinancial jeopardy because of the Supreme Court decision in Carbone.\n  Title I, the interstate title, discriminates against free market \nsolutions by allowing States to say no to economically viable \ninterstate shipments. Title II, however, attempts to enshrine the free \nmarket by preventing States from considering long-term social goals in \naddition to short-term economic benefits. Indeed, in its present form, \nI find the bill internally inconsistent. Without flow control authority \ndenied to them in title II, States will find it more difficult to meet \nthe self-sufficiency goal that is virtually required by title I. Title \nII says turn waste control over to free enterprise. It sounds like a \ngood idea. However, title I says if you do allow free enterprise to \ntake over, other States can close the market to you. It is a catch-22 \nsituation.\n  It is interesting to note that additional amendments are expected to \nfurther limit the free flow of trash over State lines. Title I, the \ninterstate restriction title, gives new powers that conflict with the \ninterstate commerce clause to Governors that they have not enjoyed \nsince the Philadelphia case was decided in 1972. Title II takes powers \naway from the States and municipalities that they enjoyed since the \n1970's, powers that they have used to keep the trash flowing within \ntheir States to local facilities.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire, the chairman of the subcommittee on \nSuperfund, philosophically believes that flow control is wrong, and I \nunderstand his position.\n But his position conflicts with a concern of my Governor and many \nGovernors who believe that, after the last election, more authority \nwould be put in their hands rather than in the hands of Congress.\n\n  Limiting the bill as the sponsors have intended has not been easy.\n  Since flow control has been a tool to solve the waste disposal \nproblems, the States and towns across America have been a laboratory of \nunique and creative solutions to their waste problems. These non \nFederal solutions to the waste problem have led to nonuniform statutes \nand nonuniform problems that were inadvertently not fixed by S. 534.\n  At subcommittee markup, over 50 amendments were filed. Changes were \naccepted to respond to specific problems in five States. Two of those \nStates need additional clarifying language.\n  A colloquy was entered into for another State and one other State was \npromised consideration before floor action. These seven State-specific \namendments have one thing in common--each of these States are \nrepresented by Senators who sit on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  It is a complicated issue. I wish we had been able to resolve these \nissues before we got to the floor here. But it was necessary to get \nthis bill on the agenda for all kinds of reasons and, as a consequence, \nwe are where we are. But we still have a lot of work to do.\n  Because many States have delegated waste control authorities to lower \nlevels of government that do not employ Washington counsel, many \ncommunities are still reviewing the committee's reported product, still \nlooking at what is being offered. And we always have that from the \nStates when they have an interest or when they have a particular \nproblem with a piece of legislation. They have not had time enough yet \nto deal with it.\n  New situations that seem consistent with the intent of the authors \nbut not exactly fitting the language of the bill, are still being \ndiscovered.\n  Mr. President, flow control is not necessary or even preferable for \nevery State. Each State is different. It has its own unique needs. But \nthis bill, as written, is not acceptable by my Governor, Christine Todd \nWhitman, and neither is it acceptable to many others. As those who have \nbeen involved in the flow control discussions over the years, New \nJersey has the most sweeping and encompassing system and it has been a \nsuccess.\n  In the 1980's, New Jersey's environmental initiatives to close \nsubstandard landfills drastically reduced the State's disposal \ncapacity. New Jersey's waste quickly became a burden for other States \nas the need to export our waste grew.\n  The high cost and market volatility associated with exporting waste \ntriggered a garbage crisis and strained municipal resources. It was at \nthis time that elected officials of both parties in New Jersey accepted \nthe responsibility to develop a solid waste management system that \nwould provide long-term stability and ultimately, self-sufficiency.\n  ``Self-sufficiency'' simply meaning that we could take care of all of \nour waste disposal needs within our State's borders. It could not \nhappen overnight. We tried to stop it when it came from other places, \nand we were turned down by the courts. As I have said now several \ntimes, we could not stand to have our shifting of material suddenly cut \noff from other States when now we are an exporter.\n  It was clear to the State that other States would not accept New \nJersey's waste forever and Federal legislation to eliminate waste \nexports was inevitable. To meet the goal of self-sufficiency, flow \ncontrol laws have been in place in New Jersey since 1979 and control \nall of the nonhazardous solid waste in the State. Flow control has been \na significant part of New Jersey's ability to build an infrastructure, \nmostly landfills, to handle the 14 million tons of solid waste \nrequiring disposal annually.\n  Since 1988, exports of municipal solid waste from New Jersey have \ndecreased 50 percent. If the flow control authority from last year's \nbill is included in legislation that passes this body, New Jersey will \nbe self-sufficient by the year 2000, only 5 years away.\n  New Jersey's recycling programs are also dependent on revenues \nreceived from use of New Jersey waste management facilities. Today, New \nJersey recycles over 53 percent of its waste.\n  Despite New Jersey's system, it is not a system that leaves out the \nprivate sector. The private sector has built and operates most of the \nwaste facilities in the State. Through competitive bidding, the \nauthorities within \n [[Page S6431]] the State ensure services will be provided at the \nlowest cost. The collection, transportation, construction of disposal \nfacilities, and their operations, are all services for which bids are \nsought.\n  Governor Whitman testified that ``every major waste management firm \nin America, and a laundry list of smaller waste companies, operate in \nNew Jersey today, and we are in the 17th year of a flow control system. \nThat is not a Government monopoly.''\n  Because of New Jersey's unique system where all the wastes are now \nflow controlled, without additional amendments, a waste crisis will \ninevitably occur. Once part of our system is no longer flow controlled, \nwastes will flow out of State.\n  New, in-state replacement facilities will be impossible to finance or \njustify economically although the supply of trash will be there, the \ntrash will flow out-of-state. Even BFI, the company leading the fight \nagainst flow control, acknowledges that new private facilities in the \nState would not be practical without flow control, without the ability \nto direct where this trash flows.\n  Even without the recycling fees, it is and will continue to be \ncheaper to dump garbage in a landfill in Pennsylvania or other States \nthan to handle it anywhere in New Jersey. This is appealing, in the \nshort term, for some of the mayors and some of the communities and \ntowns in New Jersey.\n  But the free market available over the border is subject to \ngovernmental closure by title I of this very bill. Without flow \ncontrol, what is now a decreasing waste problem will again become a \ngarbage crisis. Without flow control, communities will again give their \ngarbage to low-cost haulers and hope it ends up in certified RCRA \nfacilities, as opposed to being dumped casually someplace in an \nunlicensed facility that they do not have control over.\n  Without flow control, communities will select haulers on the basis of \nonly one factor, and that is price. But all of us know that the \ncheapest alternative is not always the best or the legal one.\n  Without flow control, we will see more illegal midnight dumping.\n  Mr. President, to protect my State, I will be offering an amendment \nto protect the flow control system in existence in New Jersey. With \nthis amendment, I can state that New Jersey will not be sending garbage \nout-of-state after the year 2000. We just need that window of time to \ndeal with it.\n  Another alternative is to not fix State problems one by one, but to \nhave a generic fix that was the essence of S. 2345 last year.\n  Depending on the amendment process we are going to be using in this \ndebate, I will be considering offering such amendment based on that \nagreement and which I introduced in this Congress as S. 398.\n  Mr. President, the Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, \ntestified before the committee on this important issue. She said:\n\n       It has been argued by some, and may be said again, that \n     flow control legislation is at odds with the goals and \n     philosophy of the new Congress. The contrary is true. A flow \n     control bill that ensures private sector competition while \n     allowing local governments to make long-term waste management \n     plans is entirely consistent with the goals of this Congress. \n     If Congress denies flow control authority to New Jersey, it \n     essentially mandates that States like Pennsylvania and Ohio \n     take trash from my State, only because land cost in those \n     States are lower than in New Jersey.\n\n  Mr. President, the interests of the exporting States and importing \nStates are not in conflict. New Jersey does not want to send its waste \nout-of-State. It wants to be self-sufficient. But to be self-\nsufficient, it needs to protect its flow control system and it needs \nseveral years to be totally self-sufficient. Without that protection, \nthe fears of the proponents of interstate restrictions, will be \nrealized and wastes will again flow out of states looking for cheap \nplaces to send their garbage.\n  In March of this year, the National Governors unanimously passed a \nresolution reaffirming a mutual commitment to each State's management \nof waste within its borders and endorsed the use of flow control in the \npursuit of self-sufficiency.\n  Because title II is so much more restrictive that last year's bill, \nit will be necessary for New Jersey to send more of its waste out-of-\nState. Unless title II is corrected, I must strongly oppose the \nexisting title I and any amendments that further limit the State's \noptions of going out of State.\n  Mr. President, I know that my dissertation just now does not compare \nwith some of the most important declarations delivered on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate nor in this great city of Washington. However, without \ntrivializing the problem, I just want to make the case once more that \nit cannot exist both ways: We cannot say to the States you are not \nallowed to control the flow of trash within your State and, on the \nother hand, face the very high risk of having a law created that says, \n``Uh-uh, you can't ship it to my State or any other State that now or \nin the future may import trash.''\n  So we have to arrive at a balance. That is what I have been saying \nthrough that flood of words that I have been issuing for the last 25 \nminutes or so. The subject is not an easy one. It is not a pleasant \none. Garbage never is. But the fact of the matter is that it is our \ngarbage and it is our problem and there is not a State exempt from the \nproblem. Today's importer may be tomorrow's exporter, which we bitterly \ndiscovered in the State of New Jersey over 23 years ago.\n  So I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will comply with our \nrequest to give the States the authority that they need to handle their \ngarbage within the State with the same authority they will have to keep \nwaste out of their States.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I promise there will not be a second \nspeech similar to the one I just delivered. This is a simple request, \nMr. President. And that is, I ask unanimous consent that Douglas \nJohnson, of Senator Wellstone's office, and Jill Schneiderman, of \nSenator Daschle's office, be given the privilege of the floor during \nthe consideration of S. 534.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first, I remind my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle that S. 770 is still at the desk and will be there until \nthe close of business today. If colleagues on either side are \ninterested in cosponsoring the bill which would ultimately move the \nembassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, we hope you will take \nadvantage and cosponsor the measure.\n  Second, we are on the Interstate Transportation of Municipal Solid \nWaste Act of 1995, and we have not been on it long, only since about 1 \no'clock. I know a lot of good opening statements have been made. I \nunderstand there are a lot of amendments. I urge my colleagues who may \nnot be on the floor, or their staffs who may be listening in their \noffices, if Members have amendments, we would like to have some votes \nhere this afternoon. We would like to keep this bill moving.\n  I am tempted to file cloture on the whole bill this afternoon and \nhave a cloture vote on Friday. I would rather not do that. I would \nrather have Members come to the floor and offer their amendments. But I \nam certain the managers are here and they are prepared to do business. \nI know there is one amendment under discussion now. I have heard there \nare dozens and dozens of amendments. If we are going to complete action \non this bill by Friday, we need to move quickly.\n  I say to all of my colleagues that if you have an amendment, come to \nthe \n [[Page S6432]] floor and let us enter into a time agreement of 30, 40 \nminutes, whatever, and dispose of some of these amendments this \nafternoon. Senator Smith is here, Senator Chafee is here, Senator \nBaucus has been here, so I think you are prepared to do business, \nright?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes. If the majority leader will yield, the majority \nleader is correct. I think if the bill does not get completed this week \nbecause these amendments do not get offered, they are jeopardizing the \nthings we are trying to accomplish. We are here, and if those who have \namendments get them here, we can finish this by this week.\n  Mr. DOLE. We may be on the budget resolution as early as Tuesday of \nnext week. So the window is not very broad here. This is important \nlegislation that affects everybody all over the country. Tonight we \ncannot stay in as late as I would like to because we have the Senate \nspouses annual dinner this evening. We will have to probably stop about \n7. So tomorrow night we can go late and late Friday afternoon.\n  I urge my colleagues again to cooperate and help us move the business \nof the Senate so that we can move on to something else.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to say to the majority leader \nand to the managers that I appreciate wanting to move forward. We are \ntrying to work out something on an amendment right now. I think it is \nan important piece of legislation. I hope we are close.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the continuation of flow control authority where \n           such authority was imposed prior to May 15, 1994)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor being kind enough to defer to me. I am hoping that we will be able \nto go forward with an amendment, if we can do it in a very brief period \nof time. I asked the Senator from West Virginia for his permission to \ndo so. I will wait for a moment, if the Senator would be patient.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 750.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent further reading be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 56, line 10, strike ``is imposed'' and insert ``had \n     been exercised prior to May 15, 1994, and was being \n     implemented on May 15, 1994,''.\n       On page 56, line 12, insert ``;' after ``subdivision'' and \n     strike ``in effect on May 15, 1994''.\n       On page 60, lines 4-5, strike ``was in effect prior to'' \n     and insert ``such authority was imposed prior to May 15, 1994 \n     and was being implemented on''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a subject that \nis of the greatest importance to many communities in my State of \nMinnesota, and indeed to communities across the country.\n  The topic is flow control, and particularly as it relates to S. 534, \nthe Interstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. For \nthose Senators who may not be familiar with the subject of flow \ncontrol--although you are likely to be very familiar with it once we \nall finish with this bill--you should take a moment and talk to the \npeople in your communities who are responsible every day of the week \nfor picking up the trash, finding a way to dispose of it, and doing so \nin an affordable and ecologically sound manner. People like Mr. Rob \nDunnette, the plant manager at the Olmstead County Waste-To-Energy \nfacility in Rochester, MN.\n  Mr. President, in 1980 my State of Minnesota, the cost of disposing \nof solid wastes in municipal landfills was on the rise * * * and the \namount of available landfill space was on the decline. ``At that \ntime,'' says Mr. Dunnette, ``our landfills were filling up, and there \nwas a lot of material going into landfills that shouldn't have.'' The \nMinnesota State legislature responded by passing the Solid Waste \nManagement Act of 1980, an act which sought to give local communities \nthe tools they needed to deal with the landfill problem. One of those \ntools was the ability to take on for themselves the authority to \ncontrol the flow of municipal solid waste. Says Mr. Dunnette, ``The \nFeds and the State told us to do something different, do something \nbetter * * * so we did.''\n  Mr. President, what Olmstead County did was to adopt flow control. It \nobtained $27 million in municipal bonds for the construction of three \ndisposal facilities--one for hazardous waste, one for recyclables, and \none to convert the remaining solid waste into steam, which was used to \nheat neighboring buildings and generate electricity.\n  The entire plan was based on what the State and Federal Government \nhad been encouraging communities to do for years--namely, to adopt flow \ncontrol authority to integrate and consolidate the disposal of \nmunicipal solid wastes.\n  And it worked. In fact because of the many counties--like Olmstead \nCounty--that began to engage in flow control, my State of Minnesota \nbecame a national example of how flow control could be an effective \ntool in managing our local solid waste streams in an economically and \necologically sound manner.\n  That is until May 15, 1994, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \nflow control authority was unconstitutional unless explicitly granted \nby Congress. This is largely why all of us are here on the floor today, \ntalking about flow control.\n  Mr. President, the issue is simple. The bill before us today, as it \nis written, excludes many Minnesota communities that have floated \nmillions of dollars in municipal bonds to build facilities under the \npresumption that they could engage in flow control. But there is a \nsolution to this problem.\n  Mr. President, I have prepared an amendment, which would ensure that \nall of the Minnesota counties that had engaged in flow control and had \ninvested money into facilities would be allowed to continue doing so. \nIt clears up a possible misunderstanding, and I thank my colleagues for \naccepting it.\n  Let us be clear: My amendment would not authorize flow control for \nany new communities. Some communities have had good experience with it; \nclearly, however, it is not right for everyone. What I am saying is \nthat this is a decision that should not be made here in Washington, but \nrather in the communities directly affected.\n  My amendment would not require anybody to use flow control. It would \nonly allow those that had been encouraged to engage in flow control \nsince 1980 by the State and Federal Governments, to continue to do so. \nHowever without my amendment, millions upon millions of dollars in \nmunicipal bonds in Minnesota could be put at risk. As Mr. Dunnette \nsaid, ``We're 8 years into our 20-year bond * * * without this fix, it \nis possible, if not probable, that we may default on those bonds.''\n  Mr. President, it is as simple as that. If ever there was a clear \nexample of a States-rights issue, this is it. We need to address this \nissue now, but we need to do so in a manner that is responsive to our \ncommunities. Our communities are telling us loud and clear what they \nneed. I hope my colleagues will listen to them.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that really just clears up a \npossible misunderstanding. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, the \nSenator from Montana, and the Senator from New Hampshire for accepting \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment makes it clear that when a county has gone forward \nwith its own flow control, has bonded, and is implementing this, that \nthey clearly will be covered by this bill. I believe the managers have \naccepted this amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is correct, \nthis is acceptable to this side.\n  [[Page S6433]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 750) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nVermont, makes a motion to lay that amendment on the table.\n  The motion to table is agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I again would like to thank my \ncolleagues.\n  This was, for a good many counties in Minnesota, a very, very \nimportant question. For all Senators, whether Democrats or Republicans, \nit always feels good to come through for people in your State. I worked \nhard at this. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6426-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6433-S6435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNITED STATES ACTION ON JAPAN TRADE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, our United States Trade Representative, Ambassador \nKantor, this morning announced a pair of initiatives regarding our \ntrade relations with Japan for which he is to be commended and which \ndeserve the strong support of this body.\n  With respect to the first initiative, Ambassador Kantor has announced \na plan to impose trade sanctions under section 301 of the Trade Act, \npursuant to an investigation into the Japanese auto parts aftermarket. \nOn this issue, this body has already spoken decisively by agreeing to a \nresolution offered on yesterday by the two leaders and myself, and the \nvote was 88-8. The Senate, thereby, decisively supports the imposition \nof such sanctions, given the complete unwillingness of the Japanese to \naddress their market closing practices which block access of the United \nStates parts to Japanese consumers. This has resulted in persistent, \nlarge trade deficits which are unfair to our industries and cost tens \nof thousands of jobs every day.\n  The Trade Representative is on solid ground to publish a proposed \nretaliation list under section 301.\n  Regarding the second initiative, the Trade Representative has also \nannounced his intention to take a broad case against Japan's automotive \npractices before the World Trade Organization [WTO] by invoking the \ndispute settlement mechanism. As stated in his letter to the new \nDirector General of the WTO, the case will be based on the fact that \n``Japan has failed to carry out its obligations under the WTO'' and \nthereby ``nullified and impaired benefits accrued to the United States \nunder the WTO'', and ``impedes the attainment of important objectives \nof the GATT and the WTO.''\n  As my colleagues are aware, in the debate last December over \nAmerica's accession to the new WTO system, the question of the impact \non United States sovereignty by creating binding decisionmaking dispute \nsettlement bodies in that organization was discussed. In fact, it seems \nclear that some other nations were quick to sign up to the WTO, \nspecifically in order to attack United States trade laws.\n  In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee today, a former \nUnited States trade negotiator, Alan Wolff, stated with respect to the \ncontext of negotiations creating the WTO,\n\n       Our negotiators should have begun to recognize that there \n     was something suspect about the U.S. proposal for an \n     automatically binding system when the rest of the parties to \n     the negotiation made an about face and embraced it. They \n     thought that they were curbing America's ability to act under \n     section 301.\n\n  So, some opinion has been expressed that it would be risky to go \nbefore the WTO in that a dispute settlement panel could rule against \nUnited States 301 action in imposing new retaliatory tariffs on \nJapanese products.\n  But the question is, what is in the national interest of the United \nStates? Let us keep our eye on the ball. The case of Japanese \ndiscrimination on a very persistent and massive scale has been clear \nfor many years in the automotive market as well as in other markets. No \nserious person can take issue with this.\n  I commend the approach taken by Ambassador Kantor. There should be a \ngood case against Japanese automotive industry barriers before the WTO \nbecause they are so overwhelming--Japanese practices overwhelm tariff \nschedules and make them irrelevant to the real dynamics of the market. \nIf there is not a winnable case, I, for one, would suspect something \ndeeply flawed with WTO decisionmaking and not the United States' case. \nLet me say that again: If there is not a winnable case, then I, for \none, would suspect something deeply flawed with the World Trade \nOrganization decisionmaking and not something flawed about the United \nStates' case.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative has maintained consistently that the \noperation of section 301 as a bilateral mechanism regarding specific \nbarriers and practices is completely appropriate at the same time that \nwe also attempt to breathe life into the new WTO dispute system. WTO \nrules do not cover the complete range of barriers that are practiced by \nthe Japanese and, therefore, 301 treatment is totally appropriate in \nmany instances. Furthermore, as a general matter, it certainly appears \nreasonable to believe that if Japanese practices nullify the value to \nbe gained from the tariff-lowering regime of the GATT, then the United \nStates should prevail in a World Trade Organization dispute.\n  The Trade Representative has established a two-track approach taking \nthe initiative before the WTO and exercising our bilateral rights under \nour trade law. I do not see any inconsistency in this approach. It is \nthe right approach because our practices in our market are transparent \nand open, while Japan's practices are not. Thus, it is a fair challenge \nto the WTO to recognize and act on the reality of the market situation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter sent yesterday from Ambassador Kantor to the new Director \nGeneral of the WTO, Mr. Renato Ruggerio, which gives prefiling \nnotification of the intention of the United States to initiate a WTO \nchallenge against Japanese automotive discrimination. In addition, I \nalso ask unanimous consent to include an op-ed piece from today's \nWashington Post by the vice chairman of the Chrysler Corp., Mr. Thomas \nG. Denomme, outlining in detail problems that Chrysler has experienced \nin attempting to break into the Japanese market.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Executive Office of the President,\n\n\n                                    U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Renato Ruggiero,\n     Director-General, World Trade Organization, Geneva, \n         Switzerland.\n       Dear Director-General: I am writing you today to give pre-\n     filing notification of the intention of the United States to \n     invoke the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO to \n     challenge the discrimination against United States and other \n     competitive foreign products in the market for automobiles \n     and automotive parts in Japan. It is our intention to \n     officially file a case with the World Trade Organization \n     (WTO) in approximately 45 days.\n       Through its actions and inactions with respect to the \n     automotive sector, Japan has failed to carry out its \n     obligations under the WTO, has nullified and impaired \n     benefits accruing to the United States under the WTO, and has \n     fostered a situation in the automotive sector that nullifies \n     and impairs such benefits, and impedes the attainment of \n     important objectives of the GATT and the WTO.\n       The market access problems in the automotive sector reflect \n     problems endemic in many sectors in Japan. Relative to gross \n     domestic product, Japan imports far fewer manufactured goods \n     than any other G-7 country and maintains a persistent surplus \n     in its global trade and current accounts. Japan's imports of \n     manufactured goods are one-fifth to one-tenth the level of \n     European countries and nearly one-third the level of the \n     United States, relative to GDP. Overregulation, toleration of \n     market restrictive practices and market structures, and \n     pervasive and unwarranted intervention in the Japanese \n     economy all work together to systematically discriminate \n     against foreign competitive imports.\n       The United States has focussed on the automotive sector \n     because of its central importance to the United States and \n     other economies, and its huge contribution to the U.S.-Japan \n     trade imbalance. This sector accounts for almost 5 percent of \n     the U.S. GDP, and it directly provides jobs for 2.5 million \n     Americans. The 1994 U.S.-Japan trade imbalance in the \n     automotive sector was $37 billion, nearly 60 percent of the \n     total U.S. trade deficit with Japan and nearly a quarter of \n     the entire U.S. global trade deficit.\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n       This trade imbalance reflects a lack of access for foreign \n     autos and auto parts to the Japanese market for the past 35 \n     years. In Japan today, foreign automobiles have a 4.6 percent \n     share of the market. In the United States, foreign autos \n     occupy a 32.5 percent share of the market. Throughout the \n     rest of the G-7, foreign cars range from 33 to 55 percent of \n     the market. In Japan, foreign auto parts account for only 2.6 \n     percent of the market. In the United States, foreign parts \n     make up 35 percent of the market. Throughout the rest of the \n     G-7, the market share of foreign parts ranges from 16 to 60 \n     percent.\n       While we are first and foremost concerned about the impact \n     of Japan's automotive barriers and restrictive practices on \n     the interests of U.S. companies and workers, this is a \n     general international economic problem, adversely affecting \n     the interests of many trading nations. Japan's huge trade \n     imbalances in the automotive sector contribute substantially \n     to unstable international economic conditions which undermine \n     global economic recovery and growth, and the health of the \n     international trading system.\n       The Government of Japan in the past implemented measures to \n     protect the domestic automobile industry, such as \n     discriminatory allocation of capital, foreign investment \n     restrictions, high tariffs, and a range of other measures. As \n     these barriers were removed and as tariffs were reduced \n     through multilateral tariff negotiations, the Government of \n     Japan developed other measures to protect domestic producers \n     from foreign competition. Such measures included, among \n     others, excessively burdensome inspection requirements for \n     imported vehicles, discriminatory access to vehicle \n     registration data, and maintaining an unreasonably complex \n     system of motor vehicle inspection and repair regulations.\n       At the same time, the Japanese automotive sector as it has \n     developed has been pervasively characterized by close \n     interlocking relationships between auto manufacturers, \n     suppliers, distributors, dealers, and those who repair and \n     inspect cars. The Government of Japan has guided or tolerated \n     the creation by industry of informal market restrictive \n     measures and market structures, which have placed a critical \n     role in excluding foreign competitive suppliers of autos and \n     auto parts from the market.\n       Foreign motor vehicle manufacturers now face a situation in \n     which limited access to auto dealerships--which until \n     recently were prohibited from carrying products from \n     competing suppliers and which still fear that carrying a \n     competitor's products will damage their relationship with \n     their current supplier--\n      seriously impedes market access. In addition, foreign auto \n     parts suppliers find it virtually impossible to sell high \n     value-added parts to Japanese manufacturers.\n       In the auto parts aftermarket, excessive and complex \n     regulations channel most repairs to garages tied closely to \n     Japanese parts manufacturers, which results in market \n     discrimination. While we are very conscious of the need for \n     any country to establish regulations pertaining to safety and \n     the environment, the Japanese regulations in the aftermarket \n     go far beyond what is necessary to protect those interests, \n     and are applied with the effect of creating unnecessary \n     obstacles to international trade. Japan has chosen to create \n     and maintain a regulatory system which effectively locks out \n     foreign competitors and imposes extraordinary additional \n     costs on Japanese consumers. According to our estimates, \n     Japan's 34 million households would save $24 billion annually \n     from deregulation of the auto parts aftermarket.\n       As you are aware, the United States and Japan have been \n     discussing measures to substantially increase access and \n     sales of foreign competitive autos and auto parts in the \n     Japanese market. After long negotiations, the United States \n     and Japan have been unable to reach agreement regarding any \n     of the three principal areas--access and sales of motor \n     vehicles, original equipment parts, and replacement parts--\n     that are crucial to a meaningful solution.\n       I have directed a task force of lawyers and economists to \n     ready our case for submission to the WTO. I must underline \n     the seriousness of our intentions in this matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Japan: One-Way Trade Tactics\n\n       U.S. Trade Ambassador Mickey Kantor is currently toe to toe \n     with the Japanese in the most contentious trade negotiations \n     to date. The aim is to open Japan to American vehicles and \n     parts. Agreements have been reached in theory to open Japan \n     to foreign insurance, medical equipment, telecommunications \n     equipment and glass. But the toughest and most important \n     sector--automotive--remains unresolved.\n       The total American trade deficit with Japan last year was \n     $66 billion, and 60 percent of that--more than $36 billion--\n     was in auto trade alone. We can't fix the trade gap with \n     Japan unless we fix the auto sector. And make no mistake, the \n     Japanese domestic industry is virtually closed to foreigners \n     and will remain closed unless we, as a nation, force them to \n     open it. Here are just a few facts:\n       American companies have sold 400,000 vehicles in Japan in \n     the past 25 years. Japanese companies have sold 40 million in \n     this country. Japanese consumers bought 6.5 million vehicles \n     last year. Only 301,391 were imported--less than 5 percent of \n     the market. We project that Big Three sales in Japan will \n     increase this year by about 12,000 vehicles. Japan ships that \n     many to the United States every three days. The Japanese auto \n     parts market is worth $107 billion per year. America's world-\n     class suppliers have less than 2 percent of that business, \n     even with the weakest dollar since World War II.\n       Japan does not play by the same rule book as Western \n     nations. It is a closed, mercantilistic society with \n     government and business working hand in hand to prevent any \n     serious foreign competition in the home market, while waging \n     an economic war of conquest in overseas markets. With the \n     second-largest economy in the world, Japan is simply too big \n     and too important for such behavior to be tolerated. It also \n     sends the wrong message to newly developing economies that \n     one-way trade is an acceptable model to follow. It is time \n     for the Japanese traders to grow up and act like responsible \n     economic adults in the world trading system. That system is \n     based on reciprocity. You can sell to us if we can sell to \n     you.\n       Totally free trade has always been a textbook theory. It \n     has never existed in reality. However, when a major trading \n     nation consistently and egregiously violates the rules of \n     reciprocity to beggar its neighbors, it can ultimately lead \n     to the collapse of world trade. Other nations eventually find \n     the costs of such violations to their own producers to be too \n     great, and a major trade war develops.\n       The Japanese or their apologists continually protest that \n     their auto markets are not closed to imports. It's just that \n     we don't try hard enough, or that our vehicles are too big or \n     that the steering wheel is on the wrong side.\n       It all boils down to an argument that Japanese roads and \n     drivers are unique and unsuited to ``foreign'' vehicles and \n     parts--just as a Japanese baseball was unique and unsuitable \n     for ``foreign'' bats, and Japanese snow was unique and \n     unsuitable for ``foreign'' skis and just as (for 23 years) \n     Japanese stomachs were unique and unsuitable for ``foreign'' \n     apples. The list is endless, and the arguments are all bunk.\n       All of the U.S. companies have right-hand-drive vehicles. \n     Chrysler was the first of the Big Three to export a right-\n     hand-drive vehicle from the United States to Japan with the \n     Jeep Cherokee. The sport utility segment is an increasingly \n     popular segment of the Japanese market, just as it is in the \n     United States and Europe. Last year, 197,877 sport utility \n     vehicles were sold in Japan. Chrysler sold 13,208 vehicles in \n     Japan; 12,701 of them were Jeep vehicles. That is an \n     improvement over 1993, but it is still not a level we would \n     expect in an open market. Japanese officials contend that our \n     sales are going through the ceiling. If so, it's a very low \n     ceiling. Those 12,701 Jeep vehicles represented only 6.4 \n     percent of the sport utility market in Japan.\n       In the United Kingdom, a market we have only recently \n     entered, we captured a 30 percent share of the gasoline-\n     powered sport utility market. Both markets are right-hand \n     drive. Both have domestic sport utility manufacturers. If we \n     had achieved a 30 percent share in Japan, our sales would \n     have totaled 59,363 vehicles in 1994.\n       Chrysler projects sales in Japan of 20,000 vehicles in \n     1995. This increase can be attributed to a number of things--\n     favorable exchange rates, competitive pricing on our vehicles \n     (we just lowered our Jeep prices by 10 percent), the \n     popularity of the sport utility segment and, certainly, the \n     current negotiations and pressure by the Clinton \n     administration. History shows that Japan doesn't liberalize \n     entry unless there is a reason to do so.\n       Last year, Chrysler opened a new office in Tokyo and \n     expanded our staff there. In early 1996 we will introduce a \n     right-hand-drive Grand Cherokee in Japan, followed by a \n     right-hand-drive Neon and, in early 1997, a right-hand-drive \n     version of our new minivan. We are making these substantial \n     commitments of money, time and engineering talent because we \n     are counting on the continued efforts of the U.S. government \n     to expand entry into the Japanese market and other auto \n     markets around the world.\n       Chrysler is committed to breaking into the Japanese market \n     and will continue to expand our presence there with more \n     products and staff support and by testing the Japanese auto \n     manufacturers' latest message: that Japanese dealers are free \n     to sell whatever vehicles they choose. We will be knocking on \n     dealers' doors, trying to establish broader distribution \n     opportunities for our products. We will provide Japanese \n     dealers with more products and profits. And we will offer the \n     Japanese consumer a wider choice of vehicles.\n       A trade agreement that provides real access to Japan's \n     vehicle and parts markets is critical, not only to the Big \n     Three and our employees, but to all of the related industries \n     that supply the industry: semiconductors, electronics, steel, \n     aluminum, chemicals, rubber, machine tools and many others. \n     All told, about 1.5 million employees of America's automakers \n     and their suppliers are waiting for Japan to remove its ``do \n     not enter'' sign.\n       Regardless of successes in other sectors, the U.S.-Japan \n     framework negotiations will fail both the American producers \n     and the Japanese consumers if the automobile sector is not \n     opened to U.S. vehicles and parts.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, in the coming weeks the Senate will once \nagain turn to the very important issue of crime. Within the next few \ndays I will be introducing on this floor a crime bill of my own. Over \nthe next 4 days I intend to discuss on each one of those 4 days a \ndifferent aspect of the crime bill that I will be introducing.\n  Today, I would like to start by talking about two truly fundamental \nand basic issues and questions. First, what is the proper role of the \nFederal Government in fighting crime in this country? Second, despite \nall of the rhetoric, what really works in law enforcement? What \nmatters? What does not matter? What is rhetoric and what is reality? \nWhat can the Federal Government do to help local law enforcement? \nBecause, Mr. President, the fact is that over 90 percent of all \ncriminal investigations, prosecutions, and trials do not occur at the \nFederal level. Rather, they take place at the local and State level.\n  This means that one of the criteria for any crime bill has to be the \nimpact that bill will have on the ability of local communities \nthemselves to fight crime. Of any crime bill, we have to ask this \nquestion: Does it help or does it hurt the local crimefighters, the men \nand women who are on the front line every single day? Mr. President, if \nit does help, does the help it gives help permanently or just over the \nshort run? In other words, are we going to get any lasting impact in \nour battle against crime for the billions of dollars that we are \ntalking of spending at the Federal level?\n  Mr. President, the role of the Federal Government first and foremost \nis to do those things that the local community cannot do for itself. I \nbelieve the Federal Government has to provide the tools to a local \ncommunity to fight crime, tools that they could not have but for the \nhelp of the Federal Government.\n  One major Federal responsibility that I would like to discuss today \nis the creation and maintenance of a national criminal records system. \nThe idea is really very basic and very simple. We need to make it \npossible for any police officer anywhere in the country to access a \nnational data base, a fully automated data base, data bank, which \nincludes information on fingerprints, DNA, ballistics, outstanding \nwarrants, and complete criminal record history of suspects and of those \nwho have previously been convicted of crimes.\n  I believe that this system will be an absolutely essential component \nof local law enforcement in the 21st century. We already have much of \nthis technology in place today, but, quite frankly, it will only become \nmore important in the years ahead. That is why we need to focus on it \ntoday, this year, this crime bill. We have to build this system \ncorrectly from the beginning.\n  Mr. President, we will soon be considering the single largest crime \nfighting bill in the history of this country. If we do not focus on \nthis technology issue now as part of this crime bill, we never will \nagain have the opportunity to do it and to do it correctly. I think \nthat would be tragic, because if we do not do this it will be much more \ndifficult later on for police to fight crime. Conversely, if we do do \nit, we will solve crimes. We will save people from becoming victims. \nYes, we will save lives. I think that really is what is at stake.\n  Mr. President, if we do not do this now, it will be more difficult \nfor the police to solve crimes committed by the same individual in \ndifferent cities--to catch, for example, a criminal who used the same \ngun to commit crimes in both Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD. It will \nbe more difficult to keep track of sex offenders and to prevent them \nfrom repeating their offenses.\n  Mr. President, when a felon is fleeing from justice and inadvertently \nfalls into the hands of law enforcers in some other jurisdiction, those \narresting officers will not know through fingerprints that that person \nis wanted, let us say, for kidnapping or a terrorist act--kidnapping a \nchild.\n  Mr. President, when a brave police officer pulls someone over on a \ndeserted highway in the middle of the night, that police officer will \nnot know the kind of person he is pulling over, will not know that the \nperson he has pulled over is a convicted criminal, maybe a fugitive \nfrom justice.\n  Local police work hard and do a great job. They deserve much better \nthan this. They deserve to have the best technology that we can give \nthem.\n  To do that they need national help. They need the technological \nbackup that only a fully functioning national--national--system can \nprovide. For local law enforcement to get the maximum benefit from a \nnational system, we have to grow this national system locally.\n  The unique thing about law enforcement in the United States, a \ncountry with a Federal system, not a top-down system, of government, is \nthat you can only have a national system if the local law enforcement \npeople build it up themselves. To attempt to create a national system \nfrom the top down is like trying to create a TV network if nobody has a \ntelevision.\n   [[Page S6436]] We can have all the Federal technology in the world \nin Washington, DC, but if a police officer in Tennessee or in Ohio or \nin Massachusetts cannot pull it up in his or her squad car or at the \npolice station, what in the world use is it?\n  To make a national system, we really need two things. We need the \nlocal people to collect data and put it into the national system. And \nthen we need to make sure the men and women scattered throughout this \ncountry, tens of thousands of them, who need this information have the \nability to get the data back and to use it and to solve crimes and to \nconvict criminals. Unless we invest in local technology, the local data \ncollection, and retrieval, this just will not happen.\n  When I was in Cleveland recently, I saw the future of law \nenforcement. I saw police officers punch a name into a laptop computer, \nno bigger than this. The computer then gave them a picture of the \nindividual and a lot of other information, including outstanding \nwarrants and a complete criminal record.\n  We have the technology today to give this ability to every law \nenforcement officer in the country. For a system like this to work, Mr. \nPresident, we need local police all over America to be putting in this \ninformation. It is the kind of system we have to grow locally so that \nit can work nationally. Only the Federal Government can do the national \ncoordination that is necessary for this kind of a system. There is an \nimportant and legitimate Federal role in crime technology, and my bill \nreflects this fact. My bill gives direct assistance to local \nauthorities so that they can contribute their knowledge, their \ninformation to a national crime fighting system.\n  Anyone who visits the laboratories of the FBI, as I have, here in \nWashington cannot help being impressed by the tremendous capabilities \nand capacity that they have. Our challenge, though, is to ensure that \nthe hub, the FBI's data base, is both expanded by and is useful to \nlocal authorities.\n  While I was at the FBI headquarters recently, the agents looked me \ndirectly in the eye and told me that the awesome technology we have \nreally will not be fully utilized, will not live up to the great \npotential it has unless the local authorities can collect the \ninformation and put it into the system.\n  They expressed to me quite bluntly a skepticism as to whether or not \nthere are the funds available today in jurisdictions across this \ncountry to achieve this type of a national system. They have it here in \nWashington. The FBI has it. But local law enforcement does not today \nhave the resources.\n  Talk to the police officers of Lucas County, OH. They will tell you \nhow crucially important access to this technology really is. Let me \ntake one example, something we have heard a lot about in the law the \nlast few months on television-- DNA. Let us take DNA in a rape case. \nThe police in Lucas County have the technology to collect blood and \nsemen in a rape scene. Today, however, the Lucas County police, \nsheriff's office, Toledo Police Department, if they have no suspect, \nthere is no quick way to match the DNA samples from the crime scene \nagainst the DNA samples of past offenders because Lucas County is not \non line with an existing national DNA data base that might help them \ndetermine who the predator really was. And even if they already have a \nsuspect in Lucas County, proving that the DNA matches that of the \nsuspect is a very slow process. It is slow because of the great backlog \nthat exists today in getting these samples fully analyzed by a \ncompetent individual, an expert who later on can come into court and \ntestify.\n  If we give Lucas County or the Toledo Police Department immediate \naccess to a national DNA data base, they could know pretty swiftly who \ncommitted that crime.\n  The same problem exists in regard to fingerprints. Now, when a \nsuspect is booked, generally, his fingers get rolled in ink onto three \nor four separate cards which then get headings like name, address, et \ncetera, which are typed by the county sheriff's department onto the \ncards. These fingerprints are then mailed--mailed, Mr. President--in \n1995, still mailed--to the FBI and into BCI in Ohio, which is our \nBureau of Criminal Identification.\n  The technology, though, Mr. President, already exists for the \ncomputerized fingerprinting of suspects. All they have to do now is \nplace their hands onto a computer imager--the technology is available \ntoday--and the fingerprints go then directly into a data base, what \ncould be a national data base.\n  That would be a tremendous improvement. But, you know, the folks in \nLucas County tell me that what they and other police officers \nnationwide really need is a national computer linkup for fingerprints.\n  I think that is absolutely correct. If you look at the technology \nthey are trying, let us say, in Cleveland Heights, laptop computers in \na squad car, and if you look at the incredible technology already \navailable for fingerprinting, for matching bullet fragments and other \nphysical evidence, the conclusion is really inescapable. We need to \nmake technology a truly national priority.\n  This is something that we in the U.S. Senate can do and, frankly, \nsomething that we must do. The time is now. This is our opportunity.\n  The situation today is almost like a system of stereo components. We \nhave a great receiver; we have a great set of speakers; we even have a \nworld-class selection of CD's. But we have not hooked the system up and \nwe have not plugged it in.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake: America's police men and women are \nalready the best in the world. If we give them this equipment, they \nwill solve the crimes; they will get the job done.\n  The U.S. Senate needs to give these local police officers the tools \nthey really need. The bill that I will introduce in the next several \ndays will accelerate the process of setting up this system of 21st \ncentury technology. We really will be going from 19th century \ntechnology, which is how many police carry out their functions today, \nto 21st century technology.\n  Only if we do this can the State and local authorities make their \ncrime information readily available to the FBI, the national data base, \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation here in Washington and, frankly, \nmore importantly, vice versa.\n  My bill makes it possible for States without technology to come on \nline. And if a State is already on line with the FBI, that State can \nuse the funds to make further improvements to its data collection \nsystem.\n  Let me give you another example. The combined DNA index system, \ncalled CODIS, a data base, includes DNA information on criminals \nconvicted of rape, murder, and other violent crimes. Under my \nlegislation, participation in CODIS will be truly national for the \nfirst time, and it will be supported by Federal dollars.\n  In another area that I think is very important, my bill would require \nconvicted sex offenders and other violent criminals to give blood \nsamples as they enter or as they leave prison so that we can develop a \ntruly national sex offender DNA data base.\n  Mr. President, there exists in this country a class of individuals \nwho I will call, for want of a better term, sexual predators. A \npredator, as we know, is an animal that preys on other animals, and \ntypically on the weak--sexual predators.\n  A recent study, Mr. President, found that 28 percent--28 percent--of \nconvicted sex offenders were later convicted of a second sex offense. I \nwill say, Mr. President, based upon my own experience when I was a \ncounty prosecutor in Greene County, that that percentage probably is \neven higher than 28 percent. That is a very high recidivism rate and it \nshows how serious a problem we are really up against.\n  And so it makes eminent sense to develop a nationwide system where we \ncan collect systematically the blood, then the DNA, and develop this \nnational DNA data base for sexual predators. If we do this, we will \nsolve crimes; we will prevent crimes; we will prevent tragedies.\n  I think, Mr. President, we clearly need to do everything in our power \nto stop these predators. That is why we need to give police access to \nthis national data base.\n  Mr. President, fingerprints and criminal histories would also be \nincluded in this integrated Federal data base.\n   [[Page S6437]] In addition, my legislation would allocate some of \nthe crime money to fund the FBI's DRUGFIRE program. This is an existing \nprogram that, quite frankly, needs to be expanded. We need to help the \nFBI develop and install computer equipment that would match bullet \nevidence to information in the FBI's bullet data base.\n  Today, for example, law enforcement officers in my home county of \nGreene County, OH, have a filing cabinet full of bullets. These bullets \nare arranged by caliber--9 mm, .38 slugs, and so on.\n  Every gun, of course, as we know from watching TV shows, leaves a \ntell-tale print on a bullet, so police officers in Greene County or any \ncounty can take a bullet from the crime scene and compare it to the \nbullets they have in their bullet file. They take the bullets that look \nsimilar and put them under a microscope, quite frankly, in the very \ndistant hope they might get a match.\n  Tragically, there is absolutely no hope of matching the bullet with \nbullets from other police departments. That is one reason there are a \nlot of unsolved gun crimes in this country today.\n  DRUGFIRE changes this dramatically. DRUGFIRE connects each bullet \nmicroscope to a computer, which takes a picture of the bullet and \nstores an image in its memory. It can then be matched with millions of \nother bullets from all around the country.\n  Today, about eight jurisdictions between Baltimore and Washington, \nDC, are linked up through DRUGFIRE. They have already connected \nBaltimore crimes to D.C. crimes--the same gun, the same criminals.\n  Thanks to DRUGFIRE, a search through 10,000 bullets takes about a \nminute. Without DRUGFIRE, no one knows how long it will take because no \none, of course, would even try to do that.\n  Mr. President, if everyone in local law enforcement were hooked up to \neach other nationwide, and to the FBI, through DRUGFIRE, they would \nhave a huge new advantage in the fight against criminals with guns. Gun \ncriminals do not respect State borders--very obvious.\n  Mr. President, a key criterion on which any crime bill should be \njudged is: Does it do any permanent good? Not just immediately, but \ndoes it do permanent good? Does it just spend money, or does it invest \nin something that has consistent, long-term benefits?\n  Mr. President, I maintain that the criminal justice records we are \ntalking about--indeed, all the technology we are talking about--are a \ncrucial long-term investment for this country.\n  We are not really just talking about the next 5 years. We are talking \nabout a cumulative effect, building, building far out into the future. \nThe efficiency of this system will continue to increase each year. It \nwill have truly a cumulative effect.\n  We want to do for law enforcement, if I could use this analogy, what \nthe interstate highway system did for U.S. transportation back in the \n1950's.\n  Now, I must admit to my colleagues that this is not a glitzy nor a \nglamorous issue. The first thing I learned, now almost 20 years ago, as \na young assistant county prosecuting attorney, was that law enforcement \nis very seldom glamorous. It is hard work. What we generally see on TV \nis not an accurate depiction of police investigations. It is not an \naccurate depiction of criminal prosecutions.\n  In fact, Mr. President, what we are seeing or we are hearing about, \nday after day after day, as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies \ninvestigate the horrible tragedy in Oklahoma, what we are seeing unfold \nis typical law enforcement work, just magnified as they go about their \nbusiness--their hard, tough, sometimes very boring business--of looking \nfor the lead that will take them to the next lead, the piece of \nevidence, the shred of evidence that will take them to something else, \nand on and on until the crime is solved.\n  Good police work is, if I could use this term, Mr. President, largely \ngrunt work. It can be downright boring hitting the pavement day after \nday to track down leads. The police in Lucas County, OH, spent a good 8 \nyears trying to track down a grandfather who abducted his \ngranddaughter. They followed his trail from State to State. They \nfinally found him, after 8 years, in California.\n  Mr. President, a national, easily accessible database would have made \nthat capture probably a lot easier and maybe, just maybe, that little \ngirl would have been reunited with her parents a lot sooner than 8 \nyears after her disappearance.\n  The Oklahoma City bombing case, as I mentioned a moment ago, \ndemonstrates the real value of a usable national database. A scrap of \nmetal that was blown 2 blocks away from the crime scene by the bomb \nblast had a vehicle identification number on it. The FBI fed the number \ninto the computerized rapid start system. The vehicle identification \nnumber then led the FBI to the rental company in Junction City, and \nthat is where they got the description of the suspect.\n  Then it took more legwork around Junction City to match a name to the \nsuspect. When the suspect's name was fed into the FBI's national \ncomputer database, that is how the FBI found that the terrorism suspect \nactually had been arrested earlier in Perry, OH, that he was actually \nin custody.\n  Mr. President, local law enforcement officers really need access to \nthat kind of technology. The measures I am talking about will help \nprovide them with these tools. This technology may not be glamorous--it \nis not glamorous--but believe me, it matters, it makes a difference. It \nwill make a huge difference in our national fight against crime. Every \nsingle time a police officer pulls someone over, we need that police \nofficer to know that America is with him or with her, not just our \nencouragement, not just our moral support, but we need to back up that \nby giving that police officer all the relevant facts we as a nation \nhave compiled about that person, that individual that the police \nofficer has just pulled over.\n  Last year, we started down the right path. Last year's crime bill did \nprovide some money for this important work. But now we have to \nconcentrate on helping the local--the local--law enforcement community \nto participate. That is what this year's crime bill absolutely must do, \nbecause, Mr. President, if we do not do this, we will be missing a \nmajor component of our crimefighting arsenal.\n  It is no use to have a gold-plated database system in Washington if \nlocal crimefighters cannot, do not contribute to it and if they cannot \ndraw out the information, if they cannot use it. Again, back to the \nstatistic that I started this speech with and that is that well over 90 \npercent of all criminal prosecution is, in fact, local. And so, you \nhave to judge the system you are establishing not just by what it does \nfor the FBI, although that is important, you have to judge what it does \nfor its component parts, what it does for the tens of thousands of \npolice officers and law enforcement agencies around this country.\n  Our challenge, Mr. President, is to prepare America's law enforcement \nfor the 21st century, and we are falling behind in this task. We have \nthe technology, we have the ability to prevent many of the crimes that \nare being committed today. Think of it, that is in and of itself a \ncrime, that we have the technology to give law enforcement the tools \nthey need to solve crime and to, more importantly, catch criminals and \nput them behind bars and keep them locked up, criminals who, but for \nthat technology, will continue to go on and continue to commit crimes \nand continue to prey upon our citizens. We need to get that technology \nto where it is needed the most, and that is the local law enforcement.\n  The improvements I am proposing in America's crime information system \nconstitute a basic investment in the security of American families well \ninto the next century. It is time to move out of the stone age on law \nenforcement. That is the principle behind my crime technology \nproposals.\n  I look forward to working on this in our Judiciary Committee process \nand on the floor of this Senate in the next few weeks. I think the work \nwe do on this truly has the potential to make a major difference in the \nlives of ordinary Americans for decades to come. I am proud to be a \npart of this effort.\n  I yield the floor\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6435-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6438-S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n        OPPOSING THE ELIMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we now have two budget proposals, one \nfrom the House of Representatives and one from the Senate. Both claim \nto balance the budget to ensure a better future for our children, to \nprovide them with more and better opportunities than we now have. \nNothing could be further from the truth, if Congress accepts the House \nRepublican proposal to abolish the Department of Education.\n  You do not turn your back on education in the name of ensuring a \nbetter future for our children. You do not turn your back on education \nto pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. You do not turn your \nback on schoolchildren to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans. You do not turn your back on college students to pay for tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans. And you do not turn your back on \nworking families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Education is critical to the Nation's future. It deserves a seat at \nthe Cabinet table and at the President's right hand when critical \ndecisions are being made. Children do not vote, children cannot hire \nlobbyists, but a Cabinet officer can fight for them. It is especially \nobjectionable that the Department of Education would be abolished in \norder to pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations in our country.\n  What does the proposal to abolish the Department of Education say \nabout Republican priorities? What kind of Nation are we? What kind of \nCongress are we? Last Congress, Republicans and Democrats stood \ntogether as the Education Congress. Are we now the anti-education \nCongress?\n  Last Congress, Democrats and Republicans worked together to reform \nthe Head Start Program. Republicans and Democrats worked to bring about \nchanges in the chapter 1 program. We worked together to adopt the Goals \n2000 program, the School-to-Work Program, and the direct loan program. \nThese programs were all passed with Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether. It truly was an education Congress.\n  Now we have the proposal to eliminate the Department of Education \nwhich is nothing more than a political stunt. It would save less than 2 \npercent of the Federal investment in education. These budget proposals \nwill not eliminate bureaucracy in education. What these cuts will do is \njeopardize billions of dollars in aid to education which go directly to \nschools and colleges and students to give them a greater opportunity to \nlearn and to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I have a list of the various education programs \ntargeted by the House Republican budget for elimination. Outlined in \nthese programs are the safe and drug free school State grants and the \nSafe and Drug Free School National Program. These are the programs that \nhave been developed to try and help local school districts deal with \nthe problems of substance abuse and violence in their schools.\n  These programs are all targeted for elimination.\n  Also on the list for elimination is assistance for the magnet schools \nwhich have been developed to try to help the public schools to develop \nmagnet concepts to attract the best of the young people in public \nschools, to give them some advantages and different specialties so they \ncan advance in their educational competence. That program is \neffectively dropped out.\n  The dropout prevention programs, demonstration programs which are \ntargeted at some 400,000 young people who drop out of school every \nyear. They are the principal cause of violence in our society and the \nprincipal individuals that have the challenges with teenage pregnancy. \nWe have a small program that is having some positive effects, and it is \ntargeted to be eliminated.\n  The charter school programs. Last year, when we were considering the \neducation reforms, how many of our Republican colleagues said what we \nneed is break-the-mold public schools, we need to permit the States to \nmove ahead with new charter schools? We included charter schools \nfunding in our Goals 2000 proposals. A number of different States are \nexperimenting with those programs. There are funds in there to help and \nassist local school communities that are trying to develop charter \nschools. Those programs effectively have been emasculated.\n  All of the education technology programs. I was listening to my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Ohio, talking about the \nimportance of new technologies to fight crime. We heard important \ntestimony today in our Immigration Committee about how we are trying to \nutilize the best in technology to try to bring sanity into the whole \narea of employment and the exploitation of illegal immigrants and deal \nwith the problems of the discrimination that exist against Americans in \nemployment, using the best of technology. How is it that we are trying \nto do the best in technology when we are trying to deal with \nimmigration and we are trying to use the best of technology in talking \nabout the problems of crime? Here we have a modest program to try to \nbring the latest technology into the public schools of this country, \nand it is targeted for elimination under the budget recommendations of \nthe House.\n  In vocational education the tech-prep educational program is the best \nwork-based learning program that has been developed in this country by \nthe private sector and the public sector working together. It is \neffectively emasculated. It is an effective program. Many of our \ncolleagues know about model tech-prep programs that have taken place in \ntheir States. They are small programs, but they really have the pattern \nfor the development of future training programs and partnerships \nbetween the public and private sectors. They are effectively \nemasculated.\n  The efforts we made last year on the School-to-Work Program which had \nbipartisan support, and which Republican Governor Thompson testified on \nbefore our Human Resource Committee as being an extremely effective \nprogram in helping to move many of the young people that are not going \non to 4-year colleges or 2-year colleges or post-high-school education \nand help them gain employment. Sixty-five percent of all the high \nschool students that graduate do not go on to advanced education. They \nare the ones who are having the difficulty in getting decent jobs. They \nare the ones who have seen their real income decline over the period of \nthe last 15 to 18 years. They are the ones who are losing confidence in \nthe whole education system and the democratic process and the free \nenterprise system.\n  One of the most innovative and creative programs has been the School-\nto-Work Program, which helps move these young people, in a thoughtful \nway, in a way that has the strong support and initiation of the private \nsector, from school right into employment and future job opportunities \nwith good and decent job programs. It has broad bipartisan support and \nis supported by Republican Governor Thompson, who was down testifying \nbefore us, as being one of the creative programs to try to help reach \nthose young people that are not going on to college. Nonetheless, it is \na modest program that was started last year. And that program is \neffectively eliminated.\n  Mr. President, I could go on. The Star Schools Program brings \ndistance learning into many of the school districts of this country. \nMany of the school districts have had tightening budgets, and they are \nnot able to get that science teacher, that language teacher, that \nchemistry teacher, that biology teacher, because of the demographics of \ntheir particular community have decreased, school budgets have gone \ndown. But what we have been able to do with the Star Schools Program is \nto beam into those schools the best educator, the best physics teacher, \nthe best history teacher, the best language teacher, for the very \nbright students in those schools who otherwise would be unchallenged in \nterms of their ability to compete in science and other kinds of \ntechnology, which this Nation needs in such desperate amounts. A modest \nprogram. It is $30 million, and it is affecting thousands of students, \nnot just in urban areas but in rural areas of the country. The program \nMCET, in my part of the country, effectively provides distance learning \nthroughout New England. Its greatest supporters are in the rural parts \nof Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont--in the rural communities.\n   [[Page S6439]] You have an exciting program in South Carolina. I \nhave attended programs in Mississippi that have reached out into rural \nareas all through the South that are teaching children foreign \nlanguages, physics, advanced mathematics, and a number of other \nprograms where they do not have those kinds of teachers. It is a modest \nprogram that depends upon local support, local matching funds, and it \nhas been an effective program in every kind of evaluation, and it is \neffectively eliminated and cut.\n  So, Mr. President, these are matters which we are going to have to \nhave a debate and discussion about when we have the opportunity to \ndebate this matter here on the floor of the U.S. Senate later and also \nwhen that conference report comes out.\n  I urge those who are committed to the cause of education to take a \nlittle time and review in detail the assault on many of the programs \nthat have been outlined in the House budget proposal, and a number of \nthose which have been included in the Senate proposal. We have seen the \nbasic assault on the programs which provide for an interest subsidy \nstudents while they are in school. That is a program that has been in \neffect, and that program is effectively being eliminated. In my State \nof Massachusetts, 70 percent of the students that go to higher \neducation get some form of help, of scholarship help or assistance; 75 \nto 78 percent of all the scholarship help and assistance is provided by \nthe Federal Government.\n  The cuts in school-to-work programs proposed in the Republican budget \nwould deny more funds for working families' children in my State of \nMassachusetts than is being provided by the State today. This is not an \nissue where the State is going to pick up the slack. I hope that during \nthis debate we will hear from our colleagues in other States and that \nthey will tell us what State has been devoting more and more to higher \neducation for their children. It is not true in Massachusetts.\n  Tuition and fees in public education have increased dramatically. And \nthat has been true in almost State in the country. And the people that \nqualify for the student assistance programs are, by definition, the \nsons and daughters of working families. This is a program that has been \ntried and tested and true.\n  I applauded the President of the United States when he talked about \ntrying to provide at least some tuition deduction for working families, \nup to $10,000, because of the increases in tuition which have taken \nplace in this country. I myself believe we ought to consider permitting \nthe repayment of interest on student loans to be deductible under the \nTax Code. Why do we permit the interest that wealthy individuals pay on \ntheir second homes to be deductible when we will not permit students to \ndeduct interest payments on their student loans?\n  That says something about national priorities. Instead of moving in a \ndirection to try and help and assist the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies, we are moving completely in the opposite direction.\n  Mr. President, there are many features of those programs which are \ntroublesome. I have mentioned just a few. We are committed to try and \nconsolidate various programs. We made some progress last year in the \nareas of education. We are doing so now in the training programs. We \nare working toward those objectives in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee.\n  We welcome the opportunity to do that with our colleagues, to \neliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and the overlapping of various \nprograms. I think that makes sense. We welcome the chance to do that.\n  But kind of wholesale assault on education programs that has been \noutlined today in the budget by the House of Representatives and the \nsignificant undermining of student assistance programs in the Senate, I \nfind to be troublesome and I hope that when the time comes that we will \nreject those particular areas.\n  The Republicans claim that these budgets are to give children a \nbetter future. Will children have a better future if we revoke our \ncommitment to raise education standards? Will children have a better \nfuture if we slash funds to help them learn to read, write, and do math \nand science? Will children have a better future if we abolish funds to \nmodernize all aspects of education, so that we no longer have to \nprepare students for the 21st century in 19th- century classrooms. Will \nchildren have a better future if the Federal Government slashes $20 \nbillion from student aid, so that vast numbers of able young men and \nwomen can no longer afford to go to college? The answer to all these \nquestions is no--no, no, no, no.\n  The American people agree. Two out of three Americans oppose a \nbalanced budget if it means cutting Social Security, Medicare, or \neducation. Eighty-nine percent of Americans believe a Federal \nDepartment of Education is necessary. Sixty-four percent of Americans \nwould increase spending on public schools if they had the opportunity \nto write the budget.\n  The American people see what our Republican colleagues refuse to see \nin their shortsighted budget proposals. Students, families, and the \ncountry itself will suffer if we abandon our commitment to education.\n  Our Republican colleagues say that they want to balance the budget so \nas not to bury the next generation in debt. Why then are they so \nwilling to bury this generation of students in debt?\n  The question answers itself. Congress and the Nation should say a \nresounding no to these irresponsible anti-education proposals.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the senior Senator from Massachusetts would \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, here is the problem I find: We have a \nterrible deficit of $200 billion which every objective group says will \nrise to over $300 billion and close to $400 billion by the end of the \ncentury.\n  The Republicans have come up with a program that reaches a balanced \nbudget not next year, not the year after, but 7 years away, which seems \nto me that would be a reasonable timetable to arrive at a situation \nwhere we are no longer sending the bills to our children.\n  Now, the proposal that has emerged from the Republican Budget \nCommittee has many harsh provisions to it. When we are reducing \nexpenditures there are going to be difficulties, as we all recognize \nand as the Senator has ably pointed out.\n  It affects this, affects that, affects things I am interested in, \nthat the Senator is interested in, that the Presiding Officer is \ninterested in. There is not one that will not find things we do not \nlike.\n  The question is, what is the alternative? I do not believe the answer \nis to say stop giving those tax cuts to rich people, because in the \nDomenici budget there are no tax cuts. Never mind the rich people. \nThere are no tax cuts at all.\n  So he has presented a budget which I know we will all find terribly \nchallenging and difficult and dissatisfying. What is the alternative? \nMaybe the answer is to increase taxes. I do not believe that we can \ncontinue on the path we are, which consists of sending the bills to our \nchildren. We live high on the hog, and send the bill to our children \nand grandchildren. I think that is immoral.\n  If we do not like the proposal, what is a better one? I am not trying \nto put the Senator on the spot.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. This is a tremendous challenge we all face.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's question.\n  Let me just outline my response very quickly.\n  First of all, I fail to understand how we are saving the future \ngenerations from indebtedness when we are increasing so significantly--\nabout 25 or 30 percent--the debt of students going on to higher \neducation, which is the part I have been talking about.\n  Let me answer it in this way. First of all, if the Senator is \nprepared to reject what the majority leader has stated, and that is, \nthat his desire to see the set-asides, the savings of $170 billion \nwhich have been included in the Republican budget in the House and the \nSenate of the United States, that can be used for future tax cuts, if \nwe are going to count those in or count those out, do we say that the \nmajority leader is for \n [[Page S6440]] the tax cut and Senator Gramm is for the tax cut?\n  I listened to the Senator from Rhode Island indicate that he is not. \nThat, I think, is certainly a more responsible position. These cuts are \ncoming at a time when one is fair enough to juxtapose what has been \nincluded in the House budget cuts as well as in the Senate cuts and the \nsaving programs.\n  To make the judgment that we are cutting back on a number of the \nprograms, particularly as I have mentioned here in education, and \nsetting aside that $170 billion which can be used for tax cuts.\n  Second, there is no review of the fastest growing contributor to the \nsize of the deficit, which is our tax expenditures. I indicated during \nthe time of the line-item veto, which I supported, that I wanted to see \nthe line-item veto go on this for tax expenditures. We are not \nreviewing tax expenditures. There is no similar kind of review by the \nBudget Committee to review the various kinds of subsidies that are out \nthere that are going, in many instances, to some of the most successful \ncompanies and corporations. There is no review by the Budget Committee \nto review those and to find out which ones make sense, which ones do \nnot make sense, and to do the same kinds of cuts that we have seen \nillustrated by the kinds of cuts that have taken place in this budget, \nidentifying program after program after program after program after \nprogram that deals with education.\n  I think that the Senator's position in terms of fairness and judgment \nand in terms of the budget would be enhanced if he said, ``Let's take a \nlook at $460 billion in tax expenditures and review those and find out \nwhich ones are fair and which ones are not.''\n  I think that is a position. Finally, let me say that I do think, and \nI think the Senator would agree with me, we are never going to get at \nthe principal contributor to expanding deficits, which is the health \ncare issue, and the escalations of health care costs both now in terms \nof medical care which is different from where it was from the mid-\n1980's to 1990, but nonetheless has doubled virtually the cost of \nliving in terms of where we are for other goods and services.\n  We are never going to really deal with that increase by just cutting. \nWe are going to have to deal with the escalation of health care costs \nby looking at the total health care system.\n  Social Security and Medicaid represent one-quarter of our health care \nexpenditures. If we are going to have some kind of a discipline on that \none-quarter, and we will have cutbacks as being included, then we will \nhave a reduction of services without giving some kind of additional \nsense of reform of health care.\n  The Senator knows very well that treating people with long-term care \nand in-home care and permitting them to get help and assistance with \nprescription drugs which are outside of a hospital setting, and \nproviding for better health care services, that there are many things \nthat can be invested. It can have an impact in reducing the pressures \nin terms of the growth of the Medicare population.\n  But the idea that we are going to solve the expansion of health care \ncosts just by cutting back again on Medicare is something that I find \ntroublesome. I wanted to indicate to the Senator that I respect his \nsincere desire to move and support programs that will bring America \ninto a closer position on the issues of our deficit, but it does seem \nto me that we should not simply have the harshest cuts in the areas \nthat I think are counterproductive, because I would say to my friend \nand colleague, that every dollar we cut back in education we will be \npaying $2 more in terms of social services.\n  I think, and particularly with regard to education, that is wrong.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator from Nevada would let me finish.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate the suggestions that the Senator from \nMassachusetts made. Tax expenditures--I suppose he is talking about, \nfirst of all, a whole series of things. Whether we should be providing \npensions, deductible pensions, or whether we are talking about in the \ntax expenditures, whether he is talking about depreciation. I do not \nfind those objectionable. But never mind.\n  It seems to me it would behoove everyone to come up with plans. That \nis, if the Senator and the administration do not like the Republican \nproposal for doing something about this balanced budget by the year \n2002, which is a very reasonable goal to reach. We have no wars, times \nare relatively good, inflation is low, unemployment is low, relatively \nlow, and this is the time to gun for this balanced budget amendment, \nbalanced budget situation.\n But the administration has not done that. It has chosen not to do \nthat.\n\n  All right, how about the Democratic Senators doing it themselves? I \nwould be interested to see what they come up with, because this is \nvery, very difficult. And every step that we take, we being the \nRepublicans who have come up with this balanced budget, we are going to \nbe attacked. And there are going to be wonderful things to attack us \non. But at least we are trying to get there.\n  I think as a part of a sense of responsibility, if you want to call \nit that, that it would be wise, it would be helpful if others came up \nwith their approach. Maybe you can do it better than we can do it. If \nso, three cheers, and let us hear your ideas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his moment of \nchallenge.\n  I am mindful, though, that this does come from voices that were not \nthere when we saw the $70 billion deficit reduction program on the 1993 \nbudget resolution. We did not have it. That is a historic fact. It is a \npolitical fact of life, as well. But there was not a single vote that \ncame from that side, not one single vote, when we were moving toward at \nleast a very modest increase in tax which was presented for the top 1 \nto 2 percent of the taxpayers, to provide a very modest increase. We \ndid not have any support there. Nor did we have support when we were \ntrying to provide the extension of the earned-income tax credit--that \nis 84,000 families in my State who were able to get some benefit, plus \nreduce the overall deficit by $600 million. We had that.\n  I have said on other occasions I respect the seriousness with which \nthe Senator from Rhode Island approached the efforts to try to deal \nwith the health care issue and crisis in a comprehensive way. I am not \nsure the Senator desires, nor do I, to get into a long debate on what \nhappened to that particular measure.\n  But, nonetheless, dealing in a comprehensive way with the total \nhealth care issues that included Medicare plus other kinds of \nexpenditures was, I think--I thought then and I still do, and I think \neventually the country will recognize, whether we do it the way that \nwas suggested the last time or in some other way--we are never going to \nbe serious about getting a handle on health care costs, which is the \nprincipal contributor in entitlement spending, until we deal with that \nissue. We were not able to break through and develop bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I am not here tonight to get into where the blame lies for that. But \nI do think those of us who supported those positions, and also \nsupported at least a line-item veto that included the tax expenditures, \ndo not come to this debate empty-handed. We do come to this with a \nrecognition that we have attempted to be responsible on this. I, \nfrankly, think that is something that ought to be a part of it, as \nwell.\n  Should the Senator from Rhode Island say, ``OK, we did not do the \nhealth care last year. We understand we are going to have to deal with \nMedicare this year, and we are prepared to try to work across the line, \nwith this President, with the other side of the aisle, to try to get a \nhandle on health care costs that are part of health care reform,'' I \nwould welcome the opportunity to be the first who comes to the table on \nthat issue. I think I speak for many on this side.\n  I must say, hope springs eternal in my soul. I think many of us \nunderstand there is nobody who could put that challenge with greater \ncredibility than the Senator from Rhode Island. Perhaps we will wait \nfor a little while to hear that challenge go out there where we can sit \ndown and really try to come to grips with this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator yields the floor, I have a question I \nwould like to ask the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n   [[Page S6441]] Mr. REID. I say to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, I recall many of us being on this floor just a few \nmonths ago, talking about the crisis in health care.\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, it was not minutes or hours or days; we spent \nweeks on the floor talking about the health care crisis a few months \nago.\n  I am curious; is the crisis suddenly upon us regarding Medicare? The \nfact of the matter is, that same crisis was here last year, when we \nworked weeks and weeks trying to solve the problem; is that not true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. What stands out even \nin greater relief is the fact that in that debate there were going to \nbe adjustments made in the Medicare system but, nonetheless, it was \ngoing to be part of an overall reform. So the seniors were going to be \nable, hopefully, to not only have a more comprehensive range of \nservices available to them, but it would give them the kind of \nprotection in the future that the continued escalation of costs for \nthem would not provide.\n  As the Senator knows full well now, for the average Medicare \nrecipient, they are paying about $1 out of $4, $1 out of $5, of every \ndollar for health care. Twenty years ago, it was $1 out of every $12.\n  Now, for those in the lower part of the Medicare system, in many \ninstances, it is $1 out of $3.\n  So there is a need to both have the reform and to use resources for \nhealth care reform rather than tax cuts.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, the fact of the \nmatter is, if there is suddenly a recognition on the other side that \nthere is a crisis in Medicare, should we recognize that the crisis is \nnot in Medicare, it is in health care? Is that not a fair statement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it very well.\n  Mr. REID. If the health care costs, as they relate to Medicare, are \nescalating 10.7 percent a year, is it not a fact that some private \nsystems are going up even more than that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct again.\n  Mr. REID. That means higher insurance premiums. Does it not mean that \npeople who have no insurance go to an emergency room; and is there any \nhigher cost of medical care any place in the country than in an \nemergency room?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct on that. The great \ntragedy in the cost is not only in the dollars and cents, but it is in \nthe cost of parents who wonder if that child is $75 or $100 sick before \nthey will even go to the emergency room to take care of those needs.\n  As the Senator knows, about 45 percent of all needs that are treated \nin the emergency room could have been treated--or are preventable--and \ncould have been treated in a much lower-cost setting at a savings of \nnot only resources, but also the anxiety primarily of parents and loved \nones because of the illness or sickness of a member of the family.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves \nthe floor, I want to say I have been here and I have used as an \nillustration some of the things that are being done on the other side \nof the aisle, as being--well, they remind me some of the things that go \non in Las Vegas. We have in Las Vegas the greatest magicians, \nillusionists in the world. I talked earlier this week about Siegfried \nand Roy. They can make things happen.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And David Copperfield.\n  Mr. REID. I did not talk about him the other day, but we have David \nCopperfield, who spends a lot of time in Las Vegas, who does many \nwonderful things. We have Melinda, who is the Woman of Magic. We also \nhave two new magicians who now live in Las Vegas by the names of Penn \nand Teller. The reason the other illusionists are so mad at them is \nbecause they tell people how they do their tricks.\n  I think we need some help from the other side of the aisle to tell us \nhow they are doing their tricks because the fact of the matter is, a \nhealth care crisis has been upon us for a long time. Suddenly, because \nthey are presenting a budget to us, they find a health care crisis when \nthere has been one here all the time. I think they have been taking \nlessons from some of my friends in Nevada. I think that because our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are really illusionists or \nmagicians in the true sense of the word.\n  I appreciate the statement the Senator has given regarding education. \nWe really have to concentrate on education and what it is doing to \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I just ask the Senator, in the House Budget \nCommittee, they actually cut $90 billion, I understand, from Medicare, \nand put it that much more at risk, in order to recapture funds in the \nHouse budget that can be used for tax reduction. Is the Senator \nfamiliar with that?\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair).\n  Mr. REID. I am very familiar with that. I say to my friend that the \nDemocrats are not against tax cuts. But I think we have to have our \npriorities in order. Do we take $90 billion away from senior citizens? \nAs indicated, $1 out of every $3 they have they have to spend on health \ncare. Is that a proper priority that we give tax cuts, $20,000 tax \ncuts, to people making over $350,000 a year? Is that fair, I say to my \nfriend?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the answer is obvious. I think that it is \nimportant as we move through this debate and the budget that is taking \nplace in the House and the Senate that the facts come out about exactly \nwhat has been cut and who is going to pay for it. I think the Senator \nis providing a real service to the membership here in discussing these \nmatters and bringing them to the attention of the membership and to the \nAmerican people. I thank him for his comments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the budget that we have just received today \ndoes some interesting things. One thing that it does without any \ndispute--there is no reason to debate this--is that senior citizens on \nan average will spend $900 per year more for health care costs. Every \nyear they can expect to lose about $900--in fact, if they can, and most \nof them cannot--they will have to pay that much more money for health \ncare costs. As I have said to my friend from Massachusetts, there is no \ncrisis today that there was not last December. Suddenly, there is a \ncrisis now. Suddenly, they want to start talking about Medicare and not \ntalk about the rest of health care costs.\n  Mr. President, this year health care costs in America will go up over \n$100 billion. We will not have any better health care as a result of \nthat. We have to be concerned about health care generally and not \nMedicare particularly.\n  Mr. President, this rhetoric that we have heard and encompassed in \nthis budget about Medicare reform is nothing but a smokescreen for tax \ncuts. There is a proposal in this Republican budget that we have for \ntax cuts. It is camouflaged, and says any savings we get we will apply \nto the tax cut. I think any savings we get we should help these senior \ncitizens that are having their Medicare bills increased. I think we \nshould talk about young people who cannot go to school, or go to \ncollege. That is where the money should go, not for tax cuts for the \nwealthy.\n  We are talking about a $900 a year increase in out-of-pocket health \ncare for every senior citizen on Medicare, and we will pay for the \n$20,000 annual tax cut for Americans making $350,000 a year or more. \nWhen the facts are filtered from this rhetoric, it is not the Medicare \ntrust fund they are concerned about at all. It is tax cuts they are \nconcerned about.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, we are all for tax cuts. But there has \nto be a prioritization of what is important. Is it more important we \ngive tax cuts to people who make a lot of money or that we take money \naway from senior citizens or kids trying to get an education?\n  Eighty-three percent of Medicare spending is for senior citizens with \nannual incomes of less than $25,000 a \n [[Page S6442]] year. Two-thirds is for those with incomes of less than \n$15,000 a year. Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. It does not \ncover long-term care. It does not cover dental care or eye care. I \nthink it is time for us to be concerned about improving Medicare rather \nthan trashing Medicare.\n  We can come up with some savings. Should not those savings be applied \nto maybe taking a look at long-term care, dental care, or eye care? I \nwould think so.\n  Drastic cuts in Medicare not only threaten the pocketbooks of seniors \nbut also those of families. Some seniors may be forced to move in with \ntheir extended families once the burden of increased premiums, \ncopayments, and deductibles become too great, if in fact they are \nfortunate enough to have those extended families. A move would result \nin loss of independence for seniors as well. That is one of the reasons \nthat Medicare was such an important thing--that we will make sure that \nwe did things to increase the independence of seniors, not take away \ntheir independence.\n  What it all boils down to, Mr. President, is priorities. How do we \nfeel about priorities? I believe the most important thing we can be \nengaged in is reducing the deficit. I think it is for a lot of \ndifferent reasons and we need to increase savings. We need to increase \nour balance of trade. We need to make sure that we do not spend more \nthan 17 percent a year for interest on the debt. The American public \nhas to understand that about 48 percent of what we spend is for \nentitlements. What is the largest part of that? Health care costs--\nMedicare and Medicaid. We have to do something about that, not just \nhack away at Medicare but do something about overall health care costs. \nThat should not be swept under the rug.\n  Last year we debated health care. Perhaps we tried to do too much. \nThere were lots of losers in that health care debate; hundreds of \nlosers, and only one real winner in the health care debate and that was \nthe health insurance industry. They were head and shoulders the winner. \nThey got over the finish line way before anybody else got out of the \nstarting block. They, through their Harry and Louise ads, set out to \nfrighten and confuse the American public, and they hit a home run. They \nfrightened and confused the American public beyond, I think, what even \nthey hoped.\n  When the health care debate started everyone recognized the truth, \nthat health care was in trouble. Almost 90 percent of the American \npublic favored health care reform. When the debate ended, Mr. \nPresident, nobody favored health care reform. The health insurance \nlobby won the day. That does not mean that the day is won forever \nbecause the problems still exist. Health care costs are increasing, and \nthey are driving deficits on local governments, State governments, and \nthe Federal Government.\n  All of this debate about let us give everything back to the States is \nscaring the people in Nevada. Why? Especially the large counties, Clark \nand Washoe Counties get all of leftovers, people that have fallen \nthrough the safety net. Social services in Washoe County, Clark County, \nReno, and Las Vegas have to take care of those people that fall through \nthe safety net. They cannot do it. They do not have a tax base to do \nit. They are frightened about what is probably going to happen back \nhere.\n  Mr. President, there is a statement they want to return the $170 \nbillion dividend to the American people in the form of a tax cut. I do \nnot think that is where the dividend should go. The budget that has \nbeen proposed slashes the prime trust funds--aid to education, student \nloans, all kinds of medical research, and raises taxes on working \nfamilies who make under $26,000 a year. We have focused on a tax cut. \nThat is a priority of the House and their Contract With America. That \nis the foundation of their contract--tax cuts amounting to almost $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. But have we talked about what has \nhappened to people who are going to get a tax increase in this budget; \nthat is, working families who make under $26,000 a year?\n  The earned income tax credit is being slashed with a proposal that \nwas introduced, or will be introduced, by the Senate Budget Committee, \nabout 7.8 million people, will have their earned income tax credit \nwhacked. On an average, these people have their taxes increased by \n$270.\n  Earned income tax credit recipients with incomes lower than $26,000 \nwill lose their eligibility, generally speaking.\n  Now, Mr. President, what is an earned income tax credit? It is a way \nof keeping people off welfare, and it is a way of having people who are \non welfare to get off welfare. Why? Because under current law people \nwho make less than $26,000 a year can apply--it is on a sliding scale--\nto have part of the taxes they pay rebated to them. It works very well. \nUnder current law, with earnings of $16,500 and no other source of \nincome, a married couple with two children would have income slightly \nabove the poverty level in 1996. While they would not owe individual \nincome taxes, they would pay about $2,500 in Social Security taxes on \ntheir earnings. Under current law, they would receive an earned income \ntax credit for the amount they pay, completely offsetting their tax \nliability.\n  That is why people want to get off welfare. That is why people do not \nwant to go on welfare. They have a chance to get ahead and be part of \nworking America. Because larger families have greater needs than \nsmaller families, taxpayers with two or more children are entitled to a \nlarger earned income tax credit than taxpayers with one or no children. \nBut under the Senate Budget Committee's mark, a very low-wage worker \nwith two or more children will receive only a token adjustment to \ncompensate him or her for the additional cost of raising this family.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to be concerned about the tax increases in \nthis mark that we are getting from the Senate. We have heard a lot \nabout the tax decreases for the wealthy, but what about the tax \nincreases for people who make less than $26,000 a year?\n  The budget grants short-term tax cuts, especially that from the \nHouse, instead of focusing on long-term investments on education, \nhealth research, and crime control.\n  May I ask the Chair how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 52 seconds remaining of the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be extended an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I held a crime summit in Las Vegas which, coincidentally, \nhad been scheduled for several months. It was the day after the \nOklahoma City explosion. I met there with the chiefs of police of \nsouthern Nevada: Boulder City, Las Vegas, Henderson; Federal officials, \nDEA, FBI, judges, and a number of other people in an off-the-record \ndiscussion about problems relating to crime. There are serious problems \nthat we are not addressing. Law enforcement needs help, lots of help. \nYet, the budget proposal cuts the violent crime trust fund.\n  I will be speaking to a number of graduating classes in Nevada in the \nnext few weeks. These young people, these high school students do not \nface a very bright future. We are cutting back on student loans and \ngrants, instead of being aware of the fact that money we spend for \neducation comes back to us.\n  Low-income families--we have talked about them--making less than \n$26,000 a year are going to be paying more taxes. The budget resolution \nwe have, Mr. President, calls for more taxes.\n  Research. I would recommend to every one of my colleagues that they \ngo to the National Institutes of Health and talk to the people who have \ndedicated their lives to curing disease. It is wonderful, the stories \nyou hear out there. Paralysis. We have a significant number of people \nwho have spinal cord injuries. As a result of the perseverance of a \nnumber of physicians out there, they have been able to make significant \nstrides in trauma associated with spinal cord injury. And as a result \nof the work they have done, especially work done with massive doses of \nsteroids immediately following an accident, people today who would have \nbeen paralyzed are not as a result of the work done at the National \nInstitutes of Health. The problems that we \n [[Page S6443]] deal with there deal with people who are sick and \ninjured and need help.\n  We are going to cut back on that research. That is wrong.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, to live up to promises made during \nthe balanced budget debate. For example, to protect Social Security. \nThe Republicans claim that under their budget they will protect Social \nSecurity. Social Security, however, will face it's greatest threat \nunder this budget in 2002 when this budget supposedly will balance. \nBecause Social Security surpluses are being scored against the deficit, \nthis budget will collateralize the Social Security trust fund. Black's \nLaw Dictionary defines collateral as ``property which is pledged as \nsecurity for the satisfaction of a debt.'' In this budget proposal, the \ndefinition of collateral is Social Security.\n  I think we have to live up to the responsibilities that we have. I \nrepeat, we have to do a better job of balancing the budget. This will \nbe the third year in a row that the budget will be lower than the year \nbefore, the first time in 50 years. Certainly, we have to do much \nbetter than we have done. We have reduced, in the last 2 years, Federal \nemployment by 150,000 people. I think that is significant. We have had \nthe highest economic growth in some 40 years. That is important. We \ncertainly have not done enough. The economy needs a lot of help. The \none thing we could do that would help more than any other thing would \nbe to reduce the deficit, but we cannot do it with tax cuts. We cannot \ndo it with cutting educational benefits.\n  We have to look at the big items. What are the big items? They are \ninterest on the debt, medical expenses, and, of course, we have to look \nat defense. We cannot leave that because 20 percent of every dollar we \nspend goes for defense.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, the chairman of my committee, \nfor his allowing me to go out of order in morning business.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6438-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6443-S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, indeed, they have been agreed to by this \nside of the aisle, and we are prepared to accept them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If not, the \namendments are agreed to.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 752 and 753) were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Chafee, who, in his usual gracious manner, has been so helpful \nin working through these two technical amendments as well as having \nassisted the committee in bringing to the floor this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to commend the chair of the subcommittee with \nspecific responsibility, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and the \nranking minority member, Senator Baucus, and Senator Lautenberg for \ntheir courtesies in the development of these amendments and other \nprovisions in the legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to \nmake a few remarks on the general subject of title II of this \nlegislation which is the provision relating to flow control.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator, before he gets into that, would \nlike to move to reconsider the vote by which the amendments were agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In further thoughtfulness on the part of the Senator, I \nmove to reconsider the votes by which the two amendments were agreed to \nen bloc.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to table that motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Senator Chafee.\n  This legislation in title II, which is the title to which my remarks \nwill be directed, raises again the fundamental question that this \nFederal Government has dealt with throughout its history, and that is \nthe appropriate role of the State government and the National \nGovernment. In this case, it raises, in stark relief, the question of \nwho should decide an issue as basic to our public welfare as the \ndisposition of garbage.\n  I start from a general presumption that that level of government \nwhich is closest to the people who will be affected by the action \nshould be able to control the action and therefore I have a general \npredisposition toward local and State government having responsibility \nand control. In this case, that predisposition also happens to be in \nthe historical responsibility of local government for the control of \ntheir solid waste and its disposition.\n  Let me turn to a little background of how we got to the legislation \nthat is before us today. I will use for purposes of my examples \nprimarily illustrations from my State of Florida but I believe that \nsimilar examples could be drawn from any of the other some 35 States \n [[Page S6444]] which have adopted a flow control process to direct \ntheir solid waste.\n  In the case of my State, this involvement was largely driven by \nenvironmental and particularly water-related concerns and the impact \nthat those proper considerations of environmental circumstances would \nhave on the public health. I was concerned in reading the report of the \ncommittee that the statement is made that the principal issue relative \nto flow control is economics. In my judgment, while economics are \ncertainly concerns, the statement made on page 6 that ``The primary \nfactor driving the imposition of flow control ordnances is economics'' \nconfuses the ends with the means. The economics are a means of \nachieving the end.\n  In the case of my State, the end was to have appropriate sites that \nwould protect the environment and protect public health. My State is \none which is growing rapidly. We are adding some 300,000 people every \nyear, having just crossed the 14 million size. Eighty percent of the \npopulation of the State of Florida lives in the coastal zone, basically \na thin strip of land over pools of water. We depend upon that \nsubsurface water for all of our purposes--human consumption, economic \npurposes, agriculture--for this large and growing population and the \neconomy which supports that population.\n  A number of years ago, it was recognized that if we continued to grow \nat this rapid rate and continued to dispose of our solid waste in the \ntraditional pattern that we were going to endanger our underground \nwater supply. And, therefore, the State passed a comprehensive solid \nwaste management law approximately a decade ago, a law that I am proud \nto say has been described as one of the most progressive in the Nation \nand has been a model for other States. That solid waste management law \ngave a great deal of responsibility to local government, particularly \ncounties, to implement solid waste disposal programs. The goal was to \nremove a substantial amount of solid waste from landfills and into \nother disposal methods or into landfills that met a very high standard \nof environmental protection.\n  The authority to implement flow control already existed in Florida \nand thus counties used it as a tool to develop a integrated solid waste \nmanagement plan that was in compliance with the State law and that \naddressed the threat of ground water contamination from the more \ntraditional, less protected landfills.\n  It was in this context, Mr. President, that 2 years ago the U.S. \nSupreme Court issued an opinion, called the Carbone opinion, which \nessentially stated that States were without the authority to grant flow \ncontrol power to their local governments, because the use of that flow \ncontrol could constitute a restraint on interstate commerce.\n  That came as a surprise to many who felt that there were few items \nthat were as indigenously local as the direction of garbage. The \nSupreme Court reached that conclusion, but went on to provide that it \nwas now the responsibility of Congress to set whatever standards it \nfelt appropriate in order to authorize local governments to continue \nexercising their flow control authority.\n  If I could quote from the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor who, \nin joining the majority in the Carbone opinion stated that, ``It is \nwithin Congress' power to authorize local imposition of flow control. \nShould Congress revisit this area, and enact legislation providing a \nclear indication that it intends States and localities to implement \nflow control, we will, of course, defer to that legislative judgment.''\n  So what we have before us today is the legislative judgment carrying \nout that empowerment by the U.S. Supreme Court. I am concerned that the \njudgment that is represented in title II of this bill is a narrow \njudgment. It is a judgment which essentially says that as the first \nproposition local governments are denied the authority to engage in \nflow control; that is the ability to direct their solid waste.\n  As a second point, it provides that those communities which have \nalready engaged in flow control prior to the date of the Supreme Court \nopinion, or prior to the date of May 15, 1994, which was the date upon \nwhich this initial version of legislation was first proposed, that \nthose communities would be allowed to continue to exercise flow control \nfor the period of time that was required for that community to meet its \nfinancial responsibility but in no cases longer than 30 years after the \npassage of this legislation. The implication of that is that no \ncommunity which was not engaged in flow control prior to May 15, 1994, \nwould be sanctioned to do so and those communities which were so \nengaged but which met their financial obligations, such as paying off \nthe bonds that were necessary to construct a modern landfill or a solid \nwaste recycling plant or an incinerator, that once those financial \nobligations were met they would lose their authority to exercise flow \ncontrol and no community, regardless of circumstance, would have flow \ncontrol authority for more than 30 years.\n  I am deeply concerned about the philosophy that says that the Federal \nGovernment is going to assume that degree of policy control offer an \nactivity which has been so historically local and which, by all of its \ncharacteristics, should continue to be local.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if I could present the counterargument to the \nSenator's proposal. The Senator is saying that it goes against his \ngrain and his philosophical belief that a local community cannot impose \nso-called flow control; a local community cannot say: We are going to \nbuild an incinerator. We are going to bond it with revenue bonds, with \nthe revenue coming from the requirement that, for everybody in this \ncommunity and every business, all trash must go to this central \nfacility. And the reason we, the town, say that, or the city says that, \nis because we have to pay off the bonds to pay for the facility.\n  And the Senator finds it disturbing, and understandably so, that in \nthis legislation we are saying, ``No, you cannot do that anymore.\n Oh, yes, you can do it if you have some bonds outstanding.''\n\n  Let us say the bonds have 18 years to go and that is the expected \nlife of the facility. But beyond that, no, you cannot have this \nproposal. It is a little bit like, I suppose the Senator would say, Big \nBrother saying to the town of Lakeland, or whatever it is in Florida, \nwhatever the town might be, ``You can't do that.''\n  Here is the other side of the argument. The other side of the \nargument says the Constitution of the United States as interpreted by \nour courts says you cannot do this to start with; that no way can you \nbe able to issue these requirements that everybody in this local \ncommunity must go to point A to dump the trash. You cannot have some \nlocal hauler come in and take it anyplace--to take it to Rhode Island, \ntake it to Texas, take it someplace else, no. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States says that it is unconstitutional to have restrictions \nthat we provide for in this legislation.\n  I look at it another way. Instead of saying it is difficult to \ncomprehend why Big Brother should step in and say why you cannot have \nflow control or you can only have it for a limited period, instead the \nCongress of the United States is saying, ``Despite the fact that flow \ncontrol is against the Constitution of the United States because it \ninterferes with interstate commerce, we are still going to let you have \nit in order to pay off your bonds.''\n  So I look on it more as the Congress giving rather than the Congress \ntaking it away.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think, respectfully, that is not a \nproper reading of what the Supreme Court said in the Carbone case. I \nwill just refer you to page 8 of the committee report which quotes the \nlanguage of Justice O'Connor in which she states quite unequivocally:\n\n       It is within Congress' power to authorize local imposition \n     of flow control.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I continue the quote:\n\n       Should Congress revisit this area and enact legislation, \n     providing a clear indication that it intends States and \n     localities to implement flow control, we will, of course, \n     defer to that legislative judgment.\n\n  So we have a range of judgments that we can make, including that it \nis appropriate for State and local governments to continue to implement \nflow control, those communities which had done it in the past and those \nwhich might like to do it in the future and \n [[Page S6445]] those which have done it in the past which have paid \noff indebtedness and wish to continue to utilize it. It is within our \npower to place the decisionmaking as to whether to use flow control or \nnot in the hands of literally tens of thousands of local government \nofficials, as opposed to centralizing that decision in Washington, with \nthe judgment that is contained in title II of this legislation, which \nessentially is: Thou shalt not engage in flow control unless you were \ndoing it before May 1994 and, even then, only for the period necessary \nto pay off your indebtedness and, in no case, more than 30 years from \nnow.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I dispute the Senator's characterization of the Congress \nor the Senate saying thou shalt not engage in flow control. It is not \nus that is saying that. The Supreme Court has said, ``You can't do it. \nAnd, indeed, if you try and do it, you are violating the \nConstitution.''\n  But the Supreme Court goes on to say, ``But if you, the Congress, \nwant to give them that power, then you have the ability to do so.''\n  I do not think it is us imposing a ``thou shalt not'' on them. In \neffect, we are coming to their rescue. It is true, we could be a \nbroader rescue mission than we are currently on. The Senator aptly has \npointed out, all we are doing is limiting our rescue mission; all we \nare saying is we will rescue those towns that have already made the \ncommitment. They had imposed flow control saying everything had to go \nto this central landfill or central incinerator, and we are saying you \ncan keep it up because you issued bonds thinking the law was the way it \nwas, you did it fairly, and along comes the Supreme Court which says it \nis against the Constitution. OK, we will come and help you out.\n  That is what we are doing. We are not doing it, as the Senator is \naptly saying, in perpetuity. We are not saying whatever you want to do \nin the towns is OK. We are limiting it.\n  But it is not us who said no to them to start with.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague, the \nSupreme Court has clearly stated, as it does in many of these \ninstances, that activities which are violative of the interstate \ncommerce clause can be made constitutionally acceptable if Congress \nsets the standards and clearly grants the conditions for that \nauthority.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Justice O'Connor has stated it quite explicitly that we \nhave that authority, and I am suggesting that prudence would lead us to \na position that would say, let us exercise the authority that the \nSupreme Court has held that we can possess under the Constitution in a \nway that decentralizes decisionmaking, that lets local communities, \nwith locally elected officials, take into account their local \nconditions.\n  For instance, we are about to say to one of the fastest growing \ncommunities in my State, Volusia County, which contains cities such as \nDaytona Beach and Ormond Beach and DeLand--a very rapidly growing \narea--that they cannot engage in flow control as a means of managing \ntheir solid waste in such a way as to give maximum protection to their \nvulnerable underground water supply.\n  I do not know why we in Washington feel that we know more about the \nsensibilities, the economics, the values, the environment, the public \nhealth threat of the people in Volusia County than their locally \nelected officials. What purpose are we serving by being so narrow in \nour willingness to offer--my State just a few years ago was one of the \nsmallest States in the Union. In fact, we are celebrating our 150th \nanniversary of statehood. When we came into the Nation in the year \n1845, we had only slightly more than 40,000 people. One hundred fifty \nyears later, we have 14 million people. Twenty years from now we will \nhave 19 million people. They are occupying the same piece of property \nwith the same environmental circumstances.\n  Many communities, about 15 to 20 in my State, have said, ``We need to \ndo a better job of protecting our water supply and inappropriate \nlandfills.'' Here is what we are going to do for the citizens of my \ncommunity with the support of the citizens of my community through \ntheir elected representatives to do so. We are now about to say that \neverybody who did not get on to that train, authorized flow control \nprior to May 1994, are going to be forever shut off.\n  I do not understand what public purpose we are advancing by denying \nthem the right to do so.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not want to quibble over language, but it is not us \nsaying you are forever shut off. If we did nothing, you could be shut \noff, if we did not pass a piece of legislation here. What Florida is \ndoing now, plus those who want to do it, they would be shut off. I \nguess I am just trying to see where is the nonaction--if we did no \naction, nothing would happen, you would not have flow control.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am going to describe in a moment the dilemma that a \nperson like myself is in, because there clearly is an urgency to act \nfor those 15 to 20 communities which had formed an alliance using flow \ncontrol and committed themselves to these major environmentally and \npublic health protecting measures. But it wounds and offends me that in \nthe same action where we are protecting the past, we are unnecessarily \nclosing off the future for those communities which today, and certainly \nin a few years, will be exactly like those that have taken advantage of \nflow control in order to develop these more environmentally and public \nhealth protecting measures.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, the Senator has a good point. The other side of the \ncoin is that once you permit this, you are permitting communities to \nset up and operate. That may be all well and good. But BFI, or Waste \nHaulers, or whoever it is, cannot come in there and offer better, \ncheaper service, and some citizen in that community is being deprived \nof choice.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You are taking the position that we here in Washington \nhave to be the ``big brother'' to protect 260 million Americans. I do \nnot think that the county commissioners of Broward County, FL, or the \ncity council of Providence, RI, are insensitive to the desires of their \ncitizens. They are the ones who wake up every morning in that \ncommunity. They are the ones who daily deal with these issues which \nare, in many cases, difficult balancing questions. Yes, you could have \ncheaper garbage rates in Broward County if everybody just hauled it to \nthe local hole in the ground and dumped it. But you would also be \nputting your water supply at risk. And so the commissioners of that \ncommunity made a judgment that they were prepared to ask their citizens \nto pay higher garbage fees in order to be able to dispose of their \nsolid waste in a more environmentally appropriate manner. Why should \nthey not be making that decision as opposed to our telling them it is a \ndecision that will be unavailable to them?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think this. First, I am not willing to concede that in \nBroward or Dade County, or wherever it might be, inevitably, if do you \nnot have flow control, your waste is going to end up in an \nenvironmentally damaging situation. That does not necessarily follow. \nWe have all kinds of laws on the books dealing with the handling of \nwaste in this country. And if some other outfit comes in--Waste \nManagement, or whoever it is--and hauls it, they cannot just take it \nand dump it in some lovely field above a ground water area. They have \nto dispose of it in a proper way.\n  But the whole root of what we are dealing with is the commerce clause \nof the Constitution of the United States, which says that there should \nbe free interstate transportation and movement in our Nation. That has \nserved us pretty well. You might say, ``How petty can you get? Why \nshould Miami, or wherever, not be permitted to handle their waste, and \nif everybody has to take it to one place, and that is the only place, \nthat is the way we want to run our business?'' But the Supreme Court \nhas said that is against the Constitution. I know we can fix it up, and \nthe Supreme Court, as you pointed out, has also said we can straighten \nit out. So far, we have chosen not to take that extra step.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we are here, Mr. President, making an important \npolitical judgment. We have the range of authority to deny totally flow \ncontrol authority to anybody, including those \n [[Page S6446]] communities which have already utilized it and, in \nreliance upon it, committed themselves to significant financial \nobligations. That is an alternative that is available to us.\n  At the other end of the spectrum, we have the authority to grant a \nvery broad license to local governments and States to utilize flow \ncontrol.\n  What we have chosen to do--and I underscore the word ``chosen''--we \nhave selected among options what I will call a targeted grandfather \napproach, in which we have said that for those who were in business as \nof May 1994, and a rather tight definition of what you had to be doing \nin May 1994, all of which is outlined on pages 56 through 58 of the \nlegislation, for a specific duration of time, you shall have authority \nto use flow control. Everybody else you excluded.\n  Let me, if I could, complete some examples that would give some \ncontext as to this theory of who should decide as to the range of local \nauthority. I mentioned earlier a case of Volusia County, Deland, and \nthe largest city, which is Daytona Beach, a fast-growing area in east \ncentral Florida. The county currently does not have flow control. The \ncounty was wise a number of years ago when it was able to purchase a \nlarge piece of land at a low price and has been, in part because of \nthat, extremely successful in keeping its tipping fees--that is the \ncharges to use the landfill--at a low rate, the lowest in the State, \nand still provide for an integrated solid waste management system.\n  At this point, they are not facing any particular competition and, \ntherefore, the county has not had a need for flow control. But the \ndirector of solid waste in Volusia County is concerned about the \nfuture. The director recognizes that he may not be able to effectively \naddress the public safety issues in our State--the threat of ground \nwater contamination--without the ability to control the waste stream, \nshould a private facility decide to open a facility in the area that \nundercuts the counties' tipping fees.\n  In addition, the director of solid waste is concerned about the \nability of the county to float bonds in the future when it needs to \nexpand its current facilities. Flow control authority would enable the \ncounty to have a stronger bond rating. Therefore, the absence of \nprospective flow control is a serious concern to this rapidly expanding \ncounty in Florida.\n  The dilemma that I mentioned to Senator Chafee that many of us feel \nis that we recognize the sense of urgency to pass legislation that \nreempowers those communities which had been using flow control and \nwhich had relied upon it. We all agree that we must act quickly to \naddress the financial crisis that those communities are facing now.\n  Again, I use an example in Florida of Dade County. Dade County a \nnumber of years ago, utilizing the State authority for flow control in \norder to carry out its responsibilities for an integrated solid waste \nsystem, set up a series of modern landfills and incinerators. Since the \nSupreme Court action, which has undercut its ability to use flow \ncontrol to assure that there was a sufficient amount of solid waste \ngoing to these facilities in order to generate enough revenue to pay \nfor the cost of operation, maintenance, and debt service on those \nfacilities, the county has been losing 45 percent of its waste, which \nequates to $53 to $68 million a year in revenue. Moody's Investors \nService has recently downgraded Dade County's solid waste revenue bond \nfrom an ``A'' to ``Baa1.'' Moody's specifically stated that the \nsignificant diversion of waste to out-of-county facilities undermined \nthe current rate structure and that the lack of a long-term strategy \njeopardizes the system's continued ability to meet financial \nobligations.\n  The county is also faced with an inability to plan for future \ncapacity and to ensure that recycling goals will be met in the future, \nthat is, future planning has been eliminated due to the severity of the \ncurrent fiscal crisis.\n  Half of the bulk waste recycling centers in Dade County have now been \nclosed. These centers used to accept old furniture, appliances, tires, \nand other materials that could be recycled rather than placed in a \nlandfill.\n  Dade County had extensive school education programs encouraging young \npeople to become involved in appropriate activities for the disposal of \nsolid waste, especially directed at recycling. Those school programs \nhad to be eliminated because of the financial crisis.\n  Dade County had an active mulching program which has been \ndramatically scaled back now to a bare minimum. This program in the \npast provided mulching services to residents who brought yard waste and \ntree branches, and the mulch was distributed to homeowners and farmers. \nNow it goes directly to a landfill so that the county can come closer \nto meeting its waste level requirements.\n  Elimination of innovative recycling programs has also been a \nconsequence of this financial crisis. Phone books, high-grade trash, \ntires, and destruction and demolition debris which used to be recycled \nare now headed for the landfill.\n  The clean organic waste composting programs are in jeopardy, due to \ninsufficient waste to implement the plan beyond a demonstration phase.\n  Those are some of the urgent consequences of the Supreme Court's \naction for a community which had adopted flow control, and based upon \nflow control, an integrated solid waste management program. They had \nincurred very substantial, in the case of Dade County, over $100 \nmillion of indebtedness in order to pay for all those facilities.\n  It is because of communities such as that across America that there \nis an urgency to pass legislation that will provide for reempowering of \nthose communities to utilize flow control and regain control of an \nimportant segment of a traditional local government responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that there is a bleak outlook for \ncommunities in the future. There are many other communities which are \ngoing to want to do what counties like Dade have already done. That is, \nutilize flow control.\n  The ability of the local government to direct where its trash will be \nstored, as unromantic a function as government could engage in, but an \nimportant function which touches the lives of every citizen in the \ncommunity; to allow the people who are elected in that community to \nmake the judgment as to what is most appropriate to meet the variety of \nneeds in that community.\n  As I mentioned earlier, when my State came in the Union 150 years \nago, it was the smallest, the poorest, and the most remote State in the \nUnion, with a population of slightly more than 40,000. Today it has a \npopulation of over 14 million. Twenty years from now, at current growth \nrates, it will have a population nearing 20 million from its current 14 \nmillion.\n  Are we to assume there will not be a similar set of concerns about \nprotecting our ground water supplies, protecting public health 20 years \nfrom now, as there was when these communities that today are engaging \nin flow control adopted their plans? Clearly, the answer to that is no, \nthere will be a similar need for this type of local control of where \ntrash is disposed of in order to meet local environmental and public \nhealth circumstances.\n  I believe strongly that these decisions should be made at the local \nlevel by those elected officials who are closest to the situation. This \nis not a conflict between government control and free market. In fact, \nin my State, most of the actual work of solid waste management is done \nby private firms.\n  As an example in Hillsborough County, the county seat of which is \nTampa, waste energy facility is operated by Ogden-Martin; landfill by \nWaste Management; BFI operates a majority of the residential recycling \nprogram. A wonderful example of a public-private partnership. In Lake \nCounty in the center of the State, the waste energy facility is also \noperated by Ogden-Martin, and the county has franchise agreements to \nhaul solid waste with three different private companies.\n  This is not an issue of the free market versus government control. It \nis an example of local communities, through locally-elected \nrepresentatives, taking control of the responsibility for their \ndestiny, particularly protecting one of the most critical resources of \nthat community, its ground water.\n   [[Page S6447]] Mr. President, I believe that it is urgent that we \npass legislation on this subject. I would hope that before we complete \nour deliberations that we would think seriously about the restraints \nthat we are imposing--I think, unnecessarily--that we would think about \nthe degree to which we are Federalizing what has been a traditional \nlocal responsibility, the decision of where to dispose of garbage.\n  We are going to continue to be engaged as we have over the past \nseveral weeks in some fundamental questions of what level of government \nshould decide important public issues and whether those decisions \nshould be made one time here in Washington or should be made 50, or \n500, or 5,000 times at State and local levels.\n  Earlier today, we passed legislation that changed over two centuries \nof American law relative to product liability. For two centuries that \nresponsibility was placed at the State level. States had the \nresponsibility to understand their own history, culture, politics, \neconomics, and they make a judgment as to how these matters of civil \njustice should be resolved.\n  Colorado is a different State than Florida. South Carolina is a \ndifferent State than South Dakota. I believe in the proposition that \nthe citizens of those individual States should make judgments as to \nwhat is appropriate for them today and in the future.\n  I strongly feel that that is also true of the issue of how to protect \nnatural resources, and how the disposition of solid waste affects the \nprotection of those resources. The situation is different from a \nrelatively arid State in the West than it is in a subtropical \nenvironment in my State of Florida. The situation is different in the \nState with the peaks of Colorado, from the State that is relatively \nclose to its water supply as we are with our high underground surface \nwater in Florida.\n  I believe that prudent policy for the future should be as it has been \nin the past. That it is a responsibility of locally-elected officials \nwho are accountable to the people that elect them, to make a judgment \nas to what is in the best interest. They would have the same range of \nchoices that we would have, but they would be making it based on their \nunderstanding of the specific circumstances in their community.\n  I think that is intelligent federalism which we should apply to this \nissue of solid waste disposal in the future, as we have in the past. \nThat it is not appropriate for Congress to make a decision here today \nthat two centuries of American tradition will be overturned, and now we \nare going to federalize into a single decision here in Washington for \nall of our States and all of our local communities one answer to the \nquestion, of how they can dispose of their garbage.\n  Mr. President, I think the American people feel we have a lot of \nimportant things to be dealing with here in Washington. Clearly, one of \nthose is going to be how to bring the Federal budget into balance.\n  I would suggest that that is a demanding enough responsibility for \nSenators to make. We do not have much time left over to decide how \nQuincy or Greeley will dispose of their garbage. We ought to let the \npeople in Greeley, CO, and Quincy, FL, decide how to dispose of their \ngarbage and put our attention to what the public expects Congress to \ndo--how are we going to balance our budget.\n  If we allocate responsibilities in that way, I think both the \ncitizens of Greeley, the citizens of Quincy, and the citizens of \nAmerica, would feel as if we were doing the jobs that they expected the \nSenate to do, and how we were graded on how well we balanced the \nbudget, would hold Senators to account and how well the county and city \ncommissioners of Greeley and Quincy did their job would be the basis \nupon which they would be held accountable by their vote.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I appreciate the fact that my friend \nand colleague, the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, accepted the amendments \nwhich I offered earlier. I hope that during this process we will give \nserious attention to the question of, do we really want to federalize \nthe issue of disposal of local garbage? Or would we not be more prudent \nto accept the invitation of the Supreme Court to allow this to continue \nto be a responsibility of properly elected State and local officials?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today Senator McConnell suggested \non the Senate floor that the President's trip to Moscow has been a \nwasted effort--that there has not been a shred of progress made there. \nI do not want anyone who may have been listening to that statement to \nbe misled by it, for, in my view, it simply is not accurate. It is \nimportant to review the reasons President Clinton went to Moscow and to \nassess his trip to Moscow--which is not yet over--with those goals in \nmind.\n  The President went to Moscow to honor the sacrifices of the Russian \npeople to defeat the Nazis and fascism in World War II. Russians lost \napproximately 20 million people in that war--more than any other \nNation. With the end of the cold war, this is the United States first \nopportunity to convey our appreciation. Our policy's to seek better \nrelations not only with the Russian Government, but with the Russian \npeople as well to help democracy take root there.\n  The President also went to Moscow to pursue discussion on key issues. \nThe United States expectations were low, and our progress has exceeded \nthose expectations. Among the accomplishments so far--and I emphasize \nthat the trip continues tomorrow--are:\n  First, with respect to European Security, the Russians agreed to \nimplement two Partnership for Peace agreements that are important to \nrealize our goal of a comprehensive system of security in Europe.\n  Second, on the issue of theater missile defenses. The Russians agreed \nto a Statement of Principles that preserves the ABM Treaty and enables \nus to proceed with deployment of theater missile defense systems.\n  Third, the Russians agreed not to provide a gas centrifuge enrichment \nfacility to Iran and to continue to review and discuss the proposed \nsale of light-water reactors. That review will be through a special \ngroup created at the March ministerial meeting of Secretary Christopher \nand Foreign Minister Kozyrev.\n  Fourth, President Clinton secured an agreement with respect to \nnuclear materials to enable both countries to cooperate to ensure the \nsafe storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons materials.\n  Finally, agreement was reached on a statement to guide economic \nrelations between the two countries that is important to our efforts to \nkeep the Russian economic reforms on track.\n  So, in my view, a substantial degree of progress has been made with \nregard to Iran, with regard to the ABM Treaty, with regard to a number \nof issues relating to European security. And, as I indicated, the trip \ncontinues.\n  That list of substantive accomplishments is impressive; to expect \nmore from one trip is, frankly, unrealistic.\n  Overall, the progress is indicative of the continuing interest of \nboth countries to cooperate where we can and manage our differences \nconstructively.\n  We should not judge this relationship or this meeting against an \narbitrary scorecard, and we must not forget that this is not the old \nSoviet Union. This is a process to develop our relationship with the \nnew Russia--again, not just its government, but also its people; to \nbuild on the potential that resides within that relationship that must \nbe rooted in democracy and a mature and balanced dialog.\n  It is an important relationship, and the President is wise to invest \nin it. I applaud his efforts, and the fact that he has accomplished as \nmuch as he has in the last 2 days.\n  [[Page S6448]] Perhaps President Clinton said it best today:\n\n       If you asked me to summarize in a word or two what happened \n     today, I would say that we advanced the security interests of \n     the people of the United States and the people of Russia.\n\n  I should also note that, regarding Chechnya, the President spoke out \nstrongly and publicly against Russian action in Chechnya at an event at \nMoscow State University. He has made clear to President Yeltsin and to \nthe Russian people the United States position. Tomorrow he will meet \nwith opposition leaders and with the family of Fred Cuny, the American \naid worker still missing in Chechnya.\n  So I would say the President certainly went to Russia knowing we have \nserious differences with Russia, but committed to the essential process \nof supporting democratic roots and institutions in Russia and \ndeveloping our relationship with the Russian people. The list of \naccomplishments is impressive, and the trip continues.\n  I only hope that in the interest of ensuring the greatest degree of \nsuccess, at least until he returns, we give him the greatest benefit of \nthe doubt, that we offer him our support, that we send the right \nmessage to the Russian people that we stand behind this President as he \nnegotiates, as he continues to confront the many very perplexing issues \nthat we must address in our complicated relationship with the people of \nRussia and certainly Russian leadership.\n  So, again, I must say I think in 2 days it is remarkable the \nPresident has developed the list of accomplishments he has. I hope we \ncould continue to add to that list in the remaining time the President \nspends in Russia. It was a trip well spent. It was a trip I think we \ncan look on with some satisfaction. I hope as the President continues \nto travel we can demonstrate our support for him and for his efforts, \nand wish him well as he continues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 754\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on taking all possible \n        steps to combat domestic terrorism in the United States)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Craig, Senator Grassley, and Senator Brown, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] for himself, \n     Mr. Craig, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 754.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over international terrorism for many years;\n       (2) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over the threat of domestic terrorism after the \n     bombing of the New York World Trade Center on February 26, \n     1993;\n       (3) There is even more public concern, worry and fear since \n     the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in \n     Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995;\n       (4) Public concern, worry and fear has been aggravated by \n     the fact that it appears that the terrorist bombing at the \n     Federal building in Oklahoma City was perpetrated by \n     Americans;\n       (5) The United States Senate should take all action within \n     its power to understand and respond in all possible ways to \n     threats of domestic as well as international terrorism;\n       (6) Serious questions of public concern have been raised \n     about the actions of federal law enforcement officials \n     including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms relating to the \n     arrest of Mr. Randy Weaver and others in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, \n     in August, 1992 and Mr. David Koresh and others associated \n     with the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Taxas, between \n     February 28, 1993, and April 19, 1993;\n       (7) Inquiries by the Executive Branch have left serious \n     unanswered questions on these incidents;\n       (8) The United States Senate has not conducted any hearings \n     on these incidents;\n       (9) There is public concern about allowing federal agencies \n     to investigate allegations of impropriety within their own \n     ranks without congressional oversight to assure \n     accountability at the highest levels of government;\n       (10) Notwithstanding an official censure of FBI Agent Larry \n     Potts on January 6, 1994, relating to his participation in \n     the Idaho incident, the Attorney General of the United States \n     on May 2, 1995, appointed Agent Potts to be Deputy Director \n     of the FBI;\n       (11) It is universally acknowledged that there can be no \n     possible justification for the Oklahoma City bombing \n     regardless of what happened at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, or Waco, \n     Texas;\n       (12) Ranking federal officials have supported hearings by \n     the U.S. Senate to dispel public rumors that the Oklahoma \n     City bombing was planned and carried out by federal law \n     enforcement officials:\n       (13) It has been represented, or at least widely rumored, \n     that the motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing may have \n     been related to the Waco incident, the dates falling exactly \n     two years apart; and\n       (14) A U.S. Senate hearing, or at least setting the date \n     for such a hearing, on Waco and Ruby Ridge would help to \n     restore public confidence that there will be full disclosure \n     of what happened, appropriate congressional oversight and \n     accountability at the highest levels of the federal \n     government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that hearings should be held before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on countering domestic terrorism in all possible \n     ways with a hearing on or before June 30, 1995, on actions \n     taken by federal law enforcement agencies in Ruby Ridge, \n     Idaho, and Waco, Texas.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the thrust of this amendment is clear on \nits face; that is to proceed as promptly as possible, but in a \nreasonable way, to have as comprehensive hearings as possible in the \nU.S. Senate on ways to combat terrorism.\n  Pursuant to that general objective, this Senator scheduled hearings \nin the Subcommittee on Terrorism, a series of four hearings, with a \nfifth one planned. The first hearing was scheduled for April 27 on \nlegislation which had been pending dealing with terrorism, with its \nfocus on transnational terrorism but also with some focus on domestic \nterrorism as it related to FBI counterterrorism strategies. A second \nhearing was scheduled for May 4, with the subject being technical \naspects of the legislation and also to provide an opportunity to the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Congress, the Irish \nNational Caucus, and the National Association of Arab-Americans to be \nheard on the civil liberties issues raised by the legislation. The \nthird hearing is scheduled for May 11, which is tomorrow, on the \nsubject of the so-called mayhem manuals on how to make bombs being \ntransmitted over the Internet. A fourth hearing is scheduled for May \n18, dealing with Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX. There is a fifth hearing \nplanned, which we may be able to schedule for May 25, which would deal \nwith the growth of the militia movement around the United States.\n  The hearing scheduled for April 27 became a full committee hearing \nand proceeded on that basis. Then Senator Hatch, who is on the floor at \nthe moment--I had notified him that I would be presenting this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution at about 6:20, as we are doing at this time--\nwrote to me saying that he believed the May 18 hearing should not be \nheld as scheduled but ought to be held at some time in the future with \na date not specified.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that it is a matter of urgent public \ninterest that the hearing be held as promptly as reasonably possible, \nbut in any event that a date certain should be set so \n [[Page S6449]] that we do not have the vague and indefinite statement \nas to when a hearing might be held in the future.\n  This is a matter which I have been concerned about since the incident \nin Waco, going back to April 1993. I had requested, shortly after the \nincident in Waco, that the Judiciary Committee hold hearings on the \nsubject. The response which was given at that time was that hearings \nought to be deferred until internal agency investigations were \nconcluded. Once that had happened, other matters overtook the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the hearings have never been held. I pursued the matter \nlast year, however, by inquiring of the Justice and Treasury \nDepartments about some of the conclusions they reached in their \ninternal reports.\n  There is a great deal of public unrest as to what happened at Waco. \nThere has been a report filed pursuant to an investigation initiated by \nthe Department of the Treasury which was highly critical of the actions \nof law enforcement officials there. An internal investigation by the \nDepartment of Justice found little fault, to characterize it, although \nthe report speaks for itself.\n  The incident at Ruby Ridge drew a tremendous amount of controversy. A \ndeputy Federal marshal was killed; others were killed. There was a \nFederal prosecution, and the defendant, Mr. Randy Weaver, was acquitted \nof the most serious charges in that matter.\n  As specified in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, there is \nsubstantial public concern that the handling of the Waco incident may \nwell have been a triggering factor in the Oklahoma City bombing, with \nthe Oklahoma City bombing coming on April 19, 1995, exactly 2 years \nafter the date of the Waco incident.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to emphasize it any more strongly than was \nsaid in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, that regardless of what \nhappened at Waco and regardless of what happened at Ruby Ridge, there \nwas absolutely no possible, no conceivable justification for the \nbombing in Oklahoma City. But there are those who say that the \ntriggering factor at the Oklahoma City bombing was the failure to have \nappropriate action taken as to what happened at Waco. The media are \nfull of reports of militias being concerned about what is happening in \nthe Federal Government and fears expressed by many people that the \nFederal Government will infringe on or abolish the constitutional \nrights of citizens, including their rights under the second amendment.\n  I believe that it is incumbent upon the Senate to have hearings on \nthis matter so that there may be assurances of full disclosure--let the \nchips fall where they may--so that there may be public assurance that \nthe Congress of the United States will exercise its oversight \nresponsibilities and that, if we do not act at least to set a hearing \ndate, that this issue will fester and who knows what the consequences \nmay be.\n  I certainly do not want to make any predictions or have any self-\nfulfilling prophecies. But I believe as a U.S. Senator, as chairman of \nthe Terrorism Subcommittee, as a member of the full Judiciary \nCommittee, and also as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee--which could conceivably have jurisdiction over these \nmatters, but I think it is more properly a matter for the Judiciary \nCommittee--that action be taken so that the Congress of the United \nStates, the Senate of the United States, in pursuance of its oversight \nresponsibilities, will do everything that it can to investigate and \nunderstand the problem of terrorism and to take all action which it can \nto respond. If we sit by idly without taking as much action as we can \nto allay the public concerns which have been expressed, that there has \nnot been appropriate action by the Federal Government to hold \naccountable the Federal officials who were involved in Waco, TX and \nRuby Ridge, ID, that certainly we would be responsible if anything \nhappens in the interim which might be attributable, fairly or unfairly, \nto our inaction.\n  There had been reports that the Senate was not acting on Ruby Ridge, \nID, because of concerns that there might be some interference with the \ninvestigation which is being undertaken by the prosecuting attorney of \nBoundary County, ID. The prosecuting attorney there, Randall Day, is \nconducting an inquiry to make a determination as to whether there ought \nto be a State prosecution of Federal officials.\n  Having had some experience in that particular line and not wanting to \ninterfere with whatever the prosecuting attorney of Boundary County, \nID, might want to do, I called Mr. Day and had an extensive \nconversation with him. There is no objection on Mr. Day's part for \nCongress to undertake whatever kind of an inquiry we choose to \nundertake.\n  Mr. Day advised me that there is a report by the Department of \nJustice which he has seen, which is not public, and he has a concern \nthat if that report comes into the hands of potential witnesses that \nthere may be some problem with those witnesses. But that would be \nunrelated to whatever kind of a hearing the U.S. Senate might want to \nundertake.\n  Mr. President, the essence of this resolution is that we move ahead \nwith a hearing on Waco and Idaho, as they are, at least in the minds of \nmany, related to the problems of terrorism in the United States. I \npersonally believe it is totally insufficient to deal with this matter \nby talking about hearings, as Senator Hatch has said, ``in the near \nfuture'' or ``after the House completes its hearings.'' That is a \nframework which is not sufficiently definable or definite, I think, to \naddress this problem as it should be addressed.\n  My preference is to proceed with a hearing on May 18. I would be \ndelighted to see that hearing in the full committee, as the hearing was \nheld on April 27, after the original notification and purpose was sent \nout for a Terrorism Subcommittee hearing. So let there be no mistake, a \nfull committee hearing would accomplish all of the purposes which I \nhave in mind.\n  But I feel very strongly that we should not stand idly by without \nhaving the hearing or at least setting a date for the hearing. That is \nwhy the resolution is specifically calling for a hearing on or before \nJune 30, which will at least let everyone out there know that there \nwill be oversight and that the Senate will take action to put all the \nfacts on the table and let the chips fall where they may, so that we \nwill be doing everything in our power to understand terrorism and to \ncurtail it to the maximum extent that we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 755 to Amendment No. 754\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the scheduling \n         of hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge in the near future)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 755 to amendment No. 754.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The American public is entitled to a full, \n     comprehensive, and open hearing on the circumstances \n     surrounding the efforts of federal law enforcement officers, \n     including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, to investigate \n     and effectuate (or seek to effectuate) the arrest of Mr. \n     David Koresh and others associated with the Branch Davidian \n     sect in Waco, Texas;\n       (2) The American public is entitled to a full, \n     comprehensive, and open hearing on the circumstances \n     surrounding the efforts of federal law enforcement officers, \n     including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \n     and Firearms, to investigate, and effectuate (or seek to \n     effectuate) the arrest of Mr. Randy Weaver and others \n     associated with Mr. Weaver, in Ruby Ridge, Idaho;\n       (3) The Senate has not yet conducted comprehensive hearings \n     on either of these incidents;\n       (4) The public interest requires full disclosure of these \n     incidents through hearings to promote public confidence in \n     government; and\n       (5) The public's confidence in government would be further \n     promoted if the timing of the hearings takes into \n     consideration the need for such hearings to be conducted in \n     an atmosphere of reflection and calm deliberation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that hearings should be held in \n      [[Page S6450]] the near future, before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, at a time and under such circumstances as \n     determined by the Chairman, regarding the actions taken by \n     federal law enforcement agencies and their representatives in \n     the aforementioned Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as usual, I have a lot of respect for the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. I know that his intentions are \nhonorable. He would like to have these matters examined, and I believe \nthat they will be examined.\n  I have to say that there were 12 Federal law enforcement officers and \npersonnel who were murdered in the Oklahoma City tragedy.\n  I understand that memorial services for those Federal law enforcement \npersonnel will be held next week. Out of respect for those who were \nvictims, I am reluctant to hold hearings on Waco at this time--although \nI believe Congress must do so. I have to admit that nobody has been \nmore concerned about the Waco incident and the Ruby Ridge incident than \nI have been. After all, both States are in close proximity to mine. I \nhave a lot of friends in both States, and there has been a considerable \namount of pressure on me to hold hearings in the last month or so, and \neven before that.\n  I been frank about the fact that I intend to hold Judiciary Committee \nhearings. When I heard that the House was going to start hearings on \nWaco and Ruby Ridge, with the agenda that we have in the Senate, which \nis a very heavy Judiciary Committee agenda, and also with the \noccurrence at Oklahoma City, I told people that we will hold hearings \nbut that I would like to wait at least a reasonable time and allow the \nFBI and other law enforcement agencies to do everything they possibly \ncan to catch, convict, and punish those people who were responsible for \nthe Oklahoma City bombing. It is certainly the most tragic terrorist \nincident in the history of this country. There are others that I can \ncite, some of which even involve my own forebears. As people will \nrecall, the Mormon Church is the only church in the history of this \ncountry where its members had an extermination order against them, \nissued by a Governor of one of these States, which extermination order \nwas rescinded by none other than one of our colleagues when he was \nGovernor of that respective State.\n  I have to say that we will hold hearings and I intend to hold them in \na reasonable period of time. They will be held, though at the full \ncommittee which is the proper jurisdictional setting, as the full \nJudiciary Committee has retained jurisdiction over the Department of \nJustice. This issue is a Department of Justice oversight issue, so the \nfull committee should hold these hearings.\n  One thing I am very concerned about is pulling any FBI leader off of \nthe Oklahoma City case until they wrap up the investigation. They are \nmaking great headway. I am updated almost daily by the Director of the \nFBI, by people at the Justice Department, people in this \nadministration, and others who are on top of what is happening \nfollowing the Oklahoma City bombing. And I personally believe we should \nallow our law enforcement community some time--and it may be longer \nthan the middle of next month or the end of June--for them to use every \npower at their disposal to resolve the investigation and problems in \nOklahoma City.\n  Now, every time we have one of these hearings--and in this particular \ncase, if we hold a hearing, a Department of Justice oversight hearing \non Waco and Ruby Ridge, the FBI Director is going to have to be there. \nMr. Potts, who is doing an excellent job of running the investigation \non Oklahoma City, is getting accolades from everybody involved in this \nparticular investigation. Were we to hold hearings now, Mr. Potts would \nhave to defer his time from Oklahoma City to prepare for and testify at \nour hearings up here. And there are innumerable other people who may or \nmay not be involved in hearings, but who need to be on the job in \nOklahoma City.\n  That is why I am reticent to calling these hearings during the month \nof May, and I am reticent to have a due date of June 30, which is what \nthe distinguished Senator has in his sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \nwill be happy to do whatever the Senate says. But it is my prerogative \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee to determine when these hearings \nare going to be held. I have to say that I hope that the Senate will \ntake into consideration the importance of the work that is being done \nto try and uncover the problems and catch those responsible for the \nOklahoma City bombing.\n  I personally think it is the wrong thing to do--to try to push \nhearings too soon on this matter, under these circumstances at this \ntime.\n  Now, perhaps there is reason to criticize the Senator from Utah for \nnot having held hearings before the Oklahoma City incident, but the \nSenator from Utah has been studying these matters and we have people \nlooking into them. We do not feel that we are prepared to hold the \nhearings at this particular time, and we certainly were not prepared \nbefore the Oklahoma City incident. Indeed, much of our attention in the \nJudiciary Committee has been focused on passing the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  I want to share with my colleague from Pennsylvania that I have many \nfriends who are very concerned in my home State and in the State of \nIdaho, my neighboring State, and in the State of Texas, a State I have \na great deal of love and respect for, who are very concerned about the \nfact that the Waco and Ruby Ridge matters have been allowed to drag on \nas long as they have. When I heard that the House was going to move \nforward, I thought to myself, good, let them do it and then we will \nwatch that carefully and we will follow up with hearings, if necessary, \nto do the necessary things to cover all of the matters that were not \ncovered there or that need to be recovered by Members of the Senate.\n  There is no desire on my part to avoid holding hearings, no desire to \nignore these matters. And there is no desire to fight the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania on this issue. I will be happy to hold \nhearings, as I informed the Senator. There will be full committee \nhearings. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will have every \nright to participate as a distinguished member of the committee. He is \na member whom I respect. But it ought to be done, it seems to me, in a \nreasonable and a considered way, giving consideration to the pressures \non everybody, including members of the Judiciary Committee but, most \nimportantly, on the leadership of the FBI at this particular time. \nPerhaps they will wrap up the Oklahoma City investigation within the \nnext week or so. I imagine it is going to take more time than that. But \nthey are on their way, and they are making great headway and I do not \nwant to pull anybody off from that investigation at this particular \ntime.\n  If we did, you never know whether some felon or murderer could slip \nthrough and escape or find some way out, or cover his or her tracks or \ntheir tracks; we just do not know at this point.\n  So I encourage my colleague from Pennsylvania to work with me on a \nresolution that will certainly express the sense of the Senate to hold \nhearings on this matter but to do so in a timeframe that I think will \nbring people together rather than split us apart. I would like to do \nthat, and I am humble enough to be given advice and to try and follow \nit. But in this particular case, I feel very deeply that there is a \ntime to hold these hearings and a time not to. And right now is not the \ntime to do it. I believe probably next month will not be the time to do \nthat as well. I certainly hope that we will hold hearings in a short \ntime and in a reasonable time from this particular date.\n  So I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his desire to do this, \nfor his zeal, and for his interest in trying to resolve wrongs that \nexist or may exist in this country with regard to these two incidents \nand any other incident. I also believe that if we are patient and wait \nuntil we see the outcome of the investigation of the Oklahoma City \nbombing--if we wait a short while longer, not only will we help the FBI \nand others to get the job done, but we may be able to uncover some \nthings that will help us to understand improvements that they are \nmaking at the FBI with regard to terrorism. And I have no doubt that we \nwill uncover the truth about whether there is no conspiracy of the \nGovernment against the American people, or against the \n [[Page S6451]] militia movement, or against individual citizens. We \nknow that there have been mistakes made. In Waco, it was a catastrophe; \nI have said that publicly, and I cannot remember, but I believe I have \nsaid it on the floor. Ruby Ridge was one of the great tragedies of our \nwestern lives. I believe that hearings are going to be appropriate and \nwe will hold them.\n  I hope that we will work this out so that we can work together on it \nrather than work apart.\n  Let me just add that I think it is the prerogative of the chairman, \nto determine when hearings within his committee's jurisdiction will be \nheld. I intend to stand by that position--for a reasonable time but not \na definite time--until after I see what happens in Oklahoma City. I do \nnot want to put extraordinary pressure on the FBI at a time when they \nhave extraordinary pressure on them anyway.\n  Especially with the understanding that Ruby Ridge and Waco will not \ngo away, with the understanding that we are studying those matters now, \nand trying to figure out what would make the most effective and \nreasonable and worthwhile hearings on the subject, I feel we can \nwithhold on hearings. I have no doubt that the administration and \nothers with whom my colleague from Pennsylvania has spoken have \ninformed him that if the Senate chooses to hold hearings, they will \nappear. I cannot, however, believe that they would take the position \nthat hearings at this time, in the midst of the largest criminal \ninvestigation in history, are a priority for them.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania for his \nefforts in trying to move this issue forward. I hope he will work with \nme on it. If he will, we will get farther than if he does not. If he \ndoes not work with me, the Senate will vote on a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution--a nonbinding resolution. I will determine when these \nhearings will be held. I just think it would be flying in the face of \ngood law enforcement, flying in the face of reality, flying in the face \nof the need to hold hearings which are calm and deliberative, and \nflying in the face of the people who have died in Oklahoma City, who \ndeserve a resolution to their problem, to hold Waco and Ruby Ridge \nhearings at this time.\n  Now, there are people who have died in Waco, and people who have died \nin Ruby Ridge, both law enforcement people and innocent people in those \ncompounds, and they all deserve to have this matter fully reviewed. I \nintend to do so. But these are matters which require a comprehensive \nand full review--not a hurried hearing.\n  I intend to work with every member of the Judiciary Committee so that \nevery member can have an opportunity to be part of the hearings, to \nhave an opportunity to ask the questions, and hopefully they can during \nthe time that will be allotted. It may take more than one day of \nhearings. In fact, it will probably take more than one day.\n  I have the commitment from the Director of the FBI and from the \npeople at Justice that they will cooperate in those hearings. I have \ndiscussed with them the need to hold hearings and I have made it clear \nto them that we will hold them. And they, themselves, have indicated to \nme that they would like a little bit of time to finish the Oklahoma \nCity matter before they have to divert their efforts and come up here \nfor full-blown hearings before any committee of the U.S. Senate and, I \nbelieve, even the House of Representatives.\n  They will do it if we demand they do it. I just believe there is a \ntime to have them do it. That time is not now, under the circumstances \nof Oklahoma City.\n  With that, I offer to work with the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania and see what we can do to resolve this problem. I stand \nready to work with him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKempthorne be added as an original cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Utah talks about \npatience, it seems to me that the American people have been patient \nlong enough, since April 19, 1993. There has been ample time to hold \nthese hearings, long ago.\n  As I said, I had asked for hearings shortly after the event itself. \nHad they been held in January or February or March or up to mid-April \nof this year, we would not be looking awaiting further action on \nOklahoma City. It may be that we would not have looked at anything at \nOklahoma City at all had the hearings been held earlier.\n  I do not know that that is so, but I think that when there is a \nrequest for patience, I think that there has already been an undue \namount of patience on the matter. I do not think that it is impatient \nto say, ``Do it by June 30.'' That is 41 days from May 10, as we stand \nhere at the present time.\n  I discussed these hearings with the Director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, \nwho was willing to proceed at this time and has no objection. The \nAttorney General of the United States has publicly stated that she is \nprepared for hearings.\n  When the Senator from Utah offers a resolution that ``hearings should \nbe held in the near future,'' my judgment is that is totally, totally, \ninsufficient.\n  When he talks about time, and he says we should wait until we ``catch \nand punish those responsible for Oklahoma City''--punishing them may \ntake a matter of years. Some murder cases languish in the courts for up \nto 20 years. I do not think he necessarily means that, but if he is \ntalking about waiting for punishment, even a trial would take months or \nmore than a year.\n  When he talks about awaiting hearings in the House, ``We will wait \nfor the hearings in the House, if necessary to see if we proceed,'' the \nSenator from Utah is not even talking in a definite way about hearings \nafter the House hearings. We will see after the House hearings, if \nnecessary. I firmly believe that the Senate has an independent \nresponsibility. We do not have to get involved in being a bicameral \nlegislature. We have an independent responsibility to undertake these \nhearings.\n  When paragraph 12 of the resolution calls to hearings by the U.S. \nSenate to dispel public rumors that the ``Oklahoma City bombing was \nplanned and carried out by Federal law enforcement officials,'' that is \na statement of the Director of the FBI himself. When Director Freeh was \nat lunch yesterday in the Republican Caucus he talked about rumors that \nthe Federal Government itself had caused the bombing in Oklahoma City, \nand that he welcomed the hearings to dispel those rumors.\n  On two occasions the Senator from Utah has said that it is ``My \nprerogative''--``My prerogative to decide when the hearings would be \nheld.'' I think that that is customarily the situation. When we \nschedule subcommittee hearings, however, it is the prerogative of the \nchairman of the subcommittee to schedule the hearings.\n  Or, as I said, it would be conceivable to have hearings in the \nIntelligence Committee which has jurisdiction over terrorism matters. \nAnd a good bit of what we are considering now in the Judiciary \nCommittee relates to the deportation or aliens, which is clearly a \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. As \nchairman, I could schedule them there, if we want to talk about \nprerogatives, but I have not done so because I think this is really a \nmatter for terrorism as it is defined in the Terrorism Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee. As I say, I would be glad to see the hearings \nheld in the full committee, as was the hearing on April 27 after the \nnotice had been given by the subcommittee for that hearing.\n  When we talk about the prerogatives of Senators, I think that is a \nlittle excessive, even if the Senators are chairmen, when we have a \nmatter of public interest.\n  I am a little surprised by the statement by the Senator from Utah, \nagain I wrote this down, that even if the resolution passes, ``I am \ngoing to determine when to hold these hearings, unless the Senate \norders me.''\n  I do not know of any procedure for having an order or a mandamus, or \ndirection of that sort under our Senate procedures, but the way we \ndetermine the will of the Senate is to have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, which is what I have offered. It gives a lot of latitude as \nto when the hearings will be held.\n  So it is a little surprising to hear that the Senator from Utah is \ngoing to determine when to hold the hearings, \n [[Page S6452]] whatever the sense of the Senate may be, unless the \nSenate issues some kind of an order. I know of no such procedure for \nsuch an order.\n  Mr. President, I am very much concerned about the officers, the \nFederal officials, who were murdered in Oklahoma City. I think every \nAmerican is. I know the area very well.\n  I went to the University of Oklahoma, which is in Norman, 20 miles \naway, and have a lot of friends in Oklahoma City. It is a catastrophe \nof the first order. I think that we can best serve the public interest \nand best pay our respect to the victims in Oklahoma City and best pay \nour respect to victims of terrorism everywhere if we act and if we do \nwhat we can to clear the air on any notion which may be current in the \ncountry that there has been a coverup by the Federal Government, or a \nfailure to act or a failure to look into what happened in Waco and Ruby \nRidge.\n  I think this resolution is a very reasonable approach to the issue, \ndeferring from the date of May 18, which the subcommittee has set, and \ndeferring to the full committee. It is not a matter of who conducts the \nhearings. Let the full committee do it. But let us do it with \nreasonable promptness.\n  I think it is important that we not talk about personal Senatorial \nprerogatives or about being ordered to do something, not talk about \nconduct them ``if necessary,'' after the House holds it hearings, or \nnot talk about the vagaries of the near future. We need to set a time \nwhen at least we will let all Americans know we are going to move \nahead, we are not stonewalling, and although we are not having the \nhearing on May 18, we will at least set a date that will give public \nassurance--that we will give the public assurance that we will let the \nchips fall where they may and there will be accountability in America \nregardless of how high the officials may be.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I strongly support the call for hearings \ninto the Federal Government's handling of standoffs in Naples, ID and \nWaco, TX.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember I have been pushing for many \nmonths to get the Government to tell what it knows about the incident \nin my home State--often referred to as Ruby Ridge. I asked for an \ninvestigation of the incident, which was done; I pressed for release of \nthe reports of that investigation, which is presently awaiting the \nconsent of the local Idaho prosecutor; and in January, I asked for \nhearings in the Senate.\n  Government agents have already been disciplined for acts and failures \nto act at Ruby Ridge. Just a few weeks ago, the Deputy Attorney General \nreleased a list of problems that she thinks occurred there and asked \nthe heads of three agencies to report how they are addressing these \nproblems.\n  Yet there still has not been any public accounting as to what \nhappened, nor answers to the questions that continue to multiply.\n  Mr. President, the public has a right to know. The Senate should hold \nhearings into this matter and into the handling of the Waco standoff, \nas well.\n  There are some who have suggested that now is not the time for these \nhearings. They say we should wait until Oklahoma City recovers, or \nuntil the polls show a more favorable political climate in the country, \nor some other goal is met.\n  At the same time, we have been hearing a lot in the press and even in \nthis Chamber about the public's so-called ``paranoia''--fear and \nmistrust of the Federal Government that is being labeled as irrational.\n  I should not need to remind my colleagues: fear breeds in ignorance. \nMistrust is fueled by rumor. The worst thing this Congress could do to \nimprove the situation would be to put these issues on the shelf or try \nto drive public discussion underground.\n  That is not the way a responsive, and responsible, representative \nbody should operate. We depend upon our State and Federal\n authorities to maintain order and keep the peace, and we trust they \nwill do so in a way that is consistent with the law and in keeping with \nthe trust we have placed in them. Sometimes a line is crossed that runs \nthe risk of breaking the trust and confidence Americans have place in \nour Federal law enforcement community.\n\n  Many across America fear such a line was crossed at Waco and at Ruby \nRidge. That fear has only increased, not decreased, as the days and \nmonths have passed without an adequate Congressional response.\n  Surely everyone in this Congress would agree that it would be helpful \nto have answers to these questions before we respond to Federal law \nenforcement requests for greater powers and resources. Hearings in this \narea may well point out areas where additional help is needed; \nconversely, they may point out areas where additional powers may \ncontribute to the potential for abuse. And if Congress deserves to know \nthe answers to these questions before making such an important policy \ndetermination, surely the public also deserves it.\n  Mr. President, it serves neither the law enforcement community nor \nthe interests of civil liberties or delay addressing these incidents. \nWe should hold hearings and seek answers to the legitimate questions \nthat have been raised--and we should do it now, rather than allow the \ncancer of suspicion and mistrust to grow.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is currently not \npending for those purposes. It takes unanimous consent to order the \nyeas and nays on your amendment, Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe considered as a freestanding resolution which, as I understand from \nthe Parliamentarian, is permissible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent it be considered as a \nfreestanding resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Minnesota, \nand acting as Chair, I do object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection that it be in order to \norder the yeas and nays at this time?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is clearly not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. All Senators on the floor are voting in favor of the \nyeas and nays.\n  Come on now, Mr. President, I have seen the yeas and nays ordered \nwith one Senator on the floor asking for the yeas and nays constituting \na sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the Parliamentarian, a minimum of \n11 Senators need to be on the floor for a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Will the \nParliamentarian represent that the yeas and nays have not been ordered \nin any case he has seen where fewer than 11 Members of the Senate have \nasked for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, there is not a record kept of that, \naccording to the Parliamentarian. So the information would not be \navailable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for his best recollection but not necessarily a \nrecord, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, so \nordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6448-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6452-S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Product \nLiability Fairness Act, which I have cosponsored, by an overwhelming \nvote of 61-37. For those of us who have been working on this issue for \na long time--my involvement dates back to 1985--this is an historic \nday. With passage of this balanced measure, we have taken a huge step \ntoward improving the product liability system for everyone--for the \ninjured people who need fast and fair compensation, for consumers who \nneed quality products to choose from, for those American businesses who \nare at the cutting edge of international competition, and for workers \nwho depend on a strong economy to support their families.\n  I commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton, and their staffs, \nfor their heroic efforts on this measure. From drafting the \nlegislation, to skillfully guiding it through a lengthy debate on the \nSenate floor, they have worked extremely effectively. Their success is \nreflected in the broad bipartisan coalition that supported the bill.\n  I also commend Senator Lieberman, my colleague from my home State of \nConnecticut. He authored an important section on biomaterials. That \nprovision is designed to ensure that manufacturers of life-saving and \nlife-enhancing medical devices have access to raw materials. In recent \nyears, the supply of raw materials has been threatened by litigation. \nThis is a critical problem, and I commend Senator Lieberman for \ncrafting a promising solution.\n  Of course, like any compromise, this bill will not please everyone in \nall respects. I had drafted, for example, an amendment providing a \ndifferent approach to punitive damages. under my amendment, the jury \nwould determine whether punitive damages are appropriate, and the \njudge, guided by certain factors, would determine the amount. That \nprocedure, in my view, offers a better approach to punitive damages \nthan one which provides limits, or caps. Senators Rockefeller and \nGorton incorporated some aspects of my proposal in the final provision, \nand I appreciate their efforts on this difficult issue.\n  The final version of this bill does not contain a provision that I \nhave supported in the past--the Government standards defense. One \naspects of that defense, related to approval of drugs and medical \ndevices by the Food and Drug Administration, was passed by voice vote \nin the House and will, I understand, be considered in conference. I ask \nunanimous consent that a number of letters supporting this provision be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks. As these letters point \nout, inappropriate punitive damages have convinced many corporate \nresearchers to avoid the search for safer and more effective drugs.\n  Once again, I commend my colleagues, particularly Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton, for their bipartisan efforts on the Product \nLiability Fairness Act.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Dodd: As a physician volunteer, I treat AIDS \n     patients at the Whitman-Walker Clinic. The suffering that I \n     see--and the threat of an ever-wider epidemic--convince me \n     that the greatest gift anyone could give to society would be \n     an AIDS vaccine. If I were the chairman of a philanthropic \n     foundation, I would invest every dollar in vaccine research.\n       However, if I were CEO of a pharmaceutical company, knowing \n     that the investment in my company represented the retirement \n     and college savings of many of my stockholders, I wouldn't \n     touch AIDS vaccine research with a ten-foot pole--until the \n     liability issue has been successfully addressed.\n       Even the safest, most widely accepted vaccines entail \n     risks--and potentially bankrupting liability burdens. \n     Childhood vaccines are available in adequate supply only \n     because Congress passed the Childhood Vaccine Compensation \n     Act. This came about only because several manufacturers got \n     out of the business of manufacturing childhood vaccines due \n     to liability concerns--raising fears of a dangerous scarcity.\n       In 1975, a man who got polio after changing his baby's \n     diaper sued the manufacturer of the Sabin polio vaccine, \n     which the baby had received. The risk of polio transmission \n     was known, but small--about 1 in 1 million. Nevertheless, the \n     jury awarded punitive damages. The award was later reversed, \n     but only by the narrowest possible margin. The very fact that \n     such a widely acclaimed health advance could expose a \n     manufacturer to punitive damages would certainly give pause \n     to any manufacturer considering research on an AIDS vaccine--\n     which entails special liability risks.\n       With a preventive AIDS vaccine, people who are vaccinated \n     will probably turn HIV positive--with all the social stigma \n     and threat of job loss or insurance loss that this involves. \n     There is a risk that a very small number of people will get \n     AIDS from the vaccine. Additionally, there is the risk that \n     the vaccine won't ``take'' in all cases and that some people \n     who think they are protected may engage in risky behavior and \n     come down with AIDS. All of these eventualities could result \n     in lawsuits.\n       In the case of therapeutic vaccines for people who already \n     have the disease, it would be very difficult to distinguish \n     the symptoms of AIDS from any side-effects of the vaccine. \n     And people with AIDS, prodded by unscrupulous lawyers, might \n     easily be tempted to sue vaccine manufacturers.\n       Unless the liability threat is alleviated--at least by \n     exempting manufacturers of FDA-approved products from \n     punitive damages--developing an AIDS vaccine is decidedly a \n     ``no-win'' proposition. This is outrageous, unfair, tragic--\n     but true.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Siegfried, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      May 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: We are writing to ask that you vote in \n     favor of a proposal that we believe will have a positive \n     effect on research and development of new medicines and \n     medical devices. American innovation is in trouble in the \n     courts particularly in the high risk areas of reproductive \n     health. Liability fears have caused the withdrawal of new \n     drugs and medical devices that the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) considers safe and effective. We \n     understand that when S. 565, the ``Product Liability Fairness \n     Act of 1995'' is considered on the Senate floor, an amendment \n     will be offered that would prevent juries from second-\n     guessing the FDA's scientific decisions that a drug is safe \n     insofar as punitive damages are concerned.\n       The proposed FDA-approval defense to punitive damages would \n     establish a defense to punitive damages in tort actions \n     involving drugs or devices approved by the FDA and subject to \n     FDA regulation. The defense would apply only to punitive \n     damages, and would not be available to a manufacturer that \n     has withheld or misrepresented information to the FDA, \n     including all required post-approval disclosure of unexpected \n     adverse effects.\n       In the past twenty years, most companies have halted U.S. \n     research on contraceptives and drugs to combat infertility \n     and morning sickness. As a case in point, Bendectin, a \n     morning-sickness drug, was removed from the market by its \n     manufacturer in 1984 after more than 2,000 lawsuits were \n     filed claiming it caused birth defects. Merrell Dow has spent \n     over $100 million defending those suits and is still doing \n     so. Even though almost every court which has looked at the \n     issue has determined that there is no scientific evidence to \n     support the contention that the drug causes birth defects, \n     and even though Bendectin is still approved by the FDA for \n     use in pregnancy, no manufacturer will risk making a morning \n     sickness drug.\n       The 1970s brought more litigation over oral contraceptives \n     than any other drug. In the early 1970s, there were 13 \n     companies doing research and development on contraceptives. \n     Eight of these were American. Today there are only two major \n     U.S. companies doing such research. In 1990, a distinguished \n     panel of scientists put together by the National Academy of \n     Sciences noted that due to fear of lawsuits, the United \n     States is decades behind Europe and other countries in the \n     contraceptive choices it offers women.\n       In early 1994, because it had spent tens of millions of \n     dollars defending against suits by people claiming injury \n     from tempero-mandibular joint implants, DuPont announced it \n     would no longer make polymers available to the medical device \n     industry in the United States. These polymers are used in \n     artificial hearts, pacemakers, catheters, hip and knee \n     prostheses, and a host of other implantable devices. We have \n     not even begun to feel the full impact of that decision.\n       The Senate is taking advantage of an unprecedented \n     opportunity to fix a flawed product liability system. We ask \n     that you include \n        [[Page S6454]] a reform that will encourage the \n     development of better medical products without impairing the \n     ability of people who are injured from recovering just \n     compensation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Sander,\n         Allergy and Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics, \n           Fairfax, Virginia.\n     Patricia Tompkins,\n         National Black Nurses' Association, Washington, DC.\n     Dorothy I. Heigh,\n         National Council of Negro Women, Inc., Washington, DC.\n     Adele Baker,\n         Wright, Robinson, McCammon, Osthimer and Taturn, \n           Washington, DC.\n     Susan Walden,\n         Renaissance Women Foundation, Washington, DC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         National Family Planning & Reproductive Health \n           Association,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate considers S. 565, ``The Product \n     Liability Fairness Act of 1995,'' we urge you to support a \n     provision known as the FDA defense. With the FDA defense, \n     companies would not be held liable for punitive damages in a \n     lawsuit if the drug or medical device involved received pre-\n     market approval from the FDA, and if the company fully \n     complied with the FDA's rigorous requirements, which include \n     specifying the warnings that companies must provide about \n     their products and furnishing post-market reports on adverse \n     reactions.\n       As an organization dedicated to expanding medical research \n     and increasing access to products that can improve women's \n     reproductive health, we know firsthand the extent to which \n     the current liability system is impeding these important \n     goals. In 1990, a distinguished panel of scientists put \n     together by the National Academy of Sciences noted that due \n     to U.S. Pharmaceutical companies fear of lawsuits, the United \n     States is decades behind Europe and other countries in the \n     contraceptive choices it offers women. An FDA defense would \n     begin to turn the tide on this disturbing trend by \n     encouraging research and development of products women need \n     without impairing the ability of women who are injured by \n     drugs and medical devices to recover just compensation.\n       We are deeply distressed that opponents of reform are \n     mounting a fear-based campaign directed at women as their \n     strategy to block change. A great deal of misinformation has \n     been circulated concerning the impact of the FDA defense on \n     women. We certainly recognize that women have had a painful \n     history with medical products, such as DES and the Dalkon \n     Shield, which have caused tragic injuries to women and their \n     children. Opponents of an FDA defense are mistaken, however, \n     in claiming this provision would have prevented plaintiffs \n     from collecting punitive damages in these cases. In fact, the \n     Dalkon Shield was on the market before the Medical Devices \n     Amendment was adopted in 1976, and thus, was never approved \n     by the FDA. As for DES, various manufacturers involved are \n     alleged to have defrauded or withheld information from the \n     FDA, and therefore would not be covered by the FDA defense.\n       The FDA defense would allow plaintiffs to obtain full \n     compensatory damages and non-economic damages, including \n     medical costs, lost wages, loss of functioning, and pain and \n     suffering. We would not support the FDA defense if limited a \n     plaintiff's ability to obtain full compensatory and non-\n     economic damages in any manner. The FDA defense would limit \n     only punitive damages. Also, the FDA defense would not be \n     available to any company that is found to have lied or \n     withheld information from the FDA or otherwise failed to \n     comply with FDA rules.\n       The FDA defense is crucial given the current legal climate. \n     A quick review of recent events clearly points out the impact \n     of current policies. During the 1970s, there were 13 \n     companies doing research and development on contraceptives. \n     Eight of these companies were American. Today, only two \n     American companies continue to conduct such research.\n       Given the current legal climate, it is easy to understand \n     why companies are increasingly reluctant to make available \n     products, despite their known therapeutic value. Two cases in \n     point:\n       Bendectin, a morning sickness drug that was taken by over \n     30 million American women, was removed from the market by its \n     manufacturer in 1984, after more than 2,000 lawsuits were \n     filled claiming it caused birth defects. The manufacturer has \n     spent over $100 million defending those lawsuits and is still \n     doing so. Even though almost every court that has looked at \n     the issue has determined there is no scientific evidence to \n     support the contention that the drug causes birth defects, \n     and even though Bendectin is still approved by the FDA for \n     use during pregnancy, no other manufacturer will risk making \n     a morning sickness drug.\n       Norplant, one of the most significant contraceptive \n     developments of the past 20 yeas in the United States, was \n     approved by the FDA in 1990. It is now the target of numerous \n     cookie cutter, mass-produced class action lawsuits fueled by \n     sensationalism and slick advertising directed at women. \n     Despite the fact that Norplant continues to be supported by \n     the medical community--as recently as a March 1995 \n     endorsement by the American Society for Reproductive \n     Medicine--many women have been driven by unwarranted fears \n     away from a safe and effective contraceptive product.\n       Punitive damages are meant to punish willful, flagrant, \n     malicious or grossly illegal behavior. A company that has \n     compiled in good faith with the FDA's regulations cannot be \n     guilty of such behavior and should not be threatened with \n     punitive damages. Nor should juries be permitted to second-\n     guess the expert judgment of the FDA on whether the benefits \n     of a drug outweigh the risks.\n       Increasingly, the legitimate concerns for the health and \n     welfare of American women are being sidelined in the pursuit \n     of large financial settlements. It is our view that inclusion \n     of a FDA defense, similar to the one included in the House-\n     passed product liability bill, would provide a much needed \n     incentive for increased investment in women's health research \n     and technologies. We believe this is a measured response and \n     we urge you to adopt an FDA defense in any final product \n     liability legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judith M.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     SR-444 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: We have been asked to convey our views \n     with regard to an amendment to H.R. 956, the Product \n     Liability Fairness Act, to establish a defense to punitive \n     damages for FDA-approved drugs and devices. Each of the \n     undersigned has served at some time as Chief Counsel to the \n     Food and Drug Administration. Each of us, in our current \n     professional capacities, advises firms engaged in the \n     manufacture of drugs and devices. However, the views \n     expressed in this letter reflect our shared personal \n     judgment.\n       The proposed defense to punitive damages for the marketing \n     of medical products that meet applicable federal regulatory \n     requirements makes eminent sense as a matter of public policy \n     and can be expected to facilitate the development and \n     continued availability of important products to treat and \n     prevent serious disease and to address other significant \n     health concerns. We describe below FDA's philosophy of new \n     drug regulation and its powers in this area, which, we \n     believe, strongly support the defense.\n       FDA exercises sweeping authority over the development, \n     manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceuticals. Indeed, no \n     other industry in this country is subject to such a \n     comprehensive regulatory scheme. Pursuant to its statutory \n     mandate, FDA requires premarket approval of all new drugs. A \n     new drug may not be approved unless it has been shown to be \n     safe and effective under the conditions of use described in \n     its labeling.\n       In making their approval decisions, FDA physicians and \n     scientists employ a risk-benefit standard. This standard \n     recognizes that all drugs have unavoidable risks, some of \n     them very serious. Therefore, FDA allows drugs onto the \n     market only when the benefits from using a drug outweigh \n     those risks. A drug's labeling is an important factor in \n     making the approval decision. Once a drug is available, the \n     treating physician, apprised of the recognized significant \n     risks of a drug, can make an informed decision whether a drug \n     is appropriate for use in a particular patient.\n       Inevitably, not all of the risks from a drug can be \n     discovered prior to approval. While manufacturers are \n     required to conduct extensive clinical trials, often in \n     thousands of patients, some adverse events are so rare that \n     they emerge only after a drug is in widespread use after \n     approval. FDA therefore requires manufacturers to report all \n     adverse events to the agency. The most serious of these must \n     be reported within 15 days. FDA and the Justice Department \n     have vigorously enforced the adverse event reporting \n     requirements through a series of widely publicized criminal \n     prosecutions.\n       FDA has the power to act swiftly and decisively when \n     postmarket surveillance does identify a safety issue. The \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services can immediately \n     suspend approval of a drug that poses an imminent hazard, \n     prior even to granting the manufacturer a hearing. FDA also \n     can compel labeling changes to incorporate new safety \n     information. As a practical matter, formal action under any \n     of these authorities is rarely necessary because, in our \n     experience, companies generally comply voluntarily with \n     agency requests.\n       With this context, the desirability of the punitive damages \n     defense is readily apparent. Where manufacturers have \n     complied with all of FDA's approval, labeling, and safety \n     reporting requirements, they should not be open to punishment \n     through the imposition of punitive damages. This defense does \n     nothing to restrict the availability of \n      [[Page S6455]] compensatory damages. Injured persons will \n     still be made whole for their losses under the law. And they \n     will even be able to recover punitive damages in cases where \n     their injuries were caused by violations of FDA regulations. \n     The defense simply recognizes--as a clear rule--that \n     manufacturers who comply with FDA's comprehensive regulatory \n     process do not manifest the type of willful misconduct that \n     could merit punitive damages.\n       While we recognize that the imposition of punitive damages \n     is a comparatively rare (but by no means unknown) event, the \n     threat of punitive damage awards skews the entire litigation \n     process and, with it, the process for developing new drugs \n     and making them available to the public. Pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers have withdrawn beneficial products from the \n     market and have ceased promising research because of this \n     threat. Congress is now in the position to remove this \n     obstacle and thereby to make a genuine contribution to the \n     public health. We therefore urge you to support the FDA \n     approval amendment to H.R. 956.\n       Sincerely,\n     Thomas Scarlett,\n         Hyman Phelps & McNamara, Chief Counsel--1981-89.\n     Nancy L.

Mr. President, last night my colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Dole, received the prestigious Eisenhower Leadership Prize in \nrecognition of his distinguished service to the United States. I have \nlong admired Senator Dole for his leadership and dedicated service and \nam pleased that the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute and Gettysburg \nCollege recognized him with such a high honor.\n  This prize is made all the more notable because Dwight D. Eisenhower, \nthe award's namesake, is a fellow Kansan and Senator Dole's hero. I add \nmy voice to the many who congratulate him on this honor and ask \nunanimous consent that the remarks Senator Dole gave last night be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I want to thank the Trustees of The Eisenhower World \n     Affairs Institute and Gettysburg College for this honor.\n       I am truly humbled to receive this award. And I thank the \n     Awards Committee for dipping down in the military ranks. The \n     first Leadership Prize went to General Scowcroft. The second \n     to General Colin Powell. Last year you honored Major Lloyd \n     Bentsen. And this year, you're down to Lieutenant Bob Dole. I \n     guess there's still hope for all you Privates out there.\n       A special word of thanks to my colleagues from the 10th \n     Mountain Division who joins us this evening. I've always \n     wondered why they assigned a kid from the plains of Kansas to \n     the 10th Mountain Division. But I've never wondered about the \n     men I served beside. You are all heroes in my book.\n       A few years back, the 10th Mountain veterans formed a \n     national association. Over the years, there have been five \n     Presidents of the Association, and I am honored that all five \n     are here this evening. At least they got to be President of \n     something.\n       I am also honored by the presence of many friends and \n     colleagues of President Eisenhower and of several members of \n     the Eisenhower family.\n       I have been privileged to get to know John on several \n     occasions--including the Eisenhower Centennial in Abilene in \n     1990, and a few years ago in the Capitol when we unveiled the \n     sign which marks the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System.\n       Elizabeth and I are very proud to call David and Julie \n     Eisenhower our friends. We've also had the pleasure of \n     meeting their children, and can tell you that David and Julie \n     are as good as parents as they are authors.\n       And Mary Eisenhower Atwater was the one who came to my \n     office last year to inform me of my selection as the \n     recipient of this prize. The only promise I had to make to \n     her was that my acceptance remarks would be brief.\n       In fact, I am tempted to do this evening what Ike did one \n     evening when he was President of Columbia University. At the \n     end of a long evening of speeches, Eisenhower's turn came. \n     After being introduced, he stood up and reminded his audience \n     that every speech, written or otherwise, had to have a \n     punctuation. He said, ``Tonight, I am the punctuation. I am \n     the period.'' And he sat\n      down. He later said that was one of the most popular \n     speeches he ever gave.\n       It is a bit intimidating to talk about President Eisenhower \n     and his legacy before family members and friends and who knew \n     him much better than I.\n       I can say, however, that, like countless Kansans and \n     countless Americans, I not only ``liked Ike,'' I regarded him \n     as a hero. I will never forget the first time I saw him. It \n     was the spring of 1952. I had just finished law school, and \n     was serving in the Kansas House of Representatives. General \n     Eisenhower had come home to Abilene to officially launch his \n     Presidential campaign, and I was in the rain-soaked audience \n     that greeted him.\n       That campaign was, of course, wildly successful. And I took \n     it as a good omen that my official announcement in Topeka on \n     April 10 had to be moved indoors because of rain.\n       I did have the privilege of meeting my hero on several \n     occasions during his lifetime, but the truth is I knew him no \n     better than the countless soldiers who called him our \n     general, and the millions of Americans who called him our \n     President.\n       Eisenhower succeeded as a soldier and as a President for \n     many reasons. Intelligence. Courage. Honesty. Leadership. The \n     ability to place the right people in the right spots. These \n     were all qualities Ike possessed.\n       But as I look at the Eisenhower statue in the reception \n     area of my Capitol office, or the painting of Ike that hangs \n     behind my desk, one word often comes to mind. And that word \n     is ``Trust.''\n       Ike inspired trust as no leader has before or since. \n     Millions of Americans may have voted for Adlai Stevenson in \n     1952 and 1956, but everyone trusted President Eisenhower to \n     do what was best for America.\n       And there's a simple reason why America's citizens trusted \n     Ike. And that's because he trusted America's citizens. Don't \n     get me wrong. President Eisenhower believed in government--\n     our Interstate Highway System is proof of that. But, \n     moreover, Ike believed in citizens. He believed in the wisdom \n     of the American people.\n       When Ike looked at America's people he saw himself. \n     According to David Eisenhower, the title that meant the most \n     to his grandfather was not ``Supreme Commander,'' or \n     ``President;'' rather it was the simple title that all \n     Americans share: The title of ``citizen.''\n       And David reminded me of a speech Ike made in London the \n     month after VE Day. Ike said, ``To preserve his freedom of \n     worship, his equality before law, his liberty to speak and \n     act as he sees fit, subject only to provisions that he \n     trespass not upon similar rights of others--a Londoner will \n     fight. So will a citizen of Abilene.''\n       Throughout World War II, Ike saw himself as someone who \n     would do what any American citizen would do when freedom was \n     at risk. And throughout his Presidency, Ike spoke of how all \n     of us shared with him the responsibility of guiding our \n     country.\n       As Ike said in his first Inaugural address, ``We are \n     summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with \n     industry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with \n     conviction, to weigh our every deed with care and with \n     compassion. For this truth must be clear before us: Whatever \n     America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come \n     to pass in the heart of America.''\n       What do those words mean in the America of 1995? I believe \n     they mean we should rededicate ourselves to remembering the \n     duties of citizenship: To keep informed and to become \n     involved in the decisions that affect the life and future of \n     all the citizens of our country.\n       And they also mean that government should trust the \n     American people with decisions that matter most--the \n     decisions that affect their families and their businesses.\n       To be sure, the 1950's weren't perfect. And as we look to \n     the 21st century, we should not seek to return to those \n     times. But what I hope America can return to is a \n     relationship of trust between the people and their \n     government. And if that's to happen, then we must rein in the \n     federal government. It's too big, too intrusive, and makes \n     too many decisions. I carry a copy of the 10th Amendment with \n     me wherever I go. It's only 28 words long. And it basically \n     states that all powers not specifically delegated to the \n     federal government should be given to the states, and to the \n     people. Dusting off that amendment, and restoring it to its \n     rightful place in the Constitution is my mandate as Majority \n     Leader, and I like to think that it's a mandate that Ike \n     would have heartily endorsed.\n       Perhaps Ike said it best when he responded to those who \n     were urging bigger and bigger government, all in the name of \n     providing Americans with security.\n       ``If all that Americans want is security, they can go to \n     prison,'' Ike said. ``They'll have enough to eat, a bed, and \n     a roof over their heads.\n       But he went on to say that citizens want more than \n     security. We also want freedom. We want dignity. We want \n     control of our\n      lives. We want our government to trust us. And the lesson \n     that Ike taught us is that if the American people believe \n     our government trusts us, then we will trust our \n     government in return.\n       Americans also trusted Ike because he trusted us with the \n     truth. As Supreme Commander, Ike never hid the truth from his \n     soldiers. If a mission was dangerous * * * if some wouldn't \n     be coming home, then Ike laid it on the line. And, with his \n     Kansas candor, he spoke about issues that many in Washington \n     today shy away from. One of those was the federal budget.\n       [[Page S6456]] How much stronger our country would be if \n     our leaders took to heart the prophetic words that Eisenhower \n     spoke in his 1961 farewell address to the American people:\n       Ike said, ``As we peer into society's future, we must avoid \n     the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own \n     ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We \n     cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren \n     without risking the loss also of their political and \n     spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all \n     generations to come, and not to become the insolvent phantom \n     of tomorrow.''\n       As always, Eisenhower matched his words with actions. There \n     have been four balanced federal budgets in the last half \n     century. And Ike gave us three of them. He knew that it was \n     easy to be popular. It is easy to say ``yes'' to every \n     federal program. But he also knew that more important than \n     being popular for a moment is to provide leadership that \n     stands the test of time.\n       Along with trusting the American people, Ike also trusted \n     the values that built our country, and that were instilled in \n     him by his parents in Abilene. Values like hard work. \n     Honesty. Personal responsibility. Common sense. Compassion \n     for those in need. And, above all, love of family, God, and \n     country.\n       These are the values that built America, and they are \n     values that must never go out of fashion, or be regarded as \n     ``politically incorrect,'' by our government or by those in \n     our entertainment industry.\n       Along with trusting our citizens, and trusting our values, \n     there's one final lesson about trust that Eisenhower's life \n     and career can teach us. And that's the fact that the world \n     must always be able to count on American leadership.\n       And that's a lesson I hope we especially remembered \n     yesterday, the 50th anniversary of VE Day. It was American \n     leadership that built the arsenal of democracy which made \n     that victory possible. It was American leadership that held \n     the Allies together during the darkest days of the war. And \n     it was American leadership which conquered the forces of \n     tyranny and restored liberty and democracy to Europe.\n       Make no mistake about it, leadership carries a price. It \n     did during World War II. It did during the Eisenhower \n     Administration. And it does today. But it is a price worth \n     paying. As Ike said in his Second Inaugural Address, ``The \n     building of * * * peace is a bold and solemn purpose. To \n     proclaim it is easy. To serve it will be hard. And to attain \n     it, we must be aware of its full meaning--and ready to pay \n     its full price.\n       And Ike never forgot just what that full price meant. He \n     said that whenever he returned to Normandy after the war, his \n     foremost thoughts were not with the planes and the ships or \n     the guns. Rather, he said, ``I thought of the families back \n     home that had lost men at this place.''\n       I was privileged to walk the beaches of Normandy and to \n     return to the hills of Italy where I saw action during the D-\n     Day commemorations last June. And I, too, thought of the \n     families back home that had lost men, and how we must never \n     forget the cause for which they fought and died. And the only \n     way to ensure that future generations of Americans will not \n     be buried on foreign land, is to continue to provide \n     leadership whenever and wherever it is needed.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored by the confidence \n     bestowed in me through this leadership award and will do my \n     best to meet the high expectations left by the legacy of \n     Dwight Eisenhower.\n       In closing, I want to share with you a few more words of \n     this American hero--and they were words he spoke on that \n     rainy day in Abilene 43 years ago.\n       Returning home led Ike to think about growing up in Kansas, \n     and he said ``I found out in later years we were very poor, \n     but the glory of America is that we didn't know it then: all \n     that we knew was that our parents * * * could say to us, \n     ``Opportunity is all about you. Reach out and take it.''\n       By working together and trusting one another, we can ensure \n     that for generations yet to come, America's parents will \n     still be able to say those words to their sons and daughters. \n     This is what we owe to the memory of people like Dwight \n     Eisenhower and all the GIs of World War II we remembered \n     yesterday. But ultimately, we owe it to ourselves, to our \n     children, and to the future of the country we love.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6455-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          FREEDOM SHRINE FOR THE HOT SPRINGS VA MEDICAL CENTER\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, an exciting event recently took place in \nthe southern Black Hills of South Dakota. The Freedom Shrine, a \ncollection of documents from U.S. history, was dedicated at the Hot \nSprings VA Medical Center in Hot Springs, SD.\n  I commend Maurice Wintersteen, the Exchange Club of Rapid City, and \nHot Springs VA Director Dan Marsh, for their efforts to bring the \nFreedom Shrine to Hot Springs. Late last year, Maurice Wintersteen \napproached the Exchange Club of Rapid City about sponsoring a freedom \nshrine in the local VA Hospital. The Exchange Club of Rapid City agreed \nto his request, and Director Marsh threw his full support behind the \nproject.\n  As a result of their dedicated efforts, the Freedom Shrine became a \nreality and was placed in the rotunda of the VA Domiciliary Building. \nThe Freedom Shrine displays reproductions of 28 historic American \ndocuments, including the U.S. Constitution, President Lincoln's \nGettysburg Address, and President Kennedy's Inaugural Address. It is my \nunderstanding the Hot Springs VA Hospital is the only VA facility in \nthe Nation to have such a freedom shrine.\n  It is very fitting that the Freedom Shrine was dedicated on the 50th \nanniversary of the death of President Franklin Roosevelt--the man who \nled a worldwide alliance against a tyranny that threatened freedom-\nliving people throughout the world. The Freedom Shrine serves as an \nessential reminder to all Americans that the freedom we enjoy today is \nthe direct result of the enormous effort and sacrifice of our \nforefathers, from the pioneers who first settled the Nation, to the \nveterans who gave their lives to defend it and the values we stand for. \nWe must never forget the precious gift they gave us. It is ours to \npreserve for future generations.\n  Inspired by the Freedom Train that toured the United States with \nAmerican historical documents after the Second World War, the National \nExchange Club resolved to display documents from U.S. history in \ncommunities throughout the Nation so that Americans of all ages would \nhave easy access to the rich heritage of their past. Since 1949, many \nfreedom shrines have been installed by exchange clubs in various \ncommunities across the Nation, Puerto Rico, and at American outposts \naround the world. From State capitols to U.S. warships, and hundreds of \nschools across the Nation, freedom shrines serve as an invaluable \nreference for students and other citizens seeking information or \ninspiration from these historic treasures.\n  Again, I congratulate the Exchange Club of Rapid City, Maurice \nWintersteen, Hot Springs VA Director Dan Marsh, and all our veterans \nfor their ongoing commitment to the preservation of American \nprinciples. Their deep pride in the history, traditions, and values of \nour great State and Nation are reflected in the Freedom Shrine. Most \nimportant, they have given present and future generations of South \nDakotans a precious and lasting gift. I salute everyone involved with \nthis inspiring project.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6456-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6456-S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE FUTURE OF THE B-1B BOMBER IS SECURE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last week the Pentagon released a much-\nanticipated report by the Institute for Defense Analyses [IDA] on our \nNation's heavy bomber force structure. This report, the heavy bomber \nstudy, examined the deployment options of our long-range heavy bomber \nforces--in association with additional tactical forces--under the \ncircumstances of two hypothetical, nearly simultaneous world conflicts. \nTo date, the IDA study is the most comprehensive, in-depth analysis of \nthe use of our Nation's three heavy bombers--the B-1 bomber [B-1B], the \nB-2 stealth bomber, and the B-52--in a conventional war-fighting role.\n  I am pleased that the IDA study confirmed what I have said for quite \nsome time: The B-1B is an efficient and effective long-range bomber, \nand it can be used successfully as the centerpiece of American airpower \nprojection. The IDA study suggests that planned conventional upgrades \nto the B-1B would be more cost-effective than purchasing 20 additional \nB-2 bombers. Further, the study recommends that remaining B-2 bomber \nproduction preservation funds should be reallocated to other weapons \nand conventional upgrades. That would allow for a total bomber force \nconsisting of 95 B-1B's, 66 B-52's, and 20 B-2's.\n  As my colleagues know, the B-1B was developed and built at the height \nof the cold war. Thus, it was anticipated that\n its function would be limited to meeting one of several nuclear \noptions. However, the B-1B has shown to be an effective conventional \nforce component--a testament to designers, Air Force strategists and \npilots who recognized the versatility of this aircraft.\n\n  Time and again, the B-1B has had to meet new challenges. For example, \nthe 1994 congressionally mandated assessment test of the B-1B, \nperformed by the 28th Bomber Wing at Ellsworth Air \n [[Page S6457]] Force Base and code named the Dakota Challenge, \nmeasured the readiness rate of one B-1B bomber wing when provided fully \nwith the necessary spare parts, maintenance equipment, support crews, \nand logistics equipment. The Dakota Challenge found that a fully funded \nB-1B wing could maintain an unprecedented 84 percent mission capable \nrate. In addition, improvements were seen in other readiness \nindicators, including the 12-hour fix rate--a measure of how often a \nmalfunctioning aircraft can be repaired and returned to the air within \none half day.\n  By meeting a number of different challenges, the B-1B has earned \njustifiably the designation as the workhorse of the heavy bomber fleet.\n  Based on the analysis of the IDA report, the B-1B should assume a \nprominent role in our Nation's defense. The study recognizes that \nmaintaining the B-1B as the workhorse of the heavy bomber fleet would \nyield the highest return on our defense investment and render the most \ncost-effective contribution to our Nation's heavy bomber requirements. \nWith continued investments in weapons upgrades, I believe the B-1B will \nbe an outstanding and effective conventional heavy bomber capable of \nprojecting America's air power into the next century.\n  Mr. President, over the next several decades, the United States \nincreasingly will be forced to respond rapidly and decisively to \nregional security threats around the globe. Holding 36 world records \nfor speed, payload, and distance, the B-1B is uniquely suited to \nmeeting our Nation's present and future defense challenges. In this \nperiod of budget constraints, I urge my colleagues to consider \ncarefully the recommendations in the IDA Heavy Bomber Study before \ncasting their vote on any defense measures affecting our heavy bomber \nforce structure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6456-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise today to salute a Missourian who \nhas distinguished herself for her bravery while in service to her \ncountry, Margaret Stanfill of Hayti, MO. As a nurse serving in the U.S. \nArmy Nurses Corps during the Second World War, Margaret served her \ncountry with unprecedented bravery and dedication while participating \nin some of the greatest Allied successes of the war.\n  Margaret Stanfill was documented as the first American nurse to \narrive on the beaches of Normandy during the Allies' D-day invasion of \nFrance on June 6, 1944. The wire service accounts of the invasion \nreported that the first nurses to arrive by barge, ``waded ashore while \nbattle-weary soldiers blinked in astonishment.'' The nurses, led by \nMargaret Stanfill and clothed in two layers of men's uniforms with \nsteel helmets, went to work immediately setting up dressing stations in \npup tents and ministering to the wounded. Many of the wounded were \nparatroopers injured as part of the initial assault. I rise today to \nsalute Margaret's bravery and leadership, not only at Normandy, but \nthroughout her life.\n  Margaret Stanfill grew up in Hayti, in the bootheel of Southeastern \nMissouri near the Tennessee border, graduating from Hayti high school \nin 1938. While in high school Margaret was a 4-year member of the \nbasketball team, serving 1 year as team captain. She was also a 4-year \nmember of the Hayti high school tennis team and was county high \nschool's girls singles champion. After graduation, Margaret entered \nnurses training at the Baptist Hospital in Memphis, TN, graduating from \nthere in 1940. After a year in private nursing, Margaret felt the call \nof service end entered the U.S. Army Nurses Corps, training at Camp \nTyson.\n  Margaret arrived in England for additional training on August 1, \n1942. By November of that year, she was among the first nurses to \narrive on shore during the Allied invasion to liberate North Africa. \nThe scenes of Margaret and her surgical operating unit being carried \nashore from barges on the shoulders of their male colleagues appeared \nin news reels shown around the world. Her unit followed the Allied \nadvance through North Africa into Sicily, where Margaret followed the \ninfantry onto European soil at the invasion of Italy before returning \nto England for further training preceding the D-day Invasion.\n  Margaret Stanfill returned from the war and married Wick P. Moore, an \nArmy captain she served with during the North Africa campaign. They \nsettled down in Texas and had three children, two sons and a daughter. \nI once again salute Margaret Stanfill Moore for her service and bravery \nin playing a role in some of the most crucial events in the history of \nour Nation and our world. Her love of freedom and willingness to give \nof herself and her talents for her country sets an example of service \nof which all of us can be proud.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6457-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6457-S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NONPROFIT HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, many may believe that health care reform \nis not an issue in the 104th Congress. But I have been advocating \nreform in one form or another throughout my now 15 years in the Senate, \nand I continue to do so. I have come to the floor on 14 occasions over \njust the last 3 years to urge the Senate to address health care reform. \nOn the first day the Congress was in session in 1993 and again on the \nfirst day in 1995, I introduced comprehensive health care legislation. \nThe Health Care Assurance Act of 1995, S. 18, which I introduced on \nJanuary 4 of this year, is comprised of reform initiatives that our \nhealth care system needs and can adopt immediately. They are reforms \nwhich can both improve access and affordability of coverage and health \ncare delivery and implement systemic changes to bring down the \nescalating cost of care. Today, I again address my colleagues on the \nissue of health care access. I want to bring to the Senate's attention \na particular component of our health care delivery system which is \nuniquely poised to provide innovative services which respond to the \nparticular needs of individual communities, but which is in jeopardy--\nnonprofit hospitals.\n  In my view it is indispensable that there be comprehensive \naffordable, accessible health care for all Americans. I believe the \nessential question is whether we have sufficient resources, that is \nmedical personnel and hospital, laboratory, diagnostic and \npharmaceutical facilities to deliver services. I think we do; and \nnonprofit hospitals are an important resource of innovative, community-\nbased care. Well over 80 percent of the hospitals in this country have \nbeen and are nonprofit institutions. Most nonprofits were founded \ndecades ago and arose from religiously or ethnically identified groups \nand so were dedicated to serving a particular community. Most have \nadhered to this dedication to community and all of them serve without \nrestriction or preference. There are approximately 80,000 voluntary \ntrustees, leaders in their respective communities giving freely of \ntheir time, their energies, and their money to raise the level of \nhealth care in those communities. However, I am concerned that recent \ntrends in the health care market, including the growth of large for-\nprofit hospital systems, and the emphasis on costs and profits of many \nmanaged care organizations as they become economically dominant, \nthreaten the community health focus of nonprofit hospitals.\n  We stand at the threshold of dramatic breakthroughs in understanding, \npreventing, and treating a variety of diseases. Clinical application of \nthe breakthroughs in research will yield wondrous results which will \nalleviate \n [[Page S6458]] human suffering, prolong life, and produce enormous \nsavings in medical costs in the United States. Nonprofit hospitals are \nessential to the application of these breakthroughs for the prevention \nand treatment of disease. The community outreach programs typical of \nnonprofit hospitals demonstrate their dedication to the needs of their \nparticular communities. They are uniquely attuned to the most fiscally \nand personally debilitating diseases of a community and\n therefore provide the services for treatment and prevention most \ndemanded in the community. Prevention is the most successful method of \ncontaining the costs associated with disease as it is the first step \ntoward controlling disease. But the health care system today appears to \nbe making it more difficult for the nonprofit community hospital to be \ndedicated to prevention and accessible treatment for the survival of \npatients.\n\n  While the demand to be competitive is increasing, hospitals' \nresources are dwindling. Changes in the health care system have reduced \nhospital occupancy, and have therefore reduced revenue. The Washington \nPost reported on March 14, 1995, that hospitals have quadrupled the \nnumber of out-patient surgical procedures and same-day procedures now \nexceed the number requiring overnight stays. Health care experts cite \ntechnological advances as well as cost-cutting efforts by insurance \ncompanies as two key factors which have encouraged the growth in \noutpatient services. For-profit hospitals tend to exclude those from \ncoverage and service who cannot afford to pay and minimize nonrevenue \ngenerating outreach programs.\n  On the other hand, nonprofits are committed to their missions to \nprovide high-quality service, thus increasing expense, but not \nnecessarily increasing revenue. The limited revenues which once could \nbe used for outreach and prevention are being reallocated to meet \ntoday's specialized care needs, and at the same time hospitals are \nbeing forced to compete with one another to maintain their existence.\n  As we continue to discuss the reform of our health care system, we \nmust reconcile the two forces which drive provision of hospital care \ntoday, that is profitability and quality. Hospitals should be able to \ncontinue to operate as a community resource, to provide preventive \nmedicine, not only curative medicine. As I have said, prevention is the \nmost economical cure for what ails our health care system, that is \nescalating costs for short- and long-term treatment. Prevention and \nearly detection are the most successful methods of controlling costs \nassociated with disease as they are the first steps toward preventing \nthe inevitable need for costly treatment incurred by disease.\n  In S. 18 I have taken such steps through streamlining the statutory \nprovisions related to the right to decline treatment, increasing \nFederal support for clinical trials at the National Institutes of \nHealth, and increasing public health programs at the State and local \nlevels. I look forward to working and reconciling the competing forces \nin our health care system today to ensure the continuation of \ncommunity-based and -focused prevention and treatment services, such as \nthose historically provided by nonprofit hospitals.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6457-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6458-S6459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CHINA'S OBLITERATION OF TIBET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 7 years ago I visited Tibet, a land of \nstriking beauty whose people are among the most inspiring and \ninteresting I have ever had the privilege to meet. Most of the \nphotographs of Tibet, I had seen before my visit, were of the jagged \nHimalayan Mountains, Buddhist monks, and a sleepy, poor country of \nsubsistence farmers and their herds of yaks. There is another Tibet, \nwhich many people may not be aware of.\n  It was with great sadness that I and my wife Marcelle saw first hand \nthe effects of China's ruthless, systematic campaign to obliterate \nTibetan culture and Tibetan life. We met some of the Tibetans who had \nsuffered under Chinese occupation, and saw the empty palace of the His \nHoliness the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India and who I have had \nthe honor of meeting several times. Since our visit, and despite \ninternational condemnation, China's campaign of cultural annihilation \nhas steadily progressed.\n  A recent article in Newsweek magazine describes the genocide. Tibet \nis being overrun by the Chinese. According to the article, Lhasa, \nTibet's capital, is now at least 50-percent non-Tibetan. Buddhist \nmonasteries have been destroyed, the Tibetan language is suppressed, \nand Tibet's natural resources have been plundered.\n  There are 60,000 Chinese troops in Tibet, whose job is to instill \nfear and quell any dissent. Public gatherings are monitored with video \ncameras, and protesters are quickly arrested before they attract \nattention.\n  Mr. President, Tibet is perhaps the most vivid example of why the \nChinese Government is widely regarded as among the world's most \nflagrant violators of human rights. A decade from now, if current \ntrends continue, the only thing left of Tibetan culture may be a \nmemory. Even today it may be too late to prevent that result, since it \nwould take a major, international campaign to turn back the Chinese \ntide. I, for one, would welcome such a campaign, because I believe we \nhave a responsibility to try to protect endangered peoples whose \nexistence is threatened with cultural genocide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Newsweek article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 3, 1995]\n\n                       China Invades Tibet--Again\n\n                            (By Melinda Liu)\n\n       Chip * * * chip. That's the sound of Tibetan civilization \n     being hacked away. Below Lhasa's imposing Potala Palace, home \n     of the exiled Dalai Lama, Chinese stonemasons chisel granite \n     that will pave a vast new plaza with government monuments. \n     The ancient downtown, some of it dating from the seventh \n     century, has already suffered a terminal face-lift. The \n     1,000-room Potala is now surrounded by hair-dressing salons, \n     chain-smoking prostitutes and karaoke bars blaring Madonna \n     music. Streets that once housed traditional Tibetan tea shops \n     have given way to rows of greasy Chinese eateries run by \n     recent arrivals from China's interior. Just outside the \n     capital, young Tibetan boys scavenge at a new open dump piled \n     high with trash. ``The Chinese keep coming,'' complains one \n     Lhasa resident, ``especially those who can't find jobs \n     anywhere else.''\n       The Chinese are invading Tibet--again. Four decades after \n     the People's Liberation Army seized the kingdom and crushed \n     an uprising by the followers of the Dalai Lama, Beijing has \n     found a more effective method of conquest: money. In 1992 the \n     government lifted controls on Chinese migration to Tibet, \n     then made it worthwhile by offering jobs that paid two or \n     three times the rate of the same work in China's interior. \n     Last year alone Beijing invested some $270 million in 62 \n     projects--including the plaza near the Potala and a solar-\n     powered radio and TV station that will broadcast Communist \n     Party propaganda in Tibetan. As a result of these \n     inducements, Lhasa's population is now at least 50 percent \n     non-Tibetan, according to Western analysts.\n       Locals might not mind so much if they thought they were \n     getting more of the economic benefits. Tibet--which means \n     ``Western treasure house'' in Mandarin--has long been \n     plundered for its gold, timber and other resources and \n     remains unremittingly poor. Many Tibetans still live a \n     nomadic hand-to-mouth existence. Working herds of shaggy yaks \n     in the summer and retreating to the capital in the winter to \n     seek alms until the winter snows subside, they earn less than \n     $100 per year. But now maroon-robed monks compete with \n     Chinese beggars for spare change. Lhasans also grumble that \n     most new entrepreneurial opportunities go to outsiders. \n     Government funds are ``inextricably linking Tibet's economy \n     with the rest of China,'' argues Prof. Melvyn Goldstein, a \n     Tibet scholar at Case Western Reserve University. ``This has \n     also resulted in non-Tibetans controlling a large segment of \n     the local economy at all levels, from street-corner bicycle \n     repairmen to electronic-goods-store owners and firms trading \n     with the rest of China.''\n       Gawking nomads: Newcomers have a significant advantage over \n     locals--connections in the Chinese interior. In landlocked \n     Tibet, the best consumer goods were smuggled in from Nepal \n     only a decade ago. Now Chinese Muslim (Hui) peddlers in the \n     vegetable market hawk chicken eggs trucked in from Gansu \n     province, bananas from coastal Guangdong and Lux soap made in \n     Shanghai. Chinese shopkeepers prefer to sell to other Chinese \n     and seem openly disdainful of Tibetans, sometimes grabbing a \n     broom to shoo out gawking nomads who spend too much time \n     fiddling with the merchandise.\n       The tension inevitably erupts. Recently a local sat down in \n     a Hui restaurant to a meal--and pulled from his plate of \n     dumplings what Xinhua news agency called ``a long \n     fingernail.'' The disgusted diner shouted to his friends, \n     ``They're serving human flesh!'' After the enraged \n     restaurateur attacked \n      [[Page S6459]] them with a metal bar, some Khampas from \n     eastern Tibet joined the brawl. The fighting spilled into the \n     street for a while, and resumed the next day. When it was \n     over, several Hui shops had been vandalized; a dozen Tibetans \n     were arrested. The provocations continue. On Lhasa's streets, \n     Chinese vendors sometimes prepare dog meat in plain view of \n     passersby--an outrageous affront to Tibetans, who believe \n     that dogs are reincarnated as people. ``The potential for \n     overreaction,'' says a Western diplomat in Beijing, ``is \n     great.''\n       Government officials dismiss the idea that China is \n     obliterating Tibetan culture. ``That's sheer fabrication,'' \n     snaps Raidi, deputy Communist Party secretary of Tibet, who \n     is Tibetan. He claims that Chinese people constitute less \n     than 3 percent of Tibet's population of 2.2 million--\n     neglecting to mention the 60,000 PLA troops and 50,000 or \n     more migrants in the region. The official press blames \n     Tibet's troubles on a ``psychology of idleness.'' There are \n     now more monks and nuns than high-school students, the Tibet \n     Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, recently pointed out. \n     ``Such a huge number of young, strong people are not engaged \n     in production. * * * The negative influence on economic and \n     ethnic cultural development is self-evident.''\n       But Beijing continues to undermine Tibet's self-\n     sufficiency. Designated as an ``autonomous region,'' Tibet is \n     anything but. Its religious life, as well as its economic and \n     political fate, depends entirely on Beijing. Chinese \n     authorities recently dropped a commitment to mandate the use \n     of the Tibetan language in government offices. ``Tibetans can \n     speak Tibetan at home and at work,'' says a Lhasa \n     intellectual who has a government job. ``But in order to get \n     ahead, you must speak Chinese.''\n       The influx of Chinese people has a political purpose, too--\n     to muffle calls for independence. Many Lhasa residents blame \n     Hui shopkeepers for harboring police during separatist \n     demonstrations back in 1989, and for supporting the brutal \n     crackdown that followed. Today, closed-circuit video cameras \n     monitor activities at major intersections in the Tibetan \n     quarter, around the markets near the fabled Jokhang temple, \n     even in the altar rooms of the Potala Palace. Police pounce \n     on protesters before they can attract crowds. The \n     intimidation seems to be working. ``The Chinese are more \n     clever than we Tibetans,'' says an educated Lhasan. ``So they \n     get all the good jobs. They work very hard, even moving \n     mountains when they want to.'' Beijing's most potent weapon \n     is to make Tibetan culture seem worthless--even in a Lhasan's \n     eyes.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6458-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT ON THE EMERGENCY WITH SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

This Act will \nprovide the jurisdictional element for the Gun-Free School Zones Act of \n1990 required by the Supreme Court's recent decision in United States \nv. Lopez.\n  In a 5-4 decision, the Court in Lopez held that the Congress had \nexceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause by enacting the Gun-\nFree School Zones Act of 1990, codified at 18 U.S.C. 922(q). The Court \nfound that this Act did not contain the jurisdictional element that \nwould ensure that the firearms possession in question has the requisite \nnexus with interstate commerce.\n  In the wake of that decision, I directed Attorney General Reno to \npresent to me an analysis of Lopez and to recommend a legislative \nsolution to the problem identified by that decision. Her legislative \nrecommendation is presented in this proposal.\n  The legislative proposal would amend the Gun-Free School Zones Act by \nadding the requirement that the Government prove that the firearm has \n``moved in or the possession of such firearm otherwise affects \ninterstate or foreign commerce.''\n  The addition of this jurisdictional element would limit the Act's \n``reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have \nan explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce,'' as the \nCourt stated in Lopez, and thereby bring it within the Congress' \nCommerce Clause authority.\n  The Attorney General reported to me that this proposal would have \nlittle, if any, impact on the ability of prosecutors to charge this \noffense, for the vast majority of firearms have ``moved in * * * \ncommerce'' before reaching their eventual possessor.\n  Furthermore, by also including the possibility of proving the offense \nby showing that the possession of the firearm ``otherwise affects \ninterstate or foreign commerce,'' this proposal would leave open the \npossibility of showing, under the facts of a particular case, that \nalthough the firearm itself may not have ``moved in * * * interstate or \nforeign commerce,'' its possession nonetheless has a sufficient nexus \nto commerce.\n  The Attorney General has advised that this proposal does not require \nthe Government to prove that a defendant had knowledge that the firearm \n``has moved in or the possession of such firearm otherwise affects \ninterstate or foreign commerce.'' The defendant must know only that he \nor she possesses the firearm.\n  I am committed to doing everything in my power to make schools places \nwhere young people can be secure, where they can learn, and where \nparents can be confident that discipline is enforced.\n  I pledge that the Administration will do our part to help make our \nschools safe and the neighborhoods around them safe.

In \n     Puerto Rico, studies conducted by distinguished professionals \n     have established the negative effect on human behavior \n     produced by the messages of violence transmitted in the \n     communication media.

The Congress \n     of the United States has directed that the Federal \n     Communications Commission is the agency responsible for \n     regulating the same.

A bill to designate the United States Post Office building \nlocated at 24 Corliss Street, Providence, Rhode Island, as the ``Harry \nKizirian Post Office Building,'' and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n          THE HARRY KIZIRIAN POST OFFICE BUILDING ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill for Senator Pell \nand myself. This deals with the designation of the U.S. Post Office \nbuilding located on 24 Corliss Street in Providence. Under the new \ndesignation it becomes the ``Harry Kizirian Post Office Building.''\n  Mr. President, today Senator Pell and I are introducing legislation \nto name the post office at 24 Corliss Street in Providence, RI after a \nrenowned Rhode Islander and a proud American--Harry Kizirian. \nRepresentatives Jack Reed and Patrick Kennedy are introducing identical \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. The Rhode Island \ncongressional delegation is united in its desire to honor Harry \nKizirian for his years of service to our State.\n  Mr. President, just a word about Harry Kizirian. He is a celebrated \ncitizen in our State. For many, many years he has been postmaster of \nour principal post office. He is a community leader.\n  Harry Kizirian is a household name in Rhode Island because of his \nlifelong career in the Postal Service but, even more so, because of his \ninvolvement\n with and commitment to his community. He has served on the board of \ndirectors of Butler Hospital, Big Brothers of Rhode Island, the \nProvidence Human Relations Commission, Rhode Island Blue Cross, and the \nRhode Island Heart and Lung Associations. Over the years he has earned \ncountless awards \n [[Page S6463]] and citations for his community involvement. He was \ninducted into the Rhode Island Hall of Fame and received the Roger \nWilliams Award. He served on advisory boards for Rhode Island College, \nProvidence Heritage Commission on R.I. Medal of Honor Recipients, the \nDisabled American Veterans, and the Marine Corps League. Harry Kizirian \nis a husband, a father, a grandfather, a Postmaster to Rhode Island, \nand a decorated World War II hero.\n  The lessons learned from Harry Kizirian are lessons of fortitude, \nvalor, strength of character, and perseverance.\n  While Harry was just a boy in school, at Mt. Pleasant High School in \nProvidence, he went to work part-time as a postal clerk. He was 15 \nyears old and his father had died, so Harry took responsibility for \nsupporting his family. He did so while keeping his grades up and \nparticipating in athletics. Twenty years later, at 35, Harry was named \nPostmaster of Rhode Island, a position he held for more than 25 years.\n  Like many young men at the time, Harry's job was interrupted by World \nWar II. The day after high school graduation Harry enlisted in the \nMarine Corps.\n  After going through training, he ended up with the marines that were \ninvading Okinawa.\n  He fought on Okinawa with the\n   6th Marine Division. He was awarded the Navy Cross--the second \nhighest honor a Marine can receive--for his valor on Okinawa. What did \nhe do for it?\n\n  Harry and a group of Marines were pinned down by a Japanese machine \ngunner. Harry got up and ran toward the machine gun. He was shot in the \nlegs. Despite his injuries, he pulled himself forward and eliminated \nthe enemy position. This extraordinary act of valor sent Harry \nKizirian, a teenage boy, to a hospital in Guam with the Navy Cross, a \nBronze Star, and a Purple Heart with a gold star.\n  Harry Kizirian was seen by millions of Americans as the face of the \nwar in the Pacific. Before he was injured, a news photographer captured \nhis image, the image of a boy in battle--by that time he was the age of \n19--for the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine. Last November, \nI was present when Harry was honored by his old Atwood-Bucci Detachment \nof the Marine Corps. The famous photograph was prominently displayed on \nthe podium. It has been 50 years since that picture was snapped and \nmany have glorified the war, but not Harry. Harry's message to young \npeople, and to all of us, is that ``war is awful. There's no way to \ndescribe it. Nobody wins a war.''\n  After the war, Harry returned to Providence and to his job at the \npost office. He was a substitute clerk. By 1954 he was made foreman. He \nwas named Assistant Superintendent during the transition from the old \npostal system to the turnkey mechanization system. The Providence post \noffice on Corliss\n Street was the first post office in the country to use the turnkey \nsystem. The turnkey system was the first fully automated system for \nsorting the mail. Until that point, all of the mail was sorted by hand. \nThe new system was not easily implemented, but once again Harry \npersevered. In 1961, Harry was rewarded for his hard work and \ndedication. He was named Postmaster of Rhode Island.\n\n  What better way to honor the life and lessons of Harry Kizirian than \nto name the Post Office on Corliss Street for him. I am pleased to \nintroduce this bill today with Senator Pell and hope that it will \nreceive speedy consideration by the Subcommittee on Post Office and \nCivil Service of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  So it seems very fitting, Mr. President, that this post office in our \ncapital city should be named after Harry Kizirian.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I join with my friend and colleague, Senator \nChafee of Rhode Island, in introducing legislation to designate the \nU.S. Post Office building at 24 Corliss Street, Providence, as the \nHarry Kizirian Post Office Building.\n  I am enthusiastic about this designation. I can think of no more \nfitting tribute. Harry Kizirian has made extraordinary contributions to \nthe United States, to Rhode Island and to Providence.\n  A very brief review of his contributions is instructive. Harry \nenlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from Mt. Pleasant \nHigh School. He subsequently became Rhode Island's most decorated \nmarine.\n  He fought in Okinawa and was shot in battle. He earned the Navy \nCross, the Bronze Star with a ``V'', the Purple Heart with a Gold Star \nand, finally, the Rhode Island Cross.\n  Upon his return to Rhode Island, he went to work at the post office, \nwhere he had worked as a 15-year-old to support his widowed mother. He \nworked his way up through leadership positions in the Postal Service.\n  He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as postmaster in 1961, a position \nhe held for 25 years. In addition to his military service and his work \nin the Postal Service, he has served on numerous committees and boards \nin Rhode Island.\n  Harry served on the board of directors of Butler Hospital, Big \nBrothers of Rhode Island, the Providence Human Relations Commission, \nRhode Island Blue Cross and Rhode Island Heart and Lung Associations.\n  He also was a member of the Community Advisory Board of Rhode Island \nCollege, the Providence Heritage Commission, the Commission on Rhode \nIsland Medal Honor Recipients, DAV and the Marine Corps League.\n  Harry Kizirian already is a Rhode Island landmark. His name has \nbecome synonymous with the qualities he exemplifies--dedication, \nloyalty, leadership and hard work.\n  The Harry Kizirian Post Office Building will be an entirely \nappropriate testament to his remarkable life and friendships.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 787. A bill to provide an exemption from certain hazardous \nmaterial transportation regulations for small cargo tank vehicles with \na capacity of not more than 3,500 gallons that transport petroleum, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation \nto reduce yet another regulatory burden on many petroleum marketers and \nother small businesses across the country. My bill would prohibit the \nDepartment of Transportation's Research and Special Programs \nAdministration [RSPA] from enforcing an unwarranted and unnecessary \nregulation on operators and owners of small cargo tanks of 3,500 \ngallons or less and return that authority back to the States where it \nbelongs. Specifically, my bill would repeal a regulation promulgated by \nRSPA which requires cargo tank operators and owners to comply with \ncumbersome Federal testing inspections and retrofitting mandates.\n  Members of the Montana-Western Petroleum Marketers Association and \nthe Petroleum Marketers Association of America have been especially \nnegatively impacted with RSPA's requirements. The cost of the \nregulation to small businesses often costs thousands of dollars, with \nlittle additional safety protection. In addition, the Federal \ninspection requirements often force cargo tank operators to travel \ngreat distances to comply with the regulations. It is time that we \nforce regulators to be responsible and establish justification before \nthe implementation of such regulations. I think we could send a clear \nmessage by passing my proposed legislation.\n  Many of the cargo tank owners and operators are owned by small ``mom \nand pop'' businesses, who operate on a slim profit margin. The cost of \ncompliance can be devastating to their business. For years, States had \nthe authority to inspect small cargo tank vehicles. Not only was this \nmore convenient for owners and operators, but States had the ability to \nstructure the program to benefit their constituents. I think we should \nreturn this authority to the States and allow them to make decisions \nwhich best suit their needs.\n  Up until 1991, RSPA provided an exemption of cargo tanks carrying \n3,500 gallons of petroleum product or less. However, since that time, \nRSPA has decided that no tank is too small to regulate and that all \ncargo tank operators should operate under the same rules. In theory \nthis may sound reasonable, but, in reality, small cargo tanks are very \ndifferent from larger tanks and should be treated as such. I ask for \n [[Page S6464]] your support of my legislation and introduce it today \nto restore some common sense into the Federal bureaucracy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 789. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the section 170(e)(5) rules pertaining to gifts of publicly \ntraded stock to certain private foundations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                           gifts legislation\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Kyl, which would permit \nthe full value deduction for gifts of appreciated stock to private \nfoundations.\n  Since 1984, donors have been allowed to deduct the full fair market \nvalue of certain gifts and publicly traded stock given to private \nfoundations. In other words, if an individual has a private foundation \nthat he has set up, and he has some stock--in General Electric, for \nexample, that has appreciated substantially--when he makes a gift of \nthat stock to the foundation, and General Electric, say, is trading at \n58, that the full value of that stock, namely each share at the present \nvalue of 58, is a deductible contribution by the donor.\n  Clearly, if an individual made such a contribution to Yale University \nor to the United Way, whatever it was, the full value of the stock \nwould be a deductible contribution.\n  And the question here is, what about now, the contribution of that \nstock to a private foundation? Up until January 31, 1994--in other \nwords last January--December 31--it has been possible to get a full \ndeduction for the contribution of stock to a private foundation.\n  Unfortunately, on that date, the action which provided for the full \ndeductibility terminated. It sunsetted.\n  Mr. President, I would like to stress that private foundations are \nnonprofit organizations. They support charitable activity. They have to \ndo that or they are not allowed an exemption. They provide support for \nmaking grants to other nonprofit agencies.\n  In other words, sometimes a private foundation has the capacity to \nmake a charitable contribution itself to the United Way or Nature \nConservancy or the Sierra Club or whatever it might be. They provide \nsupport for such things as scholarships and disaster relief. Also, they \nmake grants to individuals.\n  Now, foundations are created by endowments, money given by \nindividuals or by families or by corporations. They make grants and \noperate programs with the income earned from investing the endowments. \nSince most foundations have permanent endowments, they do not have to \nraise funds each year from the public in order to continue their work.\n  Most functions, charitable activities every year have to go out and \nraise money so they are reluctant to get into long-term commitments, \nbut foundations such as the Ford Foundation with a substantial amount \nof money that they know is there--realizing the income is going to be \nthere next year, they are not dependent upon annual donations--act as \nthe research and development arm of our society.\n  In a 1965 Report on Private Foundations, the Treasury Department \nrecognized the special nature of foundations by describing them as \n``uniquely qualified to initiate thought and action, experiment with \nnew and untried ventures, dissent from prevailing attitudes, and act \nquickly and flexibly.'' Indeed, foundations reflect the innovative \nspirit of the individuals and corporations that endow them.\n  There are more than 30,000 private foundations in America today that \nprovide over $10 billion annually to support innumerable projects, \nlarge and small. Among other things, they help the poor and \ndisadvantaged, advance scientific and medical research, and strengthen \nthe American educational system.\n  Let me give you a few examples of some of the medical advances that \nhave occurred as a result of the financial assistance provided by \nprivate foundations:\n  The polio vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 after the Sarah \nScaife Foundation provided him with the money he needed to establish \nand equip his virus laboratory.\n  With the help of the Commonwealth Fund, Dr. Papanicolaou discovered \nin 1923 that cervical cancer could be diagnosed before a woman \npresented any symptoms. That breakthrough led to the basic and now \nroutine diagnostic technique known as the Pap smear.\n  In 1951 Dr. Max Theiler received the Nobel prize in medicine for his \nwork in developing the yellow fever vaccine. That effort was the direct \nresult of a 30-year, all-out commitment by the Rockefeller Foundation \nto eradicate this disease.\n  But, Mr. President, private foundations have been involved in many \nmore aspects of our daily lives than simply funding medical advances. \nDr. John V.N. Dorr was an engineer in the early 1950's. He speculated \nthat many accidents occurring on our Nation's highways during inclement \nweather were the result of drivers hugging the white lines painted in \nthe middle of the road. Dorr believed that if similar lines were \npainted on the shoulder side of the road, lives could be saved.\n  Dorr convinced transportation engineers in Westchester County, NY, to \ntest his theory along a particularly treacherous stretch of highway. \nThe dropoff in accidents along this part of the road was dramatic, and \nDr. Dorr used his own foundation to publicize the demonstration's \nresults nationally. Today, although State funds are now used to paint \nwhite lines on the shoulder side of the Nation's highways, every person \ntraveling in a motor vehicle is indebted to Dorr and his foundation for \nimplementing this life-saving discovery.\n  As these examples indicate, private foundations provide a great many \nbenefits to our society. By permanently extending this tax incentive, \nwe can continue to encourage individuals to dedicate a substantial \nportion of their wealth to public, rather than private purposes. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this legislation.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Chafee, in introducing a bill to \nrestore a full, fair-market-value deduction for gifts of publicly \ntraded stock to private foundations. This was in fact the law through \n1994, but the provision in the tax code providing for a charitable \ndeduction measured by the fair market value of stock donated to a \nprivate foundation expired on December 31, 1994.\n  As many in this body will recall, I worked for many years to restore \na full, fair-market-value deduction for gifts of appreciated property \nto public charities. That deduction had been limited in 1986 tax \nlegislation for taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, so \nthat they could only deduct the ``basis''--usually, the original \npurchase price--of property donated to public charities, such as \ncollege and universities, museums and other charitable institutions \nthat receive the larger share of their support from the public at \nlarge. Happily, the full, fair-market-value deduction for all such \ngifts--personal property, real estate and intangible property such as \nstock--was restored on a permanent basis in the 1993 budget \nlegislation, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.\n  The bill we introduce today concerns charitable gifts to private \nfoundations, which unlike public charities, receive their support from, \nand are often controlled by, a limited group of individuals. A full, \nfair-market-value deduction for gifts of publicly traded stock had been \navailable in the case of private foundations over the past 10 years \nunder a special rule enacted in 1984 and scheduled to expire on \nDecember 31, 1994. This automatic expiration was intended to provide \nCongress an opportunity to review the private foundation contribution \nrule with the benefit of several years of practical experience under \nit. I believe that most commentators have concluded that the private \nfoundation rules are working relatively well, and that the rule \nproviding for fair-market-value deductions for gifts of publicly traded \nstock has not been a source of compliance problems. As a result, there \nis no reason to provide different treatment for gifts of publicly \ntraded stock to private foundations that is currently provided for such \ngifts to public charities. The bill we introduce today would conform \nthe rules for both.\n  Mr. President, private foundations are an important aspect of \nAmerica's \n [[Page S6465]] nonprofit, independent sector. The contributions made \nby nonprofit institutions to our society in the areas of education, \nhealth, disaster relief, the advancement of knowledge and the \npreservation of our history and cultural artifacts is vast. I daresay \nit is often not fully understood or appreciated, particularly the \nextent to which nonprofit institutions perform functions that are \ntypically governmental undertakings in other societies. Nonprofit \ninstitutions are a part of our culture that we should take care not to \nlose, and government has a role in insuring that they thrive. The \nlegislation we introduce today is a part of that role.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over international terrorism for many years;\n       (2) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over the threat of domestic terrorism after the \n     bombing of the New York World Trade Center on February 26, \n     1993;\n       (3) There is even more public concern, worry and fear since \n     the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in \n     Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995;\n       (4) Public concern, worry and fear has been aggravated by \n     the fact that it appears that the terrorist bombing at the \n     Federal building in Oklahoma City was perpetrated by \n     Americans;\n       (5) The United States Senate should take all action within \n     its power to understand and respond in all possible ways to \n     threats of domestic as well as international terrorism;\n       (6) Serious questions of public concern have been raised \n     about the actions of federal law enforcement officials \n     including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms relating to the \n     arrest of Mr. Randy Weaver and others in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, \n     in August, 1992 and Mr. David Koresh and others associated \n     with the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, between \n     February 28, 1993, and April 19, 1993;\n       (7) Inquiries by the Executive Branch have left serious \n     unanswered questions on these incidents;\n       (8) The United States Senate has not conducted any hearings \n     on these incidents;\n       (9) There is public concern about allowing federal agencies \n     to investigate allegations of impropriety within their own \n     ranks without congressional oversight to assure \n     accountability at the highest levels of government;\n       (10) Notwithstanding an official censure of FBI Agent Larry \n     Potts on January 6, 1994, relating to his participation in \n     the Idaho incident, the Attorney General of the United States \n     on May 2, 1995, appointed Agent Potts to be Deputy Director \n     of the FBI;\n       (11) It is universally acknowledged that there can be no \n     possible justification for the Oklahoma City bombing \n     regardless of what happened at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, or Waco, \n     Texas;\n       (12) Ranking federal officials have supported hearings by \n     the U.S. Senate to dispel public rumors that the Oklahoma \n     City bombing was planned and carried out by federal law \n     enforcement officials;\n       (13) It has been represented, or at least widely rumored, \n     that the motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing may have \n     been related to the Waco incident, the dates falling exactly \n     two years apart; and\n       (14) A U.S. Senate hearing, or at least setting the date \n     for such a hearing, on Waco and Ruby Ridge would help to \n     restore public confidence that there will be full disclosure \n     of what happened, appropriate congressional oversight and \n     accountability at the highest levels of the federal \n     government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that hearings should be held before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on countering domestic terrorism in all possible \n     ways with a hearing on or before June 30, 1995, on actions \n     taken by federal law enforcement agencies in Ruby Ridge, \n     Idaho, and Waco, Texas.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 755\n\n  Mr. HATCH proposed an amendment to amendment No. 754 proposed by Mr. \nSpecter to the bill S. 534, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, there is a lot of emotion and not \nmuch rationality to the question of whether we use fetal tissue to \nassist people who have problems, particularly with Parkinson's disease.\n  It is interesting that in the U.S. Senate, many of those who support \nthe use of fetal tissue comprise those who are totally opposed to \nabortions.\n  I believe their stand makes sense, much more sense than those who \nemotionally oppose use of fetal tissue.\n  If for a reason of taste, or culture, or religion, people are opposed \nto any transplant, I understand it.\n  When I die, if my eyes or any part of me can be used to be of \nassistance to someone else, I want that done.\n  I would think most people who have had an abortion would want the \nsame.\n  The requirements are very strict. You cannot make any money on it. \nYou cannot designate to whom the tissue would go. You cannot even know \nto whom it is going.\n  Joan Beck has written a column in the Chicago Tribune that outlines \nthe situation clearly, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, April 30, 1995]\n\n  An Ethical Dilemma--In Defense of Fetal Tissue Transplants to Treat \n                         Neurological Disorders\n\n                             (By Joan Beck)\n\n       He was 59 years old and he had had Parkinson's disease for \n     eight years. His body was becoming increasingly rigid and \n     immobile. He had trouble moving and talking clearly. He had \n     tremors he couldn't stop and he had to give up his job.\n       The medication that had helped early in the onset of the \n     illness could no longer give him much relief, despite \n     increasing doses. As the disease inexorably progressed, he \n     decided to try a new, experimental treatment, despite the \n     intense political and medical controversy that has marked its \n     development.\n       Surgeons inserted several grafts of fetal tissue into one \n     side of his brain. A month later, they repeated the procedure \n     on the other side. The transplants came from seven donors, \n     aborted babies from 6\\1/2\\ to 9 weeks old.\n       Within a few weeks after the surgery, the man's condition \n     improved markedly, according to a report in the current issue \n     of the New England Journal of Medicine. He could once again \n     handle daily activities, even take part in an active exercise \n     program. He needed less medication, but now it was much more \n     effective.\n       A year and a half after the first transplant, the patient \n     had surgery on his ankle to repair damage from a fracture \n     years earlier. As he was recovering from the operation, he \n     suffered a massive pulmonary embolism and died.\n       Studying his brain after death, doctors found conclusive \n     evidence that the transplants had worked as hoped. The fetal \n     neurons had survived, grown and were functioning, replacing \n     the patient's damaged brain cells, just as the improvement in \n     his symptoms had indicated.\n       An estimated 200 transplants of fetal tissue into human \n     brains have been done over the past several years. Some have \n     been performed in other countries, some under scientifically \n     questionable circumstances. Results have been uneven and \n     often discouraging.\n       The case reported this week is important because it is the \n     first to prove that fetal tissue transplants can survive and \n     function and that they can be linked to a patient's \n     improvement.\n       The long-range implications are medical, political and \n     ethical. The success story offers eventual hope for hundreds \n     of thousands of patients, not only with Parkinson's disease \n     but also with Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and \n     other disorders caused by brain cell impairment and \n     destruction for which no good treatment or cure is now \n     available.\n       Much research is still necessary, however. More data are \n     needed about optimal size of the grafts, whether the tissue \n     can be frozen in advance, which patients are likely to \n     benefit, how long improvement will last, whether the \n     underlying disease will eventually destroy the new brain \n     cells.\n       Fetal tissue is considered necessary for transplants \n     because it can survive and grow where grafts of more mature \n     cells do not. It can take on new biological functions, unlike \n     other cells. And the recipient's body is not so likely to \n     reject it.\n       But the research has been slowed in the past for political \n     and ethical reasons.\n       The problem is that such transplants almost always must \n     come from abortions--and that has raised fierce and \n     intractable opposition from pro-life forces. They see the \n     possibility that women will deliberately get pregnant and \n     have an abortion to provide a graft for a loved one--or even \n     worse, sell the tissue on some sort of medical black market.\n       Even with tight controls, abortion opponents argue, using \n     tissue from aborted fetuses will make it easier for women to \n     decide to have an abortion because they can rationalize that \n     some desperately ill person could benefit and that might ease \n     any guilt feelings they may have.\n       Should fetal transplants eventually prove to be of great \n     medical benefit and become widely used, it will be even \n     harder to rally the nation to oppose abortion--the source of \n     such grafts--pro-life leaders fear.\n       In response to anti-abortion fervor, the Reagan \n     administration prohibited the use of federal funds for \n     research using fetal tissue for humans, a major setback \n     because most research grants are based on federal approval. \n     Some experiments did continue, however, using private money, \n     and in other countries.\n       Under mounting pressure from Congress, President Bush \n     attempted a compromise. He authorized a grant of more than $2 \n     million to study whether fetal tissue obtained as a result of \n     miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies--not deliberate \n     abortions--could be used for transplants.\n       The answer turned out to be no. Out of 1,500 such fetuses \n     tested, all but seven were unsuitable because of chromosome \n     errors (a major cause of miscarriage) or problems with \n     bacteria and virus contamination.\n       In 1993, President Clinton finally lifted the ban on \n     federal funding for fetal tissue research. The use of such \n     transplants is carefully governed by state and federal laws \n     and government and medical guidelines similar to those that \n     cover other transplants, including the Uniform Anatomical \n     Gift Act which has been adopted in all states.\n       The stark facts remain. Abortion is legal in the United \n     States. About 1.5 million abortions occur every year. Aborted \n     tissue is now discarded, even though it holds the potential \n     for successfully treating several terrible, intractable \n     diseases.\n       Abortion is a tragedy, as is death from gunshot wounds and \n     traffic accidents. But the success of fetal tissue grafts \n     isn't going to encourage abortion any more than organ \n     transplants increase car crashes and murders.\n       Research is under way to find other means to treat \n     neurological disorders, some of it building on findings from \n     fetal tissue studies. But until these experiments are \n     successful, surely it is more ethical and merciful to try to \n     use fetal tissue than simply destroy it.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6467-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6467-S6468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOY SCOUTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Green Mountain Boy Scouts and congratulate the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica on their 85th anniversary. It seems fitting, indeed, that the \nGreen Mountain Boy Scouts of America will hold its statewide camporee \non the historic Rutland fairgrounds. While 10,000 Vermont scouts and \n4,000 adult volunteer leaders will be marking the 85th anniversary of \nthe Boy Scouts of America in June, the Rutland Fairgrounds prepares to \ncelebrate the 150th anniversary of the Vermont State Fair.\n  To these fairgrounds in 1861 came 1,000 young men to form the First \nVermont Regiment of infantry, the initial unit sent from Vermont to \nfight in the Civil War. It is my understanding that the first night in \ncamp, a chill wind came down off Pico and Killington flattening many of \ntheir tents. It was a strong omen, for hard times were ahead for the \nVermonters who went off to fight in that war. Before it was over, \nnearly 35,000 young men from Vermont would serve, and more than 5,000 \nwould give their lives.\n  Those lads, every one of them volunteers, established a model of \nservice from which Vermont did not falter during four bloody years. It \nis a model that we still find personified by the young people, and \ntheir leaders, who fill the ranks of scouting in Vermont.\n  [[Page S6468]] Not only do scouts well serve the communities in which \nthey live, they are constantly acquiring knowledge and skills which \nwill serve them well in later years--and make them better citizens. In \nscouting lies much of the hope for America in the fast approaching next \ncentury.\n  It is reassuring to know that Vermont still has within its borders \nable young people willing to serve in the best interests of their State \nand Nation, as did the boys of the long ago Civil War days.\n  I want to congratulate the Boy Scouts of America on their 85 years of \nexcellent service to the United States and welcome the Vermont boy \nscouts to my home city of Rutland for their celebration. Rutland is \nwhere I served in my youth as a boy scout. I hope the Vermont camporee \nis as enjoyable and successful as it is historic.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6467-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6468-S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              WORKING FAMILIES ANXIETY OVER EDUCATION CUTS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we should never lose sight of the \nmeaning of the decisions we make here for ordinary Americans and their \nfamilies. This point was brought home to me by an article in Monday's \nNew York Times, ``Families Await News on Cuts in Education Aid.'' I ask \nthat this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  This is a difficult time of year for parents of college-age children. \nAlong with their sons and daughters, they anxiously await college \nacceptance or rejection letters and financial aid offers. They worry \nabout children away from home for the first time, about summer jobs, \nabout SAT scores and grades and about the job market for college \ngraduates. But for the vast majority of parents, the biggest worry is \nhow they will be able to make it all possible for their children.\n  This year, unfortunately, there is another gnawing worry for millions \nof families who rely on Federal student financial aid to make college \npossible. Serious cuts in these programs are being proposed. The \nContract With America calls for the elimination of one of the key \npillars of Federal support for college students--the in-school interest \nsubsidy on guaranteed Federal loans. The Domenici budget plan calls for \nthe elimination of this subsidy for graduate students, but it goes on \nto proposes overall education cuts so severe that the subsidy for all \nstudents is called into question.\n  In addition, campus-based aid programs and other higher education \nprograms are endangered by the severe cuts proposed in discretionary \nspending for educational activities. This casts a shadow over the \nfuture of the College Work Study Program, the Supplemental Education \nOpportunities Grant Program, the State Student Incentive Grant Program, \nand the Perkins Loan Program.\n  Mr. President, education has always been one of the most solidly \nplaced rungs on the ladder of economic opportunity. For generations, \nAmerican families have sacrificed to assure their access to the best \neducation possible. That has paid off for us as individuals and for us \nas a nation. And yet many in Congress are prepared to turn their backs \non this record of success.\n  As we debate the budget resolution in committee this week and on the \nfloor as early as next week, there is clearly a great deal hanging in \nthe balance, not the least of which are the hopes and dreams of \nAmerican families for their children's future. I urge all my colleagues \nto read this excellent article and consider our country's future.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   [The New York Times, May 8, 1995]\n\n              Families Await News on Cuts in Education Aid\n\n                         (By Lynda Richardson)\n\n       These are uncertain times for the family of David and \n     Maureen Grau of St. Paul, Minn. As they await final word on \n     financial aid for the colleges that three of their eight \n     children attend, they worry what sacrifices will need to be \n     made, and even which child might not go.\n       The Graus know that some cuts in Government aid are likely. \n     In the next several weeks, Congress will begin considering \n     the strongest assault in recent years on the array of college \n     loans, grants and work-study programs that many lower- and \n     middle-class families have relied on since passage of the \n     nation's first major Federal student aid program, the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965.\n       And across the nation, governors and legislatures are \n     cutting the state university budgets and considering deep \n     reductions in aid for impoverished students.\n       But in the absence of decisions on what will be cut, the \n     most the Graus can do--like thousands of other Americans--is \n     make contingency plans and hope for the best. Two daughters \n     will cram three extra courses into their full college loads \n     next year so they get through school faster, saving tuition. \n     And all three will work full time--or more--this summer.\n       Baby-boomers, the Graus were themselves beneficiaries of \n     Federal student loans and grants back in the 70's. Mr. Grau, \n     44, is now a registered nurse; his wife, 42, is a homemaker. \n     With an annual income of $36,500, they save and scrimp. They \n     have not bought new furniture, other than a couch, in 23 \n     years.\n       The Graus hold many of the bedrock American beliefs that \n     swept the new Republican leadership into office. They go to \n     Mass every Sunday. They are anti-abortion. Each child has a \n     chore at home. Now, they say they are feeling betrayed.\n       ``We never questioned whether or not college education was \n     available to us,'' Mrs. Grau said. ``Loans, grants and \n     college work-study were there for the taking. All that was \n     truly needed was a desire, and now you have a lot of \n     hurdles.''\n       House Republicans have called for $1.7 billion in cuts in \n     money already appropriated in the $34 billion Department of \n     Education budget for the 1995 fiscal year. They have proposed \n     $20 billion in higher education cuts over the next five \n     years.\n       The largest cut would come from ending the Government \n     subsidy of interest on loans while students are in college, \n     which could save $12 billion in five years. Currently, a \n     student who borrows $5,000 for freshman year owes $5,000 at \n     graduation. Under the proposal, interest would be added to \n     the principal each month, so the $5,000 would become $6,000 \n     or so in debt at graduation. Students would see an average of \n     20 percent to 25 percent more debt when they graduate, \n     financial aid officers say.\n       Republican leaders, in their first 100 days, also suggested \n     dismantling Federal aid programs that are managed by \n     colleges, including the Perkins loans for needy students, \n     Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and work-study \n     programs in which the Federal government pays 75 percent of a \n     student's salary and the institution pays the rest.\n       ``It is safe to say that every low- and middle-income \n     family with a student in college and hoping to send a child \n     to college has a stake in the outcome of the debate that \n     Congress is holding now and will be holding for the next few \n     months,'' said Terry Hartle, spokesman for the American \n     Council on Education, a Washington-based association of 1,700 \n     colleges and universities. ``Many families would find their \n     plans for college disrupted, fundamentally changed or \n     eliminated by major changes in Federal student aid.''\n       But the Republicans who have proposed them say the cuts are \n     necessary for the financial health of the nation. Bruce \n     Cuthbertson, a spokesman for Representative John R. Kasich, \n     the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee, \n     said of loan subsidies, ``We think it's a matter of fairness. \n     We just put this on equal footing with all other types of \n     loans one would receive.''\n       The potential cuts have stirred public protests and private \n     anguish. In the Bronx, Elba Velez, a single mother of three, \n     worries that the cuts will halt her family's fragile upward \n     mobility.\n       ``The programs that are being cut are for the people who \n     need them the most,'' said Ms. Velez, who left welfare behind \n     after getting her degree in the 70's. Her son is a freshman \n     at Wesleyan University.\n       Carmen Vega Rivera and her husband, John, worry that their \n     high school senior will never go to college. Financial aid \n     was crucial to Mrs. Rivera's education. She now heads an East \n     Harlem tutorial program.\n\n\n                the present--being married with children\n\n       The three Grau college students are among the nearly half \n     of all 14.7 million college students who receive student aid. \n     Two daughters attend Concordia College, a small liberal arts \n     school in St. Paul, and the third is at the University of St. \n     Thomas there. Besides the subsidized loans, the young women \n     get a wide array of aid from the Federal Government, the \n     state and the college, and both work during the school year.\n       At Concordia, Amy, a sophomore, who lives at home, received \n     $12,305 in aid this year. Her sister, Sarah, a freshman who \n     lives on campus, was awarded $13,308. The total cost of \n     Concordia is $15,550 for dorm students and $14,500 for \n     students living off campus. The Graus pay the rest.\n       Their older sister, Rochelle, a junior who plans to attend \n     graduate school, is interested in biomedical ethics and \n     philosophy. She received $17,028 in aid this year to pay for \n     books, fees and other expenses at St. Thomas, which has an \n     average student cost of $16,263.\n       Rochelle and Amy are lining up full-time summer jobs, as \n     counter help at a fast-food restaurant and as an office \n     administrator. Sarah will work as a counselor at a day camp.\n       ``They are thinking maybe a part-time evening and weekend \n     job also,'' said her \n      [[Page S6469]] mother, Maureen Grau, 42. This would rule out \n     summer courses, but the women want enough money to pay their \n     expenses all year.\n       Mrs. Grau received a degree in health and physical \n     education at the College of St. Catherine in town. Mr. Grau \n     received a degree in English and education at St. Thomas. He \n     taught, then worked as a mechanic. Four years ago, he \n     returned to college to become a nurse.\n       Mr. Grau says he and his wife are not in a position to help \n     their college-age daughters because they have five more \n     children at home, ages 8 to 17. ``How am I going to educate \n     them?'' he asked. ``I don't know.''\n\n\n               the past--erecting a ladder of opportunity\n\n       For the Graus, the commitment to college education goes \n     back three generations on Mrs. Grau's side; four on her \n     husband's. But for hundreds of thousands of low-income \n     Americans, like Elba Velez of the Bronx, the ``War on \n     Poverty'' in the 1960's brought access to college degrees for \n     the first time. Federal student-aid programs began small but \n     expanded under the Nixon, Carter and Reagan Administrations.\n       Not since the G.I. Bill, after World War II, had the \n     Federal Government played so strong a role in insuring that a \n     specific segment of the population got a chance to go to \n     college. Minority enrollment, in particular, showed a \n     dramatic increase.\n       ``The generation that preceded this one has tremendously \n     benefited from Governmental assistance to attend college,'' \n     said Jamie P. Merisotis, the president of the Institute for \n     Higher Education Policy in Washington. ``Both for individuals \n     and the nation, the payoff is clear.''\n       Ms. Velez was on welfare in the 1970's when she decided to \n     go to college. She had considered a job in Manhattan's \n     garment district but said that when she saw the assembly\n      lines of uneducated women hunched over heavy machinery, ``I \n     looked around and said, `This is not for me. I'm going to \n     take charge of my life. I'm not going to let anyone tell \n     me what I am going to be.'''\n       Ms. Velez enrolled at Bronx Community College in 1979. With \n     the support of Federal Pell grants--created in 1972--and \n     state tuition aid for needy students, she received a \n     bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch \n     College in 1983.\n       ``I have more power,'' she said. ``I am able to provide for \n     my children, but I'm also able to give back to the \n     community.''\n       But she is concerned about her children's future, with the \n     cost of private colleges averaging $9,995 last year. ``I just \n     want my children to have an opportunity to go on to school,'' \n     she said.\n       Her 19-year-old son, Daniel, a bookish young man interested \n     in science and creative writing, gets a $13,975 scholarship \n     from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. In a work-study \n     job that pays $1,400 a year, Daniel re-stocks and cleans the \n     salad bar in the dining hall. He also receives $7,825 \n     annually in subsidized loans, as well as Pell and \n     Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants. He and his \n     mother contribute about $2,090 a year to make up the rest of \n     Wesleyan's $26,790 tuition and board costs.\n       To offset college costs next year, Daniel hopes to find \n     summer work at a fast-food restaurant.\n       His sister, Felicia, a senior at Central Park Secondary \n     School in East Harlem, was recently accepted at Syracuse \n     University. Her financial package covers only $19,000 of the \n     school's $25,000 cost. Felicia cannot expect much help from \n     her mother.\n       And just last week, Ms. Velez learned that she may be laid \n     off at Bronx Community College as part of the cost cutting \n     proposed for the city university system.\n\n\n              The future--$93,000 a Year And Still Worried\n\n       Walking into a noncredit class at New York University more \n     than two decades ago, Carmen Vega Rivera remembers the sea of \n     mostly Hispanic and black faces. Like Mrs. Rivera, many also \n     were first-generation college students.\n       She and the others were enrolled in the state's Higher \n     Education Opportunity Program, created in 1969 for students \n     with both academic and financial need who wanted to go to \n     private colleges. Gov. George Pataki proposes cutting that, \n     along with similar programs at state and city universities, \n     though many legislators are fighting to restore the programs. \n     H.E.O.P. alone would save $22.5 million this fiscal year, the \n     Governor's office said.\n       Mrs. Rivera was 49th of 500 students at the High School of \n     Art and Design in midtown Manhattan but scored poorly on the \n     verbal portion of the Scholastic Assessment Test. ``My chance \n     of coming through the traditional admissions was not \n     likely,'' she said.\n       With intensive counseling, emotional support and tutoring \n     in the special N.Y.U. class, Mrs. Rivera received her \n     bachelor's degree in education and the arts in 1976.\n       Now, at 41, she earns $65,500 a year as executive director \n     of the East Harlem Tutorial Program. Her husband, John, who \n     manages a commercial building, only recently began a $27,000-\n     a-year job. He had stayed at home for the last decade to look \n     after their son, Jaime, now 10.\n       Still, even with a $93,000 combined income, Mrs. Rivera \n     said her family lives from paycheck to paycheck, renting an \n     $800-a-month apartment near Yankee Stadium. There are bills \n     for medical problems and deaths in their extended family, and \n     they support a 17-year-old daughter, Taina, and her 7-month-\n     old child.\n       If Mrs. Rivera had her dream, Taina would attend New York \n     University, she said. But as the family now explores state \n     and city universities, everything seems up in the air.\n       ``As a parent, it's eating up my mind all the time,'' she \n     said. ``I'm thinking, `How am I going to pull it off? Is it \n     all going to work out?'''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6468-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO AVIS B. BAILEY\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow Arkansan, Avis B. Bailey. Avis is the owner of Avis Nissan in \nFayetteville, and I am proud to say, was honored last week by the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration as the 1995 Arkansas Small Business \nPerson of the Year. I had a chance to visit with Avis and her husband \nlast week on the Capitol steps, and I was immediately convinced that \nthis honor is richly deserved.\n  Avis Bailey was born and raised in Prairie Grove, AR. The youngest of \nsix, she married right out of high school and then moved with her \nhusband to Tulsa, OK. Twelve years later and a single parent, she \nreturned to northwest Arkansas and settled in Fayetteville, where she \nworked in her brother's transmission repair shop. In 1971, Avis took \nanother job as a cashier at Hatfield Pontiac and Cadillac, one of \nArkansas' oldest and most respected Cadillac dealerships. This became \njob No. 3 for her. However, in less than 2 years Avis was out from \nbehind the cashier's desk crunching numbers and in the showroom selling \nCadillacs. It was not long before she became one of the State's top \nsalespersons for automobiles and, within 10 years, manager of the \ndealership.\n  Avis told me she could remember when new Cadillacs started selling \nfor over $10,000. It was at that time that her father told her she \nneeded to get out of the business. He said no one would pay that much \nfor a car. Mr. President, 20-some-odds years and many success stories \nlater, Avis B. Bailey bought that Pontiac-Cadillac dealership where she \nstarted as a cashier. I know many people who still dream of owning a \nCadillac someday, and here is Avis with a whole parking lot full. Her \nwhole career is a testament to what hard work and dedication can \naccomplish. She has truly risen through the ranks of the small business \nworld.\n  In 1991, Avis bought a Nissan dealership that was nearly bankrupt. \nIts standing in the community was down, but Avis took the initiative \nand the gamble to take that failing business and turn it around. Within \n3 years, she more than doubled the volume of sales and her number of \nemployees. Sales totaled $11.7 million in 1994 for Avis Nissan. Avis \nand her partners have also bought four more automobile dealerships in \nArkansas, adding both to the economy and to the community. She and her \npartners are now owners of Mazda and Ford dealerships in northwest \nArkansas as well.\n  Mr. President, we need more people like Avis Bailey in this country. \nShe is more than a shrewd business woman. She is filled with a spirit \nthat can make a difference. Avis avidly supports the athletic programs \nof the University of Arkansas, she is a member of both the Fayetteville \nand Springdale Chamber of Commerce, and she's a friend to area grade \nschools, working to furnish school supplies and clothing. We need more \npeople who aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves, work hard, and make \na difference in their communities. Mr. President, I hope you will join \nme in congratulating Avis Bailey on being named the Arkansas Small \nBusiness Person of the Year for 1995.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6469-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6469-S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE MISSING SERVICE PERSONNEL ACT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the \nMissing Service Personnel Act of 1995, introduced by Senators Dole and \nLautenberg earlier this year.\n  The Missing Service Personnel Act is a significant and an appropriate \npiece of legislation. It would establish new methods for determining \nthe status of missing service personnel and improving the means by \nwhich full accountability is achieved. Due in part to the handling of \nPOW/MIA cases by the Department of Defense and the United States \nGovernment since the Vietnam war, existing procedures have been \ncriticized as being unresponsive to the\n[[Page S6470]] needs of effected families. In fact, current law does \nnot adequately address issues that have emerged over the past 25 years \nregarding how missing persons and their families are treated by \nGovernment officials. S. 256 would implement procedures which foster a \nsense of trust and credibility between the Government and families of \nmissing personnel, while attempting to ensure fairness to all involved.\n  Considering the tremendous sacrifices our men and women make when \nfacing combat, maintaining credibility and trust are crucial. Soldiers \nface the terrible prospect of capture and, in turn, their loved ones \nface the horrible possibility of intense anguish and heartache. We must \nassure our armed services personnel and their civilian counterparts \nthat the United States will do everything possible to return them home \nsafely in the event they turn up missing in action. At the same time, \nthey must also be assured that more open and fair procedures will be \nestablished to determine their exact status. S. 256 takes concrete \nsteps to achieve these objectives.\n  There are, however, some issues with the bill that I think still need \nto be reviewed. For instance, S. 256 restricts identification of \nrecovered remains to licensed practitioners of forensic medicine. \nUtilization of personnel in disciplines other than medicine which may \nbe appropriate are not permitted. According to DOD, such a requirement \nwould be unreasonable during combat operations or on the battlefield. \nMoreover, as this legislation would be retroactive to World War II, DOD \nmay be required to review thousands of cases. The Defense Department \nhas indicated that it does not have the personnel or budget to handle \nsuch a workload. These are some issues that I hope the Senate Armed \nServices Committee will look into when reviewing this legislation.\n  Overall, I believe that S. 256 is an important and noteworthy bill. \nThe Government has been perceived as being unresponsive to the needs of \nfamilies whose loved ones are classified as missing in action. This \nlegislation would safeguard the rights of missing armed service members \nwhile addressing the concerns of their effected families and the \nFederal Government. I am pleased to cosponsor the Missing Service \nPersonnel Act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6469-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1995\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Further amendments are expected to the bill, therefore \nSenators should anticipate rollcall votes throughout Thursday's session \nof the Senate, and a late night session could occur with votes into the \nevening. A cloture motion was filed on the substitute this evening. It \nis the hope of the leader, Senator Dole, that the Friday vote could be \nvitiated if an agreement can be reached to conclude the bill by Friday. \nOtherwise, a cloture vote will occur Friday morning.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/10/senate-section/article/S6470-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
