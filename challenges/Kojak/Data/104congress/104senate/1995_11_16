The Senate will now consider House Joint \nResolution 122, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 122) making further \n     continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1996, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate now has under consideration \nHouse Joint Resolution 122, making further continuing appropriations \nfor fiscal year 1996. The resolution provides authority to obligate \nfunds for programs and activities normally funded in the nine regular \nappropriations bills not yet signed into law. The rate of operations is \nto be the lowest of the current rate, the rate proposed by the Senate \nor the rate proposed by the House. Programs and activities terminated \nor significantly reduced under that formulation may be maintained at a \nrate not to exceed 60 percent of the current rate. And the rate of \noperations may be adjusted further to avoid reductions in force.\n  The expiration date of this continuing resolution is December 5, \n1995. This resolution does not include the provision relative to \nMedicare part B premiums that was in the measure vetoed by the \nPresident on Monday. Let me emphasize, that has been removed. That was \nthe great focus of debate and discussion on that first continuing \nresolution. That is gone.\n  Instead, there is included the following provision which I will read \nin its entirety.\n  Section 301 of this continuing resolution:\n\n       (a) The President and the Congress shall enact legislation \n     in the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget \n     not later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the \n     nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n       (b) The unified balanced budget in subsection (a) shall be \n     based on the most current economic and technical assumptions \n     of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  That is it. Nothing more. Simple, straightforward. Mr. President, I \nwant to say, in adopting this resolution, we are simply recommending \nand recommitting ourselves to a balanced budget. That is a commitment I \nbelieve we all share.\n  There is nothing in this resolution, Mr. President, that says we will \nachieve balance with tax increases or with tax cuts. There is nothing \nhere that says whether defense spending will rise or fall. There is no \nmention of Medicare or COLA's or highways or education or the \nenvironment. We will have our arguments about all of those things, but \nwe ought to be able to agree that we will balance the budget. That is \nall we are committing ourselves to.\n  And in stipulating that our efforts should be measured by the \nCongressional Budget Office, we are only restating what we are already \nrequired to do and what the President of the United States, Mr. Clinton \nhimself, asked us to do in his address to a joint session of Congress \nsome time ago. We cannot bring any proposal to this floor that has not \nbeen scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The President has \nagreed to that.\n  As one of those who voted against the constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget, I argued that we did not need to encumber \nthe Constitution when we could achieve balance within legislation. \nMembers on the other side of the aisle argued the same. I still hold \nthat position, and I ask my \n\n[[Page S 17104]]\ncolleagues who stood with me to stand with me in voting for this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I am very interested to hear responses. I cannot understand how \nanybody can stand on this floor or before the American public and say \nthey are against balancing the budget. We say 2002, and we only say the \nCongressional Budget Office shall do as is required to be done to score \nproposals. How can anyone oppose this continuing resolution, unless \nthey have turned their back on the very principle of balancing the \nbudget?\n  Now, if that is so, so be it, but let us be honest and frank with one \nanother. This stalemate we are in now is unnecessary, and we can end \nit. At the same time, we can commit ourselves to the American public \nthat is expecting us to give some kind of a statement as to when we are \ngoing to balance the budget.\n  So let us not get into all these byways and these sidetracks about \nMedicare and education and all those things. My position is well known \non those social programs. I would have liked to have written perhaps a \ncertain major reduction in military spending, but that is a personal \nview. I will argue that at some other time. But on this continuing \nresolution, let us put the Government back on track, let us end the \nstalemate, let us say to the American people we have a separation of \npowers, but at the same time we can unite ourselves, regardless of our \nparty, regardless of the branch of Government, to a simple goal of \nbalancing the budget by 2002. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon for his \nopening remarks, and I am pleased that we are at least getting to this \nso-called continuing resolution. I hope that we can move on it in an \nexpeditious fashion, because after we move on it and after it passes \nthe Senate, as it is foreordained that it will given the commitment \nthat the majority in the House and Senate have expressed, everyone \nknows it is going to the President. Everyone knows when it gets to the \nPresident, he is going to veto it.\n  So we continue the charade that we have been going through now for \nentirely too long. This is the third day of the Government shutdown. \nTomorrow will be the fourth day and the day after that will be the \nfifth.\n\n  Mr. President, it seems to me it is time we begin to get serious \nabout this and stop the charades, but nevertheless, under the process, \nwe must go through it.\n  The real issue, I suggest, before us today is whether the Congress of \nthe United States wants to stop acting like a bunch of spoiled children \nand start acting like adults. On the way in this morning, I was treated \nto a radio program that was unbelievable. It said that the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives said that he was very upset, piqued by not \nbeing treated properly by the President en route to the funeral in \nIsrael. Someone suggested that probably that was not a proper way to \nact, and I believe the words by the Speaker were something like, \n``Well, it may be petty, but it's human.''\n  That is a sad commentary, indeed, but probably sums up much better \nthan I could in any words how ridiculous this whole process is.\n  We have this continuing resolution which was just explained by the \nleader of the Appropriations Committee. I simply say to my friend that \nregardless of how well-intentioned this continuing resolution is--and \nas yet I have not even seen the numbers, but as I understand it, it is \na continuing resolution to continue the Government of the United States \nand get people back to work until sometime in December; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. December 5.\n  Mr. EXON. I have been advised, for the record, on the 5th of \nDecember.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a moment for me to give a \nlittle further explanation?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as you well know, we have 13 \nappropriations bills. We now have 7 of those 13 bills that are in the \nprocess of being sent down to the White House that we expect to be \nsigned. We have had three or four signed by now: transportation, energy \nand water, the military construction, and the agriculture bills. We \nhave acted upon foreign operations, and we will be acting today \nprobably on Treasury-Post Office. We have already acted on the \nlegislative.\n  In other words, I think we will have by, hopefully, the end of today \nseven of these bills on the President's desk signed into law. That \nmeans we have the remaining bills. The Defense bill we hope to have \nacted upon today, the conference, to reach some kind of a conclusion. \nHUD is meeting today. In other words, December 5 has a very specific \nreason; we believe that we can get the rest of these appropriations \nbills completed. And we have stripped things from those bills that have \nbeen unacceptable by the President, as the Istook amendment on the \nTreasury-Post Office, as abortion language that was on the foreign \noperations bill. So what I am saying is simply that by the December 5 \ndeadline, we expect to have all of those 13 bills completed and, \nhopefully, signed by the President.\n  As the Senator knows, as the President signs each one of these bills, \nthat part of the Government drops out of this particular stalemate, \nbecause that means that money has been appropriated and approved by the \nPresident.\n  So we are hoping to have all 13 of those bills completed by December \n5.\n  As I say, we hope to have seven signed within the hours of today, or \nmaybe early tomorrow. That is all out of the continuing resolution, all \nseven of those bills. As we pass each succeeding bill, that will be \nremoved from the continuing resolution, and that part of the Government \nwill be back in full operation, like the energy and water, and \nagriculture, and so forth, that we have now assigned, and \ntransportation. So that is the reason for the December 5.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate the explanation by my friend. Another way of \nsaying that is that you were hopeful that in the next few hours, or in \nthe next few days at least, that seven of the 13, or roughly half of \nthe appropriations bills, will have been completed and, hopefully, \nsigned by the President.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, of which we have four of those seven now signed by \nthe President.\n  Mr. EXON. Now, another way of saying that is that we only finished \napproximately half of the 13 key appropriations bills and presented \nthem to the President, is that correct? Or we will in the next day or \nso?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. Let me further explain that the real problem we \nhave had with appropriations in this particular year is--there are a \nnumber of reasons, but let me give you two major reasons. As the \nCommittee on the Budget, on which the Senator serves as the ranking \nmember, presented the budget resolution to this Congress, it called for \nabout a $22 billion reduction in nondefense discretionary programs. \nTherefore, all of the nondefense programs had to make a rather serious \nand severe reduction, and the judgments on that have certainly varied. \nAnd so we have faced a dollar question, a reduction of dollars. I would \nlike to have had far less in the defense spending. But somehow, the \nBudget Committee and the bodies, the House and the Senate, have agreed \nthat that is not part of our great reduction scheme. But rather, it is \ngoing to be the nondefense programs--education programs, health \nprograms, welfare programs, and so forth. So the committee had to make \nthose judgments.\n  The second problem we have faced--and there are not sufficient \ndollars to meet the needs on the level of spending that the President \nhas requested or wants--but the other problem we have had increasingly \nover the years, as the Senator knows, is that nonappropriation matters \nhave been piggybacked on appropriation bills--abortion, school prayer, \nstriker replacement, on and on I could go about legislative matters on \nthe appropriations bills. We could have handled a number of these bills \nfar faster if we had not had to deal with the riders. That has been the \nsecond factor. We had an abortion issue on three separate appropriation \nbills, with a little different wording, a little different application, \nand so forth and so on. You know how hot an item that is. I happen to \nbe pro-life. The Senator happens to be pro-choice, but nevertheless----\n\n  Mr. EXON. Let me correct the Senator, so that we keep the record \nstraight. \n\n[[Page S 17105]]\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will just say that some Senators are pro-life and \nsome are pro-choice.\n  Mr. EXON. To advise and correct the Record, this Senator has, I \nthink, been generally along the same line with the Senator from Oregon. \nI am a pro-life Senator, not a pro-choice Senator. Let us correct the \nRecord.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will correct the Record, as well, by saying that the \nSenator and I have agreement on that. We do not share that same \nagreement, of course, with other views here in the Senate. \nConsequently, what I am saying is that that issue has been a very \ncontentious issue over the years. As a consequence, it has slowed the \nwhole process of appropriations down.\n  Those are the reasons that we are at this point in time relating to \nthe appropriations process. We are hoping to strip the riders, as we \nhave been doing, or modify them, or amend them, to make them acceptable \ndowntown in the White House.\n  So I just wanted to indicate again why, from the appropriations point \nof view, we happen to be in this situation today and are fast trying to \nextricate ourselves from it, as indicated by the fact that we have \nseven bills on the President's desk, four of them signed, and how we \nhope to get the others down to the President within the period between \nnow and December 5.\n  Mr. EXON. Let me further inquire of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, with whom I have worked very long and very \nwell over the years. I believe that the Senator from Oregon has been on \nthe Appropriations Committee nearly all of the time he has served with \ngreat distinction in the U.S. Senate.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon ever recall a time when we have been \nthis far behind in passing appropriations bills, regardless of what the \nreason was for the delay?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Oh, yes. I would say that back in the 1980's we had a \nCR that went a whole year. We could not resolve those problems. We had \nother CR's. We had probably three or four in a period from 1981 to \n1985, short-term CR's. We had the Government shut down for a couple of \ndays. This is not new. It is not the way to do business.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend. Again, I will proceed with my remarks.\n  I was saying, Mr. President, I was disappointed in the fact that we \nhave delay upon delay upon delay, and we are going through charades, as \nwe are going through today on this continuing resolution that is going \nto be passed, very likely, and vetoed by the President.\n  So this is an exercise in futility, unfortunately, at a time when the \nNation is wanting. I simply say, Mr. President, that in negotiations \nduring the last few days, myself and others have been pleading, and the \nadministration has been pleading, with the Republican majority to just \ngive us a clean continuing resolution. By ``clean,'' I mean every \nextraneous measure, or thought, or condition, or concept would be \nthrown off, and we would just have a continuing resolution for 24 \nhours, or 48 hours. That was rejected. I was mystified by that because \nI could not understand how any reasonable group of people, regardless \nof their political affiliation, would not agree that it was wise to \ncontinue the normal functions of Government, at least for a short \nperiod of time, while we continued to negotiate.\n  I now understand why we were turned down flatly on what would appear \nto any reasonable person as the course of action which could be taken. \nIt was because the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and others, \nclearly had in their hip pocket this new, ludicrous plan that they knew \nit would not open up Government once again, but it might give them, on \na political scale, some advantage, or an up-bump in the polls that have \nbeen quite devastating to the Speaker and others in the last few weeks.\n  The measure before us today is a farce. It is game playing. It is not \nthe way to do business, and it is not doing business; it is playing \npolitics. Grown-ups know that it is a childish game to shut down the \nGovernment in order to blackmail the President into accepting extreme \nmeasures, the extreme Republican budget, and trying to make excuses for \nwhy they are doing it.\n  The sad part is that this game has real consequences to real people. \nHundreds of thousands of Federal workers do not know whether they are \ngoing to be able to pay their bills. Thousands of Americans who are \nentitled to sign up for Social Security are not able to do so because \nno one is at work to process the new legitimate claims. Thousands of \nveterans who should be signing up for new benefits that they have \nearned are not able to do so because Government is not on the job. \nThousands of Federal contractors are not being paid, but the Government \nhas agreed to pay them.\n  According to press reports, for example, Mr. President, 39 illegal \nimmigrants--I repeat, Mr. President, according to press reports, 39 \nillegal immigrants--were detained, as they should have been, and sent \non their merry way, smiling and laughing on Tuesday because the \nGovernment was shut down. It left the Immigration and Naturalization \nServices shorthanded.\n  Another matter, the Colorado State Police stopped a van, called INS, \nand was informed they would be unable to investigate because they \nlacked the manpower to do so because the staff had been furloughed.\n  This is no way to run the Government. What we should do is pass a \nclean continuing resolution to allow the Government to serve the \npeople, pay its bills, and do so in a timely fashion. That is our duty.\n  The majority wants to set the terms for the coming negotiations on \nthe deficit reduction bill. All this political posturing about how to \ndo the big deficit reduction bill is just a transparent attempt, I \nsuggest, to coerce the President to weakening his negotiating position \nbefore--before--negotiations even begin.\n  The responsible thing to do, of course, would be to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution for either a shorter or a longer number of days \nand allow the Republicans to get the extreme budget proposals that they \nare pushing out of their system, because they are not going to prevail.\n  We should let the President go ahead and veto these bills, which is \nwhat he is going to do, and then and only then start some real serious \nnegotiations where people of good will can sit down and say, ``We are \nnot, any of us, going to get exactly what we want.'' Through \nnegotiations and compromise, we can do our job as we were sent here to \ndo.\n  In these real negotiations, everything should be on the table. Let me \nrepeat that, Mr. President, because that is not the mode that we are \noperating under now. In these real negotiations to come that I am quite \nprepared for at this time, and will have some recommendations to make \nat the proper time that I think might be an important step toward \nbringing us together--bringing us together--these real negotiations \nhave to start with everything being laid on the table. Otherwise, we \nwill not get anything done.\n  The length of time it takes to balance should be on the table, along \nwith everything else. The economic assumptions that we use should be on \nthe table. What do we need to make the extreme cuts in Medicare that \nthe Republicans advocate should be on the table, and will be on the \ntable. At least I am pleased that the Republicans at this very late \nhour have taken the Medicare matter off the table temporarily.\n\n  Also on the table should be whether we want to give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest among us. That has to be on the table. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, I have run the numbers on this budget and I have been \ntrying to figure out a way to get to a balanced budget. I do not agree \nwith the White House with regard to a 7-year budget. I think we can \ncome to agreement to balance a budget by 7 years.\n  I believe under the proper circumstances we would be able to convince \nthe President to sign such a measure if we can put everything on the \ntable and if we can sit down as adults and reach a compromise.\n  I must say, Mr. President, that if the Republicans continue to \ninsist--I repeat this, if the Republicans continue to insist--on a $245 \nbillion tax break for the wealthy, and if they continue to insist on \nusing CBO assumptions only and purely, there is no way that we can get \nto a balance in 7 years without extreme and deep cuts in Medicare, in \nnursing home care, nursing homes, and in education.\n  We hold out the hand, the offer of compromise, once again. After we \nget \n\n[[Page S 17106]]\nthrough with this ridiculous exercise that is going nowhere today, \nmaybe we can get to that point tomorrow or the next day or the day \nafter that.\n  I am proud, and the President is right to oppose such a budget. I \nsupport him in that. Passing of the continuing resolution that has just \nbeen offered to us from the House of Representatives would tie the \nPresident's hands to such an extent that it would be almost impossible \nto start meaningful negotiations on a compromise.\n  Therefore, I will strenuously oppose this continuing resolution and \nhope that we can move it along to a fair and honest role that can pass \nboth Houses and receive the President's signature, and stop this \ncharade and game playing. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from \nNebraska, whom I greatly admire as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, and from what I have heard him say, I can understand no \nreason why he would not vote for this resolution.\n  This resolution does not use specifics as to how we reach a balanced \nbudget. It does not say that we must follow the outline laid down by \nthe Republicans on our side of the aisle--which outline I happen to \nthink is a fairly reasonable one.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has characterized it as ``extremist,'' but \nI do not know what is extreme about balancing a budget over 7 years, \nallowing the Government to grow by 3 percent over that period of time, \nallowing Medicare to grow by 6.5 percent, or $349 billion, over that \ntime, allowing Medicaid to grow by about 5.4 to 5 percent or $146 \nbillion over that period of time, saying to senior citizens, ``We will \nspend $4,800 on you today but in the year 2002 we will spend $6,700 on \nyour health care.'' Those are hardly extreme positions. They are fairly \nreasonable positions, and they allow us to reach a balanced budget by \nslowing the rate of growth of the Federal Government.\n\n  If you allow the terminology of the Senator from Nebraska to apply--\n``extremism''; this is what is being used often on the other side as a \nreason for rejecting a balanced budget--even if you accepted what the \nSenator from Nebraska has said that he would, however, be willing to \nagree to a budget which reaches balance in 7 years and that that is a \ndoable event--he does not like our budget but it is a doable event.\n  What this continuing resolution says is, ``Let's reach a balanced \nbudget in 7 years.'' It does not say how. It does not give specifics. \nIt does not bind the President or the members of the other party to a \nspecific glidepath to reaching that balanced budget. It simply says the \nPresident and the Congress shall enact legislation in the 104th \nCongress to achieve a unified balanced budget not later than the fiscal \nyear 2002 as scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  Therefore, all it is saying is that we have to reach a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. It is not saying how we reach a balanced \nbudget. It is not demanding a certain set of specifics be used for \nreaching that balanced budget. It simply is saying, during the term of \nthis Congress, during our watch, we must put in place a balanced budget \nthat is scored by the Congressional Budget Office which, of course, is \nwhat the President initially said he would use as a scoring agency.\n  Therefore, when the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, gets up and states he is for a balanced budget in 7 \nyears, it seems to me he should be comfortable with this resolution \nwhich says exactly that: Let us reach a balanced budget in 7 years. It \ndoes not say let us reach the Republican game plan for a balanced \nbudget, it says let us reach a balanced budget in 7 years. So, I do not \nsee this resolution as being on the extreme. In fact, this resolution \nis right in the mainstream of the comments made by the distinguished \nSenator.\n  The further comments were made that it is ludicrous, and there is an \nattitude of futility here, in pursuing a balanced budget under these \ntypes of terms. Why is it ludicrous? Why is it futile to bind the \nCongress and the President to reaching a balanced budget in 7 years? We \nare not saying, in this resolution, you have to cut this program, you \nhave to cut that program, you have to slow the rate of growth in this \nprogram, you have to raise this tax or cut that tax. We are just saying \nlet us do it. Let us agree we are going to do it, we are going to \nbalance the budget in 7 years. What could be ludicrous or futile about \nthat? That seems like a fairly constructive statement. It is a \nstatement which I suspect most Americans would say is maybe too passive \non the issue of reaching a balanced budget. I suspect most Americans \nwould like us to say specifically how we are going to do it.\n  We as Republicans have. We have laid down a plan for that. From the \nother side we have not seen such a plan, but we have heard statements, \nlike the Senator from Nebraska's, saying they would agree to balance \nthe budget in 7 years. So all we have done in this continuing \nresolution is say: All right, let us take one little baby step on the \nroad to balancing the budget. Let us, as a Congress, agree, with the \nPresident's support, that we shall balance the budget in 7 years. Let \nus not get into specifics, but let us just take this little step into \nthe water. Let us put our toes in the water, the water of a balanced \nbudget, and say we are going to commit to it. That is neither ludicrous \nnor futile. That is what we are supposed to be doing as a Government. \nWe do not say do it in 4 years or 5 years, which is what the President \noriginally said he would do when he ran for this office, and what many \nof us would like to do. We say 7 years, which is a fairly reasonable \ntimeframe.\n  During this period of 3 weeks, while we will be functioning under the \ncontinuing resolution, we have not unfairly impacted the spending \naccounts of this country. We have simply set up a structure which says \nwe will spend at the levels, the lower levels of either the House or \nthe Senate numbers. Or, if there is no spending on a program, we will \nhave it function at 60 percent of its level, which is a fairly \nreasonable thing to do when we are talking about a short timeframe.\n  Why would you want to excessively fund programs over their funding \nlevels which have been laid out in the appropriations bills as they \nhave been coming through? It would be unreasonable to fund them at the \nhigher level. It would be inconsistent with good government to fund \nthem at a higher level when we as a Congress may choose the lower level \nwhen we finally pass the appropriating bills. So it is the safer and \nmore thoughtful course to take the lower level.\n  Thus, this is a resolution which really does not do a whole lot. As I \nsay, it just puts our toe in the water of the balanced budget issue. In \nfact, I happen to think it is far too weak. I have serious reservations \nabout it. I personally am on the borderline of whether I even want to \nvote for something that is this weak on the issue of balancing the \nbudget.\n\n  But the fact is, it is not extreme, it is not futile, and it is not \nludicrous to suggest the Congress, the 104th Congress, should commit \nwith the President on this resolution that we are going to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002. That is not only not extreme, ludicrous, or \nfutile, that is our job. That is what we should be doing. That is what \nthe American people hired us for. And therefore I take a bit of \nexception to the statements of the Senator from Nebraska and ask him to \nreview those statements in the context of the resolution. I think if he \ndoes, he will come to the conclusion he can support this resolution.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to join those who expressed their \nreservation in opposition to the proposal that passed the House of \nRepresentatives last evening, some 16 pages or 17 pages of continuing \nresolution plus the words that have been mentioned in reference to the \nbalanced budget.\n  I think it is only appropriate to look at where we are today to \nunderstand why the President is deeply concerned about signing this \nparticular proposal. We have to really understand what the significance \nof all of this means, beyond just the words which are included in the \ncontinuing resolution. We have to look back at the fact that, in the \nspring of last year, the Speaker of the House had indicated what was \ngoing to happen in the late fall, that there would be a clash between \nthe executive \n\n[[Page S 17107]]\nbranch and the Congress on a budget for this country, and that he \nplanned to shut the government down to get his way. He has said that \nrepeatedly, in the spring and in the early fall. My colleagues have \nincluded those statements in the Record.\n  Effectively, to sum up what the Speaker was talking about, Speaker \nGingrich's at-all-cost strategy shows little hint of compromise or \ncommon ground. For months he has implemented a strategy to blackmail \nthe American people and the President into accepting his budget \npriorities. We have to consider all of the statements that were made by \nthe Speaker predicting where we were going to be in the fall, the \nimpasse that we find ourselves in today. That was all predicted. It is \npart of a plan. It was his intent to do so and this is where we are \ntoday as a result of that intransigence. This crisis we are facing \ntoday was predicted and planned by the Speaker and other Republican \nleaders. So no one should suddenly be surprised that we have this \nsituation, because we have had a long period of notice.\n  Now it was not only the statements of the Speaker, but it has been \nhow the House and the Appropriations Committee have been dealing with \ntheir business. Up to just a day or two ago, only 4 of the 13 \nappropriations bills were actually sent to and signed by the President \nof the United States.\n  I listened with interest to my good friend from Oregon, the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, who said we will be up to almost half \nin the next couple of days. The fact of the matter remains that, of the \nmajor appropriations bills that deal with the heavy commitments of the \nFederal Government, about 80 percent have not been sent down to the \nPresident. So we find, on the one hand, the prediction by the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives of the United States saying we will \nhave this train wreck, we will slow or stop the Government--repeatedly \nstating that. And with the other actions of the Speaker--because, as \nall of us know, those appropriations initiate over in the House of \nRepresentatives--we know we are going to have, effectively, the crisis, \nbecause he is not going to pass the appropriations bills. If you do not \npass the appropriations bills you have the continuing resolution.\n  It was by design and intent, design and intent by Republican \nleadership, that we were going to have crisis--both by the statements \nand by the failure of the appropriations process and the leadership in \nthe House of Representatives in sending those appropriations over here.\n  I would just add, as I heard the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee say, ``then there were so many riders that were put on those \nbills.'' Who is in charge here? Who put the riders on? They could not \nget on if they had not had the support of our Republican friends and \ncolleagues. And, as we know, the tradition of this institution is we do \nnot provide legislative matters on appropriations. We never used to. We \ndo this year, because of the majority, and that has slowed the whole \nprocess down.\n  But, Mr. President, the Republican leadership understood that would \nbe the direct impact of adding rider after rider on appropriations. The \nconferences have not done their work. They have not finished the \nappropriations and set them down and had them completed. So, where we \nare today should not surprise any Member here. It will become \nincreasingly clear to the American public why we are here, and who \nintended us to be here with this particular crisis.\n\n  Mr. President, I listened last night to the debate over in the House \nof Representatives. I am mindful what is going to be on the floor of \nthe Senate tomorrow--the Republican budget, the reflection of their \npriorities. You know something, Mr. President, in 24 hours we will \nprobably have here on the floor of the U.S. Senate those same cuts in \nMedicare that were included in the continuing resolution. I mean come \non, colleagues. We know exactly what is going on here. They are not \neven going to wait 24 hours. We are going to have the same cuts in \nMedicare that were included in the continuing resolution, tomorrow, on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. What is the idea? They say, let us work \nthis out together, we are coming with clean hands, and we are prepared \nto work with the President of the United States on a balanced budget--\nbut they still bring their cuts in the Medicare Program.\n  This is a back-door cut in Medicare, and every senior citizen ought \nto know about it. And 24 hours from now we will have that budget with \nthose cuts on the floor of the U.S. Senate We will have the budget with \nthose tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals. And we will have the \ncuts in education programs on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are \ngoing to have to have it within 24 hours.\n  So spare us the arguments my friends, the Republicans, that you just \nwant to work this out with the President of the United States. Why did \nyou not work out the budget with the President of the United States? \nWhy did you not sit down and say, ``All right. This is acceptable, and \ncan't we work this out in order to move toward a balanced budget?'' He \nis committed to do that, but we never had that opportunity. We never \nhad that negotiation.\n  As has been stated repeatedly on the floor by the relevant committee \nchairman, most of the Democrats were not included in the conferences. \nThey never had a chance to express an opinion. We were reduced the \nother night to a situation where Members could not address this body, \nor talk for their constituents in their State about what was really \nhappening around the consideration of the budget.\n  Last night I took the time to watch that debate over in the House of \nRepresentatives. There was not one single Republican, not one, that \nstood up and said, with the passage of this proposal we are prepared to \ntake Medicare off the table. Not one. Not one of them said, pass this \nresolution and we will reconsider our tax breaks for the wealthy. Not \none. Not one of them said, pass this particular resolution and we will \nreconsider the severe cuts in the education programs that will put a \ndollar sign on every college door in this country that says ``Only the \nWealthy Need Apply.'' In 3 hours of debate, not one of them said we are \ngoing to reconsider our position on tax cuts and Medicare cuts. Not \none.\n  So what are we left with? We are left with the language that we heard \nfrom a number of our Republican colleagues last night. They said, let \nus give the President a message. Let us put him on the spot. Let us \ndrop this on the door of the President of the United States--over and \nover again.\n  So we ought to understand where we are, and why the President is \nabsolutely correct in vetoing this measure. Mr. President, passage of \nthis measure is just another indication that there will be cuts in the \nMedicare Program. Make no mistake about it. Do not listen to this \nSenator. Just take the time to listen to the debate tomorrow on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. That is a better indication of where the \nRepublican priorities are than all of the speeches that are made here \nthis morning, this afternoon, and maybe even this evening. They can \nsay, we are really just trying to do what the President says he wants \nto do. And they can say, all you have to do is put your toe in the \nwater and move us toward a balanced budget. But that is hogwash. And \nevery senior citizen ought to know about it. Their plan means an \nincrease in premiums. It means an increase in the deductible. It means \nan increase in the copayments. It means a diminution of quality of \nhealth care. And it means taking away from the seniors their ability to \nchoose their doctors.\n  So when our colleagues say, we want to go back to the basics, and we \nwant to work this out with the President, we are really approaching \nthis with good faith on that--that just does not fly, not when you look \nat the facts.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, we see where we have gone with our \nRepublican friends. They say everything is on the table. Yet, in this \ncontinuing resolution--they cut the heart out of many of the education \nprograms which are essential to improving the quality of education for \nthe young people of this country.\n  They reduce the Goals 2000 legislation. They cut it by some 40-\npercent. That is a block grant that makes sense. That says that 90 \npercent of the funds to improve and enhance the education of the young \npeople of this country are going to go to the local school districts, \ngo to the parents, go to the \n\n[[Page S 17108]]\nteachers, go to the school boards, and let the local communities help \ndevelop a program to increase academic achievement. It goes for \neducation at the local level. It passed overwhelmingly with Republicans \nand Democrats alike last year. And nonetheless, because it was a \nPresident Clinton initiative on education, it was zeroed out in the \nHouse of Representatives--abandoned. Now it hobbles along under this \nparticular resolution reduced from the previous resolution of the \nRepublicans that left it at 90 percent. Now it is going to be funded at \n60 percent--a 40-percent cut, Mr. President.\n  What will the Republican resolution be on December 6? This resolution \nonly goes to December 5. And we have that kind of a cut from 90 \npercent. We cut it 40 percent in this continuing resolution. That is \nunacceptable.\n  You take safe and drug-free schools. How many times do we listen to \nour Republican colleagues talk about the problems of substance abuse, \nand here they are cutting out a significant program. That is not the \nanswer. All of us understand from various hearings on these programs, \nyou need not only a program in the schools, but you need after-school \nprograms, and preschool programs. You need employment, you need sports, \nyou need a variety of different activities to involve young people in \nthis country. Safe and drug free schools and communities has been an \neffective program in many schools--and it is cut by 40 percent.\n  Take the funding for new technology for schools, which is already \navailable to so many children in many of the private schools in this \ncountry. Effectively, that program is gutted--cut by 40 percent. Making \nnew technology available in the public schools of this country is being \ncut by 40 percent.\n  Take the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. It is one of \nthe very best teacher training programs in the Nation. It enhances the \nacademic achievement and accomplishments of teachers and offers wide \nrange of new courses to strengthen their academic background and \noverall experience so that they can be better teachers in the \nclassrooms across the country. That program is cut by 40 percent.\n  Then the Perkins Loan Program, which is an additional college loan \nprogram to help the students of this country pursue their education is \ncut by 40 percent. These are cuts in efforts to reform the basic \neducation programs, cuts in technology, cuts again in help and \nassistance for those that are pursuing higher education.\n  And the summer jobs for youth is cut 40 percent. I guess an awful lot \nof those teenagers cannot vote. This program is zeroed out in the House \nof Representatives--summer jobs for youth, a program that makes a big \ndifference to many of the young people in this country, and in urban \nand rural areas alike. Major cities, such as Boston, receive extensive \nmatches in funds by the private sector. There is an effective \nrecruiting mechanism for young students in the inner cities to find \nemployment as they work in the summer jobs. They then work for many of \nthese companies and corporations in the cities. This important effort \nis cut by 40 percent.\n  So there it is, Mr. President. That is what we are being asked to do. \nOn the one hand, we are going to hear the same statements repeatedly \ntoday. They will say, let us just ask the President to work with us on \na balanced budget. But every single Member in this body knows that we \nare facing the Republican budget tomorrow that cuts the Medicare \nProgram, provides tax breaks for wealthy individuals, and cuts \neducation.\n  If they were serious, they would have said, let us work out the \npriorities in those areas. Let us really move to a bipartisan balanced \nbudget. Let us find out what we can do working together, and then have \nthe opportunity to get beyond what the Speaker of the House called a \ntrain wreck. A train wreck that he predicted and an event that he \neffectively implemented by failing to provide leadership to ensure the \ntimely completion of the appropriations bills. Let us not fool the \nAmerican people, Mr. President. We know what is happening here.\n  They are just trying to score the political points, trying to put \nsomething to the President of the United States. They will not say \ntoday, all right, we will reconsider our tax cut.\n  I am going to watch today and see whether any Member who supports \nthis proposal will say, look, we are operating in good faith. We will \nreconsider our tax cut for the wealthiest individuals. We will \nreconsider that. We will consider the Democrats' position on the \nMedicare Program and their wish to ensure its financial stability to \nthe outer years. We will reconsider our $270 billion, and we will \nreconcile that with your $87 billion. We will look at that. We are \nserious about today. We will meet with you all during the day with our \nBudget Committee to consider some of the Democratic priorities. And we \nwill also take another look at these extraordinary cuts that have been \nmade in education. We have addressed the education issues. We have had \nsome success in restoring them here. But do you think that is reflected \nin the continuing resolution? Absolutely not.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we all understand what is at risk here. \nThe President is wise to reject this. But the President should \nchallenge Republicans and Democrats alike to sit down and work this \nout. We have no preconditions, no preconditions to moving toward a \nbalanced budget, as has been repeated by the President and leaders, \nevery Member of this side. They are for the balanced budget, but not \nfor the Republican priorities.\n  That is the problem. The Republicans are saying, oh well, you have to \nvote for this because it says balanced budget but we are going to stick \nit to the elderly on the Medicare cuts, and we are going to stick it to \nthe children, and we are going to enhance the wealthiest corporations \nand richest individuals with unjustified tax breaks. That is wrong. \nThis resolution should be defeated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank the Chair for recognizing \nme. I wish to say for Republicans on our side so they will understand, \nthis is an appropriations matter. Chairman Hatfield is going to be \nmanaging the bill. There are no time limits thus far. So if Senators \nthink that we can allocate time, there is no allocation. It is a \nquestion of the Chair observing the precedents of the Senate in \nrecognizing Senators either to speak or offer amendments. So everyone \nshould know I do not think I can get them time if they just call on the \nphone. There is open debate unless and until we reach some unanimous-\nconsent agreement with reference to the situation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of points rather than go into \na lot of detail. The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] has \nfailed to mention to the American people one thing. As he goes through \na litany of reductions and cuts, he failed to tell the American people \nwhat we have before us is a 19-day bill--one-nine, 19 days.\n  For the next 19 days, if this is signed, the U.S. Government will \ncontinue to operate under an interim funding program described in this \nbill. This is not a year. This is 19 days. So all the comments about \nwhat is being reduced in expenditures, how much we are asking programs \nto take a cut is for the next 19 days, and until we finally reach a \nconclusion between the President and the Congress on the full year, \nthis 19 days is a very insignificant portion of what is going to be \nfunded and how things are going to come out.\n  It is generally and historically true around here that when the \nCongress and the Presidents are battling over expenditures continuing \nresolutions are funded at less than what you finally agree to do. So as \nto make the point, in this case we want to spend less overall rather \nthan more. The problem we have is that some Democrats--and of late it \nseems the President joins with them--just want to spend more money \nrather than less while they are talking about reducing the deficit. So \nlet us make sure that everybody understands, whoever comes to the floor \nfrom whichever side of the aisle during the next 3 or 4 hours and talks \nabout what is being cut on the appropriations side, we are talking \nabout an interim, short-term funding measure for 19 days. We are not \ntalking about the entire year. We are not talking about final \nappropriations numbers.\n  For those who wonder about not getting all the appropriations bills \ndone on time, let me suggest that the very \n\n[[Page S 17109]]\nlast Democratic Senate with a Republican President had six continuing \nresolutions. If I recall, we have had one, so far. They had six to make \ntheir case to a President and then eventually were able to work \nsomething out. So it is not untoward or unexpected or something we have \ninvented. At the end of the year, when you are arguing over important \ndifferences, frequently you have short-term extensions of the \nappropriations bills while you attempt to get something worked out.\n  Let us talk about getting something worked out and why we are here \ntoday. We are here today because we want to open the Government, put \nthe people back to work, have a 19-day extension of funding, and then \npresumably the day after tomorrow we will pass a Balanced Budget Act of \n1995. We will send that to the President. He has said he will veto it, \nand then we are left with nothing. We are left with no serious deficit \nreduction. Presumably, according to the President, he would like to \nwork with us then. He submits that he would like a budget, a short-term \nappropriations bill that says, look, give us the right kind of funding, \ndo not worry about that, and let us just state in there that we are \ngoing to get together after all of these vetoes and we are going to \nwork on the budget. Then and there we are going to agree on when it is \ngoing to be balanced, and then and there we are going to agree on what \neconomic assumptions we are going to use.\n  I see that as the end of a balanced budget. There is no chance you \ncan work anything out that way. With the differences that exist, if \nthere is not some kind of a benchmark that guides and leads those \nnegotiations, you will be nowhere and probably nowhere forever.\n  Having said that, let me suggest that there is going to be a lot of \ndebate on the other side of the aisle on how onerous and difficult this \n7-year balanced budget using real economics is. There is going to be a \nlot of debate that the Republican agenda is mandated by this balanced-\nbudget-in-7-years portion of this bill. Neither is true. This is not a \nbalanced budget amendment that says how we will get to balance, when we \nstart negotiating with the President.\n  It is not how we get there. It is whether we get there. It is not how \nwe get there. It is whether we get there. The truth of the matter is \nthat all the ideas for spending more money, for reducing the tax cuts, \nfor saving every program that everybody wants to stand up and say we \nought to save, they are all on the table. When the President comes to \nthat meeting with his experts talking about this issue, they are all on \nthe table. There is no agenda that is predetermined. Whatever any \nMember of the House or Senate says, the language is clear. Republicans \ndo not dictate the agenda and the President does not. The benchmark is \nthat we will all start with one premise, 7 years, and we will balance.\n  It seems to me that the President and others are saying we do not \nknow if we can do a balanced budget in 7 years using real economics. \nLet me suggest there are 71 Senators that have said we can and have \nvoted for a plan to do it.\n  Nineteen Democratic Senators voted for a plan, a bill, that says we \nshould have balance in 7 years using real economics. Nineteen of them, \nadded to the 52 Republican Senators, my arithmetic says that is 71. So, \n71 have said it can be done. Nineteen say, ``Do it a different way.'' \nFifty-two say, ``Do it the Republican way.''\n  It is my understanding that last night 48 Democrats joined the \nRepublicans in recommending this to the President. Previous balanced \nbudgets this year voted on by the House, 299 House Members, considering \ntwo different plans, one by Democrats and one by Republicans, voted for \na balanced budget in 7 years using real economics. What is the \nPresident afraid of? What are Democrats afraid of in terms of a 7-year \nbalanced budget that says, ``We aren't telling you how, we're just \ntelling you whether we have a balanced budget or not\"?\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I would like now to just read a few \ncomments from The Washington Post editorial of this morning. Mr. \nPresident, it is called, ``The Real Default.'' It is about half a page. \nI might suspect some would say, ``If it's the Washington Post, they are \nprobably saying the Republicans are `in default.''' I regret to tell \nyou Democrats, it is not us that they say are in default. It is the \nPresident and the Democratic leadership that this says are in default. \nI would like to just read a little bit of it.\n\n       The budget deficit is the central problem of the Federal \n     Government and one from which many of the country's other, \n     most difficult problems flow. The deficit is largely driven \n     in turn by the cost of the great entitlements that go not to \n     small special classes of rich or poor but across the board to \n     almost all Americans in time. The most important of these are \n     the principal social programs for the elderly, Social \n     Security and Medicare. In fiscal terms, Medicare is currently \n     the greatest threat and the chief offender.\n       Bill Clinton and the congressional Democrats were handed an \n     unusual chance this year to deal constructively with the \n     effect of Medicare on the deficit, and they blew it. The \n     chance came in the form of the congressional Republican plan \n     to balance the budget over 7 years. Some other aspects of \n     that plan deserve to be resisted, but the Republican proposal \n     to get at the deficit partly by confronting the cost of \n     Medicare [and its own default] deserves support. The \n     Democrats, led by the president, chose instead to present \n     themselves as Medicare's great protectors. They have \n     shamelessly used the issue, demagogued on it, because they \n     think that's where the votes are and the way to derail the \n     Republican proposals generally. The President was still doing \n     it this week; a Republican proposal to increase Medicare \n     premiums was one of the reasons he alleged for the veto that \n     has shut down the government--and never mind [says the \n     editorial] that he himself, in his own budget, would \n     countenance a similar increase.\n       We've said some of this before; it gets more serious. If \n     the Democrats play the Medicare card and win, they will have \n     set back for years, for the worst of political reasons, the \n     very cost of rational government in behalf of which they \n     profess to be behaving. Politically, they will have helped to \n     lock in place the enormous financial pressure that they \n     themselves are first to deplore on so many other Federal \n     programs, not least the programs for the poor. That's the \n     real default that could occur this year. In the end, the \n     Treasury will meet its financial obligations. You can be \n     pretty sure of that. The question is whether the president \n     and the Democrats will meet or flee their obligations of a \n     different kind. On the strength of the record so far, you \n     would have to bet on flight.\n\n  Now, there is much more. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n                            The Real Default\n\n       The budget deficit is the central problem of the federal \n     government and one from which many of the country's other, \n     most difficult problems flow.

On the strength of the record so far, you'd have to bet \n     on flight.\n       You'll hear the argument from some that this is a phony \n     issue; they contend that the deficit isn't that great a \n     problem. The people who make this argument are whistling past \n     a graveyard that they themselves most likely helped to dig. \n     The national debt in 1980 \n\n[[Page S 17110]]\n     was less than $1 trillion. That was the sum of all the deficits the \n     government had previously incurred--the whole two centuries' \n     worth. The debt now, a fun-filled 15 years later, is five \n     times that and rising at a rate approaching $1 trillion a \n     presidential term. Interest costs are a seventh of the \n     budget, by themselves now a quarter of a trillion dollars a \n     year and rising; we are paying not just for the government we \n     have but for the government we had and didn't pay for \n     earlier.\n       The blamesters, or some of them, will tell you Ronald \n     Reagan did it, and his low-tax, credit-card philosophy of \n     government surely played its part. The Democratic Congresses \n     that ratified his budgets and often went him one better on \n     tax cuts and spending increases played their part as well. \n     Various sections of the budget are also favorite punching \n     bags, depending who is doing the punching. You will hear it \n     said that someone's taxes ought to be higher (generally \n     someone else's), or that defense should be cut, or welfare, \n     or farm price supports or the cost of the bureaucracy. But \n     even Draconian cuts in any or all of these areas would be \n     insufficient to the problem and, because dwelling on them is \n     a way of pretending the real deficit-generating costs don't \n     exist, beside the point as well.\n       What you don't hear said in all this talk of which programs \n     should take the hit, since the subject is so much harder \n     politically to confront, is that the principal business of \n     the federal government has become elder-care. Aid to the \n     elderly, principally through Social Security and Medicare, is \n     now a third of all spending and half of all for other than \n     interest on the debt and defense. That aid is one of the \n     major social accomplishments of the past 30 years; the \n     poverty rate for the elderly is now, famously, well below the \n     rate for the society as a whole. It is also an enormous and \n     perhaps unsustainable cost that can only become more so as \n     the baby-boomers shortly begin to retire. How does the \n     society deal with it?\n       The Republicans stepped up to this as part of their \n     proposal to balance the budget. About a fourth of their \n     spending cuts would come from Medicare. It took guts to \n     propose that. You may remember the time, not that many months \n     ago, when the village wisdom was that, whatever else they \n     proposed, they'd never take on Medicare this way. There were \n     too many votes at stake. We don't mean to suggest by this \n     that their proposal with regard to Medicare is perfect--it \n     most emphatically is not, as we ourselves have said as much \n     at some length in this space. So they ought to be argued \n     with, and ways should be found to take the good of their \n     ideas while rejecting the bad.\n       But that's not what the president and congressional \n     Democrats have done. They've trashed the whole proposal as \n     destructive, taken to the air waves with a slick scare \n     program about it, championing themselves as noble defenders \n     of those about to be victimized. They--the Republicans--want \n     to take away your Medicare; that's the insistent PR message \n     that Democrats have been drumming into the elderly and the \n     children of the elderly all year. The Democrats used to \n     complain that the Republicans used wedge issues; this is the \n     super wedge. And it's wrong. In the long run, if it succeeds, \n     the tactic will make it harder to achieve not just the right \n     fiscal result but the right social result. The lesson to \n     future politicians will be that you reach out to restructure \n     Medicare at your peril. The result will be to crowd out of \n     the budget other programs for less popular or powerful \n     constituencies--we have in mind the poor--that the Democrats \n     claim they are committed to protect.\n       There's a way to get the deficit down without doing \n     enormous social harm. It isn't rocket science. You spread the \n     burden as widely as possible. Among much else, that means \n     including the broad and, in some respects, inflated middle-\n     class entitlements in the cuts. That's the direction in which \n     the president ought to be leading and the congressional \n     Democrats following. To do otherwise is to hide, to lull the \n     public and to perpetuate the budget problem they profess to \n     be trying to solve. Let us say it again: If that's what \n     happens, it will be the real default.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, I want to repeat to every \nDemocratic Senator here, to the President of the United States, this \ncontinuing resolution in this very simple language:\n\n       The President and Congress shall enact legislation in the \n     104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget not later \n     than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the non-partisan \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       The unified balanced budget in subsection (a) shall be \n     based on the most current economic and technical assumptions \n     of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  If ever there was a simple statement of whether or not we intend, \nwhether or not we as a Congress, intend, and the President, as our \nleader, intends to stop spending our children's, grandchildren's, and \nunborn children's wealth to pay for programs of today, there could not \nbe a better statement than that. Do you want to continue that or not?\n  I have been at it for a long time. I have been unsure from time to \ntime when we could reach a balanced budget. But, Mr. President, and \nfellow Senators, I am absolutely convinced, and 19 Democrats backed \nthis, and 299 House Members have voted it, that 7 years is ample time \nto get rid of the legacy of debt, and pass on a legacy of opportunity \nto our children. I am absolutely convinced it can be done.\n  For those who would argue we are trying to force our agenda, then I \nsubmit this is the people's agenda, 7 years using real economics. It is \nnot a Republican agenda. And we are not even saying how you should do \nit. We are saying that we ought to continue this Government of America, \nput our people back to work, but we ought to make a commitment to the \nAmerican people, and our President ought to join us. He has said he \nwants a balanced budget. And at one point he said 5 years. At one point \nhe said 10 years. At another point he said 9 years, maybe 8.\n  Mr. President, you have to seriously consider what you are saying \nwhen you say, ``We will not do one thing with the Republicans. We will \nnot negotiate,'' if they say let us start with a very basic marker of a \nbalanced budget in 7 years.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to yield without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that anyone who \nvotes for this resolution will not be voting for a tax cut or promise \nto vote for a tax cut, will not be voting for a reduction in Medicare \nspending, will not be voting for a reduction in Medicaid spending and \nwill not be voting for any of the specifics that are laid out in the \nRepublican budget? None of that is referenced in the continuing \nresolution; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No one can make the claim they are voting against this \nbecause they are against the Republican budget as outlined; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. I might put it another way. Nineteen \nDemocratic Senators offered their own plan to balance the budget at the \nsame time as the Republicans using the same economics. If that is what \nthe Democrats want when we go meet with the President, and if that is \nwhat the President wants, it has the exact same validity and the exact \nsame merit as the Republican budget.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. One additional question. The only other thing, other \nthan saying we are to balance the budget in 7 years, is that we will \nuse the Congressional Budget Office as the final arbiter; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Has there ever been objection by the other side using \nthe Congressional Budget Office as the final arbiter that you are aware \nof?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to say I never heard anyone on the other \nside of the aisle object to using the Congressional Budget Office, \nbecause they might have, but let me tell you, never in the Budget \nCommittee as we debated this did I hear any of my good friends on the \nDemocratic side, including their leader in the budget matters, say that \nwe ought to depart this year or last year from the Congressional Budget \nOffice's economics. I have not heard that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that the Democratic leader said on \nJune 25, ``We will come to whatever accommodations that are to ensure \nthat CBO is the final arbiter of the numbers.'' So that is the \nDemocratic leader speaking.\n  I just want to know if anybody else has spoken differently, to your \nknowledge?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know of none.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thought I heard the discussion suggested that the only \nother change with CBO is also the case that this 15-page continuing \nresolution cuts by 40 percent some programs, including, for example, \nlow-income energy assistance. It is now wintertime, of course. I come \nfrom a State that gets pretty cold. Some low-income folks get energy \nassistance. Does this not cut that by 40 percent? Is that not a change? \nI am using that as one example. Would that not be an example of other \nchanges you put in this 15-page document?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I answer the Senator this way. You were not on \nthe \n\n[[Page S 17111]]\nfloor, I believe, so I will answer again. This document does not run \nGovernment for the entire year of 1996. It runs Government for 19 days. \nAnd during those 19 days, those who are managing the programs cannot \nspend on the program you described at more than a rate of 60 percent of \ncurrent program funding, but it does not set the year-long funding for \nthose programs.\n  Continuing resolutions are for a short period of time only. I add, it \nwill be for 19 days. I cannot conceive that that would be the level in \nthe long run that we would be at. That is what we still have to work \nout, and that is what continuing resolutions are for.\n  I thank you for the question, and anybody who has questions on all \nthe other 10 programs, the answer is the same. It does not eliminate \nanything. It does not set the pattern for the full year. It says 19 \ndays from now. That is until December 5.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is a change from previous CR's where it was 90 \npercent. It will now be 60 percent, so the cut would be 40 percent of \nthings like star schools, low-income energy, et cetera.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is; yes. Frankly, when you are involved in this kind \nof situation in trying to get something done, it is not unusual that \ncontinuing resolutions change each time, seeing if some headway can be \nmade about the loggerhead situation by adjusting it. That has been done \nbefore.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to continue on. I want to talk a little \nbit about what I think is the real problem. First of all, I think the \nproblem is that the President of the United States has committed to a \nbalanced budget, and what I am saying I do not say about Democratic \nSenators. They had some very serious proposals, and I believe they \ntried very hard--19 of them--to get a balanced budget. I believe \nSenator Exon would clearly try to get a balanced budget in 7 years and \nachieve it.\n  But what I think the problem is, is that the President of the United \nStates does not want to tell anybody how much money he wants to spend. \nThe issue is how much do you want to spend in the next 7 years, not how \nmuch you want to cut taxes.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct, if you vote for this, the \nPresident can go to the table saying, ``I don't want any taxes.'' And I \nrepeat that. He can go to the table saying, ``I don't want to cut one \nbit of education. I want it to increase education instead of it being \nfrozen or reduced.'' This does not obligate any specifics.\n  What I believe is the case is that the President is not prepared to \ntell the American people how much he wants to spend. It is spending \nthat is ruining America's future. It is spending too much that brings \nthe Washington Post to saying, ``The budget deficit is the central \nproblem of the Federal Government and one from which many of the \ncountry's other most difficult problems flow.''\n  Deficits do not come from the air. They come from spending more than \nyou take in, and I believe if the President and his experts will sit \ndown in a room between now and the time we finally send this bill to \nthem and ask themselves seriously--forget the Republican agenda--``How \nmuch do we want to spend?'' They do not have to tell anybody, but I \nbelieve they will come to one of two conclusions: One, they want to \nspend too much and, therefore, cannot agree to this, or, to their \namazement, they will find under their priorities they can easily get a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002.\n  I believe that without a question. In fact, I will volunteer to sit \ndown with them and use their priorities. How much more do you really \nwant in education? It is annually appropriated, but let us just put it \non the table, I say to my colleague, Senator Cochran, put it on there. \nHow much more do you want in the Environmental Protection Agency? Put \nit on the table. Not very big budget items. Put some more on that they \nhave been talking about. Put them on the table.\n  Look at this resolution: ``The unified balanced budget shall be based \non the most current economic and technical assumptions of the \nCongressional Budget Office.''\n  We did not use those because we kept our budget resolution to the \nApril ones. But, Mr. President, I say to my fellow Democrats, I ask \nthat you look at those. See how much more that gives us to spend. I \nwill guess $30 billion. Your priorities can be plugged into those, but \nwhy in the world, with the effort that has gone forth and with over 85 \npercent of Americans wanting a balanced budget, why would the President \nnot commit and why would Democratic Senators not vote for a very basic, \nsimple cornerstone for the beginning of serious negotiations by the \nExecutive and the Congress, and there are no other conditions? Right?\n  It does not say how we get there. It does not say what committee does \nit. It does not say which programs are in, which are out. Very, very \nsimple: Do you want to agree to the cornerstone of fiscal sanity, which \nis 7 years using real economics, and sit down and do it? As a matter of \nfact, I would assume that if it turns out to be impossible, that it \nwould turn out to be impossible because there is great justification on \nthe part of the President not to do it and even that the American \npeople might buy in after serious negotiations.\n  Nobody goes to jail. Nobody is run out of office. It just says the \nCongress and the President shall do this. We cannot tie our President's \nhands. We can just say let us get on with this.\n  Let me put into my last thoughts--this idea is sort of budgetese and \nhard to talk about--but whose economic assumptions should you use? Let \nme try to draw a distinction that maybe everybody can understand. We \ncreated an institution called the Congressional Budget Office, led by \nDemocrats and Republicans, I am very pleased to say to this day to this \nSenator's satisfaction, and in my opinion, they are very objective and \nthey are very good. Nobody owns them. They do not work for the majority \nor the minority or the President. They have a cadre of economists that \nare as good as any. They have number crunchers that are the best.\n  Why did we do that and why did we tell them to do their work and to \ngive it to the U.S. Congress? Because we wanted a neutral, objective \nevaluator of the realities of the American economy, especially if you \nhad to do some predicting.\n  Nobody is going to take the floor and say that they are inferior to \nthe President's people who do the same kind of work. Most will say they \nare superior to the President's people. Most will get the record out \nand say they are right more times than any of the others, which is \ntrue.\n  What is this battle about? The President of the United States got up \nat a joint session of Congress. He had his first budget before us as \nPresident. In that budget, he used what? Congressional Budget Office \nassumptions. He bragged about it, and he said that we are not cooking \nthe books anymore. I am paraphrasing. We are not cooking the books \nanymore. No more smoke and mirrors. We are using the real authenticator \nof economics.\n  Who was it he was talking about? The Congressional Budget Office. He \ndirected that sort of at Republicans that night. At least we took it \nthat way. The Democrats cheered. Republicans sort of said, I guess he \nis picking on us.\n  The very next year, the President of the United States, for some \nreason, said, ``I am not using them anymore. I am going to use my own \npeople.'' Everybody should understand that those who do this work for \nthe President work for him. The Office of Management and Budget \nDirector is appointed by the President. We confirmed him. His Chief of \nEconomics, head of that council, he picks them. The Secretary of the \nTreasury, he picks them.\n  Why did we create CBO? Because we were not too sure that when it came \nto these kinds of things, that you would not just lean a little bit \ntoward your boss, right? We think some of those did that for Ronald \nReagan, and we were the ones that took it in the neck for it. We had to \nend up saying we do not like these magic asterisks anymore and rosy \neconomics.\n  So, for some reason--I think I now know why--the President, after 1 \nyear, changed his mind, and he produced a budget that used different \neconomic assumptions--growth, interest rates, and how much programs \nwould cost, such as Medicare and Medicaid. He did that with his people \nand said, ``If you want \n\n[[Page S 17112]]\nto use the Congressional Budget Office up there on the Hill, that is \nyour business.'' But it turns out, right now, that it happens to be \neverybody's business because, essentially, if you use what the \nPresident's own people did for him, you have a no-pain budget. You do \nnot have to change things very much because you pick up great savings \nbecause of assumptions. You even save a huge amount of money on \nMedicare and Medicaid without changing anything. You do not change a \nsentence in the law, put a new period in; you just assume more savings \nand then the program costs less.\n  I must say, I really wish that, before I went to the trouble of \nproducing the budget that we are going to bring up the day after \ntomorrow and that we voted on here, somebody would have given me a \npresent. What kind of present? A $475 billion present saying you do not \nhave to worry about $475 billion of these reforms and restraints and \nreductions, because we just found them. Where did you find them? We \nfound them because the President's men, the President's workers, the \nPresident's OMB Director found them by changing the books.\n  Now, I understand--and there is no inference that there is anything \nillegal about this at all--they have their views, and they are \ncompetent, smart, informed people. But the truth of the matter is that \nthey work for the President and the Congressional Budget Office does \nnot, nor does it work for Republicans. They have been more right than \nwrong, and we have been burned many times using economic assumptions \nthat turn out not to be right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I think I am hearing from Members on the other \nside is they are trying to find a reason to vote against this \ncontinuing resolution. They may not be comfortable with voting against \nit because it balances the budget in 7 years or because we are using \nCongressional Budget Office scoring. But some are trying to find a \nreduction in the expenditure levels in the continuing resolution as a \nreason to vote against this continuing resolution.\n  I want to ask the Senator, who I know is on the Appropriations \nCommittee--and I conferred with the Senator from Mississippi, who is \nalso on the committee--is it not a custom that when a continuing \nresolution is passed, in that continuing resolution you use the lower \nof the House- or Senate-passed levels of spending for the various \nprograms, and that becomes the continuing resolution? Is that not the \ncustom of continuing resolutions, I ask the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. While I was not intimately involved in the process that \ndeveloped that theory, it actually has a name. It is called the Michel \nrule, which is from the former minority leader in the House, \nRepresentative Michel, because at a point in time when he was in his \nleadership role, we were confronted with a Republican President and a \nDemocratic Congress, and they were trying to work together to get some \ntime, like we are, in a continuing resolution. Bob Michel suggested the \nlower of either House for this short interval, and it has thus been \nknown as the Michel rule. So that is the case. That has been the \npractice.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This bill conforms with the Michel rule?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Have Members on both sides voted for CR's that do that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. We have to lay that on the table. There is a \nslight addition because there are programs that are zeroed out in the \nMichel rule application. The House feels strongly about those. The \nPresident feels strongly about those. And so rather than using the \nMichel rule, which would have said the lower of either means zero, we \nhave compromised at 60 percent for the next 19 days.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So actually we are even spending more money than the \nMichel rule would require because we are taking programs that would \nhave been zeroed out because the House zeroed out those programs. They \nare spending 60 percent just to continue those programs during this \nperiod of time. So, in fact, we are being more generous than previous \nCR's would have been; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, in the sense that if you had a zero and applied \nthe Michel rule, that would be the lowest possible one. So it would be \nzeroed out. I do not know if there has ever been any such zeroing out \nin a continuing resolution applying the Michel rule. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Mississippi knows that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Michel rule never applied to a set of facts in \nwhich you were zeroing out programs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just said that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is absolutely right. So the response to the \nquestion put from the Senator from Pennsylvania is contrary to his \nassertion. The Michel rule never reached the matter we are confronting \nwith all the zeroing out of these very important programs, including \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which the Senator from \nNorth Dakota made reference to earlier.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say, first, to Senator Sarbanes, one might put it \nanother way and be just as accurate as your statement. One might say \nthat the Michel rule has to be modified because, as it was applied, \nthere were no zeroing out of program funding. So it is being modified. \nAnd we are modifying it and saying 60 percent funding for a temporary \nperiod of 19 days. That is one way to say it. I think that is what we \nare acknowledging.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will yield for a quick question, I ask if \nthe Senator from New Mexico is aware that, this morning, the Wall \nStreet Journal has endorsed the economic assumptions of the President, \nrather than the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. The Wall Street Journal this morning said: ``While the \nCongressional Budget Office predicted 2.3 percent annual economic \ngrowth, OMB boosted it to 2.5 percent.'' And, interestingly enough, the \nWall Street Journal, this morning, said: ``In our view, both growth \nassumptions are overly pessimistic. Corporate profits look fairly \ncheerful. There is no reason the economy should not grow at 3 \npercent,'' according to the Wall Street Journal. ``Government policies, \nwhether monetary or fiscal, should not be designed to foreclose this \nresult.''\n\n  I wanted to know if the Senator from New Mexico was aware that the \nWall Street Journal--this is perhaps the most conservative journal in \nthe country with respect to these issues--has this morning endorsed the \neconomic assumptions of the Office of Management and Budget--if you \nlook at the last 2 years.\n  I further ask, is it not true that the actual results of economic \ngrowth have exceeded both CBO and OMB assumptions, and that the actual \nresults on deficit reduction have been better--the actual results--than \nCBO or OMB assumptions?\n  In fact, both have been overly conservative, and that perhaps the \nWall Street Journal has got it right in that both OMB and CBO are \noverly conservative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the question.\n  Was the Senator aware the Wall Street Journal has endorsed the \nPresident's economic assumptions, saying that both OMB and CBO are \noverly pessimistic?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was not aware, but it does not surprise me. I have \nthe greatest respect for the Wall Street Journal but their charter is \nnot to balance the budget. Our charter is to balance the budget. Theirs \nis to write editorials and make assessments and predictions. They are \ngood at it.\n  The fact of the matter is if you put to the American people in \nlanguage they could understand, if you are going to work at a balanced \nbudget would you want to take a chance on using a rosy economic \nscenario and pulling us in again, or do you want to be more \nconservative?\n  If the conservative economics are right, lo and behold, we will have \na nice surplus. Is that all so bad? Especially when you look at what we \nhave do to get there, and if the Democrats will look at what we have \ndone to get there, and apply their priorities on it, you get to a \nbalanced budget using the \n\n[[Page S 17113]]\nCongressional Budget Office's more conservative, historically more \naccurate, economic assumptions than those prepared either by OMB or \nconfirmed by the Wall Street Journal in their opinion as being more \nappropriate.\n  Now, Mr. President----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have tremendous respect for the Senator and I want \nto ask one thing. There are a number of us here who are anxious to be \npart of the debate. Will the Senator hold the floor longer, or is there \nan opportunity to have this debate, I think many of us would like to \nhave?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am fully aware you want to debate, and I am sure we \nwill debate and I will be through very soon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just give you, the people \nlistening and those who at least understand where I am coming from, my \nlast observations.\n  Mr. President, I want to give my last observation of the situation: \nIt is going to be very difficult to get a balanced budget. Once the \nPresident has vetoed the Balanced Budget Act we will present, it will \nbe very difficult. Then there is no game plan and we will have to sit \ndown as best we can and see if we can put one together.\n  I predict with almost certainty that if we do not have at least a \ncornerstone from which to start that work of a balanced budget in 7 \nyears with agreed-upon economics, I submit it will never happen. I \nsense that in my discussions with people from the White House.\n  The differences are so severe that we will be all over the lot, and \nwithout 7 years staring us in the face and agreed upon priorities--and \nI say ``agreed upon'' because they are not ours at that point, they are \nnegotiable--we will not get there.\n  Senators on your side want to debate things, and I wonder, is Senator \nExon the manager?\n  Mr. EXON. There are no time restraints. It is open season, so to \nspeak.\n  I believe the Senator from North Dakota was very, very early, but it \nis up to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not yield because of the nature of this amendment \nthat is pending and the fact that it can be amended. I have to either \nask that there be no amendments to it for the next 30 minutes or 40 \nminutes or an hour or I will have to bring the Republican leader to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. EXON. Would the chairman of the committee please restate the \nrequest.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I give up the floor without getting the majority \nleader to the floor so I can talk to him, could we have an agreement \nfor the next hour we will debate and there will be no amendments?\n  Mr. EXON. There are some amendments that we want to offer. I simply \ninquire--we could not agree to that without further consideration.\n  The floor is open to amendments at any time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was unaware of a conversation between the majority \nleader and your leader that has already occurred that straightens out \nmy problem, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened for some while this \nmorning, and I will respond to some of the discussion that I have \nheard.\n  This is either, in theatrical terms, a comedy or tragedy. I suppose \nsome view it both ways.\n  A comedy--I came to the Capitol this morning to see a newspaper that \nsays ``Cry Baby,'' and a newspaper saying that the Speaker had a \ntantrum and closed down the Government because Clinton made him sit at \nthe back of the plane.\n  I do not know the veracity of the news piece but the quote that is in \nthis piece says, claiming that Clinton refused to open budget talks and \nsnubbed him aboard Air Force One, Gingrich said, ``That's part of why \nyou ended up with us sending down a tougher stopgap spending bill.''\n  Well, I hope that is not the case. I hope that is just hyperbole, but \nif it is the case, it truly is comedy--low-grade comedy. It does not \nmake any sense for this country to be in this situation. The tragedy is \nthis affects a lot of people in a lot of significant ways.\n  I know that truth is often the first casualty in debates like this. I \nknow that on the floor of the Senate there are people today who will \nwork very hard to make the case that this debate is about whether we \nshould balance the budget.\n  We will see contortions and acrobatic approaches today that suggest \nthis is only about whether we should balance the budget. It is not \nabout that at all.\n  Of course we should balance the budget. Of course we should balance \nthe budget. I do not think anyone in here disagrees with that. That \nought to be the goal.\n  The question is, how do you balance the budget? What approach do you \nuse to balance the budget? I know that we will have people for the next \nhour who will say the debate here is about CBO versus OMB. I bet a lot \nof people do not understand the interests of that--CBO versus OMB. I do \nnot care whether it is CBO, OMB, AT, or the NFL.\n  That is not the issue with me. What I do care about is the notion \nthat people are bringing legislative initiatives to this floor to--they \nsay--balance the budget, in a manner that cuts health care for the \nelderly and the vulnerable in our country, takes kids off the Head \nStart Program. It does dozens of things to the more vulnerable parts of \nour society and then rewards others with tax breaks.\n  As long as people are coming to this floor saying what we need to do \nis borrow money to give a tax break, some $245 billion, 80 percent of \nwhich will go to the top 20 percent of the income earners, as long as \npeople are saying we must do that, and in order to pay for all of that, \nwe ought to take a big hunk out of Medicare, Medicaid, education, low-\nincome energy assistance for poor people, when they are trying to heat \ntheir homes during the winter as an example, I am not going to be \ninterested in talking about CBO versus OMB.\n  I am for 7 years. That is fine. If we can do it quicker, that is fine \nas well. The fact is, we ought to do it the right way, and the right \nway is not to borrow money to give a tax cut which will reward the \nprivileged in this country.\n  There was an article the other day that described in summary what we \nare facing here. The ``how to balance the budget,'' represented by the \npriorities of the road map already given us by the majority party, is \nto do it this way. It says, you take a roomful of people and have that \nroomful of people represent the population of the United States. Then \nyou divide them. You take the 20 percent of your room that have the \nlowest incomes and you put them on this side of the room in chairs. You \nsay: You sit over there because you have the lowest income in the room, \nyou 20 percent. Now we are going to cut spending in a way that says you \n20 percent with the lowest incomes get 80 percent of the spending cuts. \nYou bear the burden of 80 percent of all we are going to do on the \nspending cut side.\n  In the same room you say: By the way, we would like to take the 20 \npercent that have the highest incomes in this room and put them over \nhere in chairs on this side of the room. Then you go over to them and \nsay: By the way, we have good news for you. You 20 percent with the \nhighest incomes in this little room of ours, we are going to give you \n80 percent of the tax cut.\n  Now we have our room divided, a microcosm of our country. We have the \n20 percent of the lowest income earners on this side of the room and we \nhave 60 percent in the middle and then we have the 20 percent of the \nhighest income earners on the other side of the room. And we have said: \nYou folks that do not have much, we are going to make things a lot \nworse for you because you are going to take 80 percent of the spending \ncuts, that is what we are saddling you with. And you folks that have \nthe most, we are going to reward you with 80 percent of the tax cuts. \nThat is what we are facing. That is the road map.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield when I have finished, if I have \nany time left, but I have just begun my statement----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Let me just ask, about the tax cut----\n  Mr. DORGAN. We were generous with the Senator from New Mexico, who \nhad the floor for some while----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. He yielded to you for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. All right. I will yield for a question of----\n\n[[Page S 17114]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I was just going to ask the Senator if there is any tax \ncut in this bill? This is a continuing resolution that provides, is it \nnot true, for 3 weeks for a cooling-off period to fund Government and \nget everybody back in the agencies and departments? There is not \nanything in this resolution that would require any tax to be cut, is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I get your question. Let me ask you a question. Would you \nagree to balance this budget without a tax cut so you are not borrowing \nmoney to give a tax cut to the wealthy?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We are not debating how we get to the balanced budget, \nis my response. That is what you are trying to convert this into, is a \ndebate over tax cuts. This is a debate on getting the Government \nfunctioning, is it not true? That is what the continuing resolution is \nabout.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time. We already know what your plan \nis. It has been on the floor twice, just as recently as a couple of \nweeks ago. It includes a tax cut. We know that.\n  My question to you, Senator Cochran, was would you agree to balance \nthis budget without giving a tax cut? Because the fact is, every single \ndollar of tax cut you are going to borrow.\n  I simply ask that question of you.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to respond to my good friend. This is \nnot a debate over how we balance the budget. It is a debate over \nwhether or not we ought to commit ourselves to working together to \nachieve a balanced budget. That is the provision in this resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's response. The fact is, he did \nnot answer my question. The reason he did not answer my question, he \nand I both know, is that you have no intention, the majority party has \nno intention and never has had an intention, of bringing a balanced \nbudget resolution to the floor of the Senate that does not include a \nbig tax cut that will, in most cases, reward the most privileged of \npeople in our country and every single dollar of the tax cut you are \ngoing to borrow. The fact is, every dollar that is given as a tax cut \nto someone during the next 7 years will be a dollar that is borrowed \nand increases this country's debt. If you call that conservative \neconomics, I do not know what school teaches it.\n  The fact is, we know what the plan is. So to come here and say this \nis about 7 years and CBO and put blinders on--here is the journey. Do \nnot remember, by the way, where we have taken you in the past. We know \nexactly what that journey is about and we know all of the stops along \nthe way.\n  Among those stops are a very significant tax cut, because that is the \ncenterpole in the tent on the contract for America. The fact is, the \nAmerican people are a lot smarter than a lot of the folks running \naround town. They understand that, when the job in front of you is to \nbalance the Federal budget, you roll up your sleeves and you talk about \nhow you do it. They also understand that those who roll up their \nsleeves and talk about a tax cut while you are up to your neck in debt \ndo no service to the future of this country.\n  I know it is popular. I know why my colleagues, some of my colleagues \non the House and Senate side, want to talk about tax cuts. Because it \nis enormously popular. I have a couple of kids who want to eat desert \nfirst every single meal. I know why they want to do that. And I know \nwhy you all want to talk about tax cuts. But you all know, if you are \nhonest, that every single dollar of the tax cut will be borrowed.\n  Let me just suggest a couple of other points about the tax cut. We do \nnot know what this tax cut is going to be, but let me give some \nexamples of what it can be.\n  In the House of Representatives, they give a $2 million tax cut \napiece for 2,000 corporations by eliminating something called the \nalternative minimum tax. That does not mean much to anybody. Eliminate \nthe AMT. That is pretty foreign stuff. Nobody knows what that means.\n  What it means is this. In the old days we used to read stories about \na corporation that would make $2 billion in income and guess what they \npaid in taxes? Zero. Nothing. Then we put together something called an \nalternative minimum tax, to say that is not fair. If you make $2 \nbillion, and somebody goes out and works 8 or 10 hours a day and makes \n$8 or $10 an hour, guess what? They have to take a shower at night and \nfill out a tax return and they are going to pay a tax. It is not fair, \nif you make $2 billion and pay zero, so we are going to have an \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Our friends in the House said we do not want an alternative minimum \ntax. Why should we want those big interests to start paying taxes \nagain? Let us eliminate that. Let us give 2,000 corporations $2 million \neach in tax breaks and then let us tell 55,000 kids we cannot afford \nHead Start for them. Tell them we cannot afford a Head Start Program \nfor you.\n  In this bill--you know, it is interesting. We are told this is an \ninnocent little piece of legislation. The only thing that matters on \nthis piece of legislation is the last page, page 15, which talks about \n7 years and CBO.\n  What about page 9? I wonder if somebody wants to talk about page 9. \nPage 9 says the Star Schools Program--which deals with math and \neducation and science, in which we are going to try to boost America's \nschools--that program we ought to get rid of. What we do is we cut \nfunding 40 percent on the Star Schools Program. And the Senator from \nNew Mexico says, that is only for 19 days; what are you concerned \nabout? Cut Star Schools by only 40 percent for 19 days.\n  Do you know something? The same people who bring us these priorities, \ncutting Star Schools, and call themselves conservatives and say they \nwant to balance the budget, are off trying to build star wars for $48 \nbillion, building an astrodome over America. The Soviet Union is gone, \nbut now we want to build an astrodome over America for $48 billion \nbecause, when it comes to star wars, the sky is the limit. We have \nplenty of money. Let us spend it like it is Saturday night and we have \nunlimited credit cards. But when it comes to Star Schools, we are \nsorry, it is just not in the rank of priorities for us.\n  I somehow do not understand the priorities. We are here, not by \naccident. This is an engineered circumstance. All of us know that. I \nhave read before, but I want to read again, statements by the Speaker \nlast April. He vowed ``to create a titanic legislative standoff with \nPresident Clinton by adding vetoed bills to must-pass legislation \nincreasing the national debt ceiling.''\n  This is not an accident. We are not here by some trick of fate. This \nis a deliberate, engineered shutdown. Why? I guess--I do not know. \nMaybe it is because somebody was not invited to get off the front of \nthe airplane and he got piqued. It is human. Maybe it is petty. Maybe \nit is human. Or maybe because there is a genuine difference in \npriorities.\n  I guess they want the debate today to be a debate about 7 years CBO. \nSeven years does not matter to me. Six years will be fine, as far as I \nam concerned. If we get good economic growth, maybe get some moderation \nof health care prices, we can do it faster than 7 years. But the fact \nis, the differences between us are differences in priorities, very \nsubstantial differences in priorities.\n  Just a couple of other quick points. We have heard a lot already this \nmorning, and we will hear all day, that they have a plan to balance the \nbudget. Of course they do not have a plan to balance the budget. The \nCongressional Budget Office says their plan results in a $110 billion \ndeficit in the year 2002. I hope the Senator from South Carolina, who \nis on the floor, will address this as well. What a fraud. It does not \nbalance the budget and never has. The only way they address it is to \ntake money from the Social Security trust funds, move it over, and then \nclaim after they have taken the money they have balanced budget.\n  Everybody in this room knows it is a sham. I said it in 1983 and \noffered an amendment in the Ways and Means Committee in the House in \n1983, and said: This is what they are going to do with the Social \nSecurity surplus if it is not protected. And 12 years later, sure \nenough, every single year they have done it. So they say we have a \nbalanced budget. Sure they do.\n  They got to a balanced budget by, in my judgment, dishonestly using \nSocial Security trust funds in the operating budget. No. 1; No. 2, \nborrowing money to give a tax cut, 80 percent of which will go to the \ntop 20 percent of the income earners in the country. \n\n[[Page S 17115]]\n\n  The fact is this is all about special interest, all about big money. \nI come from a rural area. I know about the sound of hogs in a corn crib \nand feeding. I tell you. This is all about feeding. It is about who \ngets helped and who gets hurt, who gets saddled with the cost and who \ngets the benefit.\n  And predictably when you look at winners and losers--not whether we \nbalance the budget but who wins and who loses under this plan--it is \npretty clear.\n  There is an old song by Bob Wills.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not yield.\n  There is an old song by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys that I have \nused on the floor before with lyrics that I think are appropriate to \nthese priorities. ``The little bee sucks the blossom, and the big bee \ngets the honey. The little guy picks the cotton, and the big guy gets \nthe money.'' That is what this is about. This is about queen bees and \nbig guys. Guess who ends up with all the money, and guess who winds up \nwith all the hurt?\n  What we ought to do--all of us--is get in a room and talk about what \nworks and what does not. Who needs help and who does not? How do we \nmove our country ahead? What kind of incentives provide opportunity and \ngrowth? All of those things are important to everyone of us in this \nroom. Our differences at this point are over priorities, and choices. \nAnd honestly I think there are some who do not want them solved. I \nunderstand that. There are some who are piqued. There are some who are \nupset about what end of a plane they got off of at some point. But \nthere are others, myself included, who believe it is worthy to balance \nthis budget. It is important to the country to do it, but to do it with \nthe right choices and the right priorities so that all of the American \npeople benefit from this exercise.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  My question was simply to refer to the statement he made, and to ask \nhim whether or not on the Star Schools issue he realized that in the \nSenate committee that has jurisdiction over education we recommend in \nthe bill that we tried to call up the other day that Star Schools be \nfunded at the same level that it was funded last year; that the House \nprovided no funding in their bill. And the suggestion of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota though is this continuing resolution, if it passed, \nwould zero out Star Schools. The program is forward funded anyway. But \nin the Senate bill, which the Democrats refused to let us bring up when \nthey refused to permit us to agree to the motion to proceed to the \nbill, would fund that program at the same level that was funded at last \nyear.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct. He is also correct that the House \nversion of the appropriations bill zeroed it out. I guess I have little \nfaith that rather than getting the best of each we will probably get \nthe worst of both.\n  So I think that when you come to this floor saying that the Star \nSchools Program shall have a reduction in funding of 40 percent, which \nis what I said, the Star Schools Program be reduced by 40 percent in \nthis continuing resolution at the same time that we have a bunch of \nfolks who are genuflecting trying to build a star wars program that \nwill cost $48 billion. I am scratching my head. Who sees the bigger \npicture for our country--those who want the best in schools and kids, \nor those who want to build a star wars project with money we do not \nneed and do not have?\n  That is the only point I was trying to make. That is why I think this \nis truly about choices. This it about priorities. This is a very worthy \ndebate. We ought not have it while the Government is shut down. There \nought to be, in my judgment, more thoughtful programs keeping the \nGovernment open trying the prioritize as we balance the budget, and, \nyes, in 7 years. That is fine with me. Score keeping is not the issue \nhere. It seems to me that it is choices and priorities.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the article to which the Senator was referring the \none from the New York Daily News that starts out ``House Speaker Newt \nGingrich admitted yesterday that he provoked the government shutdown in \na fit of pique over how President Clinton treated him on last week's \ntrip to Israel''?\n  Later on it says, ``And so, Gingrich's wounded pride fueled the \nshutdown that forced the furlough of 800,000 Federal workers and closed \nnonessential services--costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars.''\n  Is that the article?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the article to which I was referring to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Daily News, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\nCry Baby--Newt's Tantrum: He Closed Down the Government Because Clinton \n                     Made Him Sit at Back of Plane\n\n               (By Timothy Clifford and Dave Eisenstadt)\n\n       Washington.--House Speaker Newt Gingrich admitted yesterday \n     that he provoked the government shutdown in a fit of pique \n     over how President Clinton treated him on last week's trip to \n     Israel.\n       Claiming that Clinton refused to open budget talks and \n     snubbed him and Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole (Kan.) aboard Air \n     Force One, Gingrich (R-Ga.) said, ``That's part of why you \n     ended up with us sending down a tougher [stopgap spending \n     bill].''\n       On Monday night, Clinton vetoed the GOP bill that would \n     have kept the government running through Dec. 1.\n       Clinton rejected the measure because Gingrich and Dole put \n     in provisions that would have raised Medicare premiums and \n     cut deeply into education and environmental programs.\n       And so, Gingrich's wounded pride fueled the shutdown that \n     forced the furlough of 800,000 federal workers and closed \n     nonessential services--costing taxpayers hundreds of millions \n     of dollars.\n       Even though Gingrich and Dole spent 25 hours flying to and \n     from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, the \n     speaker groused that they never talked about the budget.\n       And Gingrich told reporters that White House staffers \n     ushered him and Dole off the back of the aircraft on their \n     return--far from the media cameras focused on Clinton and \n     former Presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter walking out \n     the front.\n       ``You just wonder, where is their sense of manners, where \n     is their sense of courtesy?'' Gingrich told reporters. ``I \n     don't know. Was it just a sign of utter incompetence or lack \n     of consideration, or was it a deliberate strategy of \n     insult?''\n       Despite conceding that his complaints sounded ``petty,'' \n     Gingrich argued, ``We think they were sending us a deliberate \n     signal that they're not going to negotiate; they don't care \n     what we are doing, that they have, in fact, decided on their \n     path and that is the path of confrontation.''\n       Democrats immediately ridiculed Gingrich--saying that the \n     President let the speaker bring his wife on the trip.\n       ``I'm amazed that he would be the biggest whiner,'' Senate \n     Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (S.D.) said. ``We'll give him \n     another flight over there, and the President can play cards \n     with him. . . . It's crazy.''\n       And Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said, ``You all know \n     that they were going to mourn a death by assassination of the \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. And the speaker was \n     treated with utmost courtesy.''\n       Dole distanced himself from Gingrich's outrage, joking \n     about the incident.\n       ``We got in on the front exit, went out the rear exit,'' \n     Dole told reporters. ``Maybe that's just the normal \n     rotation.''\n       Slightly backing down last night, Gingrich and Dole \n     proposed a new stopgap funding bill without the controversial \n     Medicare provision.\n       But the measure also would force Clinton to accept \n     balancing the budget in seven years and retains the cuts to \n     environmental and educational programs.\n       The White House immediately announced that Clinton would \n     veto that bill.\n       With polls showing public support for his stand, Clinton \n     told CBS television that he would not cave to the \n     Republicans. ``I'm not going to do it, even if it's 90 days, \n     120 days or 180 days. If we take it right into the next \n     election, let the American people decide,'' the President \n     said.\n       Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin took more than \n     $60 billion from two Civil Service retirement funds to stave \n     off the first default in U.S. history.\n       Clinton vetoed the GOP's debt limit extension Monday, \n     forcing Rubin to take the extraordinary action that \n     guarantees that the U.S. can pay its bills through the new \n     year.\n       The financial markets showed approval of Rubin's actions, \n     but the Federal Reserve failed to cut interest rates as many \n     expected it would.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, is the Senator familiar with the \narticles which appeared in today's Post and today's Baltimore Sun, one \nheaded ``Underlying Gingrich's Stance Is His Pique About President,'' \nand the other one, \n\n[[Page S 17116]]\n``Gingrich links stalemate to perceived Clinton snub.''\n  This is an absolute tragedy. You have 800,000 employees out of work, \nservices cut down at great expense, and it is all because the Speaker \nhas had a fit of pique about this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those articles be printed \nin the Record as well, along with a column by Lars-Erik Nelson, of the \nNew York Daily News, headed ``Crisis reveals Newt depths of \npettiness.''\n  This is incredible. The Speaker himself at a breakfast in effect \nconceded that this provoked him into taking this action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Maryland \nthat the Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. I am finished.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the articles to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n       Underlying Gingrich's Stance Is His Pique About President\n\n                           (By John E. Yang)\n\n       The budget battle between President Clinton and Congress \n     turns on many things, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich keeps \n     coming back to that long plane flight back from Israel when \n     he says the president ignored and insulted him.\n       Gingrich (R-Ga.) yesterday said the tough terms of the \n     interim spending bill Clinton vetoed Monday night, triggering \n     a partial government shutdown, were partly the result of \n     pique he and Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) \n     felt on Air Force One during the long round-trip flight to \n     Jerusalem for the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak \n     Rabin.\n       ``This is petty,'' he told reporters. ``[But] you land at \n     Andrews [Air Force Base] and you've been on the plane for 25 \n     hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get \n     off the plane by the back ramp. . . .You just wonder, where \n     is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of \n     courtesy?''\n       At a breakfast with reporters, Gingrich delivered an almost \n     stream-of-consciousness analysis of the current political \n     crisis, a candid performance he said he knew his press \n     secretary would not like. Gingrich alternately and astutely \n     described how his party was positioned in the current debate \n     over the budget, and angrily relived--at length--the \n     disrespect he felt he suffered at the president's hands \n     aboard Air Force One. He said that the fact that Clinton did \n     not speak to him or Dole during the trip to and from \n     Jerusalem is ``part of why you ended up with us sending down \n     a tougher'' interim spending bill.\n       ``It's petty . . . but I think it's human.''\n       Gingrich's comments brought immediate disdain from \n     Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) \n     who was also on the trip to attend Rabin's funeral, called on \n     Gingrich to ``quit the whinning--let's get on with the real \n     business here.''\n       And White House press secretary Michael McCurry reacted \n     with mock disbelief when asked about Gingrich's allegations \n     of disrespect on the part of the president.\n       ``You all know that they were going to mourn the death by \n     assassination of the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin,'' \n     McCurry told reporters at his daily briefing. ``And the \n     speaker was treated with utmost courtesy. In fact, so much \n     courtesy that his wife was invited when other wives of this \n     delegation were not invited. And until someone shows me these \n     words in black and white. I will refuse to believe that the \n     speaker said anything that as you described it as so petty. . \n     . . I just fail to believe the speaker would somehow connect \n     this to the current budget crisis.''.\n       As the budget battle intensifies, the bickering between \n     Clinton and congressional Republican leaders is becoming \n     increasingly bitter and personal.\n       During Monday night's Oval Office meeting between Clinton \n     and congressional leaders, for instance, House Majority \n     Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) complained about having ``to \n     listen to these lies'' from the White House, according to a \n     participant.\n       Clinton responded by saying the congressional Republicans \n     had been worse in their attacks, telling Armey who had \n     criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton during last year's health \n     care debate: ``I never, ever have and never expect to \n     criticize your wife or members of your family.''\n       A phone call last Saturday produced complaints of rudeness \n     on the president's part. Dole complained publicly that \n     Clinton had all but hung up on him when he called to discuss \n     a possible budget deal, and Gingrich was angry that Clinton \n     promised to call them back and never did. The White House \n     explained that Clinton was leaving for a Veterans Day event \n     when the Republicans called and that Clinton said then he \n     could talk for only five minutes.\n       The tension is not surprising. Gingrich is in the midst of \n     the most crucial week yet of his speakership. Not only is he \n     engaged in a high-stakes confrontation with Clinton, but he \n     and his leadership team are struggling to complete work on \n     the massive Republican balanced-budget bill--which leaders \n     vowed would be done last Friday. Gingrich called the measure \n     ``central'' to Republicans. ``It will decide for a generation \n     who we are,'' he said.\n       ``This is not a game of political chicken . . . this is not \n     a bunch of juveniles,'' the speaker said. ``This is a \n     serious, historic debate and a serious, historic power \n     struggle. . . . That's why there will not be an immediate \n     resolution to this crisis.''\n       Gingrich told reporters that is why the lack of \n     negotiations aboard Air Force One was so serious.\n       The speaker said the airborne silence was a signal ``that \n     they had made a decision because of their political \n     calculation that they wanted a fight. . . .  Our calculation \n     was that they hadn't seen us deliberately. . . . Our feelings \n     aren't hurt.''\n       The speaker said the terms of the interim spending bill \n     were toughened because it was clear it would have to pass \n     without Democratic support.\n       Whether Gingrich took it as an affront or not, the incident \n     became a rallying cry among House Republicans, who rarely \n     failed to mention it when asked about the possibility of \n     working with the administration.\n       Among the other things on which the budget battle is \n     turning, Gingrich said, is instinct. That, he said, was the \n     basis for the Republicans' demand that the federal budget \n     deficit be eliminated in seven years. Clinton is refusing to \n     accept that time frame and, earlier this year, proposed \n     balancing the budget in 10 years.\n       ``Seven [years] is the longest period in which you can \n     maintain the discipline to insist on it happening,'' Gingrich \n     said. ``Ten [years] allows you to avoid all the decisions \n     that get you to a balanced budget.''\n       Asked on what that was based, the speaker gave a one-word \n     answer: ``Intuition.''\n       Gingrich also dismissed polls indicating that more \n     Americans blame congressional Republicans than Clinton for \n     the budget impasse, saying that his party would win in the \n     long run.\n       Gingrich said the average American ``frankly hasn't thought \n     about it, doesn't particularly care. . . . If the choice [of \n     whom to blame] is a vacillating, extremely misleading \n     president who refuses to make any serious decisions, who \n     refuses to tell the truth and shows up on television trying \n     to make you like him by telling you things that aren't true, \n     and a Congress that says in a very firm, adult way: `Yeah, \n     we're going to balance the budget.' Now of those two, which \n     one is more likely to get blamed?''\n       But, Gingrich said, the Republicans will prevail. ``The \n     public relations fight is easy,'' he said. ``That's why we've \n     ignored it. . . . We're on the right side of history, we're \n     on the right side of this culture.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n           Gingrich Links Stalemate to Perceived Clinton Snub\n\n                            (By Susan Baer)\n\n       Washington.--In remarks that reveal the personal tenor of \n     the budget battle, House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested \n     yesterday that he and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole \n     toughened the spending bill that has led to the partial \n     government shutdown because they felt President Clinton \n     snubbed them on a recent plane ride.\n       At a breakfast session with reporters, Mr. Gingrich said he \n     was insulted and appalled that, on the long trip aboard Air \n     Force One this month to and from the funeral of Israel Prime \n     Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the president failed to invite the \n     Republican leaders to the front of the plane to discuss the \n     budget, and then made them exit at the rear of the plane.\n       ``I think that's part of why you ended up with us sending \n     down a tougher continuing resolution,'' Mr. Gingrich said.\n       ``This is petty, and I'm going to say up front it's petty, \n     and Tony will probably say that I shouldn't say it, but I \n     think it's human,'' the speaker added, referring to Tony \n     Blankley, his spokesman.\n       Mr. Gingrich's remarks suggest that the shabby treatment he \n     perceived helped shape the ``continuing resolution,'' the \n     temporary spending bill that Mr. Clinton vetoed Monday. The \n     bill is at the heart of the budget impasse that has closed \n     parts of the government and furloughed 800,000 federal \n     workers this week.\n       Mr. Gingrich said he thought ``a couple of hours of \n     dialogue'' among the three leaders on the plane might have \n     averted the stalemate that has led to the partial government \n     shutdown.\n       As he has done repeatedly since returning from the Nov. 6 \n     Rabin funeral, Mr. Gingrich railed against Mr. Clinton's \n     treatment of him and Mr. Dole during their 25 hours in \n     flight--specifically the president's decision not to discuss \n     the federal budget with them.\n       Upon arriving back in Washington, he and Mr. Dole had to \n     exit the plane by the rear door instead of by the front door \n     with Mr. Clinton and former Presidents George Bush and Jimmy \n     Carter.\n       ``When you land at Andrews [Air Base] and you've been on \n     the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they \n     ask you to get off by the back ramp so the media won't \n     picture the Senate majority leader and the speaker of the \n     House returning from Israel, you just wonder, where's their \n     sense of manners, where's their sense of courtesy?'' the \n     speaker said.\n       ``Had they just been asleep all night and it hadn't \n     occurred to them that maybe Bob \n\n[[Page S 17117]]\n     Dole deserved the dignity of walking down the front ramp? Forget me--\n     I'm only speaker of the House. But you just have to say to \n     yourself, was it deliberate calculated aloofness or just \n     total incompetence?''\n       Mike McCurry, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, called Mr. \n     Gingrich's remarks ``incomprehensible'' and said he could not \n     believe the speaker would connect the trip to the Rabin \n     funeral with the current budget crisis.\n       When pressed by reporters, Mr. Gingrich tried to dismiss \n     the notion that his tougher negotiating stance on the \n     spending measure was a result of a bruised ego.\n       Rather, he said, the Republican position was influenced by \n     his sense--stemming from the neglect he and Mr. Dole \n     perceived on the plane ride--that the White House was itching \n     for a fight and was simply not interested in negotiating.\n       ``It was clear to us getting off that airplane they had \n     made a decision because of their political calculations that \n     they wanted a fight,'' the House speaker said.\n       During the plane trip, he said, he and Mr. Dole tried to \n     grasp the message of the administration's apparent snub.\n       ``It's like Kremlinology,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ``You have \n     Clintonology. What are they doing? What are the signals? One \n     of the signals was that in 25 hours it was not worthwhile to \n     sit down and talk. One of the signals was, once we arrived \n     back in America, we no longer mattered.''\n       Asked at a news conference whether he, too, was offended by \n     his treatment aboard Air Force One, Mr. Dole said, ``I \n     wondered why I went out the rear exit. We went in the front \n     exit. Maybe that's just the normal rotation.''\n       Mr. McCurry said that, during the flight, Mr. Clinton \n     walked back to the Republican leaders to thank them for \n     joining the delegation to Israel. Budget negotiating, Mr. \n     McCurry said, was not the purpose of the trip.\n       ``The president of the United States lost a friend,'' Mr. \n     McCurry said. ``And I don't think he much felt like talking \n     about budget politics with speaker Gingrich, with all due \n     respect.''\n       Mr. McCurry said the speaker was treated with ``so much \n     courtesy'' on the trip that he was permitted to bring his \n     wife, Marianne, on Air Force One. The privilege was not \n     extended to anyone else in the delegation, including Mr. Bush \n     and Mr. Carter.\n       Other Democrats, in the heat of the budget stalemate \n     yesterday, seized on the speaker's remarks. South Dakota Sen. \n     Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who was also on the \n     trip, said Mr. Gingrich ``must have been sleepwalking that \n     night'' because the president had spoken with the \n     congressional leaders several times.\n       Noting Mrs. Gingrich's presence on the plane, Mr. Daschle \n     said: ``For a person who was given extra privileges, extra \n     opportunities to experience this extraordinary piece of \n     history, I'm amazed that he would be the biggest whiner.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Daily News, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n                Crisis Reveals Newt Depths of Pettiness\n\n                         (By Lars-Erik Nelson)\n\n       Washington.--Across the breakfast table, House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich was doing a good imitation of Capt. Queeg at the end \n     of ``The Caine Mutiny'' court-martial, slowly unraveling into \n     resentment and self-pity.\n       He was fighting liars, he said. And disrespect. ``Forget \n     me, I'm only the speaker of the House,'' he said. Here was \n     Newt Gingrich, leader of the Republican Revolution and \n     defender of civilization on this planet, forced to sit for 25 \n     hours in the back of Air Force One, waiting for President \n     Clinton to stop by and negotiate a budget deal.\n       But Clinton never came back. So Gingrich, in his rage, \n     drafted two resolutions that forced Clinton to bring the \n     federal government to a grinding halt.\n       The extraordinary behind-the-scenes tale Gingrich told \n     yesterday morning at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast is \n     either comedy or tragedy, or junior high school cafeteria \n     intrigue, take your pick. It surely was not what you expect \n     to hear from the stewards of your government.\n       Gingrich had been invited aboard Air Force One last week to \n     fly to the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. \n     With a budget crisis pending, he expected Clinton would take \n     time out during the flight to talk about a possible solution.\n       But Clinton, who seemed to be genuinely grieving over \n     Rabin's death, stayed up front in a cabin with former \n     Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush on both the outward-\n     bound and return trips.\n       Then, when the plane landed at Andrews Air Force base \n     outside Washington, Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole were asked to deplane by--gasp!--the rear door.\n       ``This is petty,'' Gingrich confessed. ``I'm going to say \n     up front it's petty, but I think it's human. When you land at \n     Andrews and you've been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody \n     has talked to you and they ask you to get off by the back \n     ramp . . . you just wonder, where is their sense of manners, \n     where is their sense of courtesy?''\n       To Gingrich, the professor of history, this was one of the \n     snubs of the century, ranking, he said, with the time Charles \n     Evans Hughes stiffed Hiram Johnson of the California \n     Progressive Party back in 1916, a slight that cost Hughes the \n     California vote and the presidency. And it was this \n     disrespect, Gingrich continued, that caused him to send the \n     President two temporary financing and spending bills he knew \n     that Clinton would have to veto--thus shutting down the \n     federal government.\n       As Gingrich spoke, feeling sorrier and sorrier for himself \n     and Dole over their treatment aboard Air Force One, he \n     realized that what he was saying did indeed sound petty. So \n     he changed his tack. ``This was not petty,'' he insisted. \n     ``This was an effort on our part to read the White House \n     strategy. . . . It was clear to us coming off that airplane \n     that they had made a decision because of their political \n     calculation that they wanted a fight.''\n       But then again, he wasn't sure. ``Was it just a sign of \n     utter incompetence or lack of consideration, or was it a \n     deliberate strategy of insult?'' he asked himself. ``I don't \n     know which it was.''\n       Either way, the federal government is shut down, 800,000 \n     employes are laid off, the Treasury is scrambling to honor \n     payments on its bonds, the once-in-a-lifetime Johannes \n     Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art is padlocked, \n     the Statue of Liberty is closed down for the duration and \n     Gingrich, second in line for the presidency, walks around \n     town seeing plots against his dignity.\n       Well, what about it, George Stephanopoulos? Did you \n     intentionally snub the speaker of the House aboard Air Force \n     One?\n       ``I think the speaker needs a weekend off,'' Stephanopoulos \n     said. ``The President was in mourning for a friend. He had \n     several briefings with the speaker, and the rules for Air \n     Force One are that only the President goes out the front \n     door.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I fervently hope \nthat thoughtful people will sit down, and that we will reason together \nand compromise on these choices--not on the question of whether we \nshould balance the budget. Of course, we should. Not on the question of \n7 years or score keeping--compromise on the question of priorities and \nchoices that allow us to get our fiscal house in order, and allow us to \nbuild a better future for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3055\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that there are a number of \namendments to be offered. I think it is important that we get on with \nthem.\n  So, in interest of doing so, I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3055.\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       Section 106(C) of Public Law 104-31 is amended by striking \n     ``November 13, 1995'' and inserting ``December 22, 1995''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me first explain the amendment. It \nvery simply says let us get down to business here. Let us put aside all \nof the debate, all of politics, all of the charges, and let us do first \nthings first. Let us pass a continuing resolution to the 22d of \nDecember, about a month, giving us time to work through what we know is \ngoing to be an extraordinarily difficult 4 weeks. We know we are going \nto have more of this debate. We know we are going to have many \ndifferences. We know that we are not going to resolve many of them. But \nwe also know that we cannot let all of what is happening out there for \nthe last 48 hours continue day after day after day.\n  I do not have today's report, Mr. President. But let me give you \nyesterday's. So far, in just 2 days, 56,000 people have been unable to \napply for Social Security benefits--56,000; 3,226 veterans have been \nunable to file new claims for compensation and pension benefits; 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion visitors have been turned away in 2 days from our national \nparks; 46,000 people have been unable to apply for passports.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. But that is result of what is \nhappening here. Until we resolve the issue of a continuing resolution, \nwe are not going to see changes except for the fact that these are \ngoing to get worse and worse and worse. Those are the changes we can \nexpect.\n  So my amendment simply says this. Let us agree to disagree on all of \nthe other issues for now, and let us at least agree that this cannot go \non; that the American people expecting services from the Federal \nGovernment ought to get them; that this looks worse and worse, and that \nwe ought to resolve at least this part of it. I do not think that is \ntoo much to ask, Mr. President.\n  So I would hope every Senator could support at least this. That is \nall we are \n\n[[Page S 17118]]\ndoing today--offering an amendment that says the Government must \ncontinue to function.\n  What is all the more troubling is what we have just heard in the \ndialog and in the colloquy on the floor between the distinguished \nSenators from North Dakota, from Maryland, and others who have laid out \nwhat may be the motivation behind this impasse.\n  It sounds to me more like this impasse is directly a function of the \nresult of a hunch and a grudge on part of the Speaker--a hunch and a \ngrudge, a grudge that somehow he was not given adequate consideration \non the plane to Israel. Well, I must tell you--and I will tell my \ncolleagues what I have said repeatedly now in the last week or 10 days \non the floor and in public forums throughout the last week and a \nhalf. I was in that same room, and I do not know whether this is \nselected memory or sleepwalking on an airplane or what. The President \ncame back on a number of occasions, talked to us a number of times \nabout the extraordinary nature of the trip itself. We were going to one \nof the most difficult, one of the most emotional, certainly one of the \nmost memorable occasions that I have had in public life, the burial of \na head of State. He came back. We talked at some length about that with \nthe Israeli Ambassador, who, by the way, was also in the room. We had \nthose conversations. The Speaker was there. Why he chooses now not to \nremember that is something I do not understand.\n\n  He came back on other occasions talking about the need to find \nagreement, the need to breach our differences, the need to find a way \nwith which to resolve the impasse. And when he was finished coming \nback, the Chief of Staff came back on several occasions and asked about \nwhether or not we could resolve our differences.\n  I must remind my colleagues, I recall very well when I got the call \nfrom the White House that this was a development that had just occurred \nand could I come back to Washington. I was in South Dakota. Reference \nwas made to spouses, and I was informed that spouses in this situation \njust were not welcome. And I said I understood. I knew the plane would \nbe crowded. I knew how difficult the trip. I knew all the logistical \nproblems. So I did not challenge whether spouses ought to be there or \nnot. But I am told the Speaker did. The Speaker said: I have got to \nhave my wife there, and she was there. I do not deny her the right. I \nam glad she was. She is a delightful woman, and I appreciated having \nthe chance to have her on the airplane and for her to experience what \nwe experienced. However, it makes all the more petty, all the more \ndemeaning this whole affair. I do not understand it. And so, Mr. \nPresident, I must say that for him to be using this, given the facts, \nis absolutely incredible.\n  And then to go beyond just the grudge--the hunch. The hunch. \nYesterday morning, the Speaker was asked, on what do you base your \ncalculation that this has to be done in 7 years? What is it about 7 \nyears that you think really drives the need to have a balanced budget \nin that timeframe? The question was, what do you base it on? His \nanswer? Intuition. Intuition. That is my answer. That is how it is that \nwe have concluded a 7-year balanced budget is the right number of \nyears.\n  As my colleagues have said and as the Wall Street Journal says again \nthis morning, maybe it is time to privatize these economic projections. \nI hear arguments on the other side that we ought to privatize \neverything. Well, there have been seven economic analyses. The CBO is \nthe most conservative of the seven. In 1993, they were so conservative \nthey were $100 billion off in 2 years--$100 billion. And now we are \nsaying we have to use these conservative estimates as we project for \nthe next 7 years in spite of the fact--and I hope everyone just thinks \nabout this for a minute. It is one of the most inexplicable \ninconsistencies. Maybe our Republican colleagues can enlighten me \nhere--our economic growth for the last 25 years has been 2.5 percent, \n2.5 percent.\n  CBO is projecting economic growth for the next 7 years at 2.3 \npercent. But we are told--and I think there is a mutual agreement--that \nif we balance the budget, if we do all the things that we should be \ndoing to spur economic growth, it should be more, not less, than what \nit has been historically. It ought to be more than 2.3 percent. So what \nthe Republican majority is apparently telling us is that we are going \nto go through all the pain, all the difficult choices, all these \ncircumstances so that we can enjoy a growth rate less than what we have \nenjoyed for the last 25 years.\n\n  Mr. President, somebody smarter than I has to explain why the \nAmerican people should buy that. Everyone is entitled to buy their own \nprojections but somebody ought to explain that to the American people. \nAnd again I go back to whether or not----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield when I finish. I will be happy to yield to \nthe Senator from Alaska as soon as I finish my train of thought.\n  I will stand by whatever we may ultimately agree to here, but let us \nbe real. Let us be honest. The Government does not have a monopoly on \ngood numbers. If the private sector is telling us not once, not twice, \nbut on five different analyses done about economic growth in the \nfuture, if they are all telling us, look, you are missing something \nhere, we think it is a lot better because of what you have been doing, \nit is going to be a lot better than 2.3 percent, why not consider it? \nWhy not think about it? Why not privatize economic growth? If we are \nprivatizing everything else, let us privatize this, too. Because if we \nprivatize it, we are going to be in a lot better position to better \nunderstand the implications of all this than we are right now.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what this is about. I am very, very \ndisappointed that we have not been able to resolve our differences on \nthe continuing resolution at least. We will have more to say about the \nbalanced budget, but let me just emphasize we have all voted for a \nbalanced budget. Many of us have voted for a balanced budget in 7 \nyears. But to say under any condition you just have to accept the fact \nthat it is going to be 7 years and we will fill in all the blanks later \nmakes me very, very skeptical, frankly.\n  The Republicans have been very uneasy about the fine print in that 7 \nyears, and now we want to get on to the large print. I think we have to \ngo back to the fine print and look at exactly what we are talking about \nin 7 years. I hope we can agree to 7 years at some point. But if we do \nor if we do not, before we are called upon to vote on a 7-year budget, \nI hope everyone understands it is like buying a house from the curb. We \nlook at it from a distance and it looks like a nice house. It looks \nlike a great house. But what happens when you walk inside? Is it a \nmoney pit? Is it a house of horrors? What will that house include? Does \nit have a roof? Does it have a basement? What will be the definition of \nthis house? What will be the design?\n\n  That is something we are going to start working on tomorrow. As early \nas tomorrow the reconciliation package will be before us. If we have \nsome concern about what this house looks like, maybe it is for good \nreason, because we have already seen the Senate-passed and the House-\npassed reconciliation bills. We know what they look like. We know that \nthey cut $270 billion out of Medicare for tax cuts totaling over $200 \nbillion. We know that. We know they cut over $185 billion out of \nMedicaid. We know that. We know they have made deep cuts in education.\n  There is a room we ought to look at. Let us walk into the education \nroom for a minute. There on one side of the room I see a lot of cuts \ndirectly affecting school programs. I see a loss of student loans to \ncollege students. I see a whole array of losses in the education room \nthat I am not prepared to accept.\n  Then I walk into the working person's room, and I find dramatic cuts \nin the earned-income tax credit, almost a complete demolition of the \nEITC.\n  So the more I walk through this house, Mr. President, I have to tell \nyou it is a house of horrors, and that is why we are very skeptical \nabout whether or not signing on to this house from the curb makes a lot \nof sense to us regardless--regardless--of whether or not we agree on an \namendment by a date certain.\n  I know a lot of people have asked to speak, and the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska sought recognition for purposes of yielding for a \nquestion. I will be happy to do that. Let me just again state my motive \nhere. \n\n[[Page S 17119]]\n\n  Our motive is simply to say let us have that debate tomorrow. Let us \nhave it on Friday when reconciliation comes. Let us get into next week \nif we have to, but let us at least agree that the thousands of people--\nthe thousands of people--who are not getting the services that they \nexpect from their Government, services they have paid for in their hard \nearned taxes, that at least that much we can agree on, that we are \ngoing to give those services back to the people who expect them. This \namendment provides that. And I hope it will enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Alaska \nsince he sought recognition first.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I listened with interest to the leader on the other side \nof the aisle. There are two questions I have. There are two parts to \nthe resolution that is before us: One deals with recognizing the \neconomics through the CBO, and the other deals with the date, 7 years.\n  Could the leader tell me what has happened since the President of the \nUnited States stood before us in joint session, and said, ``I'm going \nto rely on the CBO, and ask you to rely on the CBO. Let's get out of \nthis business of having different numbers.''\n  My memory is the Democratic side of the aisle cheered very wildly at \nthat time. What has happened since that time, since the President asked \nus to rely on the CBO?\n  Second, my memory is that the President's group that was put together \non Medicare said that Medicare would be bankrupt by 2002, that the 7 \nyears came from the Medicare report. And it was the President himself \nin the first instance that said we should do it within 7 years.\n  What has happened to change the position of the people on the other \nside of the aisle from what the President asked us to do, rely on CBO, \nand what the President's people predicted, that unless we act that \nMedicare fund will itself be bankrupt by 2002? That is the reason for \nthe 7 years. What has been the change, Mr. Leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to answer both questions of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. And they are good questions.\n  The first question: I think it is fair to say our confidence has been \nshaken a little bit when any Government agency happens to make, in a 2-\nyear timeframe, a $100 billion mistake--$100 billion. We said, ``We're \ngoing to listen to you, but I hope you're going to be right. And if you \nare not right, would it not make sense to go back and find whether or \nnot there is a better way to calculate whether, as we make one of the \nmost important decisions regarding our spending for the next 7 years, \nthat we not use numbers that are more accurate?'' If we are off $100 \nbillion in 2 years, what is that calculated for 7? How much more off \nare we going to be in 7 years?\n  So that is the first question. He assumed they could calculate, that \nthey could give us an accurate assumption of what we were going to be \nexperiencing for 2 years. But to be off $100 billion, that sounds like \nanother governmental agency that needs some work.\n  The answer to the second question is, yes, absolutely we have got to \nsolve the Medicare bankruptcy problem, the problem involving the trust \nfund. But nothing we are talking about here does that. If we are going \nto solve the problem with regard to the trust fund, we have only got to \ndeal with part A, and for that we need $89 billion. And, of course, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska has read the same trustees' report \nthat we have. The trustees say, ``You're going to need $89 billion.''\n  That begs the question, why in the Republican budget do we need $181 \nbillion more than the $89 billion? Why the $270 billion? We know why \nthe $270 billion, because $181 billion of that $270 billion is going \nfor the tax cut, to pay for $200 billion-plus in handouts to those that \ndo not need them. Those are the best answers I can give to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota was seeking to ask a \nquestion. I yield to him.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would ask the Senator from South Dakota if he was aware \nthat the Wall Street Journal this morning has endorsed the President's \neconomic assumptions? Was the Senator from South Dakota aware that this \nmorning the Wall Street Journal has said the estimates of both CBO and \nOMB are overly pessimistic, that both of them are wrong? Based on what? \nBased on what has actually happened the last 2 years.\n  I would just ask the ranking member of the Budget Committee, who has \nbrought charts that show the actual results the last 2 years, that \ndemonstrate CBO and OMB have both been wrong with respect to what has \nactually occurred with economic growth, have both been wrong with \nrespect to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee, because it is directly relevant to the Senator \nfrom Alaska's question. Perhaps he can explain the chart.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Alaska----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from--\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, who retains the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader retains the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Alaska's question was a very good one, and \nthis chart answers it directly. I am confident that the Senator from \nAlaska did not know about this. He seems to think that the projections \nof both CBO and OMB are infallible. This chart indicates the opposite \nand indicates and answers the question of what has happened to \nprojections.\n  You will note on this particular chart that President Clinton \ndelivers on deficit reduction. When we passed----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  Mr. EXON. Would you kindly direct the Senator from Pennsylvania to \nfollow the rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor and may \nonly yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Which is what I did. I yielded to the Senator from \nNebraska for a question. Part of the question involves an explanation \nof a chart for which I hope to give an answer as soon as the \nexplanation is complete.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask this question of the Democratic leader? Was the \nDemocratic leader aware, as a response to the question asked by the \nSenator from Alaska, that the reason that we are questioning these \nprojections are that this chart showed very clearly that after the \nPresident's deficit-reduction bill, which was projected by both CBO and \nOMB to be in the range of $275 billion, very close, actually the \ndeficit reduced dramatically less than that, clear down to the $175 \nbillion level? Was the Democratic leader aware of that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was not aware of it. And I appreciate the Senator from \nNebraska's explanation.\n  Mr. EXON. One more thought that maybe the Senator from Alaska or the \nDemocratic leader indicated----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska for another \nquestion.\n  Mr. EXON. Was the Democratic leader aware, on the projection idea, as \nto what economic growth has come about? Economic growth is what the \narticle that has been referred to by many Senators this morning with \nregard to the Wall Street Journal--the economic growths that were \npredicted both by OMB and CBO, as a result of the President's actions, \ncame at this level. Notice they are almost parallel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would remind the Senator from \nNebraska that the Democratic leader has yielded for the purpose of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. EXON. I am asking a question. I am asking a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It did not appear to be.\n  Mr. EXON. I am asking if the majority leader knew that, in addition \nto the other chart, on this particular chart the numbers were far, far \nmore than either CBO or OMB had estimated? \n\n[[Page S 17120]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nebraska makes the point in his \nquestion, and I think it goes to the very issue raised by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. They have both been too conservative, not accurate; \nand as a result, they miss the mark by more than $100 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know the Senator from Mississippi has been seeking \nrecognition for purposes of a question. I yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  My question is this: The Democratic leader's amendment seeks to \nextend the time for the continuing resolution. My question is whether \nyou support the continuing resolution with this change and would \nrecommend that the President sign it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would recommend--I am not sure I understand the \nquestion completely. But if the Senator is asking, would I recommend to \nthe President to sign a clean resolution taking us through December 22, \nmy answer is, of course, yes. I would hope he would sign it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My understanding is that the amendment the distinguished \nleader has offered has simply extended the date of the resolution, as \noffered, to well over into December rather than----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My question is, if this amendment is adopted, that we \nvote for it, would you recommend it to the President?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, he would. He would sign it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Without any change in the content of the resolution?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My amendment modifies their resolution to take out any \nother references, to take out balanced budgets, to any of the other \nintentions----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thought it was just changing the date.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No. No. I apologize.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is taking out all of the language in the \nresolution completely?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I said, I describe this as a clean resolution, a \nresolution that allows us to debate the question of a balanced budget \non a time certain, beginning tomorrow during the reconciliation, when \nwe should. This simply says, let us pass a resolution through December \n22 at the level of funding we established in the previous continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. But not making any commitment to achieve a balanced \nbudget?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We can make a--absolutely. We would certainly make a \ncommitment. The question is, does it have to be written in as a \nlanguage specific to CBO as part of the CR, the continuing resolution?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. And if I could ask.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield again to the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Does your amendment say there will be a balanced budget \nin 7 years, that that is the commitment that is being made by the \nDemocrats to achieve a balanced budget in 7 years?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sorry the distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nwas not listening to my remarks, because I thought I made it very \nclear. I will be happy to clarify one more time.\n  We support a balanced budget by a date certain. Many of us could even \nsupport a 7-year balanced budget under the right set of circumstances, \nbut we have to know what the house looks like from the inside, not just \nthe outside. And while we are looking at the house, I think it is \nimportant that the services of Government continue to be provided.\n  That is what this does. It allows us to have a good debate about a \nbalanced budget, with all of its ramifications, including Medicare and \ntax cuts, something you heard us talk about a lot, all of that \nbeginning tomorrow, but it allows the Government to continue to run, as \nwe expect it to run, through December 22.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand the leader's position, the examination \nof the rooms within this house--the education room, the Medicare room, \nMedicaid room, so forth--should take place in the course of considering \nthe reconciliation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Exactly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the package under which that examination takes \nplace; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that examination should take place in a \ncircumstance in which a gun is not being held at the head of the people \nconducting the examination by virtue of closing down the Government and \nterminating all these services. This is a coercive measure which has no \nplace----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I call the Senator on rule XIX.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In our consideration; is that not the leader's view?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me ask the leader one other question on these \nestimate figures. Is the leader aware that the blue chip consensus, \nwhich is derived from a monthly survey of 50 private sector \nforecasters, disagrees with CBO and, in fact, agrees with OMB on the \nforecast? So the private sector forecasters, in effect, do not validate \nthe CBO projections; they agree with the OMB projections. Is the leader \naware of that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was aware of that, and the Senator is right to point \nit out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And furthermore, the CBO projections have been notably \nshort in recent times----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I call the Senator under rule XIX.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In terms of hitting the mark with respect to the growth \nfigures; is that not correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It had been represented a little earlier this morning that \nthere are only two parts of the resolution before us that came over \nfrom the House. On one part, we are told that there is a commitment to \na 7-year balanced budget, and the other part is that CBO figures would \nbe used. Is it not true that those two parts are only part of title \nIII, which represents less than one page of the CR that came over from \nthe House, and that the other 14 pages contain other significant \nchanges, including 40-percent reductions in low-income home energy \nassistance; 40-percent reductions during this CR period of 18 days of \ndrug elimination grants; 40-percent reductions of housing for severely \ndistressed folks; VA construction cuts of 40 percent; 40-percent cuts \nduring this period of impact----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator from Michigan \nthat the leader has yielded only for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am in the middle of a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was not certain about that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not also true that this same document that came over \nfrom the House, in addition to the two parts of title III that have \nbeen referred to, contain 40-percent cuts in dozens of programs during \nthis period of the continuing resolution?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is accurate. That is the case. As the \nresolution has been presented, not only does it address the issue of \nwhether or not we ought to be confined by numbers which have been \ndemonstrated to be extraordinarily erroneous over the last 2 years, but \nwe are also compelled to vote for dramatic, draconian, extreme cuts in \ncurrent funding levels.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to abuse my floor privileges. I know \nothers have sought recognition.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I ask the Senator a brief question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield for a brief question from the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Which will require only a very brief answer. My \nquestion to the minority leader is as follows: Is the Senator aware \nthat right now some of these programs, like the Low-Income Energy \nAssistance Program, which my colleague from Pennsylvania has been a \nvery strong advocate for, the funding is not getting out to the cold \nweather States, and for those States this is an issue right now? \n\n[[Page S 17121]]\n\n  Is the Senator aware that on this continuing resolution, as my \ncolleague from Michigan just stated, we are talking about only 60-\npercent funding of a very minimum amount nationwide?\n  And, finally, is the Senator aware--can I please put this in human \nterms--that as a matter of fact, if we keep this up here, there are \npeople who could go cold and freeze to death? That could happen. Is the \nSenator aware of that? That is not melodramatic. Is the Senator aware \nthat that could happen?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My answer to the Senator from Minnesota is yes, I am \naware of that, and that is the reason we are offering this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Can we agree to vote on this amendment or on a motion to \ntable this amendment, say, at 12:45?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be willing to enter into that \nagreement, as long as we have the understanding it is either a tabling \nmotion or up or down; that it is not subject to second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And equally divide the time. I will say, we will not offer \na second-degree amendment. That will give each side additional time to \ndebate. I understand there is one additional amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, the Senator from South Carolina has \nasked for the opportunity to offer an amendment, and he would be \nwilling to commit to a relatively short timeframe. So I think it would \nbe three amendments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me indicate, I have been here since 9:30--we all \nhave--and I am not complaining about it, but I do not want any \nagreement, I say to the distinguished leader, to forego the chance to \noffer an amendment sometime today and a fair chance to debate it as \nrelative to the unified budget versus using Social Security funds.\n  We just voted on Monday not to use Social Security funds. Now today \nit appears by the resolution--and I want to be able to correct it with \nan amendment--we are going to use Social Security trust funds to \nbalance the budget, and that is just a one-line amendment. I have it \ndrawn, as the Parliamentarian has indicated, where I can present it \nagain and again and again, second degreed or perfecting or otherwise. \nThat is why I am stating this so the majority leader understands the \nintent of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DOLE. It was impressed on me, which is why I did not file cloture \nlast night, that there would be two amendments offered today. More can \nbe offered. If that is the case, I may get my cloture motion out. If we \nare going to shut the Government down by filibuster or offering \namendments throughout the day, then do not blame this side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand the majority leader's concern. There is \nabsolutely no interest in filibustering this bill. We would agree to \ntime agreements on each of these amendments, as I have indicated. I \nwill enter into those time agreements whenever it is appropriate. We \nalready have a time agreement on the first amendment, and we will do so \non the second and third as well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be glad to enter into a time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield just for a comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. You can take the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the minority leader yield time? The \nminority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I am recognized, I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader can yield for a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Because of the time agreement, I understand, I will \nyield such time as he may require to the Senator from North Dakota. As \nI indicated, it is not our desire to monopolize the floor. There have \nbeen people waiting on both sides. I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota for a question.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand it, we do have an agreement there will be a \nvote on or in relation to the pending amendment at 12:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. And that time is equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Was that unanimous-consent agreement entered into?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 10 minutes of that time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, after the exchange between the minority \nleader and the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Republican leader. I was going to alert the \nleaders that I, too, have an amendment on which I would be happy to \ntake a short-time agreement. But I think it is important that an \nadditional amendment be offered. I would like the time to do that. I \nwould be happy to take a short-time agreement to do so.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, we will work that out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield me 30 seconds to make a \npoint?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to put this in the Record. The \nGovernment private forecast, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, on GDP \ngrowth for 1995 was 2.5 percent. The CBO forecast was 1.3 percent, \nwhich fell way short of what the actual growth has been over that \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been on the floor for a \nconsiderable period of time and on my feet, and I had called Senators \nto order under rule XIX, where there had been a succession of \nquestions, which I think, fairly stated, really went beyond a question. \nThe rules of the Senate do not permit any Senator, even a leader, to \nyield to another Senator on the floor for anything other than a \nquestion. The proceedings went far beyond a question. I just wanted to \nmake that explanatory statement as to why I was on my feet seeking \nrecognition and seeking that the rules of the Senate be complied with, \nso that others might have an opportunity to seek recognition.\n  As I have listened to this debate, Mr. President, I am reminded of \nthe statement by a very distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith, who made the distinction between the principle of \ncompromise and the compromise of principle.\n  As I listen to this debate, we are not talking about first amendment \nissues. We are talking about dollars and cents and some sort of an \naccommodation. I heard the question raised by the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, about low-income energy assistance and \nhow it was not being provided to the poor people of America. And he \nmade a reference to what this Senator had been trying to do. I think \nthat characterizes the situation on the Senate floor, where we have a \nbill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the \nsubcommittee which I chair, which has not been brought to the floor \nbecause there is a filibuster effort by the Democrats on a provision \nrelating to striker replacement. I do not say that in the context of \nfixing blame on the Democrats, necessarily, because that provision is a \nsubstantive provision added on to an appropriation bill by Republicans \nand we really ought not to use the appropriations process for \nsubstantive provisions which are contested.\n  I think that is what has happened now when we have had the Government \nshut down for 2 days, and we have had many, many Americans \ninconvenienced. There has been a recitation of the people who have been \ninconvenienced--the Social Security beneficiaries cannot apply, and the \nveterans, and the situation with passports, and immigration issues, and \nvisitors.\n  I received a call yesterday from my hometown of Philadelphia, where \npeople cannot go to Independence Hall, and they are saying, ``What is \ngoing on down there?''\n  Mr. President, I believe we are witnessing a real spectacle in the \nCongress \n\n[[Page S 17122]]\nfor the last 2 days. What we have been seeing over the past several \nyears has really been a demise of democracy. When I first ran for \npublic office, not too long ago, 70 to 75 percent of the people of \nPhiladelphia came out to vote in a mayoral election. Last week, we had \nan election in Philadelphia, and less than half of the people came out \nbecause of the disillusionment, disenchantment with what is happening \nin Washington, DC, inside this beltway, and really around America in \nthe political process. What is happening here--and it is no surprise \nand it is understandable, in a sense--is this maneuvering for political \nadvantage.\n  I suggest to my colleagues, both in the Congress and in the executive \nbranch, that nobody is getting any political advantage now. This is not \na win-win situation, this is a lose-lose situation for everybody. When \nSenators come to the floor and decry the issue of political advantage \nand go on and on about what the Speaker's wife did as a passenger on an \nairplane, that is hardly going to the issue of what we are trying to do \nto solve this crisis in Government and this crisis in confidence.\n  Mr. President, what is really involved here is a question of \npriorities. I think it is far beyond the issue of pique. I think people \ndo not understand really how tired everybody is in Washington and how \ntired everybody is around the country about what is going on in \nWashington. But we have late-night sessions, and many of the people \njust went to Israel for the sad funeral of Prime Minister Rabin--16 \nhours over and 16 hours back. There is a certain sense of exhaustion \nwhich is working here. We certainly do not want the American people to \nthink that the Government is being run out of a sense of pique or out \nof a sense of grudge. What we are boiling down to here, Mr. President, \nI think, is a crystallization of the issues which have to be decided at \nthe next election.\n  The issue of a balanced budget is one where a lot of lip service is \nbeing given on both sides of the aisle. But I suggest that the record \nis reasonably clear--and it is hard to have a reasonably clear record \non anything in Washington, DC--that it is pretty much a party issue, \nwith every Republican, except one, voting for a balanced budget \namendment. And on the Democrat side of the aisle, there was substantial \ndisagreement with six Senators last year in favoring a balanced budget \namendment, and now not favoring it.\n  The President of the United States--and not in a harsh rhetoric \nsense--opposes a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. We may \nbe clarifying an issue here about having the 7-year timeframe for a \nbalanced budget amendment, as postulated on this continuing resolution. \nIt is my hope that President Clinton will sign a continuing resolution \nthat has two qualifications. One is a 7-year time limit, which, on \noccasion, he has endorsed, and a second on figures from the \nCongressional Budget Office, which, again, on occasion, he has \nendorsed.\n  Of course, you can raise arguments as to anything on any issue at any \ntime, anyplace, especially around here. But those are not unreasonable \nconditions to move ahead with a continuing resolution, to get the \nGovernment back in operation. If the President decides not to sign that \ncontinuing resolution, then I think we have to come to terms, leave the \nissue for the 1996 election in fairly crystal form, and get this \nGovernment running again.\n  If we come back to basic principles, we all agree that the Congress \npasses legislation which has to be signed by the President, unless \nthere are two-thirds of each body of the House and Senate that will \noverride a Presidential veto. And if we have a gridlock, if the \nPresident is adamant, for whatever reason, and if the Congress is \nadamant, for whatever reason--and I think the American people see it as \na lot of political posturing on both sides and are saying ``a plague on \nboth of your houses''--why cannot the Congress of the United States \ncome to terms? This is not freedom of religion; this is not due process \nof law; these are dollars and cents which, customarily, have been \nsplit. If we cannot split them, let us crystallize the issue for the \n1996 election. But let us not tie up the Government of the United \nStates in the context where we all look so foolish.\n  Yesterday, I had my regular weekly radio news conference, and the \nonly question asked was about the stalemate in Washington and the \ngridlock. I said, candidly, that it was an embarrassment. It was \nembarrassing to be a Senator when what is happening in Washington, DC, \ngoes on without any resolution. So I hope, Mr. President, in the first \ninstance, that President Clinton will accept this continuing \nresolution. It is not too onerous.\n\n  There is no commitment as to what is going to appear in all of the \nrooms discussed by my colleagues within the 7 years. I have been on the \nfloor of this body objecting to the tax cuts at a time when we are \nseeking to balance the budget and to tighten our belts and we are \nasking people to take cuts in programs. I have the chairmanship of the \nappropriations subcommittee covering three big departments:\n  Education--where we have added $1.6 billion on a Republican bill \nwhich is being filibustered by the Democrats. Again, I do not question \nit, really, because a substantive measure was added on striker \nreplacement.\n  Health and Human Services--both the House and the Senate have agreed \nto add substantial funds to the National Institutes of Health on their \nimportant research projects. That is being held up because of the \nbickering. Certainly the President would agree to sign that.\n  And we cover the Department of Labor. Our subcommittee came back in \non a $70 billion discretionary budget and cut $8 billion with a scalpel \ninstead of a meat ax in a way which satisfied the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has worked with me on that subcommittee.\n  So we really ought to come to terms here. If there is a limitation of \n7 years, it does not say that is going to be done to any one of the \ndepartments. There is plenty of time to object at a later stage.\n  I hope the President will sign a continuing resolution with these two \nrelatively modest limitations. If that does not happen, Mr. President, \nI hope we heed the words of Margaret Chase Smith and distinguish \nbetween what is the principle of compromise as opposed to the \ncompromise of principle and recognize that our Constitution gives the \nPresident the veto power and a dominant role, or at least an equal \npartnership role, unless we have two-thirds to override--which we do \nnot--so that we can end the charade, get the Government going, and \ncrystallize that issue for the 1996 election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had talked to the distinguished \nranking member on the other side of the aisle and asked for 10 minutes \nbut he is not here so I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Pennsylvania talks about the \nresolution without smoke and without mirrors.\n  Let me point to the smoke and let me point to the mirrors. It says \nhere on the last page about commitment to a 7-year balanced budget: \n``The President and the Congress shall enact legislation to achieve a \nunified balanced budget.''\n  Now you have the smoke. Now you have the mirrors. This is exactly \nwhat the U.S. Senate on Monday--today is only Thursday--exactly what \nthe U.S. Senate on Monday voted 97-2 against, this smoke, this mirror.\n  Let me quote, since the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is \nhere, our late colleague, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator John Heinz.\n\n       Since 1983, when we may have saved the Social Security \n     goose, we have systematically proceeded to melt down and pawn \n     the golden egg. It doesn't take a financial wizard to tell us \n     that spending these reserves on today's bills does not bode \n     well for tomorrow's retirees.\n\n  I quote another statement from Senator John Heinz:\n\n       The truth is that Congress, by counting the old-age, \n     survivors and disability income trust funds as part of \n     general revenues, radically distorts the actual financial \n     health of this Nation by pretending that the money paid in by \n     workers to Social Security will never be paid out.\n\n  Stating further:\n\n       Mr. President, in all the great jambalaya of frauds \n     surrounding the budget, surely the most reprehensible is the \n     systematic and total ransacking of the Social Security trust \n     fund in order to mask the true size of the deficit.\n\n  Now, that is exactly, Mr. President, why I have an amendment at the \ndesk \n\n[[Page S 17123]]\nwhich I will call later in its due time. We have the amendment on the \ndate of December 22, which I favor, but I thank the distinguished \nleadership for yielding me this time because here on Monday, here on \nMonday, the distinguished leader stated, when we read in here that ``on \nthe Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995, the U.S. Congress agrees to \nhonor section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 so as not to \ninclude in the conference any language that violates that section.''\n  Now, what does that section that Senator Heinz had enacted back and \nsigned into law on November 5, 1990, say? I ask unanimous consent that \nsection 13301 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In order to vote for the resolution you have to vote to \nviolate the law. They know it. That is the smoke and that is the \nmirror.\n  On Monday, they agreed--in fact, the Senator from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee talking now about ``unified'' stated \nat the time we passed the Heinz-Hollings-Moynihan amendment, ``I \nsupport taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation . \n. .'' Again, on Monday, he voted that way.\n  It reminds me, Mr. President, of a contest that we had for an \ninsurance company and they wanted a slogan for the new insurance \ncompany. The winning slogan we finally got was, ``The Capital Life will \nsurely pay if the small print on the back don't take it away.''\n  Now, Mr. President, that is the gamesmanship you see here. That is \n$636 billion. This is a problem not of technicalities. It is real. For \nwe, at the present moment, owe Social Security $481 billion. Pass this \nGOP budget and you will use again another $636 billion.\n  So, come the year 2002 we will say, ``Oops, what a smart boy am I. I \nhave made solvent Medicare but, oh, heavens above, I have forced Social \nSecurity into bankruptcy. I owe $1 trillion and there is nobody around \nready to raise $1 trillion worth of taxes to make the IOU sound.''\n  Let me look at the morning paper here and see exactly what it says. \nIt says:\n\n       Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced plans \n     yesterday to pull $61.3 billion from two Federal retirement \n     accounts, an unprecedented fiscal move he said was necessary \n     to save the U.S. Government from the first default in its \n     history.\n       He authorized withdrawal of the entire $21.5 billion held \n     in a Federal savings plan known as the G-fund, and as much as \n     $39.8 billion of the $350 billion in the Civil Service \n     retirement fund. In effect, both funds would be given a \n     temporary IOU that would obligate Treasury to make complete \n     repayment with interest after a permanent increase in the \n     debt limit is finally approved.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, that is my point. We should reduce deficits. We \nshould eliminate deficits. We should not move deficits. You move them \nfrom the general fund over to the Social Security trust fund. Or as the \nSecretary of the Treasury did yesterday, you move it from the general \nfund over into the Civil Service retirement fund. That moving around is \nabsolute trickery and is putting us in such a position that we are no \nlonger allowed the luxury of children and grandchildren arguments. We \nwill get it through the neck here in about 2 years.\n  We owe, this minute, trust funds $1.255 trillion--right this minute. \nIf we continue to spend now under this so-called continuing resolution, \na unified budget, then we really are going to be up a creek.\n  Let me tell you who loves this--Wall Street. The financial market. I \ntalked to one of them just earlier this week. They love a unified \nbudget.\n  Why? Theirs is to make money. And so if you can borrow around from \nthe other Government funds there is less of a burden of borrowing on \nthe New York stock exchange. When we come in for borrowing funds, with \nthe sharp elbows of Government, we shove away other capital investment. \nThey love that. But we have the responsibility of running the \nGovernment, not of making money.\n\n  This thing was, perhaps, a good idea at one time. But now we have \ncome with the contract and the revolution that says we are not going to \nhave business as usual. We are going to have change.\n  Do not tell me what Presidents have done, what this President will \ndo. Tell us what we will do to not have business as usual. Namely, \nadhere to the law--adhere to the principle and policy of not using the \ntrust funds.\n  That is why there is a lack of trust in Government, if the youngsters \ncoming along see that you are frittering away their retirement funds. I \nlose trust myself. So there is no mystery to this thing. Let us have an \nhonest budget, without smoke and without mirrors. Let us get right down \nto the idea, here, that we are not using the Social Security trust \nfund. It is against the law to do it.\n  On October 18, if you refer to the Congressional Record, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee stood on the Senate \nfloor and he said here: I have the certificate, certified of this GOP \nbudget, and we have a $10 billion surplus.\n  When we reminded her of the law--would you think you would have to \nremind a Congressional Budget Office Director of the law? Once reminded \nof the law, June O'Neill, the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, came and said, ``Oops, I am sorry. You have a $105 billion \ndeficit.'' So they went from a $10 billion surplus, in 48 hours, to a \n$105 billion deficit.\n  And they talk about CBO figures. That is what destroys the trust in \nCBO. Because they have gamesmanship there. But let us not have \ngamesmanship here.\n  We all voted on Monday to stop the gamesmanship with the Social \nSecurity trust funds. Let us again vote for this amendment when it \ncomes up that says: Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \nresolution, the 7-year balanced budget passed by the Congress to the \nPresident shall not include Social Security trust funds to reduce or \napply to the deficit--to effect or obtain a balance.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator from North Carolina yield for just 30 \nseconds while the majority leader is on the floor so we can maybe move \nto some kind of tentative agreement?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Charge it to my time.\n  I advise the Senate that as far as I am able to ascertain at this \ntime on this side of the aisle, we have the amendment pending, offered \nby the minority leader. There will be a second amendment by the \nminority leader, and there will be an amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I would simply say at this time, in order to give us some idea of \nwhere we are going, we want to move in an expeditious fashion. How much \ntime, when we get to the amendment that will be offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, how much time does he think he would need to \nfurther explain his amendment, in addition to the time he has just \nused?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator indicates an hour, a half-hour to a side, \njust on this amendment. \n\n[[Page S 17124]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. I ask the majority leader, are there any amendments or \nsecond-degree amendments that he is aware of on his side of the aisle?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am not aware of any at this point.\n  Mr. EXON. I am simply saying, it seems to me--the majority leader \nrequested a while ago, and the minority leader indicated, too, we want \nto move expeditiously. It would appear to me that right now we are in a \nposition when we dispose of this at 12:45, we probably--maybe at that \ntime we may be in a position to frame some time agreements, short time \nagreements, and finish and have final passage on this sometime early in \nthe afternoon.\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope that is the case, because we would like to move to \nthe Defense Appropriations conference report. Then, tomorrow, of \ncourse, we will have the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  I do not know what happens after the CR goes to the White House, if \nit is vetoed, where we are as far as the Government is concerned. But I \nwill be happy to work with the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I am working with the minority leader. I think we are \nmaking some real progress.\n  I thank my friend from North Carolina for yielding.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that time not come out of the time of \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is charged to the minority.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \ncontinuing resolution for the very simple reason that all this \nresolution says is that the Federal Government can reopen if the \nPresident agrees to balance the budget in 7 years. It is that simple.\n  I want to read the precise language. It might have been read before \nthis morning, but it bears repeating.\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget not \n     later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the non partisan \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  This is all the Congress is asking for. We need a commitment from the \nPresident to this timetable.\n  I have to wonder when the President will begin worrying about the \ntaxpayers of this country and the children yet unborn. We are $5 \ntrillion in debt--$5 trillion. Twenty years ago our total debt was $595 \nbillion, and in 20 years we spent $4.5 trillion that we do not have.\n  It took us 200 years from the founding of this country until 1982 to \nbuild a $1 trillion debt. We have spent almost five times that much in \nthe last 12 years.\n  In the President's 1996 budget, 16 cents of every dollar will be \nspent to pay interest on the debt. What that equates to is 41 percent \nof all individual income taxes sent to the Government will be used to \npay interest--41 percent. Can we really keep taxing America's hard-\nearned money to pay interest and run a viable economy? No, we cannot. \nThis has to stop. If we do not do it now, it will never be done. Now is \nthe opportune time.\n  When he ran for President, President Clinton said he wanted to \nbalance the budget in 5 years. This does it in 7 years. But he made the \npromise 3 years ago. This is 10 years from the original promise, and he \nstill refuses to sign--says he is going to refuse to sign a 7-year \ncommitment to balance it.\n  When he ran for President, he said he wanted to cut taxes for the \nmiddle class. This budget does that.\n  When he ran for President, he said he wanted welfare reform and \nRepublicans in Congress are going to give him that. It should be clear \nthe Republicans in Congress are keeping their commitment to the \nAmerican people. Bill Clinton is not. But this should come as a \nsurprise to no one.\n  When he ran for Governor of Arkansas in 1990, he said he would not \nrun for President. If only he had kept that promise. If the President \nwas so concerned about having the Government closed, why has he chosen \nnot to negotiate? For 26 hours last week he was on the same plane with \nSpeaker Gingrich and majority leader Dole: No negotiation.\n  Finally, in a typical Washington political move, he offered to meet \nat 10 p.m., 2 hours before the Government shutdown. Not only a typical \nWashington, but a more typical Clinton maneuver.\n  I said 2 days ago this President is playing politics at its worst. \nInstead of doing something good for his country and the future of this \ncountry, he is concerned with the poll numbers. His political adviser, \nDick Morris, calls it triangulation. This means Clinton is supposed to \nappear moderate. Really, it is not triangulation; it is strangulation \nof the Federal Government by no leadership, no principles, and no \nnegotiation. The President is not serious. He is not accepting \nresponsibility. This Congress is.\n  We have to stop spending money we do not have. We have been doing it \nfor far too long now.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the President of the United States to \ncome to the table and work with the leadership of this Congress. He \nneeds to negotiate in good faith. He needs to negotiate for the good of \nthis country and its future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the ranking \nmember.\n  Republicans say they want to balance the budget in 7 years using CBO \nnumbers. The fact is the Republican plan does not balance the budget, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, this is a letter that I received on October 20, 1995, \nfrom the head of the Congressional Budget Office pointing out that, if \nwe obey the law--that is, we do not count Social Security trust funds \nin the calculation--the Republican plan has a $105 billion deficit in \n2002. Why is that? It is because the only way the Republican plan \nachieves balance is to take every penny of Social Security trust fund \nmoney over the next 7 years.\n  The law--this is a copy of the law--specifically precludes that. \nNinety-eight Senators voted for this law.\n  This chart shows the looting of the Social Security trust funds that \nis going to occur, if we adopt what the Republicans call a balanced \nbudget by 2002. We are going to be taking $636 billion of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus in order to call it a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, that is not a balanced budget by law. It is not a \nbalanced budget by any serious economic standard.\n  Some say, ``Where is your alternative? Why don't the Democrats have \nan alternative?'' Very simply, Mr. President, we do. During the budget \nresolution, I offered what I called the fair share balanced budget \nplan. Thirty-nine Senate Democrats voted for it. It achieved more \ndeficit reduction by 2002 than the GOP plan. In fact, it achieved $100 \nbillion more of deficit reduction in that period than the GOP plan, and \nit achieved true balance in 9 years without counting the Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  At the same time, it had different priorities. It did not slash \nMedicare, Medicaid, or education. In fact, we restored more than $100 \nbillion of the $270 billion Republican cut to Medicare. We restored \nfull funding for student loans, and provided additional discretionary \nfunding for education at all levels. We had nutrition and agriculture \nrestored by $24 billion, and veterans restored $5 billion so that we \ncould have a better set of priorities.\n  But we did have savings out of the spending entitlements. We had $156 \nbillion of savings out of Medicare instead of the Republican plan of \n$270 billion. We also had savings out of Medicaid.\n  So we had savings out of the spending entitlements. But we also \nrecognized that the biggest entitlement of all is the tax entitlements. \nThe tax entitlements, as this chart shows, amount to $4 trillion over \nthe next 7 years. It is interesting to compare the tax entitlements--$4 \ntrillion over the next 7 years. The Republicans never want to talk \nabout the tax entitlements. They want to talk about the spending \nentitlements of Social Security. That is about $3 trillion over the \nnext 7 years. Medicare, that is about $2 trillion over the next 7 \nyears; Medicaid, $1 trillion. But the granddaddy of them all are the \ntax entitlements, $4 trillion.\n  In the Democratic plan we said, yes. Slow the growth of the spending \nentitlements, absolutely--Medicaid and \n\n[[Page S 17125]]\nMedicare. But also slow the growth of the tax entitlements to inflation \nplus 1 percent. That is fair. That asks everybody in our society to \ncontribute to deficit reduction. We don't just put middle class and \nworking families into the front lines in the battle to balance the \nbudget--we also ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to deficit \nreduction. That means no tax cut until we balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, we are going to be adding under the Republican plan \n$1.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 7 years. Why would we \nbe increasing that debt by borrowing money to give a tax reduction that \ndisproportionately goes to wealthiest among us?\n  Mr. President, we not only have the fair share plan that a group of \nDemocrats offered. We also have the common sense budget plan. On the \nquestion again of no tax cut, there is no tax cut because it makes no \nsense to be adding to the debt, to be digging the hole deeper before we \nstart filling it in.\n  On the question of the Congressional Budget Office versus OMB, I \nthink it is critically important to understand that the Wall Street \nJournal this morning made reference to that in their editorial. They \nsaid, ``The Congressional Budget Office predicts over the next 7 years \n2.3 percent economic growth. OMB projects 2.5 percent.'' Listen to what \nthe Wall Street Journal says. ``In our view, both growth assumptions \nare overly pessimistic. Corporate profits look cheerful. There is no \nreason this economy should not grow at three percent in good years as \nit has through much of the past. Government policies, whether monetary \nor fiscal, should not be designed to foreclose this result.''\n  Why did the Wall Street Journal come to this conclusion? Because they \nhave looked at what actually happened over the last 2 years. And look \nat what has happened. This shows economic growth. The President's plan \nprojects on the blue line what economic growth would look like. The \nCongressional Budget Office is the red line. The orange line shows what \nhas actually happened. And what has really happened in the real world \nis both the Congressional Budget Office and OMB have been too \nconservative. They have been wrong.\n  What are the results? Look at the deficit reduction. The President's \nplan shows the blue line. That is what he was predicting. The red line \nshows what the Congressional Budget Office was predicting. The yellow \nline shows what has actually happened. Again, both the Congressional \nBudget Office and OMB have been wrong.\n  Let us break the gridlock. Let us agree to a plan to balance the \nbudget, but let us base it on the best estimates of private \nforecasters. Let us use the blue chip forecasters, and break the \ngridlock.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in condemning the situation that has brought us to the point \nwhere the Federal Government has shut down.\n  The American public should understand one thing about the shutdown: \nthis budget crisis is completely avoidable. It was manufactured by the \nHouse Speaker as a tactic to impose his extreme budget priorities on \nAmerica.\n  The Speaker's own words illustrate this point. Last April 3, he told \nreporters that he intended to ``create a titanic legislative standoff \nwith President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to must-pass \nlegislation.'' With the Speaker at the helm, Republicans have put the \nFederal budget on a collision course with the iceberg.\n  Congressional Republicans are in the majority in the House and \nSenate, which gives them the power and votes to keep the Government \noperating.\n  Instead, they have shut down the Government and are gambling with our \neconomy and credit rating, in a political game to force a heartless \nbudget on the American people.\n  Today we have an opportunity to end the budget impasse. Our \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, proposed a temporary funding \nresolution in an effort to get the Federal Government back to work. \nThis would have extended spending authority through December 22.\n  Unfortunately for the American public, the funding resolution that \nthe Democrats proposed was rejected, and the Government shutdown \norchestrated by the Speaker continues.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment provided the best opportunity to end the \nGovernment shutdown. This is an amendment that the President can sign. \nWe should pass the Daschle amendment, put an end to this crisis, and \nbegin the important work of negotiating a budget agreement.\n  How many thousands of veterans will be unable to submit new benefit \nclaims because VA offices remain closed?\n  How many Americans will be turned away from Social Security offices \naround the country because no Government workers are available to \nprocess their applications? How many millions of visitors must be \nturned away from our national parks, museums, and monuments before \nRepublicans in Congress will vote to end this stalemate and approve a \nclean funding resolution?\n  How many corporations will be unable to conduct business overseas \nbecause their executives cannot get their passports renewed?\n  The Republicans, led by the Speaker, have forced a political showdown \nat the expense of our needy, elderly, and veterans of our country. \nWhat's good about telling senior citizens who want to apply for Social \nSecurity or veterans trying to get their benefits processed that \nthey'll have to wait until the Government reopens?\n  I think it is important that we review the record of the Republican \nCongress on spending bills.\n  None of the 13 appropriation bills were passed by the September \ndeadline. All 13 of these bills should have been passed by September \n30. Because of this failure, a temporary spending bill is necessary to \nkeep the Government running.\n  Republicans are trying to use this manufactured funding crisis, which \nthey could easily have avoided, to force an increase in seniors' \nMedicare premiums and to provide tax breaks for wealthy Americans.\n  We should say no to political blackmail and yes to a clean CR.\n  And most importantly, let us get our people back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the majority \nleader has asked me to control the time on this side of the aisle.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nthis time, and I want to respond just briefly to the comments that were \njust made and make a couple of additional points.\n  This debate is about whether or not the President wishes to \nparticipate in balancing the budget--nothing else. Everything has been \ntaken off of this continuing resolution that the President originally \nobjected to. The only thing that is on this continuing resolution that \ndoes not involve day-to-day operation of the Government--remember, this \nresolution only runs for 19 days--the only thing that is on this \nresolution is a statement that the President will join with the 104th \nCongress in a commitment to balancing the budget by the year 2002 using \nthe Congressional Budget Office numbers. It does not say he has to \nagree to our approach to balancing the budget. If he wants to use the \ntwo proposals outlined by the Senator from North Dakota, he can do \nthat.\n  He can use either of those proposals if he wants to use them. And \nsome of the ideas put forward by the Senator from North Dakota may be \nideas upon which we could reach an agreement.\n  The point is that he has to agree initially. He has to make this \ninitial minor step, small, incremental progress of saying, hey, I wish \nto balance the budget, too.\n  That is all we are saying to the President. Just come forward and say \nI wish to balance the budget, too, in 7 years. Is that an outrageous \nrequest? I should not think so since he has already on a number of \noccasions said he wanted to balance it in 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 \nyears, 9 years. He has been at \n\n[[Page S 17126]]\nthis position once or twice before during his term of office. We are \njust asking him that he sort of settle out, settle out, on the idea of \n7 years. I think it is a reasonable request.\n  I do not think most Americans feel 7 years is an unreasonable period \nof time to get this financial house in order. I think most Americans \nlook at 7 years as maybe an excessive amount of time for us to get our \nfinancial house in order. They wonder why we cannot do it a little \nsooner, but we do not appear to be able to. So we said 7 years.\n  On the issue of whether or not we use CBO numbers, of course, the \nopposition to that really is a red herring because the President came \nto this Congress and he, in rather definitive terms, said he was \nwilling to use CBO numbers in his first statement to this body. And so \nthe opposition to that language is, I think, a bit of a sidetracking \nexercise because he has already agreed to that.\n  If the President wants--and the Senator from North Dakota mentioned \nthe tax issues in our budget--he can come up here with a balanced \nbudget which raises taxes. He can do it all with tax increases, and he \nwill be consistent with the language we have asked him to sign on to. \nWe have not said he had to do it by reducing the rate of growth of \nGovernment as we have proposed. We suggested that the rate of growth of \nGovernment not be cut. We have not done anything that draconian. We \nhave just suggested it grow at 3.3 percent annually, which is more than \nthe rate of growth of the economy.\n  We have suggested that Medicare be allowed to grow at 6.5 percent; \nthat Medicaid be allowed to grow at 4 percent; that senior citizens be \ngiven more choices for their health care options; that the States be \ngiven control over welfare, that people who are on welfare be allowed \nto only stay on it for 5 years during their lifetime, not be on there \nfor an entire experience of their working lifetime; that they be asked \nto go to work after a couple of years.\n  These were our suggestions for how you get to a balanced budget. But \nwe are not saying we have all the answers. If the President wants to \ncome up here with a new tax package as he did a year, 2 years ago, when \nhe proposed the largest tax package in history, as a way to get this \nbudget under control, if he wants to duplicate that event, so be it. \nThat is his option. Under this language, it would be consistent with \nthe proposal that we are asking for. All we are saying to the President \nis, sign on to a balanced budget. Agree that the budget must be \nbalanced.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator yields.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would just ask my colleague from New Hampshire, who I \nhave respect for on this issue, I think the Senator has made serious \nattempts to make serious proposals to reduce the deficit, and I would \nask him, if the President agreed to a 7-year timeframe for balancing \nthe budget but said to us, ``I would want to use the blue-chip private \nforecasters rather than CBO, because it turns out that they have been \nmore accurate over the last 2 years than has CBO or OMB,'' would the \nSenator from New Hampshire say that is an unacceptable position?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, what the Senator from New Hampshire----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator may not be able to say what his position is.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator an \nadditional minute to respond to the question of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would say that the President was off on a tangent, and a \ntangent which is really not necessary to be on because the President \nalready came up here once and said CBO is OK. In fact, he not only said \nit was OK, he demanded that we follow CBO.\n  I believe that his initial decision in that area was correct. I just \nwant to hold him to what his initial commitment was, that CBO should be \nthe scorer. I see no reason why we should not use CBO. They are going \nto be right sometimes, wrong sometimes. Blue chips are going to be \nright sometimes, wrong sometimes. But at least we are using one \nacceptable group. The CBO being the group both the President and \nourselves have used over the years, it seems reasonable we accept them. \nThen that standard is one we should all be comfortable with. But the \ncore issue, of course, is he has to agree to balancing the budget in 7 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my office, like most of the offices in this complex, \nhas been besieged with calls from constituents wanting to know why we \ncannot pass the necessary legislation to keep the Government operating. \nThese calls are not simply coming from people who work for the Federal \nGovernment. Most are from people who do not work for the Federal \nGovernment. They are not just from people who rely on Government \nservices and programs.\n  It is interesting that most of the people who call do not identify \nthemselves as Democrats or Republicans. They are just average Americans \nwhose greatest expectation of Government is that it operate to serve \nthe interests of the people, to operate in the interest of serving the \ntaxpayer. They are the kinds of people who pay their taxes. They play \nby the rules and vote for the person, not for the party. They want to \nknow why this standoff is occurring.\n  The answer is very simple. The Congress, which is controlled in the \nHouse and in the Senate by the Republican Party, has not allowed \nappropriations bills to go through this body. There are 13 \nappropriations bills, and they simply have not passed. Everyone knows \nthat the morning news said the transportation appropriations bill was \nsigned and 29,000 Federal workers reported for work today.\n  The reason Federal workers are not working today is because the \nappropriations bills have not been completed. I have been here going on \n14 years. There has never been anything like this.\n  When was the House supposed to pass their bills? By June 10. They \nsimply did not do it. They did not pass their bills on time, and, of \ncourse, if they do not pass their bills on time, there is no way the \nSenate can pass its bills on time. The House missed the deadline on \nevery appropriations bill.\n  We hear all this talk about personal responsibility. Well, what about \nresponsibility of the majority party that rules the House and Senate? \nDo they not have a responsibility to get us these bills so the \nGovernment does not shut down?\n  The deadlines missed by the House have caused the Senate \nAppropriations Committee to push back the dates on which they could and \nshould have considered these measures.\n  While the Senate is not bound by a similar deadline, it is required \nto complete action on these bills by the end of September. The Senate \nhas had more success than the House in meeting the deadlines, but it \nstill was doing the things at the 11th hour, and after we pass them, of \ncourse, there has to be a conference.\n  It has been a total lack of responsibility by the majority, that is, \nthe Republican Party controlling both bodies.\n  As of today, only four of these bills, maybe five, have been signed. \nI do not know what the latest report is. And why were these annual \nappropriations bills not passed on time? Let me tell you why they were \nnot passed on time. It is because they were stuffed with some of the \nmost controversial, radical proposals in the history of this body, in \nthe history of the other body.\n  Why do I say that? Rather than going through the ordinary legislative \nprocess, they wanted things like any charitable organization, a charity \nwould not be able to lobby Congress even if they paid for it with \nprivate funds. That held up two appropriations bills.\n  How is that for democracy? You cannot even come back here and talk to \nyour Representative even if you pay for it yourself. EPA, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 17 different regulations they wanted \npassed. They put them in appropriations bills. They could not pass \nthese laws changing environmental laws, food safety laws, safe drinking \nwater laws, and clean air laws through the normal course of \n\n[[Page S 17127]]\nbusiness. Instead, they engaged in a high stakes gamble.\n  In one of these bills, they completely rewrote the Housing Act in an \nappropriations bill. The crime bill, the Commerce-State-Justice bill--\nthey rewrote the crime bill. And abortions held up three bills. Now, \nMr. President, I am not an advocate of abortion, but this is not the \nway to do appropriations bills. Grazing, timber, drilling for oil, all \nissues that they could not get done in an ordinary legislative process, \nthey stuck on appropriations bills. They would force the President to \nsign legislation that the majority of Americans oppose for the sake of \nkeeping the Government operating.\n  This was apparent as far back as April. If you do not believe me, \nhere is what the Speaker of the House of Representatives said in April. \nHe vowed to ``create a titanic legislative standoff with President \nClinton by adding vetoed bills to must pass legislation increasing the \nnational debt ceiling.'' This is reported in the Washington Times \nnewspaper, April 3.\n  He also said, the President ``will veto a number of things, and we'll \nthen put them all on debt ceiling. And then he'll decide how big a \ncrisis he wants.''\n  This has been a planned crisis. It is a war, Mr. President, but it is \na war that is not being won by the Republicans. Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican political analyst, said yesterday on public radio:\n\n       If the United States budget deficit problem does represent \n     the fiscal equivalent of war--and maybe it does--then what we \n     are really looking at is one of the most flagrant examples of \n     war profiteering this century has ever seen.\n\n  That is what Kevin Phillips said. He said that the only people \nbenefiting are the people with money with this debt crisis. And that is \ntoo bad.\n  We continued to learn today why the Speaker is allowing this standoff \nto continue. It is not even any longer for scoring political points. It \nis about ruffled feathers and perceived slights. Remember, he did not \nget to sit in the front of the airplane when they went to Israel to the \nfuneral of Prime Minister Rabin. He indicated, it is part of why they \nended up sending down a tougher interim spending bill. And he is quoted \nas saying, ``it's petty * * * but I think it's human.'' He has made the \nCR tougher because he did not get to ride where he wanted to in the \nairplane going to Israel. Mr. President, I respectfully submit this is \njust plain petty.\n  I return to my point that all this could have been avoided if we had \ndone our job and the majority allowed us to vote on appropriations \nbills. We failed to do that. Now we are at a crisis point. If all this \nwas part of some master plan, it is truly sad, it is truly sad. And \neven if it was due to simply a lack of diligence or negligence, it is \nalso not excusable. Thousands and thousands of Federal workers are now \nsitting idle at home because the Speaker feels he was slighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Nevada that \nhis time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that I be yielded 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. This not only affects Federal workers, Mr. President, it \naffects other people, because they, the Federal workers, buy groceries \nand clothes and cars, and they use the services of small \nbusinesspeople. It also, in the short term and especially the long \nterm, is going to hurt the American business community.\n\n  This Senator suggests that the Speaker begin to consider the feelings \nof thousands of public servants and the people that depend on those \npublic servants' paychecks. I think it is important that he consider \ntheir feelings, Federal workers who simplly want to be able to come to \nwork and get a paycheck on a regular basis and take care of their \nfamilies. That is what this is all about. It is too bad they are not \nbeing recognized because they are really important to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Nebraska \nhas 2 minutes remaining on his side. The Senator from Mississippi has \n9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understood that I yielded 6 minutes to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and that that would leave \nus 10 minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have about 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, [Mr. Bennett].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened to the debate here this \nmorning with some interest. I do not have a prepared statement, but I \nhave a few observations I want to make.\n  First, with respect to this forecasting issue and what should be and \nshould not be in it, I would like to point out one fact that many have \nignored with respect to forecasting. This is not a forecast; this is a \nhistorical report. Martin Feldstein, writing in the Wall Street \nJournal, has pointed out the difference between the forecast made 2 \nyears ago for the President's tax increase and the amount of tax \nactually received is this: The Federal Government has received one-\nthird as much tax revenue as was forecast. Nobody is talking about \nthat. They say the President raised the taxes because he had so much \ncourage and that solved the deficit problem. In fact, the forecasters \nwere off by two-thirds. We got one-third as much money as was forecast.\n  Now we are being told, ``Yeah, the blue chip forecasters are now \nsaying that we will get more money than CBO or OMB say we will get. So \nwhy don't we take that forecast?'' I will be happy to take that \nforecast, Mr. President. I will do it in a heartbeat on this \ncondition--that we use the same blue chip forecasters to score the \nlegislation that we pass.\n  But we are stuck with the CBO whether we like it or not. The CBO \nscores the Senator from New Mexico on every budget action that he \ntakes. Why do we have one set of numbers for our legislative action and \nthen say we will have another set of numbers for the balanced budget \ncircumstance?\n  Let us put it out very clearly, Mr. President. If the CBO is wrong \nand too low, that means that the bill that we pass will bring us to a \nbalanced budget faster than 7 years. That means if the CBO is wrong, we \nwill make the terrible mistake of balancing the budget in 5. But, if \nthe CBO is right and OMB is wrong and we pass the President's program, \nthat means we will balance the budget never.\n  I have learned since I have come to Washington the true definition of \nthe phrase ``the outyears.'' I never knew what the outyears meant. In \nWashington, the outyears mean those years that are far out there. Well, \nin fact, in this debate, Mr. President, the outyears mean never. We \nhave to recognize that if we are going to balance the budget, we have \nto start now and not depend on a rosy scenario for the outyears, no \nmatter who makes it, whether it is CBO or OMB or the blue chip \nforecasters or whoever. If we wait for the outyears to make the \ndecision, we will never ever get there. So we must take the first step. \nWe must take it this year. And we must not flinch.\n\n  One other thing, Mr. President. The President pounded the pulpit the \nother day and said some 16 times he believes in a balanced budget. \nWell, Mr. President, we are going to find out, because some of the \npolitical handlers at the White House did not bother to inform the \nPresident that the election is next year, not this year. And between \nnow and then he is required by law to send us a budget. And we will see \nwhen he sends us his budget in 1997 just how serious he is. And we will \nsee how effective it is because the budget he sent us in 1996----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Ten more seconds.\n  The budget he sent us in 1996 received the resounding vote of 99-0 \nagainst it. We will see what he does next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I have 2 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 44 seconds. \n\n[[Page S 17128]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Let me first respond to the remarks just made. Why it is \nnecessary that we use realistic assumptions? That is because we are \noverpenalizing Medicare, we are overpenalizing students, we are \noverpenalizing people who receive Medicaid. If we are realistic in our \nassumptions, we do not have to hurt people as much. Also being \noverlooked by those who talk the argument we have to stay with CBO is \nthe obvious fact that they talk about paying for this in later years. \nIf you look at the Republican budget, you see that they delay all of \nthe hard choices to the fifth, sixth and seventh years.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us is simple and direct. It will \nput the Government back to work. It would allow time for negotiations \non the larger budget bill which is going to definitely be tough going, \nbut we need to reduce the deficit. That is the responsible thing for us \nto do: Adopt the Daschle amendment.\n  The underlying bill will be vetoed. The underlying bill tries to \nstack the deck against the President in negotiations to come. The \nunderlying bill is an attempt to force the President to accept the \nextreme cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and education in the Republican \nbudget bill. It is blackmail, very pure and very simple. The President \nwill use his veto, and properly so, to prevent that from happening.\n  The President would sign this bill as amended by the pending \namendment. So the choice is clear. If Senators want to pass a bill that \nthe President can sign to keep the Government running, then Senators \nshould vote for this amendment. A vote against this amendment is simply \na vote to continue the shutdown.\n  If we are to act responsibly, we must adopt the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator his time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will move to table the pending amendment \nat the conclusion of my remarks. Somebody sent me--in fact someone from \nGeorgia sent me a fax. I have already written a note to thank him. He \nincluded in the comments a quote from Mark Twain. I thought--at least I \nhave not heard it before--maybe some of my colleagues have. Let me \nquote it:\n\n       In the beginning of a change, the patriot is a scarce man, \n     brave and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, \n     however, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be \n     a patriot.\n\n  I must say, as I get into this debate again about a balanced budget, \nI think that quotation applies today. This is about change, it is about \nfundamental change. I am not an advocate of shutting down the \nGovernment. I have never been an advocate for shutting down the \nGovernment.\n  But this is an unusual circumstance. We have a President in the White \nHouse who said he would balance the budget in 5 years, in 7 years, in 8 \nyears, in 9 years, in 10 years. So we picked 7. Nothing in our balanced \nbudget statement, if you read the language carefully, which is on the \nlast page--in fact, I watched the debate last night on the House side, \nand I heard Congressman Hoyer--I have great respect for him--from \nMaryland say:\n\n       There is nothing wrong with the first 14 pages of this \n     amendment; it is the last page.\n\n  Everything else was OK, all except title III, which is very brief, \nand let me read it, because we have talked about it, but I am not \ncertain it has been read. All it says is:\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget not \n     later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the non-partisan \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (b) The unified balance budget in subsection (a) shall be \n     based on the most current economic and technical assumptions \n     of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  I believe later today the Senator from New Mexico will quote \ncolleagues on the other side who say we ought to use CBO to balance the \nbudget, including the distinguished manager on the other side and the \ndistinguished minority leader. That is all we have said.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing in here about Medicare, nothing about \nSocial Security, nothing about Medicaid. It is about balancing the \nbudget in 7 years, which 83 percent of the American people support. \nThere is nothing in this that should prevent the President from signing \nthis bill. It says:\n\n       The President and Congress shall enact legislation. * * *\n\n  That means we are going to have a lot of discussion, a lot of \nnegotiation or we cannot enact it, he can veto it.\n  So I hope when final passage comes, we will have some bipartisan \nsupport. I watched last night on C-SPAN the House action. I watched as \n48 Democrats voted with Republicans, a tremendous victory, a bipartisan \nvictory. And I listened to one Democrat from Virginia, Congressman \nMoran, who said it is time we stop this foolishness, the American \npeople want to balance the budget, the Federal employees want to go \nback to work.\n  That is all we are asking. It is nothing unreasonable. There is no \nMedicare. Oh, they beat us up on Medicare, but I must say, I never \nthought I would be around to read an editorial like this in the \nWashington Post called ``The Real Default.'' In the Washington Post, \nbelieve me of all papers--well, the New York Times might startle me \nmore--but the Washington Post, known by some of us as sort of The Daily \nDemocrat Journal, talking about the real default, demagoguery, lack of \nleadership on the Democratic side, in effect setting back the cause of \nbalancing the budget for years by trying to make Medicare a scare word \nwith senior citizens.\n\n  Somewhere we have lost sight of what we are here to do. Somewhere we \nhave lost sight of what the American people expect of us, and somewhere \nwe have lost sight of what is going to happen next week, next month, \nnext year, and the next century.\n  We have stepped up to make some tough decisions, and it is not easy. \nWe are doing the heavy lifting, as my colleague from New Mexico said a \nfew days ago. When you are not lifting anything, it is easy.\n  I just suggest to my colleagues, I am one who would like to resolve \nthis issue. I met with the President the other night. I thought he was \none who wanted to resolve the issue. He told us in his first State of \nthe Union Message that CBO numbers are the ones they are using in their \nbudget. I remember Republicans laughed. He looked at us and said, ``All \nthose Republicans laughing, remember, they have been more conservative \nmost of the time,'' the CBO numbers, the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers.\n  So I do not think we have done anything here that is so bad. We were \ntold last night on the House floor in debate, ``If you just tear off \nthe last page, the President will sign it in a minute.'' What is wrong \nwith this last page? It does not say he has to sign a balanced budget \ntoday, or next week or next month. It says ``in the 104th Congress.''\n  And if you watched TV last night and you saw the President saying, \n``I'm for a 5-year balanced budget,'' and then, ``I'm for a 7-year,'' \n``I'm for a 10-year,'' ``I'm for a 9-year,'' ``I'm for an 8-year''--the \nAmerican people are confused.\n  So let us send this to the President. Let us not take all day in \ndoing it. Let us get it down to the President of the United States. I \nbelieve after reflection, he will sign it. It is a commitment to a 7-\nyear balanced budget. That is all it is. That is what it says in the \ntitle, ``commitment.'' It is not a law, it is a commitment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to table this amendment and to table the \nother two amendments to be offered and, hopefully, have some bipartisan \nsupport on final passage.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 577 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns \n\n[[Page S 17129]]\n\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3055) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that Senator Hollings wishes to proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3056\n\n  (Purpose: To reaffirm the commitment of the Congress not to use the \n surpluses in the Social Security trust fund to mask the true size of \n             the deficit in any plan for a balanced budget)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask the clerk to report my amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3056.\n       Add at the end of the Joint Resolution, the following last \n     section:\n       Sec.  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Joint \n     Resolution, the seven year balanced budget passed by the \n     Congress to the President shall not include the use of Social \n     Security Trust Funds to reflect a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it was Mark Twain who said the truth is \nsuch a precious thing that it should be used very sparingly. As a \nresult, Mr. President, what we have been doing is calling budgets \n``balanced'' when in reality there have been raids, or, as the former \nSenator from Pennsylvania, John Heinz, called it, ``embezzlement'' of \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  At the present moment we owe Social Security, due to this lack of \ntruth in budgeting. We owe Social Security $481 billion, and if you \nduck the proposed reconciliation tomorrow or the GOP budget, you will \nexpend another $636 billion of Social Security trust fund.\n  Now, what may have been in the original instance an instrument of \ngood, turned into a usurpation and a bankruptcy of Social Security if \nyou have to borrow a few billion dollars. In the morning paper, you see \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in order to keep from defaulting, the \nSecretary of the Treasury has borrowed $61.3 billion from the civil \nservice retirement. And they say later on, of course, he has to pay it \nback with interest--and that is the point. You have to pay Social \nSecurity back with interest and at the end of the 7-year budget you \nwill owe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold a moment? The Senate \nis not in order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there are nine conversations going on on \nthe floor right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is aware of it and is trying to get \norder.\n  The Senator from South Carolina may proceed.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  At the end of the 7-year period, we will all have to pay back, \nsupposedly, over $1 trillion into the Social Security trust fund, and \nno one has any idea--not any Senator or House Member --who is going to \nintroduce the increase in taxes to refund the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The remedy for this particular evil is to obey the law. We saw this \nin the Budget Committee. We tortured over it. We realized this back in \n1983 when we passed the Greenspan Commission report making the Social \nSecurity trust funds solvent into the middle of the next century, we \nsaid, so the children and the grandchildren could count on it.\n  We raised the taxes and assured everyone--in fact, we could not have \ndone it for defense or for foreign aid or for welfare or for any of the \nother endeavors of Government. We said we were raising these Social \nSecurity taxes to make certain that there was trust in the trust fund \nthrough the year 2050.\n  Having done that, 5 years ago we met in the Budget Committee and \nrealized, look, on an emergency basis, yes, we borrowed from Social \nSecurity, maybe $100 billion here, $200 billion there. As Senator \nDirksen says, it could easily run into money.\n  So we voted, on a vote of 20 to 1 in the Budget Committee, that we \nwould stop this nonsense by writing into the law section 13301 of the \nstatutory laws of the United States of America that ``thou shalt not \nuse Social Security trust funds to in any way be computed in outlays or \nrevenues of the United States Government or in any way to obscure the \nsize of the deficit.'' That particular measure passed this body by a \nvote of 98 to 2. It was signed into law by President George Herbert \nWalker Bush on November 5, 1990, and no less than reaffirmed in a \nsolemn vote here on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Monday, 3 days ago. \nWe said in the reconciliation----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold a moment. We have \nseveral other conversations going on on the floor. The Senate will be \nin order.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We said in the reconciliation instructions that they \nadhere to the law 13301.\n  At that particular time, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee looked at it. It was Senator Graham of Florida and the \nSenator from South Carolina who introduced the particular language. We \nsaid about the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995, and I read, \n``. . . that the conferees be instructed to honor section 13301 of the \nBudget Enforcement Act of 1990, and, 2, not to include in the \nconference report any language that violates this section.'' And, to \nthat, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, said, and I quote: ``Mr. President, the first portion \nof this instruction, we have never violated, so we can be instructed on \nit. The second section, we have never violated it, so we can be \ninstructed not to.''\n  Absolutely false. That is categorical. We have regularly violated it. \nAnd that is the plea, later on, of the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, that all the Presidents have done it. All the \nCongresses have done it. So, the heck with the law. He gets up and says \nsolemnly: We have never violated it. We continue to do so.\n  The fact that President Reagan reported a budget that way, and \nPresident Bush reported a budget that way, President Clinton reported a \nbudget that way, makes no impression on this particular Senator. It is \nour responsibility to have truth in budgeting. It is our responsibility \nto adhere to the statutory laws of the United States of America. It is \nnot a technicality of law; it is a fundamental here involved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na budget table showing the U.S. budget outlays beginning in 1945, the \nuse of trust funds under President Truman at that particular time, the \nreal deficit, and then, of course, the gross Federal deficit.\n  When you put together the borrowing from the trust funds that must be \nreplenished, you get the real deficit, the gross Federal debt, and the \ngross interest costs.\n  These are all on one page so all the Members cannot dance around and \ntalk about CBO and OMB. These are the figures of the U.S. Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n.......................................................................\n\n[[Page S 17130]]\n                                                                      BUDGET TABLES

Historical tables, Budget of the U.S. Government Fiscal Year 1996; beginning in 1962 CBO's 1995 Economic and Budget Outlook.                          \n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as you go down, you will see we have \nbeen borrowing sumptuously from trust funds. At the present time--not \njust owing Social Security the $481 billion--at this very minute, we \nowe the trust funds of the United States, we owe to the veterans, we \nowe to the civil service retirees, we owe to the military retirees, we \nowe, yes, to Medicare. We have been using everybody else's moneys: \n$1,255,000,000,000.\n  So, the thrust of using the word ``unified'' is to obscure just that; \nthat we are already in hock, before we begin the year, \n$1,255,000,000,000. We are already in hock on a national debt of just \nabout $5 trillion. And, since this is all Presidential campaign \npolitics, whoever the next President is, when he comes to town January \na year from now, he will find at least $500 billion spent for \nabsolutely nothing, just for the past profligacy and waste, Congresses \nfor 15 years now are spending over $200 billion more than we have taken \nin.\n\n  Congress has continued to campaign on balanced budgets, and they all \ntell you on the political stump how they are going to balance the \nbudget. When they come to town, they get into the smoke and the \nmirrors. There is no question that the smoke and the mirror are just in \nthat one word ``unified.'' Just say ``the balanced budget.''\n  I have heard Senators say it is not complicated. You take the \nrevenues that the Government receives, you take the expenditures, or \noutlays the Government spends, and there is the balance. That is not \nthe way.\n  Then they want to move deficits. They say, ``Wait a minute, when you \ntake the revenues in, the outlays out, and you look at that figure, \nthat is too high for me to run on in the next election. So we will take \nan amount of money out of the right pocket and put it into the left \npocket. We will take $636 billion from Social Security in this budget \nthat we have under consideration and put it in the general fund to make \nit appear we are balancing the budget.''\n  That is what my particular amendment is. As soon as I caught this \nword ``unified,'' the attempt has been made to abolish this section \n13301. They do not like it. But the Senator from South Carolina \nwatches.\n  So the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which I was \nprepared for, ready for, and have voted for numerous times--and am \nready, willing, and able to vote for at this minute--included in \nsection 7 the repeal of section 13301. I caught that earlier in this \nsession this year. I told the distinguished majority leader and our \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, who was \nsponsoring this, I said, ``You got my vote. I understand you got five \nother Democratic votes in a minute. Just take out the repeal of what \nJohn Heinz called embezzlement provisions that protects the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund from embezzlement.'' They will not do it. They were \nadamant.\n  Then they figured, ``Wait a minute. It is good politics if we try to \nblame it on one vote--if we fail to pass a constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget by one vote--and then take it down and offer it next \nyear during the election year.\n  I have the same amendment right in my pocket. Everybody has been \nwalking around with the contract in their pocket. My distinguished \nformer majority leader from West Virginia carries the Constitution in \nhis pocket. I carry around in my pocket the Social Security provision--\nnamely, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that does not \nrepeal section 13301 of the United States Code.\n  Mr. President, there are those who love this unified budget that has \nbrought a modicum of dignity and financial expertise to the politician \nSenator. Because you go up on the financial market, and I am astounded. \nBut still the best of economists, the best of financial officers, the \nbiggest and the best of the banks, are reporting what? A unified \nbudget. They are the ones \n\n[[Page S 17131]]\nwho want it because they are in the business of making money. And the \nless pressures of the Federal Government's borrowing in the financial \nmarket, the more the interest rates, momentarily, will drop and the \nease with which to finance momentarily will grow. And, if they can have \nthe Government itself back in Washington borrowing from each other even \nthough, of course, the debt is up, up, and away to $5 trillion, who \ncares? This crowd operates on quarterly reports, computers, tenths of a \nsecond, moving money around, all around the world. They have no \nresponsibility. The Government, Mr. President, you and I, do.\n  So, it is fine, momentarily, for the financial markets in reducing \nthe pressure. But we, who have the responsibility of serving here in \npublic office as a public trust, have to cut out the nonsense and \nplaying around with the smoke and mirrors. We have to cut out trying to \nfool the American people that under, for example, this resolution, you \nwould have a balanced budget when it is unified. Not at all. When it is \nunified alone from Social Security and $636 billion and over the 7-year \nperiod from civil service retirement and military retirees and others, \nwe will borrow another $200 billion. So it will be over $836 billion \nneeded to get to a so-called ``paper balance.''\n  Let me tell you about the paper balance because I have to listen to \nthe talk on the other side of the aisle about this historic effort and \nthat we finally are doing the heavy lifting. They have not lifted \nanything. When we lifted year before last, when we cut $500 billion in \nspending, when we taxed cigarettes, when we taxed liquor, when we taxed \ngasoline and Social Security, when we cut Medicare $57 billion, they \nwanted lifting? They were out at recess. There was not a single vote on \nthe other side of the aisle in this body, or in the other body.\n  And they have the unmitigated gall to come and say, ``President \nClinton does not want a balanced budget.'' Well, he is the only one \nthat cannot be blamed for it. The distinguished Presiding Officer, this \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, may have voted for \nexpenditures that unbalanced the budget, but not President William \nJefferson Clinton. He was down in Little Rock doing what? Balancing the \nbudgets. He balanced them for 10 years. That was part of the good \nrecord that helped in his election in 1992.\n  But we instead were engaged in this shabby exercise of growth, \ngrowth--that we will just cut out all the revenue and buy the vote with \nReaganomics and with President Bush.\n  It was President Clinton who came to town, yes, to give us a change \nin direction. I was here under President Lyndon Johnson. He was \nconscientious about this political charge of guns and butter and \nrunaway government. So with George Mahon and others working in a \ncommittee, we called at the very end, in December 1968, the fiscal year \nrunning from the 1st of July back to the next year, June 30, and we \ntold the President, ``We can cut another $5 billion.'' He said, ``Don't \ndo it.'' And the budget for the war in Vietnam, for Social Security, \nfor Medicare and all these particular programs was $178 billion.\n  To show how far we have gotten out of hand, the interest costs for \nabsolutely nothing--no government is obtained there--the interest cost \non the national debt this fiscal year is $348 billion, $1 billion a \nday. But President Johnson not only balanced, but he gave us a $3.2 \nbillion surplus.\n  President Nixon came to town. We were working with him again on the \nidea of block grants, incidentally. But in 1973, the OPEC cartel hit. \nWe began to run some $21 billion deficits. President Ford took over, \nand our friend, President Ford, knew well what the problem was. And he \ncalled us all together in a summit. He said, ``Let's get our hands on \nthis thing. It is runaway.'' We held it down to $66 billion. \nThereafter, President Carter came to town. He said, ``I have to at \nleast reduce this.''\n  Now, you are looking at the author of the first reconciliation bill. \nI was chairman of the Budget Committee, and I went over on the Friday \nafter President Jimmy Carter was defeated on a Tuesday in November \n1980, and I said, ``Mr. President, a Democrat is never going to get \nelected again with this deficit going up, up, and away.''\n  He said, ``How much?''\n  I said, ``Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has just \nestimated the deficit is going up to $75 billion.''\n  He said, ``Heavens. What are we going to do?''\n  I said, ``There is a fancy word called reconciliation. It means cut--\njust cut across the board already-approved spending.''\n  He said, ``We can do that?''\n  I said, ``If you can just take Harris and McIntyre''--who were \nworking at OMB and the assistant at OMB trying to give away the money \nto reelect their President--``if you tell them to stay out of the \nCapitol, I will go to my good liberal friends''--I say that with \nreverence--``and I will get the votes, and we will cut it back.''\n\n  And President Carter said, ``Go to it.''\n  I came to Warren Magnuson of Washington and Frank Church of Idaho and \nJohn Culver of Iowa and George McGovern of South Dakota and Birch Bayh \nof Indiana and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. I said, ``Before you all \nleave, you have to give me one vote because we have got to prove that \nwe are fiscally responsible.'' They did, and we reduced the deficit \ndown to $57 billion, just about $58 billion.\n  Then came to town the leader of them all against waste, fraud and \nabuse, President Ronald Wilson Reagan, and he was beginning to put up \nbudgets that we were going to work with. But he got behind the poll, \nbehind the curve. Do not ever fool with polls. That is why I have this \nparticular article on the desk. But getting behind it, he adopted what \nhe had earlier rejected, namely Kemp-Roth. Reaganomics. They termed the \nname, and we were going to cut out all the revenues.\n  I stood at this desk--and I saw the distinguished Republican Senator \nlast night--and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mathias agreed with \nme, and some 10 other Democrats. We tried to hold the line. We said: \nWait a minute; this thing is going to get way out of hand. What is \ngoing to grow is these deficits and debts with the very intent that you \nhave in mind and by talking this political nonsense that we will have \nmore sales, we will have more purchases, we will have more sales taxes, \nmore income, more income tax revenues.\n  ``Give the money to the people. They know how to spend it best.'' \nThat was the political cry. ``Get out of the wagon and help us pull'' \nand that kind of nonsense. We are the ones up in the wagon. Who is in \nthe wagon? The Congress has been in this wagon for 15 years. The people \noutside have been pulling. I am trying to get the Congress out of the \nwagon--$200 billion a year more than we have taken in for 15 years.\n  President Reagan said he was going to balance the budget in 1 year. \nIf necessary, I will go get the speech for you. He came to Washington \nafter his inauguration and he said: Whoops, this is way worse than I \never thought. So I will put in a budget that we will balance in 3 \nyears. And just like this paper document that we are going to consider \ntomorrow--the so-called reconciliation that nothing but a paper \ndocument--it reported formally that it would be balanced by the year \n1984.\n  I will include that page that we have for the fiscal year 1984. It \nsays, ``Fiscal year, zero,'' Calendar No. 63, the 97th Congress, first \nsession. I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFirst Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year 1982\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       (4) the amount of the deficit in the budget which is \n     appropriate in the light of economic conditions and all other \n     relevant factors is as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1982: $48,800,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1983: $21,400,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1984: $0;\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then, Mr. President, we came to one of the wonderful \nchapters in history, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I had worked earlier--and \nwe got to wish him a happy birthday--Senator Howard Baker. Senator \nHoward Baker was the majority leader, and he tried to help me on the \nfreeze. We could not get the freeze. And so I then got with Senator \nPhil Gramm of Texas and said, ``Look, I understand you have an idea of \ncutting spending across the board.'' \n\n[[Page S 17132]]\n\n  I remember well as Governor I got a triple A credit rating doing just \nthat. We had truth in budgeting back in South Carolina in 1959. We said \nthat whatever your budget said was going to happen and would have to \noccur within the expenditures and revenues. If the expenditures ever \nexceeded the revenues, automatically by law--no discretion--the \nspending amounts across the board would be cut. And from Standard & \nPoor's and Moody's, I got a triple A rating ahead of Texas and up to \nMaryland and before any of the Southern States. I used it as my calling \ncard as a young Governor to carpetbag the North, trying to get industry \ndown. So I feel it keenly.\n  It is lost now. Why is it lost now? We have Republican \nadministrations that are giving that same nonsense. That is why I would \nnot join them. It is all rhetoric. It is all applesauce. We have lost \nthe triple A credit rating in South Carolina on account of growth.\n  But be that as it may, Senator Gramm, Senator Rudman and I put in \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. I have the tape from President Reagan giving me \nThe Good Government Award and litany and congratulations and everything \nelse, and, yes, the budgets were going to be balanced because we had \ntruth in budgeting.\n  And then what happened? We found out that it was too severe, these \n$37 billion cuts annually, and they went out in the year 1990 to \nAndrews Air Force Base and repealed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I raised a \npoint of order on October the 19th, 1990, at 12:41 a.m., and they voted \nme down. I said when you get away from the automatic cuts across the \nboard, the sequesters, what you have is so-called spending caps that \nare pure rhetoric, and you can see what has happened. The spending has \ngone up, up and away.\n  So they repealed it at that time. And let us go to the 1990 budget at \nthe time of the repeal. Mr. President, that is the most interesting \ndocument for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to ever look \nupon for the simple reason that it has an astounding figure to it. It \nsays here for the 101st Congress, Second Session, report 101-820--I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year 1991\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       (4)(A) The amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1991: $143,700,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1992: $100,900,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1993: $62,000,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1994: $14,700,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of the surplus is as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1995: $20,500,000,000.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. ``The appropriate levels of total budget outlays are as \nfollows * * *'' And going right down the list, the amount of surplus is \nas follows: ``Fiscal year 1995, $20.5 billion.''\n  So to their crowd saying: ``We are carrying the load; we are lifting \nthings,'' I say you all are doing nothing. They have not voted for \nanything since Clinton has been in town. They have not passed the \nappropriations bills. They have not passed the reconciliation. I want \nto see that lifting.\n  Be that as it may, this 1990 document is another paper document--a \nsurplus we are supposed to have, this minute, of $20 billion. What is \nthe actual deficit? I put the tables in. The actual real deficit at \nthis particular minute is $283.3 billion instead of a $20 billion \nsurplus.\n  So every 5 years, in 1981 reflecting one, in 1984 and 1985 reflecting \none, in 1990 reflecting a surplus, and here we go again, in with \nanother paper document for another 7 years.\n  Another day older and deeper in debt. But who will be around 7 years \nfrom now? We will have two Presidential elections under this scheme. We \nwill have unrealistic cuts. We have had already cuts in Social \nSecurity. You are not going to get $270 billion in Medicare. I do not \ncare what you say or how you vote, we have been cutting.\n  I have been on this Budget Committee 20-some years, and every year \nPresident Reagan, President Bush, and other Presidents, they would come \nand they would want to cut $5 billion to show they were headed in the \nright direction. We would have to restore $2 billion or $3 billion. So \nmomentarily, or annually, I should say, we have been cutting billions \nout of Medicare. So it is under President Clinton who came to town, he \ncut $57 billion in the year 1993 out of Medicare.\n  Last year--last year--Mr. President, he proposed a $120 billion cut. \nNow, let me just as an aside and say a word about Social Security. \n``For by their fruits shall ye know them.'' In 1994, last year, I read \nthe so-called report of the board of trustees of the Federal Hospital \nInsurance Fund. And from page 2:\n\n       The trust fund ratio defined as the ratio of assets at the \n     beginning of the year to disbursements during the year was \n     131 percent in 1993, and then under the immediate assumptions \n     is projected to decline steadily until the fund is completely \n     exhausted in the year 2001.\n\n  Now, mind you me, Mr. President, that this is the same report they \nare talking about 2002. Last year when they said it was going broke in \n2001, they did not even care about it. They went around whining, \n``What's the matter with health care? We have got the best in the \nworld.'' There was no proposal to confront that so-called dreadful \ndisaster 7 years from now.\n  But with President Clinton, not with their votes, President Clinton \nand the Democratic votes--and the Vice President had to vote--we at \nleast picked up a year with the $57 billion cut. And it was completely \nrejected, repudiated. The First Lady was ridiculed all last year about \nhealth care.\n  An interesting thing because the distinguished Senator from Texas was \nsaying that with Social Security taxes, they were going to be hunting \nus down like dogs in the street and shooting us. Like dogs in the \nstreet. Oh, they said the whole country was going into inflation. \nUnemployment was going to soar. Plants were going to close. The economy \nwas going to be in a depression. And they were going to grab us \npoliticians who voted for this and hunt us down like dogs in the street \nand shoot us.\n  Well, it was not easy to vote to tax Social Security. But, mind you \nme, Mr. President, when we taxed it, we said, wait a minute, the \nrevenues from this tax, $25 billion, shall go to--what? Shall go to \nhelp making Medicare solvent. We allocated $25 billion to Medicare. \nHere we had already cut $57 billion.\n  Here then we had allocated some $25 billion. And you know what the \ncontract crowd did in November? They came in there and said, ``Do away \nwith this $25 billion, Medicare,'' that they now are worried about 7 \nyears from now. Pure theater. An absolute sham.\n  They, in their contract, increase the deficit of Medicare some $25 \nbillion. They did not help strengthen the Medicare fund. Why is it that \nwe pick out these straw men out here 7 years from now in Medicare, 30 \nyears from now in Social Security, and are not worried about going \nbroke this minute?\n  We have fiscal cancer. The interest costs--the automatic spending to \npay the interest costs on a $5 trillion debt--is going $1 billion a day \nup, up and away. There is no plan, Democratic or Republican, that says \nlet us cut spending $1 billion a day.\n  So let us get down to the real facts. The real facts are, in the GOP \nbudget, that for every year they increase spending, the fact is, the \npresent budget--the reconciliation we will vote on tomorrow--will \nincrease spending $53 billion. $53 billion over the present year. A $53 \nbillion increase in spending. You look over at the increase in \nrevenues, and you say, well, maybe we had to spend more. But we took in \nmore. We did have some of that growth. Not so. Not so.\n  You add up the 7 years, Mr. President. The expenditures, the outlays \nby CBO. Incidentally, I do not mind CBO figures. I do not mind the 7-\nyear budget. I am prepared to vote for a 7-year budget and CBO \nfigures--so long as it is a true balanced budget and not an \nembezzlement of Social Security. None of this unified. Do not give old \nHollings that. I heard it before. I hear it again. I hear the whine \nthat other Presidents have done it.\n  We came to town in November, my dear Republican colleagues, for \nchange, not for business as usual, not how Presidents have done it, not \nhow Congress has done it before, but the truth in budgeting. But, Mr. \nPresident, the outlays exceed the revenues some $1,052,000,000,000 \nduring that first 7 years. How do you start with a $283.3 billion \ndeficit, increase spending over \n\n[[Page S 17133]]\nrevenues each year for 7 years, and get a balanced budget?\n  You cannot. There is no mystery to it. You use smoke and mirrors. In \nfact, the very authorities they use, they misquote. You look at page 3 \nof the conference report of Chairman Kasich over in the House side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a portion of that report be printed in \nthe Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal year 1996\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       (4) Deficits.--For purposes of the enforcement of this \n     resolution, the amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1996: $245,600,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1997: $234,100,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1998: $204,000,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1999: $192,900,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2000: $181,100,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2001: $140,200,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2002: $108,400,000,000.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Kasich there for the 104th Congress, the first \nsession, concurrent resolution for the fiscal budget for the fiscal \nyear 1996. It says fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. President, everybody ought to listen. They do not want to hear \nit: It shows a $108,400,000,000 deficit. Aha. They keep on these \nweekend shows, morning interviews, the TV, 20-second scripts. Truth in \nbudgeting. But they themselves say in the year 2002, it is a \n$108,400,000,000 deficit.\n  And then, of course, June O'Neill, on October 20, 1995. This, \nincidentally, Mr. President, was subsequent to the October 18 good \nGovernment award that the chairman of the Budget Committee came to the \nfloor and gave his budget.\n  He said, now we have got it certified. Now we have got it certified. \nAnd I do not want to just repeat the record of those particular \namounts, but he had them all detailed out there on October 18. And he \nsaid, the Congressional Budget Office has reviewed our budget that I \nhave just quoted from, and they have found that we have a $10 billion \nsurplus in the year 2002.\n  I said, wait a minute, I can read. Kasich himself said a $108.4 \nbillion deficit. Where in the world did this $10 billion surplus come \nfrom? Two days later, when we admonished the Madam Director to obey the \nlaw--to cut out the embezzlement of the Social Security trust--she \nwrote back meekly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record, \nthe letter of October 20.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office provided the Chairman of the \n     Senate Budget Committee on October 18 with a projection of \n     the budget deficits or surpluses that would result from \n     enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \n     Budget Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO \n     provided projections (using the economic and technical \n     assumptions underlying the budget resolution and assuming the \n     level of discretionary spending specified in that resolution) \n     of the deficit or surplus of the total budget--that is, the \n     deficit or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions \n     of the federal government, including Social Security and \n     Postal Service spending and receipts that are designated as \n     off-budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $115 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in \n     2002. (The letter you received yesterday incorrectly stated \n     these two figures.)\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows there, and I read, ``CBO would \nproject an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in 2002.''\n  ``Peace, peace, everywhere a man cried peace,'' said Patrick Henry, \n``But there was no peace.'' Balance, balance, balance, balance, \neverywhere men cry balance. There is no balance. There is a deficit.\n  Let us level with the American people. To quote Mark Twain, ``The \ntruth is such a precious thing, it should be used very sparingly.''\n  And that is the credo of this Congress that is up in the wagon trying \nto get by again and is using the pressures of the Government closedown \non itself to get what they cannot get by a majority vote. They could \nnot get a majority vote because--I joined with one on legal services. \nThey do not want, like the gang of 73 over on the House side, to \nabolish legal services. So we joined in reinstating legal services in \nthe appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, they do not want to abolish the Department of \nCommerce. That is why we had a voice vote to strike the provision that \nwould have abolished the Department of Commerce.\n  What is happening is they are trying to force feed the White House on \nmeasures that they cannot even get a majority vote for.\n  And they're nagging and crying like children about where they sat on \nthe plane going to a funeral. I do not believe anybody felt much like \ntalking. But our distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, was \nthere and I believe him, and he recounted the several times that the \nPresident came back.

Mr. President--reading from that document, which use \nCBO figures--during the 7-year period, the debt actually goes up $1.8 \ntrillion. I have listed down in that document what is owed to the trust \nfund, what is owed to the Government accounts, and what is owed to \nadditional borrowing. And, of course, interest costs go up from $348 \nbillion to at least $448 billion, but over the 7 years, every expert on \nWall Street says interest cost is going up and will exceed $500 \nbillion.\n  So how do you do it? You do not. Mr. Kasich, the chairman, says you \ncannot. He records a deficit; the CBO records a deficit. How do you do \nit? You fabricate a paper balance with smoke and mirrors.\n  One of the big smokes that has recently surfaced and in 20 years I \nhave not heard this tricky one, is that the CPI, the Consumer Price \nIndex, has been overstated. So we will have less of a CPI and spend the \nmoney. You cannot. When you give less to Social Security, you do two \nthings: You cut the benefits, of course, because you are giving less, \nbut more than anything else --and I welcome that--you increase the \nSocial Security surplus. You do not have ready moneys to spend in \nviolation of 13301. You do not have ready moneys for Medicare when you \nuse a different CPI to spend for the deficit. It goes to Medicare, and \nwe are trying to save Medicare. So let us talk sense.\n  That CPI is a gimmick. Use it if you will, but the result is not to \nlower the deficit. It is to increase the surplus. On that basis, we \nneed to do that and the Senator from South Carolina would support it. \nBut come down to the reality of Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. I \ncould go through each one of them. Let us just take welfare.\n  We say some $83 billion saved in the welfare reform. The House side \nsays $100 billion or so. I can tell you it will cause spending more \nmoney.\n  I have been a Governor. You give me welfare and say, ``Governor, now \nyou have to set up a job-of-last-resort system in the government,'' \nbecause they have to work, and I can tell you it is going to be \ndifficult now to get people to work because they have closed down 17 \ntextile plants in South Carolina since NAFTA. There have been at \nleast--and this is last week's figure--92,000 jobs lost. So we are \nmoving our manufacturing overseas like gangbusters and here come \nwelfare recipients.\n  If you cannot get them a regular job, you have to give them a \ngovernment job. But to give them a government job, of course, they have \nto be skilled. So you not only set up a jobs program. You have to set \nup a skill program. That costs money.\n  And, oh my gracious, two-thirds of children--the other third are \nminority mothers, single mothers--are part of the program and you look \naround and say, ``They can't leave the children,'' so you set up a \nchild care program.\n  All of this costs money. The intent is splendid. Let us put everybody \nto work, but let us not kid the taxpayers that we are saving money. \nWhat we are doing, and I welcome it, is saving lives. Yes, let us train \nthem, skill them, try to find jobs for them, and that is a worthwhile, \nnecessary Government program. The market is not going to do it. That is \nthe kind of thing we need Government for that they are trying to \nabolish.\n  But they abolish their own responsibility, the Gang of 73, by giving \nit back to the Governors under the chant that ``government closest to \nthe people is the best government.''\n  So we will get rid of that responsibility and start cutting the \nmoneys. That is not going to happen.\n  The worst thing of course, Mr. President, you see in this document is \nbackloading. When I talk about backloading, if we were to adopt ipso \nfacto the reconciliation bill that they bring out tomorrow, we will \nhave cut or saved, however you look at it, $45 billion, and that is \nassuming the truth of everything that happened under that particular \nbudget.\n  We will have cut $45 billion. That has not been easy. We are already \nat Thanksgiving, and we have not gotten the bill. It is so difficult. \nDo you know what they say to do in the year 2002? Cut $347 billion. \nThis thing is just to get their attention and get out of town to get \nthe President's election over with next November. They say, ``Do not \npay attention to it; oh, we'll come back, we'll change it later; it \ndoesn't have any impact on the Presidential election.''\n  They do not have anything there much cut as compared to the enormous \ntask of saving billions of dollars. They put it all in the last 2 years \nafter two Presidential elections. Gamesmanship, smoke and mirrors and, \nyes, Social Security embezzlement.\n  Now they embezzled $636 billion. That word embezzlement is from none \nother than the former Senator of Pennsylvania, Senator John Heinz, when \nwe debated and passed the law.\n  Now they have another little thing that has come along. They give \nthemselves credit and say we are going to cut taxes. That, if anything, \nought to expose the charade, the fraud that we are being asked to \nadopt. When you come around and you are looking for money and you cut \nwell-conceived programs--education, Head Start, technology, health \ncare, research--they then have the audacity to say we have to buy the \nvote for next year with this middle-class tax cut. Under the tax cut, \nwe are going to get--like Reaganomics--increased revenues, they say. \nThat is what they say.\n  Mr. President, we were faced with this 8 years ago in the Budget \nCommittee. We had tried with the freeze during the early eighties. We \ntried with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings the cuts across the board. We had \ntried with the tax reform, with Senator Bentsen. In the Tax Reform Act \nof 1986, we closed the loopholes and then, yes, 8 years ago in 1987, \neight of us Senators cold-sober voted what? To increase taxes. We voted \nfor that in the Budget Committee.\n  I abhor taxes just like everybody else in this land. But we looked \nand saw what was occurring, and I conferred at that particular time \nwith Dick Darman, the head of OMB for President Bush. I said, ``Look, \nwhat we need to do is get''--actually, President Reagan was still in, \nbut we were talking to Darman who was coming in--``we need not only \nfreezes, we need not only spending cuts, we need not only loophole \nclosings, but we need all of those and a tax increase.'' We voted that, \nallocating it to the deficit and the debt.\n  I want you to know we did not give up with President Clinton. In \nFebruary 1993, shortly after his inauguration, I asked for a personal \ninterview with the President of the United States. \n\n[[Page S 17135]]\n\n  And I said, Mr. President, I have been in this thing almost 20 years, \nand there is no way out. What we really need to do is get what cuts you \ncan get, what savings you can get. But to get on top of this hemorrhage \nof interest cost spending on the national debt, you are going to need a \nrevenue measure. And on careful consideration, we would suggest a \nvalue-added tax.\n  In fact, I said, ``Mr. President, if you take it, I will take the \nlead.'' I had just been beat up upon, being reelected in 1992 as \n``high-tax Hollings.'' But I said I would take the lead, and we could \nget the votes, as long as the President is leading. Nobody, for \nexample, on the House side running for reelection is going to throw \nhimself on the tax sword if it is going to be vetoed. One-third of \nthose in the U.S. Senate, running for reelection, are not going to \nthrow themselves on a tax sword if it is going to be vetoed.\n  So, Mr. President, you are going to have to get it. And he said, \n``You know, that is interesting, Senator.'' He said, ``Last night I got \na call from Lane Kirkland of the AFL-CIO. He was down in Bar Harbor at \nthe annual conference. He said he would favor a 5-percent VAT to get \nrid of the deficit and the debt.''\n  I said, ``Mr. President, happy day. When I testified before the \nFinance Committee, that was the opposition, and organized labor was \ntalking about the regressivity.'' They do not talk about the \nregressivity of spending for nothing. Nothing is more regressive than \nthe present course Government is on and insisting upon raiding trust \nfunds, just to look politically smart. ``Come on,'' I said, ``If we \nhave the AFL-CIO, we can really get it done.''\n  The next morning, Mr. President, the President of the United States \nwas out doing his jog, and one of the reporters asked him about some of \nhis thoughts. He said, ``I am thinking about a VAT.'' Well, before he \ngot back to the White House, they were stepping all over us and all the \nrest of that crowd said, ``You're lying, the President overspoke; he \ndid not say it,'' and everything else. I will show it to you in the \nnewspaper. That ended any effort.\n  At least the President came back with $500 billion in cuts, increased \ntaxes on gasoline, Social Security, and the least cuts in Medicare and \nacted very responsibly, which has gotten us into a pretty good economic \nsituation--for the moment. But we have fiscal cancer.\n  The automatic spending and interest costs on the national debt are \neating us alive--are growing each day and cannot be stopped, unless we \nget rid of this debt and this deficit. Ironically, the only way to get \nrid of the increased taxes--because that is what the interests costs \nare. They cannot be avoided, like death and taxes; you have to pay the \ninterest costs. The only way to get rid of the automatic increase in \ntaxes is to increase taxes.\n  Now, if you understand that, you will understand the predicament the \nland is in. All of this other thing of force-feeding, whether it is \neducation, whether it is the environment, whether it is Medicare and \nall, is beyond repair. Why argue here in November 1995 about something \nthat is solvent and paid for like Medicare? Why argue about something \nthat is solvent and paid for like Social Security?\n  Let us look at the real problem that we are trying to finesse. Let us \nunderstand that we are in the same act, same scene. And, as President \nReagan said, ``Here we go again.'' We proposed and supported a balanced \nbudget in 1987 we proposed and supported a balanced budget in 1991, and \nwe were supposed to, under Bush in 1990, report a surplus in 1995.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know Senator Hollings was serving in the Senate in \n1983. I was serving in the House of Representatives and was on the Ways \nand Means Committee when the Social Security reform package was \nenacted.\n  I offered an amendment in 1983 in the Ways and Means Committee that \nfailed, but the amendment that I offered--I ask a question about this--\nsaid if we are going to incur surpluses in Social Security year by year \nin order to save for the future, as a deliberate strategy, then we are \ngoing to have to put those surpluses aside so they are not used for \nother purposes, because if they are part of the unified budget, they \nwill get used. So I offered the amendment and the amendment failed. \nThat was 12 years ago. Now, 12 years later, we are back debating this.\n  Is it not the case that 12 years later we are debating that because \nwhat I feared would happen in 1983, and offered an amendment to try to \nprevent from happening, is happening. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaid it has happened under Democrats and Republicans. He is absolutely \ncorrect. But it is business as usual, and it is wrong. It has been \nwrong, and it is wrong now. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly correct. If anybody heard anything \nduring this week's debate, listen to the Senator from North Dakota. He \nwas there and made the motion. I remember it well.\n  At that particular time, we were raising taxes on the absolute \npromise that it would only go for Social Security. If we said at the \ntime we are going to raise taxes for defense and raise taxes for \nforeign aid and raise taxes for education--in fact at that particular \ntime they were trying to abolish the Department of Education--and raise \ntaxes for any of these other endeavors of Government, you could not \nhave gotten a tax increase. You got it on a solid promise that we were \nkeeping faith under the Social Security fund.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for an additional question, the \nSenator then, subsequently, in future years, offered an amendment on \nthe floor of the Senate that actually succeeded. It was an amendment \nsimilar to what I offered in 1983 and failed in the Ways and Means \nCommittee. Senator Hollings then offered an amendment that subsequently \nhad become law that says you cannot use the Social Security trust fund \nas part of the unified budget, which meant that when the balanced \nbudget agreement was brought to the floor by the majority party, on \npage 3 of the agreement, they had the years of the deficits and, in \n2002, this document they said was their balanced budget document set \ndeficits in 2002 of, I believe, it was $108 billion.\n  Now, why would something they called a balanced budget propose a $108 \nbillion deficit in 2002? Is it not because, in fact, the law prevents \nthem from bringing something to the floor that says ``zero,'' \nespecially inasmuch as the law says you cannot use the Social Security \ntrust funds. But by calling it a balanced budget, they know what they \nare doing; they are using the Social Security trust funds as an offset \nagainst other revenue, thereby saying, yes, we balance the budget, but, \nin fact, they have taken the trust funds to do it, and, in fact, the \nbudget is not in balance at all; is that not the case?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is the case. Our only chance at getting out of \nthis particular fix is the free press, the media.\n  I have dutifully called all around the clock. I think at that time \nPresident Jefferson said, ``As between a free Government and a free \npress, I would choose the latter.'' Yes, you can have a free \nGovernment, but it will not remain free long unless you have a free \nmedia. Right to the point, I have gotten the Washington Post economic \nwriter, I have gotten all the particular people--for example, on ``Meet \nthe Press.'' I have talked to editors and written articles. I keep \ntalking about it, and they keep reporting just like Greenspan, like he \nis some authority. He represents Wall Street.\n  Wall Street loves a unified budget. When you say a unified budget, \nthe Government in Washington borrows from itself and not from Wall \nStreet. There is less of a burden on the financial market. So they have \na selfish interest involved here, and they do not want to see us, as \npublic servants, start putting this Government on a pay-as-you-go \nbasis. Greenspan has been a lawyer here for 15 years.\n  I can tell you, in football, I would have had another coach long ago. \nI got some remarks of his somewhere here. He was talking, just the \nother day, to some group and he said, ``We don't want to be lulled \nasleep.'' If there is one person who has lulled us asleep, it has been \nAlan Greenspan. He talks of unified budgets. He never says, \ncategorically, what the truth is, and that is that you have to get tax \nrevenues in here to do this job. When you are at $1 billion a day, and \n$348 billion a year, and use $271 billion in defense, you can \n\n[[Page S 17136]]\neliminate defense and you would still have a deficit.\n  Domestic discretionary spending is the President, Congress, courts, \nDepartment of the Interior, Justice, go right around, Commerce, general \ngovernment. That is $273 billion. You could eliminate it, not just cut \nit, and you still have a deficit.\n  We are in a position like the character in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' \nIn order to stay where you are, you have to run as fast as you can; in \norder to get ahead, you have to run even faster.\n  No one wants to talk about it. We have fiscal cancer. Once again, we \nare prepared to lie to the American people. Therein, the Hollings \namendment. It is very clear-cut. Do not give us any of this Social \nSecurity embezzlement budget. It is not the balanced budget. Read the \nlanguage. Section 301 of the continuing resolution says the President, \nthe Congress, must enact legislation to achieve a unified balanced \nbudget. That is the trick.\n  We voted on Monday just exactly not to do that by a vote of 97 to 2. \nAt that particular time, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee said the first portion of this instruction ``we have never \nviolated, so we can be instructed on it.'' False. We continually--as he \nargues, every President, every Congress has given budgets that way and \nit has been in violation. He knows it.\n  The second section ``we have never violated, so we can be instructed \nnot to.'' False. We continue to violate it. You come around and you \nraise a point when he is on the floor, he will say, ``Senator, that is \nwhat President Clinton does.'' Do not give me that. I am serious. I \nexpect to be here after President Clinton. Come on. I have been here \nafter all of these Presidents that are running up these deficits.\n  We are conscientious about it. We do not want to see this charade \ncontinue. The only way to make sure that everybody knows when they \nvote--I will vote for your resolution, Senator, on 7 years; I will vote \nfor CBO figures. Nothing wrong with that. But do not give me the trick, \nthe smoke, the mirror, of unified. That is raiding the trust funds--\n$636 billion, specifically, of Social Security, $200 billion from the \nairport and airways trust fund, the highway trust fund, the Medicare \ntrust fund, the Civil Service retirement, your military retirees.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska has that responsibility. You \ncan see the trickery as they do.\n  Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced plans yesterday to pull \n$61.3 billion from two retirement accounts.\n  He authorized withdrawal of the entire $21.5 billion--in the G-fund, \nand as much as $39.8 billion of the $350 billion held in the Civil \nServices retirement fund. In effect, both funds would be given--IOU \nthat would obligate Treasury to make complete repayment with interest \nafter a permanent increase in the debt limit is finally approved.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I must say that I am saddened here when the Senator from \nSouth Carolina made that statement, because as he knows I am the author \nof that bill that created those funds just mentioned. It is a defect in \nthe legislation.\n  We intended that to be available to the administration in the event \nof a national emergency. We meant a true national emergency.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not a political war.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think this is a political war and an aberration. No \nadministration has done that before.\n  It is very sad because we saved the taxpayers billions of dollars by \ncreating a separate fund in which employees contribute and the employer \nmatches a portion of that. And, a portion of that is invested in \nGovernment securities.\n  What they have now done is they have reached into funds that \nemployees have put into Government securities, pulled it out, and said, \n``We can run the Government on it.''\n  This is the worst thing I have seen in the history of the \nGovernment's relationship to its employees--to invade the trust funds, \nand at a loss now, the employees will lose interest.\n  They will give the employees a chit to pay interest. What will be the \ninterest? The interest paid on the national debt?\n  That is why we took it out of there, because the national debt is so \nfluctuating--it, too, is political in a sense.\n  I think it is unfortunate we have reached a point where that action \nwas taken by the President.\n  I am enjoying the Senator's comments and my question is this: I heard \nthe Senator from South Carolina say he could support this amendment--\nthis continuing resolution--but did he say with an amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The amendment that is now under the consideration of \nthe body. Namely, it says that the 7-year balanced budget passed by the \nCongress to the President shall not include Social Security trust fund \nto reflect a balance.\n  Very simple. I have copies of it. I will be glad to try to change it \naround and make it clearer, but I do not know--I wanted to make you an \noffer you could not refuse. You just voted for it on Monday. Here it is \nThursday. That was my intent.\n  If I do it now, then we will correct this situation and we will all \nbe pulling forward together and finally getting out of Senator Gramm's \nwagon of spending $200 billion a year and raiding trust funds, and \ntalking about how intent we are in doing heavy lifting and how Mark \nTwain, and whether we are patriots and whether we are popular--that is \nchildren's talk.\n  We should do the job. In order to do the job, quit moving deficits. \nDo not move the deficit from the general fund over to the Social \nSecurity. Our idea is to lessen or eliminate deficits, not move them \naround.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senator has a germ of an \nidea. I am not sure I concur entirely in what he is saying. I do not \nbelieve we should have a situation where the balancing of the budget \ncomes about because of a failure to use the Social Security trust fund \nthe way it was intended. Is that the position of the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My position is it not be used. The budget--so far we \nhad in the Budget Committee, the document by Chairman Kasich of the \nconference itself on the budget reflects a usage of Social Security \ntrust fund--$636 billion over the 7 years.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is that not a restriction? It leaves the money in the \ntrust fund. It does not put it in the Treasury. But we are not \ntransferring to the Treasury.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You are. The law itself says that it cannot be used in \nthat fashion, if I could put my finger on it. That is exactly the law \nyou voted for and I voted for in 1990, that it not be employed in that \nfashion, to obscure the size of the twist.\n  We are spending more than we are taking in. That is what we are \ndoing. It is not a technicality about being in the Treasury. Certainly \nit is in the Treasury, and it should, under our intent of increasing \nthe taxes back in 1983, be embellishing a surplus. Nothing wrong with \nthat.\n  The fact is with the surplus there, your children and my children can \ncount on their retirement. As it is now, Senator Thurmond and I are \nholding free on that score but the kids are not. They are caught up \nbecause we are using all the money.\n  We owe $481 billion. If we spend another $636 billion under this \nbudget, thereupon, at 2002 we will all be owing Social Security over $1 \ntrillion, and then they will be coming around on the floor of the \nCongress saying, ``Social Security is busted and we have to save it.''\n  How will you find $1 trillion to save it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have another question. Would the Senator yield for a \nmoment to make a unanimous-consent request on behalf of the leader?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17103-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17136-S17137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2126\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I have the question, if I might ask my \nfriend?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Because he is a good friend, as a matter of fact.\n  If we were to vote for your amendment, do you have any indication the \nPresident would support it as amended?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It makes no difference to me. I would hate to see a \nPresident want to veto that and say I want to raid the Social Security \ntrust fund. He does know politics. I do not think he would hesitate \nsigning that part of it, I can tell you that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My question, respectfully, to my friend, is, has he \ndiscussed this amendment with the White House.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. This gentleman is working on his own. This is no \nWhite House amendment. I can tell you here and now, if I wait on that \ncrowd over there, we would not get it done.\n  Mr. President, there is one more thing to be recognized and that is \nthe exception that makes the rule. That is, as I am critical of the \nmedia for just going fast asleep on this one, and battling the \nGreenspan unified nonsense, the one exception is USA Today just about a \nweek ago--10 days ago, November 6, Monday.\n  I ask unanimous consent this editorial and an October 20 column by \nLars-Erik Nelson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n                        The Balanced-Budget Myth\n\n\nour view: both parties use social security to hide the truth about the \n               budget; and in time, the public will pay.\n\n       Each day, the debate over balancing the budget produces \n     another dire warning. The cuts are too deep! say the \n     Democrats. Taxes must fall! say the Republicans.\n       But after they compromise and begin arguing over who won a \n     few weeks from now, one truth will remain: Both sides will be \n     lying, because neither is talking about a truly balanced \n     budget at all.\n       The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office underscored \n     that point recently. It pointed out that come 2002, when the \n     budget will be ``balanced'' under Republican plans, the \n     government will still be borrowing more than $100 billion a \n     year. This is done by writing IOUs from the Treasury to \n     Social Security and other trust funds that Congress declares \n     ``off-budget.''\n       The bill for this little game won't come due in the \n     political life of President Clinton or much of today's \n     Congress. But the public will pay it soon enough.\n       To understand, look ahead to 2005. That's just 10 years \n     away, about the time it takes for an 11-year-old child to go \n     from grade school through college.\n       That year a critical balance tips. Increased costs for \n     Social Security will begin to deplete Congress' cushion. \n     Because the Social Security trust fund is a fiction filled \n     with nothing but government promises to pay, Congress will \n     gradually lose its fudge factor.\n       By 2013, when the trust fund peaks, taxpayers will feel a \n     hard bit. They'll have to start doing what the trust fund was \n     supposed to do--pay for the retirement of 75 million baby \n     boomers. The budget will plummet into a sea of red ink, with \n     $760 billion a year deficits by 2030. By then the government \n     will have had to double the current 12.4% employer-employee \n     payroll tax to cover Social Security obligations.\n       That's unaffordable. Yet, neither President Clinton nor \n     leaders of either party in Congress acknowledge reform is \n     needed to avert economic catastrophe. To do so would require \n     Republicans to get off their tax-cut bandwagon and Democrats \n     to accept deeper spending cuts. Both prefer the myths that a \n     budget borrowing from Social Security is balanced and a trust \n     fund filled with IOUs to be paid by today's 11-year-olds has \n     value.\n       Those are frauds only fundamental reform can fix.\n       The leaders of Clinton's commission on entitlements--Sen. \n     Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., and former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.--\n     last year recommended raising the retirement age to 70 and \n     converting a portion of the current payroll tax into a \n     mandated personal retirement account. The Concord Coalition, \n     a deficit watchdog, has called for cutting benefits to upper-\n     income retirees. Other proposals include taxing all income \n     for Social Security and subjecting all benefits to normal \n     income taxation.\n       Which measures are best? Only a thorough debate of the \n     various measures can decide. But first political leaders must \n     give up their convenient budget myths and face the fact--a \n     Social Security train wreck is coming, and sooner than they \n     think.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, Oct. 20, 1995]\n\n                 Borrowing From Soc Sec to Aid the Rich\n\n                         (By Lars-Erik Nelson)\n\n       Washington--See that Social Security deduction on your \n     paycheck? It's the key to the Republican plan to ``balance'' \n     the federal budget while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.\n       In 2002, the year Republicans have been promising a \n     balanced budget, they will in fact come up $108 billion \n     short, according to the House Budget Committee's report. The \n     Republican plan makes up the difference by ``borrowing''--the \n     late Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) called it ``embezzling''--from \n     the Social Security trust fund.\n       By law, Social Security deductions are supposed to be \n     earmarked to pay benefits for future retirees. But for the \n     past dozen years the Social Security surplus has been used to \n     mask the real size of the federal deficit.\n       The Republican plan continues the embezzlement. In pure \n     accounting terms, the Republicans are right: If the amount of \n     money the government collects in a given year equals the \n     amount that it pays out, the budget is in balance. But \n     borrowing from the trust fund to cover current operating \n     costs means raising taxes on the next generation--our \n     children--to pay back the debt to the trust fund.\n       In addition, using Social Security deductions to balance \n     the budget means that working people, who cannot escape that \n     FICA deduction on their paychecks, make up the shortfall \n     caused by tax breaks for the wealthy and for business.\n       ``It's the largest transfer of wealth from labor to capital \n     in our history,'' Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said \n     yesterday. ``We are using a 15% payroll tax [the combined \n     burden on employer and employe] to pay the interest on \n     Treasury bonds, which are generally not owned by blue-collar \n     workers.''\n       ``These guys [the Republicans] don't have any intention of \n     balancing the budget,'' agreed Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.). \n     ``All they want to do is to get credit for it, make room for \n     a big tax cut and destroy the government.''\n       Republican budget plans are still something of a moving \n     target, with many details being worked out behind closed \n     doors, often in consultation with business lobbyists. \n     ``You're really not supposed to understand this until it's \n     too late,'' one of the lobbyists confessed with a grin \n     yesterday.\n       But the general outline is clear. The budget plans call for \n     increasing taxes on the lowest-income Americans--those \n     earning under $30,000 a year--primarily by curtailing the \n     Earned Income Tax Credit for working people.\n       The way the tax cuts are skewed, the wealthiest 12% of \n     Americans share $53 billion in tax breaks; the remaining 88% \n     of taxpayers share $49 billion. Federal spending cuts also \n     hit the low-earners harder than they do upper-income \n     families.\n       More bad news: En route to their supposedly ``balanced \n     budget,'' the Republicans run annual deficits that will add \n     another $1 trillion to the national debt. That means that in \n     2002, interest costs--now running at nearly $1 billion a \n     day--will eat up even more of the federal budget, leaving \n     less money for spending on everything else.\n       Moynihan tried yesterday to strike $245 billion in GOP tax \n     cuts and use the money to reduce the deficit, preserve the \n     EITC and spare some of the proposed cuts in Medicare. he was \n     defeated.\n       ``This is simply the wrong time to cut taxes,'' Moynihan \n     argued. Republicans did not listen.\n       As Ronald Reagan's conscience-stricken budget director, \n     David Stockman, observed in identical circumstances just over \n     a dozen years ago, ``Now the hogs are really feeding.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Talking about the budget, the editorial says:\n\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office underscored \n     that point recently. It pointed out that come 2002, when the \n     budget will be ``balanced'' under the Republican plans, the \n     Government will still be borrowing more than $100 billion a \n     year.\n\n  The truth is, it is over $348. But then:\n\n       But after they compromise and begin arguing over who won a \n     few weeks from now, one truth will remain: Both sides will be \n     lying, because neither is talking about a truly balanced \n     budget at all.\n\n  That is what I want to do, is repair the lying with this particular \namendment. So both sides can be telling the truth and we are not any \nlonger embezzling Social Security.\n  The title of this one is ``A Balanced Budget Myth.'' There is one \nparticular entity, now, that has the truth and they are after us. I \nhope all the media will wake up and get after us. Let us start talking \nsense, rather than who is on top and who is lost and who is popular and \nwhat the polls show.\n  I absolutely, since I have the time here, have learned one thing in \n40 years of public service. That is, this political polling is a \ncancer. Yes, you have to \n\n[[Page S 17138]]\nget it. The opposition gets it when you run for office. But if you try \nto administer, if you try to govern with a poll--I think of the \nMarshall plan. Mr. President, 14 percent favored the Marshall plan at \nthe time it was adopted. It was overwhelmingly opposed.\n  I go back as a young House member in my own State legislature, when I \noffered the sales tax bill and education finance reform to start \nbuilding up public education in my own home State. Sales tax, at that \ntime, was totally unpopular. As of this minute, if you took a poll in \nSouth Carolina on the sales tax, I am convinced the majority, by far, \nwould say they oppose the sales tax.\n  But, in the 45 years, from 1950 to 1995, not a single bill has been \nintroduced in the legislature to repeal it. The polls would show \noverwhelmingly it is a popular thing, but the people know if they did \nrepeal it the government would go broke. We would not have any BMW's \ncoming from South Carolina. We would not be correcting the illiteracy. \nWe would not be giving the youngsters an opportunity in public \neducation.\n  So, let us get away from this cancer, in addition to the interest \ncosts on the national debt, of how well the President or the Congress \nis up or down in the polls.\n  We have a job to do. Under this job, let us have truth in budgeting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will just repeat what I said a couple of \ntimes here on the floor. We talk about who is at fault in these various \nthings, in the impasse we have that has furloughed so many hard-working \npeople. I could not help but think the other day, when I heard the \nSpeaker of the House talking about the kind of discipline they now have \nin the House and how they are able to move, ``We told the American \npeople we would do certain things and by golly we are doing them right \non time''--et cetera.\n  One of the things they did was take over control of both bodies. And \none of the things you are supposed to do, and get paid to do, is to \npass appropriations bills on time--for example, all 13 by the end of \nthe fiscal year in September. What they have not told the American \npeople is that you have hired us to run the Congress, pay us over \n$130,000 a year to do that, but we failed to get our work done on time \nin September. We passed and had signed into law only two of the 13 \nappropriations bills. Today there are only about 4 of the 13 that have \nbeen signed into law. That is why we are debating what kind of \ncontinuing resolution we might have.\n  I cannot remember a time in my 21 years here--and I have been in the \nSenate, first under Democratic leadership and then under Republican \nleadership then under Democratic leadership and then under Republican \nleadership--I cannot remember a time that the Congress has been so \nderelict in passing and getting signed into law our appropriations \nbills. That is what has happened. That is why we are in the problem we \nare in.\n  Every appropriations bill begins in the other body. It is the other \nbody that has a Speaker who talks of the tremendous control he has over \nthe House and tells us how, now that we have this Contract With \nAmerica, there is a new majority ruling and they will run things. They \nought to at least run the trains on time.\n  The fact of the matter is, they were a dismal failure in just passing \nthe legislation that Members of Congress are supposed to pass every \nyear. There are certain things we have to do. You raise the flag up on \nthe roof when you go into session. You turn the lights on. You show up \nfor work. And you pass the appropriations bills.\n  Nobody has been over here filibustering the appropriations bills. \nYet, probably it is the most dismal record of passing bills in \nanybody's memory in Congress. I think they virtually guaranteed we \nwould have this shutdown. I can remember some years we might have \ngotten 10 of the 13 passed and we had to have a continuing resolution \nfor a week or two, into October, to get the other 2 or 3 passed. But to \nhave nine of them not passed by now? To have nine when you are 6 weeks \npast the date? If anybody was running a business and had employees who \nwere that tardy, they would fire them all. They would fire them all.\n  Then we hear on some of the things when he finally does take an \ninterest, when the Speaker has taken an interest--he has taken an \ninterest in one thing, in the farm programs. He has announced to the \nSenate, which passed a dairy compact 2-to-1, he is just going to take \nthat out. It does not affect his little district in Georgia so, even \nthough it affects all the Northeast, he is just going to take it out. \nAll New England--he is just going to take it out, regardless of the \nfact the Senate passed it 2 to 1 with Republican and Democratic \nmajorities on it. He will just take it out. He says next time around he \nwill take out anything else that affects us.\n  Frankly, I would be happy to have the Speaker of the House come up to \nVermont and see how hard dairy farmers work. In fact, I guarantee, so \nhe will be in a good mood, he can ride in the front of the airplane and \nhe can come out the front door of the airplane. We will have somebody \ngreet him there. While he will not have the chauffeurs and bodyguards \nhe might have here, I will personally drive him. He can ride right up \nfront. We will give him an ice cream cone and give him anything else he \nwants. We will make sure we give great attention and deference to him, \ntalk to him whenever he wants. I will shine his shoes, do whatever he \nfeels is his due. He should come up and see just how hard farmers work \nin Vermont.\n  He should come up and see how hard farmers work in Vermont. He should \ncome up and see how hard a lot of other people work in Vermont. He \nshould see how hard the Immigration and Naturalization Service works in \nVermont for all of us, Republicans and Democrats, and independents \nalike. He should see how hard the people who run our Forest Service \nwork in Vermont, the people who have been furloughed because of temper \ntantrums over where he may sit on the airplane. He should see how hard \nthe people work who have to pay the mortgage, have to pay the tuition, \nand have to pay the children's dental bills. He should see how hard \nthey work, those people now without a job because under his control and \nhis leadership, the majority control, we have one of the most dismal \nrecords of passing appropriations bills that I can remember in my 21 \nyears here.\n  During that whole time I have never, during Democratic Presidents, \nRepublican Presidents, seen the Congress so lax in doing what we are \npaid $133,000 a year to pass the bills that keep this Government \nrunning.\n  You could vote to change this way or that way. They have the \nmajority. They can pass them in any form they want. But at least pass \nthem. Do it. Get it passed. There has never been a situation like this.\n  So, in case you start wondering who is at fault, are we at fault? Is \nthe Government closing down because the Speaker did not get the seat he \nwanted on Air Force One? Most of this country would feel pretty \nprivileged to ride on Air Force One, if they just wanted to go to a \nfuneral or something. Are we closing the Government down for that? \nApparently, that is one reason. But the biggest reason even predates \nthat. The biggest reason is people are supposed to keep these things \nrunning, and they did not get things done on time. They did not get \ntheir work done in time. They have not completed their work, and there \nwe stand.\n  So I have heard those who are speaking here. The distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, former Governor of his State, a good \nfriend, Senator Hollings, made a very good point here.\n  I simply close with this, Mr. President. Let us not talk about \ngamesmanship. Let us stop trying to say who is up in the polls this \nday, who is up in the polls tomorrow, who is going to be running in \nthis Presidential primary, who is going to be running in that, and who \nis going to have their face on Time, or Newsweek, or U.S. News this \nweek, or who is going to be on there next week. Let us at least do the \nGovernment's business. We will vote different ways on different issues. \nRepublicans will vote differently than Democrats on some, and different \nDemocrats will vote differently than each other. Some Republicans will \nvote differently than each other. But at least get the bills up and get \nthem passed.\n  Let us do the things we are hired to do. Let us at least pass the \nbasic bills \n\n[[Page S 17139]]\nthat run the Government as we are hired to do. The new majority may \nwell change what they think the priorities are with the Government. \nThey have the right to do that. But at least get it done.\n  This is sort of like having somebody who is going to repair the roof \non your house before the thunderstorm comes, and they keep coming to \nyou every day and saying, ``We will be there. We will be there. Keep \npaying us. You paid us to fix the roof. We will get there someday. We \nwill get there someday.'' In the meantime, thunderstorms come.\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota, is that not so?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one brief question, I will \nmake it a brief question.\n  He raises the point about the continuing resolution and where we are \nat the moment. I made a point on the floor earlier today about two \nlittle issues, actually two issues--one little, and one big--that sort \nof described the dilemma of this continuing resolution. One is a \nprogram called star schools, and the other is a program called star \nwars. I have some additional information.\n  I was wondering if the Senator from Vermont knows the information. I \nwas unaware of it until I looked into it. Star schools is a tiny little \nprogram designed to improve math, science scores, to help schools \nadvance, to help kids, and it is an investment in education to create \nstar schools. It was funded at only $25 million for the whole country. \nUnder this continuing resolution, this program is going to go from $25 \nmillion down to $15 million. So it is going to lose 40 percent of its \nfunding because the House wants to kill the whole program.\n  So this continuing resolution says on star schools you kick 40 \npercent of the funding out. But another program, star wars--the star \nwars program for which the administration requested $371 million for \nR That is all they requested. They requested no money for \ndeployment. The Congress said in their bill let us stick in an extra \n$300 million for deployment. We invest. You spend that.\n  So what happened in this continuing resolution? The continuing \nresolution means that the star wars gets $300 million extra money, and \nStar Schools gets 40 percent less. If there ever is a vivid description \nof warped priorities, it is the juxtaposition of star wars and Star \nSchools. That is what this is about.\n  I ask the Senator. When people come to the floor and say, ``This is a \ntiny little decision, it is 7 years, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice,'' is it not true that it is much more than that? Because this \ncontinuing resolution, which is 15 pages long, also says to Star \nSchools, guess what? You are unworthy. We cut you 40 percent, and then \nallows generously $300 million more for star wars. This is about big \nguys and little guys, about big interests and little interests. That is \nwhat this is all about. Guess what? Is it not true that the big \ninterests get rewarded and the little get penalized?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is. I say to my friend that, if we wanted to simply \npass a continuing resolution to have the Government continue, we could \ndo that in a one sentence--in one sentence say we will continue the \nexpenditures at whatever percentage until such a time as the \nappropriations bills are passed. But instead we have not done what the \npublic is led to believe with a simple continuing resolution. But every \nsingle piece of special interest legislation that can be packed on in \nthe back room somewhere with no debate. That is what this continuing \nresolution is. It is a continuing resolution that rewrites the farm \nbill. It rewrites our education bill. It rewrites health, and does all \nthese things with no hearings, no votes--done in a back room.\n  Why not do what the American people pay us to do? Bring up each of \nthe appropriations bills, and in those if they want to cut out the \nmoney for education and star schools or anything else, then have a vote \nso that people can look and say, ``This Senator voted for the education \nbill. This Senator voted against the education bill. Here is their \nreason.'' Be accountable. But no. We do not do it.\n  If we are going to have star wars to defend against the Soviet Union, \nfor those who have not been reading the newspapers and do not \nunderstand where the Soviet Union is today, then at least have a vote \non it. Vote to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of our tax \ndollars, or vote against it. But stand up and be accountable.\n  What we are doing is saying we will take care of all these special \ninterests. We will get rid of all these things people might want. But \nthere will not be any fingerprints on them.\n  It makes me think of the days when I was a prosecuting attorney, and \nwe would come in and realize the burglar had worn gloves. That is what \nhappened here. The burglar is wearing gloves.\n  I have cast a lot of votes that I knew would be unpopular in this \nbody in the last 20 years. But I am willing to stand up and do them. \nThis is something being done by people who do not even have to vote. \nLet us vote on it. If we are going to fund a B-2 bomber, vote on it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. In just a moment, because of my great respect for the \nSenator from Alaska. He and I serve on the Appropriations Committee. We \nusually get at least most of the bills passed by the end of September. \nThat is my point.\n  I, of course, yield to the Senator from Alaska for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the continuing resolution is even more \nfair than in the past. In the past we took the lower of the House or \nthe Senate figure. This time there is a 60 percent, in the event that \ndefunded items are in the budget this year. That is much more fair than \nin the past during the time the Senator's party was controlling the \nCongress, and we had Republican Presidents. What is more unfair than in \nthe past?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might respond to my friend, the point I make is this. \nI do not remember a time in this body--and he has been here longer than \nI--a time under either the Republican leadership in the Senate or the \nDemocratic leadership, under Republican Presidents or Democratic \nPresidents, that we were so derelict in the number of appropriations \nbills that have passed--certainly by the middle of November--passed and \nsigned into law. I can remember sometimes we had continuing resolutions \nfor a few. But I can think of sometimes, certainly in the last 3 or 4 \nyears, when we had all thirteen passed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield again, I can \nremember distinctly the times back in the days when we had the \nRepublican majority in the 1980's when we had the problems with regard \nto the House, and we had continuing resolutions that had all 13 bills \nin it.\n  As a matter of fact----\n  Mr. LEAHY. For how long? A week?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was the Armed Services bill----\n  Mr. LEAHY. For a week or maybe 2 weeks in October but never mid-\nNovember. Never mid-November.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my question to the Senator again. We gave the \nPresident a continuing resolution from October 1 until November 13. We \nare under the second continuing resolution now. As a matter of fact, \nthe resolution before us is again short term. The Senator is making it \nlook like--does the Senator wish the public to understand we have cut \nthose programs in this bill? This does not cut them. It preserves their \nfunding for 2 weeks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yielded for the question. I would say \nthis: Before the Senator from Alaska came in, it was pointed out that \nwe cut Star Schools very substantially in this continuing resolution \nand increased very substantially star wars beyond what the President--\n--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? It is just not \ntrue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could, just for a moment. It is, if you read the \ncontinuing resolution. My point is this--and I think the Senator from \nAlaska would have to agree--never have we been down to mid-November--to \nmid-November--with so few--in fact, before Monday I think we had only 2 \nof the 13 appropriations bills signed into law, and on Monday we had \nsigned 3 of the 13. I guess now we sent down another one. But does the \nSenator from Alaska remember any time under either Republican or \nDemocratic leadership that we were down to mid-November with only two \nof the appropriations bills signed into law? \n\n[[Page S 17140]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to answer that if I may. In 1988, we \nhad a continuing resolution that had all 13 appropriations bills. Three \nof them had not even been considered by the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Was that November 15?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This was November, yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, it was \na time of the Nicaragua contra aid problem, if the Senator will \nremember. But we had all of them in the bill at one time. And at that \ntime the Senator's party was in the majority.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But not down this late. Not down this late, I would say to \nthe Senator from Alaska. Not this late into the session.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As a matter of fact, if the Senator will yield again, \nthe Senator will recall there was a sequestration ordered that year. It \nwas late. We finally had to pass a continuing resolution to suspend the \nsequestration under the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, my question to the Senator is, he implies that we have \nraised star wars by this bill. We are going to bring to the floor--we \njust got the agreement now--the Defense Department appropriations bill \nfor this coming year. It deals with the star wars issue. Because of the \nfact that bill is almost ready to go, it appears that it is higher than \nthe other funding, but the other funding is in another bill. We are \ncontinuing the funding for the Star Schools for a 2-week period rather \nthan leave them out altogether.\n  Does the Senator object to that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have also seen, I would say, Mr. President, in these \ncontinuing resolutions, we have even arranged a way to do the LIHEAP \nprogram. I will give you some idea of what happens when you do not pass \nyour appropriations bills on time.\n  The LIHEAP program is to provide heating assistance for those of us \nin States with severe weather, none more severe than the Senator from \nAlaska, obviously. But in my own State we have 25- and 35-below-zero \ndays. This is to give heating assistance to the people, aid in heating \nto the poorest people in our States, to help them weatherize their \nhomes, or whatever else. Not only is the program cut substantially, but \nit is set up so you can pay out only \\1/365\\ per day. So, in other \nwords, if you are in Montana or Alaska or Vermont and it is 25 or 30 \nbelow zero in January, you are told: Sorry, we do not have enough, but \ncome back in June and we will probably be able to take care of you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I remember the time when because of the controversy over \nthe SST we carried through the continuing resolution to the following \nMarch. Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. On one bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As a matter of fact, in 1988----\n  Mr. LEAHY. On one bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. When we had that, it was December when we had this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do not remember. I must admit that was before --\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator know Star Schools are forward funded? \nIt is not affected by this bill at all.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The SST, I would say, was before I was old enough to be in \nthe Senate so I will have to take the remembrance of the Senator from \nAlaska on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Thurmond and I remember that very well. We \nstepped off the Mayflower and voted at that time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The SST was before I had reached the constitutional age of \n30 to be here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, will the Senator answer my question? Does he know \nthat Star Schools are forward funded; they are not affected by this \nbill at all?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will tell the Senator to go back to the comments made \nearlier by the Senator from North Dakota who read the specific chapter \nand verse.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish I would get a chance to talk to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota about that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sure the Senator will.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I hope the Senator will not mislead the public here as \nto the Appropriations Committee, on which we both serve so well. I \nthink we try to do our best. And this bill is a better bill than \nprevious continuing resolutions. It leaves out less programs as a \nresult of its total breadth than have been covered by prior continuing \nresolutions. Under that circumstance, it should be readily approved by \nthe President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, I have \nalways enjoyed, and I think enjoyed more, serving on appropriations \nthan any other committee. One of the reasons for that is my \nrelationship with the Senator from Alaska. I know of nobody who works \nharder. I have no higher respect for anybody than he. And he and I have \nserved on several subcommittees together. I probably now ruined his \nelectoral chances in Alaska by saying nice things about him here.\n  The fact of the matter is there was no Nicaragua Contra debate, there \nwas no sequestration debate, there were none of these things that \nstopped us from getting the appropriations bills through, bills that \nbegin in the other body, at the time we are required to, expected to \nand paid to. That is the end of September.\n  But when I hear the Speaker of the House tell about how they are able \nto do all the things they are supposed to do, and they are running \nthings on time and all, the fact of the matter is these bills begin \nover there and have not gone through at the speed they should, and were \nall the appropriations bills done, we would not have a Government \nshutdown. In those areas where we have passed appropriations bills, \nthere are no shutdowns.\n  All I am saying is let us stop worrying about who sat where on the \nway to a funeral or who got off which door. Let us get on with the \nbusiness.\n  I think the Senator from Alaska may recall this. I started saying in \nAugust, in July, that Democrats and Republicans have got to sit down \nand start figuring out how to get these budgets through; that there \nwill not be a Clinton budget exactly, there will not be a Gingrich \nbudget exactly, there will not be a Stevens or a Leahy budget exactly. \nBut all of us working together could get a budget that might make sense \nfor the country.\n  I see my friend from New York is here, and he has been waiting at a \ntime when others were waiting, such as my friend from Washington, so I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to strongly support \nand endorse the underlying resolution, House Joint Resolution 122, \ncalled the continuing resolution.\n  I doubt if the American people really know what a continuing \nresolution is, but let me say one thing. I have no doubt that the \nAmerican people are absolutely fed up with what they see going on. I \nhave no doubt that the American people do not want us to continue doing \nbusiness as usual. Some want us to just continue our merry way--spend \nand spend, tax and tax for programs that they have decided are good for \nthe American people whether they like them or not. We have colleagues \nhere who have said we are going to give the American people health care \nwhether they like it or not. That is the kind of attitude. That is why \nthe people are angry.\n  People voted for change. They voted for change in 1992. They did. And \nin 1994, when they saw that it did not happen, they said, by gosh, we \nwant you to change things. We want you to really keep your commitment.\n  Now, President Clinton, for all his noble politicking--and he is good \nat it--has a happy facility of forgetting what he says. He will say \njust about anything to get your vote or to go up in the popularity \npolls, and then when it becomes a little tough, he goes the other way \nor conveniently forgets when the pressures from his party come up. When \nhe ran in 1992, he was the new Democrat. He was going to change things. \nHe was going to cut taxes for working middle-class families. That was \nhis promise. Not only was he going to cut taxes, he was going to \nbalance the budget in 5 years--not 7 years, not 10 years--5 years.\n  Promises made; promises broken. And that is why in 1994 you saw a \nrevolution. People said, we are sick and tired of it. And we want \npeople who are going to go down and do the job. All over the country \nthey sent a message. \n\n[[Page S 17141]]\n Wherever there was an open seat, they elected Republicans who said, \nyes, we are going to cut taxes, cut spending, we are going to let \nmiddle-class working families keep their money, and we are going to \nhave less Government--that was the message--and balance the budget over \n7 years.\n  Here you have a President that said, ``I'm willing to balance the \nbudget in 5 years.'' And yet he is having trouble saying, ``Yes, I'll \ndo it in 7.'' Here is a President who said we are going to use the real \nlegitimate figures to ascertain what economic growth is, how much money \nwe owe, how much money we do not. That is called the Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO. Most Americans do not understand, but here is the \nPresident, and he says, ``I'm going to balance the budget in 5 years. \nAnd I'm going to give tax cuts to working middle-class families. We're \ngoing to use the Congressional Budget Office to be the official \naccounter for whether or not a budget is in balance,'' and now, 1995, \nhe has forgotten that.\n  I am proud that those men and women who were elected for change are \ndown here fighting for change. I do not think we are doing a good job \nin getting the message out. I think we are doing a terrible job. I \nthink the President is beating our pants off. And the media loves him \nand they play his score. What do we hear? We hear the President \nsanctimoniously saying, ``I have to tell you I'm not going to allow \nthem to cut programs for the senior citizens, Medicare, Medicaid, and \ngive tax breaks to the wealthy.'' That is hokum, Mr. President. That is \njust simply an overstatement and an exaggeration that comes down to \nbeing untruthful. It is disingenuous.\n  As a matter of fact, the cuts he has proposed in Medicare, or \nreducing the rate of growth, in many cases, parallel those that we have \nput forth, in many cases. Now, let us take a look at the so-called tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  We have proposed, and the President will not even come to the table \nto discuss it, a package of $245 billion worth of tax cuts. Here is a \nfamous Governor from my State, a Democrat, who said something many \nyears ago that we should refer to. He said, ``Let's look at the \nrecord.'' So we look at the record to see exactly where the so-called \ntax cuts go. We will find they do not go to the wealthy people. Indeed, \n70 percent, $171.46 billion, 70 percent, goes to family relief. I hear \nall of this jargon and all this talking and all the crocodile tears \nabout ``we care about families.'' Well, we do. We really do. And that \nis what this tax package puts forth, $171.46 billion in tax relief for \nthe working middle-class families of America.\n  And indeed, the child tax credit, if you are talking about one \nperson, it is phased out at $70,000; a couple it is phased out at \n$110,000. So we are talking about giving relief for families under \n$100,000. Most of them, the bulk of them, fall in this $50,000 to \n$70,000, $45,000 to $70,000 area. They are not wealthy people. So 70 \npercent--and let me give you a breakdown.\n  When we talk about the child tax credit, that means if you have a \nchild you will get back $500 in taxes that you would otherwise pay. A \nfamily of three, $1,500. That is pretty good. Families earning $45,000 \na year, that means they can keep $1,500 that they can invest, that they \ncan spend, that they can save. They will make a determination, not some \nbureaucrat down in Washington. I like that. That is $147 billion of the \ntotal of $245 billion that just goes to families who have children.\n\n  Mr. President, I heard a lot of talk about the marriage penalty. I \ndaresay, many people will say, what are you talking about, a marriage \npenalty? Under the Tax Code, if a couple gets married, they can have \nthe same incomes, they join, and they wind up paying more than if they \nlived separate and apart or lived together and were not married. It is \ncalled a marriage penalty.\n  We are talking about trying to bring American families together, \nhelping families. Government cannot do it by way of stepping in itself. \nBut it can relieve some of the inequities, some of the burdens. They \ncan say, if you have children, you are to get $500; if you are going to \nget married, we are not going to penalize you for getting married. We \nbegin to phase it out. That is a small step. That is $8 billion worth \nof relief.\n  Let me ask you, Mr. President, is a child tax credit for the wealthy \nor is it really going to most working middle-class families? Is phasing \nout the marriage penalty for the wealthy or is it going to working \nmiddle-class families who are being penalized for doing, I guess, that \nwhich we want to encourage--people getting married--as opposed to \npeople living together who do not get married paying less taxes? We \npenalize people for getting married? There was this--ever since I was a \nkid I heard politicians talking about doing away with this, phasing it \nout. Here we start to do it. That is $8 billion.\n  We talk about the homeless and we talk about abandoned children and \nwe talk about those who need help. And almost $2 billion, $1.9 billion, \nin this family package--you know, you hear ``family friendly''--this is \na tax-friendly package. It is a tax-friendly package for families. And \n$2 billion is to be provided for those families who want to adopt \nchildren. It seems to me we have had so much in the way of discourse \nand disagreement as it relates to children, those who are unwanted. And \nhere we provide an opportunity for those families who are willing to \ntake in children, to make it possible for them to pay the cost that \notherwise, in many cases, would keep poor families and working middle-\nclass families from adopting a youngster who would have no home, who \nwould be in foster care, who would be a charge of the State. That is $2 \nbillion.\n  I do not hear anybody--Mr. President, why do you not tell the \nAmerican people? Do you support giving credits for families who are \ngoing to adopt children or are you opposed to it? Are you opposed to a \n$500 tax credit for children for working families? Are you for it or \nagainst it? Do you want to keep the marriage penalty in place? Are you \nfor it or against it? Is that for the wealthy families or is that for \nmiddle-class Americans?\n  Student loans: We provide $1 billion to help. I would like to see it \nmore. And maybe if we got to compromise and sat down with the \nPresident, began the work, we would find some more money for students. \nMr. President, $1 billion.\n  Tax deductions for elderly parents living with their children: Do we \nwant to see elderly parents placed as charges of the State who are poor \nor do we want to provide some incentive for youngsters to keep their \nelderly parents in their homes? That is almost $1 billion.\n  We add that up, it is almost $160 billion, Mr. President. Now, let me \ntell you, I said $171 billion. And 70 percent of all the taxes go to \nfamilies. I am a little bit short, $11.8 billion short.\n\n  IRA's, individual retirement account: One of the things we do is we \nsay, for those spouses who are taking care of children, who are taking \ncare of the home, should they not be entitled to an IRA and not be able \nto put $2,000 aside for their retirement for the days when they become \nelderly? Is that something that is used by the wealthy or is it \nsomething that will be used by working middle-class families? The vast \nbulk of that will be working-class families. So $11.8 billion in \nindividual retirement accounts is made available.\n  So, Mr. President, we come up to $171.46 billion, and 70 percent of \nthe so-called tax cut for the wealthy goes to families. If you make \nmore than $110,000, you do not qualify for most of that or any of that. \nWhere does the balance go? Let me talk to you about some of the \nbalance.\n  Long-term care insurance: a deduction. All right. Should people be \npermitted to go out and buy insurance for their long-term care if they \nhave a catastrophe or do you want them to be Government charges? We \nprovide $5.7 billion. A 50 percent deduction for small business \ninsurance, $1 billion. That is $6.7 billion. Small business being able \nto deduct expenses for purchases of equipment, $3 billion.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you that when President Clinton says that \nwe are cutting programs to advantage the wealthy, that is just not \ntrue. It is disingenuous. And I would debate with the President any \ntime on the business of whether or not we should have a tax cut that is \ngoing to help create jobs, because let me tell you something, I--think \nwe do need that.\n  I think we need a capital gains tax cut. And we do provide for that, \nand it does and will help creativity, job expansion, capital formation. \nIt will \n\n[[Page S 17142]]\nbring about more in the way of jobs and more in the way of revenue. \nAnd, indeed, as Al Smith said, ``Let's look at the record.'' It was \nJohn F. Kennedy who brought in a capital gains tax cut that produced \nrevenue. Somehow our colleagues like to forget that. If you give \nbusiness the opportunity to expand, reward people for investment, they \nwill do exactly that, you will get more economic activity, you will get \nmore jobs, you will get more growth.\n\n  So, Mr. President, with any reasonable calculations, more than 80 \npercent of tax cuts that we have provided will go to individuals \nearning less than $100,000, and those tax breaks that go for capital \ngains tax cuts, I submit to you, in the fullness of time, will \nadvantage more working people, more middle-class people, more poor \npeople than bigger spending, than larger deficits\n  I think that President Clinton has an obligation to sign the balanced \nbudget act into law and stop playing political games with the economic \nwell-being of our country, and that is exactly what he is doing. He \nwill be taking a poll in about 2 hours, and his pollster will come in \nand tell him whether or not he is gaining on extending this \npolitically. If they say he continues to gain, he is going to draw this \nout. At some point in time the people are going to really make it known \nthey are holding him responsible, too, and maybe then he will begin to \nbargain in good faith.\n  I think that is a heck of a way to run Government or make policy. I \nsubmit to you that is exactly what is taking place. The American people \nwant us to balance the budget, and what this continuing resolution says \nis we will give you until December 5 to do exactly that.\n  Listen to the great commitment it has. It is a commitment that \nanybody should be willing to sign off on. It continues Government \nbasically at the same spending levels. Oh, you can make an argument \nthat there is a little percent here or there that is out of whack, but \nit continues the essential programs that people want and need. Then it \nsays in section 301(a):\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget no \n     later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored by the non-partisan \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Putting aside the legalese, that means the President would be \ncommitted, he will be making a commitment that he is going to work for \na balanced budget over the next 7 years. That is the basis on which we \ngo forward. We do not say it is our numbers, our programs, he has to \nagree with all our tax cuts and tax programs. But we do say we have to \nhave an honest method of accounting, not pie in the sky.\n  By the way, I have been here when I have seen pie in the sky. I have \nbeen here when Dave Stockman cooked the books and projected economic \ngrowth that was unrealistic and interest rates that could absolutely \nnot be achieved. If you want to balance the budget, predict a 4-percent \neconomic growth when, indeed, it is 2.3. That will bring you in tens \nand tens of billions of dollars of extra revenue. Therefore you say, \n``I balanced the budget.''\n  You predict the interest rates are going to be lower and you predict \nbillions of dollars. That is why we insist we use an honest \nscorekeeper, not your scorekeeper or mine--an honest one. If, when the \nPresident took office, he said he was going to use the Congressional \nBudget Office to be that official scorekeeper, what is wrong today? \nWhat has changed? Promises made, promises broken. The President says, \n``When I'm elected, I'm going to cut middle-class taxes.'' He raised \nthem. Then he had to say, ``I made a mistake.''\n  Did he make a mistake when he said we will use the Congressional \nBudget Office as the official scorekeeper to determine whether or not \nwe are really going to have a balanced budget? What did he mean and \nwhen did he mean it? Was he just kidding us when he made that promise \nto the American people, when he came before and addressed the Congress \nand said, ``We are going to use the CBO''? Was he kidding then and is \nhe serious now, or is he kidding now and was he serious then? Is he \njockeying for partisan political advantage, and I fear he is? I think \nthe American people know that.\n\n  The American people are not exactly throwing bouquets at us, because \nI think we have done a poor job in explaining what we are trying to do \nhere. I really do. Whether or not I got off the back of the plane, the \nbeginning of the plane, the side of the plane, they would not even let \nme on the plane. So what? And let me tell you, I went on a different \nplane and they did not even want me to go on that plane. They did \neverything they could to keep me from going. And that is a fact. That \nis a fact.\n  You want to talk about partisanship, well, let us put the \npartisanship away. Let us do the business of the people. I want to tell \nyou something, if this goes on much longer--the American people are fed \nup. They want a balanced budget, they want us to cut taxes, they want \nus to give future generations the economic opportunity that they are \nentitled to. They expect us to make the tough decisions, and if we \ncontinue this nonsense, they are going to say ``a plague on both your \nhouses,'' and they will be right. That means we have to stand tall and \ncall them the way we see them, and we also have to be open and ready to \ndeal with the President, but to deal with him honestly, and he has to \ndeal with us honestly and not the political sloganeering.\n  So, Mr. President, I support the commitment to go forward, to extend, \nyes, and to continue spending for a limited period of time basically at \nthe same rate for the next 2 weeks provided that the President says he \nagrees he is committed to balancing the budget using real numbers, \nusing the Congressional Budget Office as the real referees, not my \nfavorite guy or his favorite guy, not someone who is going to cook the \nbooks to disadvantage one side as opposed to the other, but an honest \nscorekeeper. The American people are entitled to that.\n  I ask the President of the United States, ``You tell us why you have \nchanged your mind now, why you want a new referee, your referee to call \nthe game your way? Are you really serious about doing the business of \nthe people and bringing in that impartial referee and getting down to \ndoing the business of the people?'' That is what they expect.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New \nYork for his comments. They are right on. I think he hits the nail \nright on the head. This is about the future of our children. This is \nabout balancing the budget.\n  I am glad as a member of the Finance Committee he took on all these \nassertions to talk about tax cuts for the rich. The Senator from New \nYork is right. These are tax cuts for middle-income families.\n  The only thing that would not be targeted for tax cuts for middle-\nincome families would be capital gains. The Senator from New York \ncorrectly said capital gains reductions are job-creating engines that \nemploy middle-income families. So whether you are giving them a tax \nbreak or you are giving them an opportunity to get a job, it is \ntargeted toward families of middle income.\n  We, obviously, do not do a very good job getting our message out. I \nkeep hearing over and over again--I talk to folks from Pennsylvania who \nare in the Capitol, I talk to them as they call into my office, \nwhatever the case may be. I explain to them what we do, what we are \ntrying to accomplish here, and they say, ``Why doesn't anybody report \nthat?'' Well, talk to the national media why they do not report what is \nin this bill.\n  The reason we are so passionate about sticking up for a balanced \nbudget over the next 7 years and the reason we care so much about what \nwe are doing here and why we invested all this time in putting this \nbill together is because we honestly believe that when we pass this \ninto law, the American public will approve in overwhelming numbers what \nwe do. If we thought this was bad policy, I can guarantee no one would \nbe standing here taking on every sacred cow in Washington, DC.\n  It is amazing to me some suggest this is being done on our side for \npartisan political advantage. Let me assure you--and if you do not \nbelieve me, look at the poll--let me assure you, there is little \npartisan political advantage in trying to reform Medicare, in trying to \nreform Medicaid, in trying to make decisions on education. There is no \npartisan advantage here. \n\n[[Page S 17143]]\n\n  The advantage is it is the right thing for America, for our children, \nand for our future. This has nothing to do with politics. It has \neverything to do about the future of this country. It has everything to \ndo about deeply held, passionate policy beliefs about what direction \nthis country should take.\n  That is what we are debating here. I know this is all sort of seen \nfrom the outside as sort of a squabble between the President and \nCongress and Republicans and Democrats. I assure you that this is not \npartisan politics. This is a fundamental difference of opinion about \nwhat is right for America. We believe what is right for America, which \nis in the continuing resolution, is a balanced budget--not talking \nabout it, not saying we like it, not saying that, gee, we would like to \nget there some day, but doing it. Doing it for our children.\n  I look up in the galleries and walk around here, and there are \nstudents around all the time. Sometimes I have to look down. I do not \nknow how Members around here who keep voting for more and more \nspending, more deficits, more and more passing the buck to future \ngenerations, can stare at a kid today and say, ``You pay the bill. I \nget the votes, you pay the bill.'' That is what is going on. It has \nbeen going on here on both sides of the aisle for 25 years. We are \ntrying to say today: Enough. Enough. Let us do the right thing.\n  This is not hard, Mr. President. Balance the budget using real \neconomic assumptions. How hard is this? You said you wanted to do it. \nEverything in this resolution, you have made public statements saying \nyou want to do. You want to balance the budget in 7 years. You said \nthat.\n  Now, I know promises do not mean as much down at the White House as \nthey do up here. See, we believe our promises should be kept. Those of \nus who ran--and Senator Abraham was here and the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Thompson, ran in 1994--made a promise. We said we were going to \ncome to Washington and change this town, and we were going to, first, \nbalance the budget. We happen to believe promises are made to be kept, \nnot just to get elected. There is a difference here. My dad always told \nme you do not make promises to get what you want and then go do what \nyou want. You make promises and you give your word. Remember when a \nhandshake used to mean a contract in this country? You gave your word \nand that meant everything. We did not need all these lawyers filling \nout all these forms. You gave your word.\n  There was a day when people listened to a politician who gave them \ntheir word, and they actually believed them. Think about that. You \nwatched him give a speech, and you actually believed what they were \nsaying was actually what they were going to do. Nobody believes that \nanymore. No wonder we have politicians here and politicians down at the \nWhite House who just say whatever the polls tell them to say today. No \nwonder people are sick and tired of this place. No wonder they have no \nfaith in our institutions. Promises do not mean anything.\n  I think promises do mean something. You ask me why we are stuck in \ncement over here or standing firm. Because promises mean something. We \nare going to stand firm. We are going to get a balanced budget. We will \nget a balanced budget over the next 7 years. We will. I do not know how \nlong it will take, but we will because it is the right thing to do. It \nis the right thing to do.\n  The plan we put together, while I agree with it and I think it is an \nexcellent plan, is not everything I want to do. We have a few things on \nthe agriculture side we are not particularly crazy about. Would I do it \ndifferently? Absolutely, I would. But we did the best we could. Now, is \nall that stuff negotiable with the President? Of course, it is.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a question on that point, I \nwas just listening to the President speak.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am sorry I missed it.\n  Mr. GREGG. He said--and maybe he does not understand this. He said \nthat in order to sign this continuing resolution, ``I would have to \nsign on to the Republican budget.''\n  Now, as I understand this continuing, all it says is that he must \nagree, or should agree, to join with the Congress in promoting a \nproposal that reaches balance by 2002, the practical effect of that \nbeing he can put forward his proposal and we can put ours forward, and \nwe can reach an agreement.\n  Is he right, or is my understanding of this right?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Some might find this hard to believe, but the President \nis not being forthcoming in this issue. I know you find it incredible \nthat he is not owning up to the facts.\n  I asked the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, that \nquestion earlier. By voting for or signing on to the Republican \nbalanced budget plan, the specifics--the tax cuts, the reductions in \nthe growth of Medicare, the changes in Medicare--does all that then \ncome with signing this? He said, ``No, it does not.'' It says two \nthings. I will read you this. And remember, those of you listening, the \nPresident of the United States just said--would you repeat exactly what \nhe said, or paraphrase it?\n  Mr. GREGG. Without your yielding to the floor----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. He said that to sign this continuing resolution would mean \nthat he would have to commit to the Republican budget proposal.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me read what this continuing resolution says. Do \nyou want to know who is telling the truth, what promises mean?\n\n       Section 301: The President and the Congress shall enact \n     legislation in the 104th Congress to achieve a unified \n     balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as scored \n     by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n       The unified budget in subsection (a), shall be based on the \n     most current economic and technical assumptions made by the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  That is all it says.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Therefore, when the President cited that to sign this \ncontinuing resolution, he would have to sign on to the Republican \nbudget, he was wrong. What he should have said was, to sign this \ncontinuing resolution means I have to commit to a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002, under any terms I want. That would have been his reason \nfor rejecting this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That would be the only reason you would reject this.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will ask another question. Earlier today, I heard the \nChief of Staff, who used to be the head of the OMB and the Budget \nCommittee in the House, state that the reason they oppose this \ncontinuing resolution was because it meant massive cuts in the Medicare \nProgram.\n  Now, it is my understanding--and I wish the Senator would clarify \nthis for me--first, that this budget resolution deals with \ndiscretionary spending, am I not correct? And it deals with Medicare \nentitlement spending, and this continuing resolution has no impact of \nany nature on any Medicare spending that is presently occurring, \nbecause Medicare spending is an entitlement program, is that correct?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from New Hampshire is exactly correct. To \nexplain, a continuing resolution needs to be passed because we have not \ngotten it enacted here in the Congress or signed by the President. \nDiscretionary spending--that means spending that is not mandatory, \nwhich we have to spend. These are programs that we have to appropriate \nmoney for every year. If we do not appropriate that money by October 1, \nwe then have to pass a resolution to continue spending, because if we \ndo not, no spending is permitted. That is on discretionary programs.\n  Medicare is not a discretionary program. Medicare is a mandatory \nprogram. That means the money is spent, whether we have a budget or \nnot. And so when someone says that they will be signing off on \nreductions in Medicare by signing a continuing resolution, a spending \nbill, they either fundamentally misunderstand how Government works in \nthis town--and I know the former chairman of the Budget Committee \nunderstands how the budget works--or there was a deliberate attempt to \nmislead and, I would go further, to scare seniors.\n  There is nothing here--I will read the operative part one more time:\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the 104th Congress to achieve a unified balanced budget not \n     later than the \n\n[[Page S 17144]]\n     year 2002, as scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Enact legislation. It does not say enact Senate bill such and such, \nor enact the Republican reconciliation or budget bill. It has enact \nlegislation. Very broad. It does not nail anybody down to anything.\n  Mr. GREGG. May I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I am to understand this correctly, when the Chief of \nStaff of the President comes out on the portico of the White House and \nsays to the national press, ``The reason we oppose this continuing is \nbecause it means cuts in Medicare,'' he either, one, does not \nunderstand how the continuing resolution works--which would be \ndifficult to believe in light of his history as head of OMB and head of \nthe Budget Committee--or alternatively, he is continuing this rather \njingoistic theme of trying to scare seniors without substance, which \nappears to be the policy of this White House relative to this budget \nprocess, is that correct?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think the Senator from New Hampshire is correct. I \nfinished last night reading Harry Truman's biography written by David \nMcCullough. Every time I look at the current occupants of the White \nHouse and see them get up there and say these kinds of things and \ndeliberately mislead to scare people--this is not enlightening. This is \nfear. This is just misleading people for fear.\n\n  This is from the White House. There are people all over the world who \nlook on the White House as a center of freedom, as sort of this ground \nthat democracy first took hold.\n  Here we are--have we reached that, have we really reached that low in \nthis country that we cannot sit and have an honest discussion? Do you \nknow what this continuing resolution asks for? An honest discussion. An \nhonest discussion. That is all this is.\n  A balanced budget in 7 years, sit down and negotiate, using real \nnumbers--not trumped-up numbers, not numbers that wish away problems, \nbut real numbers. An honest discussion.\n  We have a President who will not even agree to an honest discussion \non things he says he wants. We have a President who says he wants to \nbalance the budget. We balance the budget. We want it balanced. We have \na President that says he wants to end welfare as we know it. In the \nbudget bill that we have, we end welfare as we know it--frankly, pretty \nclose to what the President had suggested.\n  We have a lot of things in there that the President actually proposed \nhimself. We really did reach out. I think we--as we did in the Senate \nbill--got 87 votes on the Senate floor for the welfare reform bill. I \nthink we can get that many for this. We save the Medicare system, \nwhich, according to his trustees, his office, is going to go bankrupt \nin 6 years, 7 years.\n  He even suggested change. Sure, we can negotiate how much, what to \ndo, but we both agree it has to be brought up. He wanted a middle-\nincome tax cut for families. We provide it. You heard the Senator from \nNew York, a middle-income tax cut for families.\n  If we were talking massive buildup in defense, huge tax cuts on the \nwealthy, slashing a bunch of programs, if we were miles apart on this \nthing, then I think we could have sort of the logjam we are in now. We \nwould be miles apart. Folks, we are not miles apart.\n  For those who see this as sort of the reason we tried to get elected \nhere, to try to bring this fiscal sanity to Washington and to see that \nthe sides on this issue are so close, yet if you listen to the national \nmedia you would think that he is in California and we are in Maine and \nwe are not even talking the same language.\n  But we are not that far apart. That is the frustrating thing. Not \nonly are we not that far apart, but we are willing to negotiate to come \ncloser.\n  I know the polls are bad. As I said before, we took on sacred cows. \nWhen you take on sacred cows, you have someone standing up at the \nHouse--at the White House--out there using that position to scare \npeople, using the Presidency of the United States to scare 81-year-old \npeople. Boy, the power of the White House, the bully pulpit. The moral \ncompass for the world. We are now out to scare people who rely on \nSocial Security and Medicare to make ends meet.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn now briefly to the Hollings amendment.\n  I know he has offered this amendment, and I know he sincerely feels \nvery strongly about this.\n  I find it absolutely incredible for the Senator from South Carolina \nand the Senator from North Dakota, who was just on the floor every day \ntalking about how the Social Security are being used to ``balance the \nbudget.''\n  No. 1, I do not know how you can stand here and talk about, through \nan accounting measure, the Social Security trust funds are being used \nwhen in fact nobody is taking the money out and using it. In fact, that \nmoney that is in the Social Security surplus, the trust fund, is being \ninvested in Government bonds and earning interest, right now. And at \nthe same time, right now, the President of the United States is \nraiding--raiding--the pension funds of Federal employees--raiding them. \nNot using them for accounting purposes to balance the budget, but \nliterally reaching in there, taking the money out to pay for debt \nservice--raiding the money. Not paying interest, taking the money, \nphysically taking the money.\n  Now, I have heard a lot of demagoguery around here, but when you say \nwe are in the right because we are not going to use the Social Security \ntrust fund for accounting purposes to determine whether we have a \nbalanced budget or not, that is one thing; but when you have your \nPresident at the same time you are making that argument literally \nraiding trust funds, raiding pension funds--it is like a CEO who is \nrunning a corporation and the bank will not lend him any more money. \nWhat does he do? He raids the pension fund. Do you know what happens to \nCEO's where banks will not lend them any more money and that CEO goes \ninto the pension fund and raids the pension fund? They go to jail. They \ngo to jail. We do not raid pension funds in this country. We have a \nPension Benefit Guarantee Corporation set up so they do not raid \npension funds. Now we have all this whining and gnashing of teeth about \nusing accounting measures to determine whether we balanced the budget \non Social Security. And the President is raiding pension funds.\n\n  Where are the protestations? Where are the people grieving for the \nFederal employees who are having their pension funds raided? Where is \nthe other side saying, ``Oh, the President should not be doing this.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Wait until I am done.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I protested.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You had a chance to vote on that. Senator Moynihan \noffered an amendment to the debt limit, and in the debt limit we had a \nprovision in there saying we could not do that. We had a provision in \nthere saying you could not raid pension funds to keep the debt going.\n  Guess what? No protestations over there. They voted to strip it out. \nAnd the President vetoed it.\n  Oh, yes, you can protest. Put the votes down. Put the votes down. \nWhere are the protestations? Raiding pension funds, that is what we are \ndoing.\n  Let me just summarize it. We have a President, a Chief of Staff of \nthe White House, at the White House today, at the United States of \nAmerica's White House, out there scaring seniors; at the same time, \nraiding seniors' pension funds, who are Federal employees. Do you know \nwhat they are telling them? Do you know what they are trying to do? \n``Please trust us, we know what we are doing. Please trust us, we know \nhow to balance this budget. We are protecting you.''\n  Give me a break. Come to the table. Let us work this out. This is an \nembarrassment. The more this goes on the more embarrassing it is going \nto get. You are not solving problems, Mr. President. It is time to be \nPresident, not to run for President. It is time to be President. It is \ntime to solve problems.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could get a unanimous consent and have a \nvote on this particular amendment. I do not know how much longer you \nwould like to speak, but Senator Murray would like to speak for 6 \nminutes. \n\n[[Page S 17145]]\n Then we will vote on the Hollings amendment on a motion to table.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray be granted 6 minutes and \nSenator Santorum 6 minutes, after which we proceed to a rollcall vote \non a table. I ask it be in order at this point to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I thought I had gone over and talked to the \nleader and I thought when I came to the floor, it had been agreed.\n  Senator Murray was the only one on your side that would speak before \nwe voted on this, or I would not have imposed that. We have been on \nthis for a long time. Your side has a lot of time.\n  How much time would you want? We have another amendment from your \nside, too, shortly, right now, on this issue. How much time would you \nneed?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, I know you want to get this amendment disposed \nof. I do not want to be an impediment to it. I will take 8 minutes and \nremove my objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we add 8 minutes for Senator Bumpers and then \nproceed with the rest of my request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Give me 3 more minutes to respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To be equal, we will add 3 minutes to Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask it be in order that I seek the \nyeas and nays on a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And do we have a motion to table, that the yeas and \nnays have been ordered on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays will be ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I have it in order now, even though there is \ntime, that I ask for the--I move to table.\n  I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Federal Government is now in its \nthird day of shutdown, and just like 3 days ago, there certainly is no \nend in sight and it seems like we in Congress are destined to flounder \nfor a couple of more days because the majority is insisting on debating \na continuing resolution that the President has vowed he will veto.\n  Listening to the rhetoric of the last hour it seems to me this is \nmore about putting somebody into somebody's face than it is about \nsolving problems. It seems like it is more about drawing lines in the \nsand and calling names than it is in making sure that this country gets \nmoving again.\n  I have to ask the question, why are we doing this? Why are we not \nputting together a proposal that we can all agree on, that will get the \nGovernment running again, restore public services, and put people back \nto work?\n  I heard my colleague from Vermont a short time ago say it does not \ntake 15 pages of paper with a lot of additions. It only takes one \nsentence to get us back to work again.\n  I have to remind my colleagues the American people are tired and \nimpatient. They want solutions, not politics and rhetoric. They want to \nknow that Government works for them. They want to feel secure and have \nfaith in their elected officials.\n  Unfortunately today they are probably watching us in disbelief. They \ncannot believe we are unable to solve the country's problems.\n  That concerns me. I want to move forward. I want Congress to get its \nact together and balance this budget. And the longer we take to do so, \nthe more disaffected our constituents become. We just reinforce in \ntheir minds the belief that Congress is unaware of their real needs and \nconcerns. They look at us and they say, ``How can those people really \nunderstand how difficult it is for me to pay the rent, put food on the \ntable for my kids, or take care of my elderly parents? All they can do \nin DC is whine and squabble about where they sat on an airplane.''\n  As we muse about Presidential politics and other hi-jinks, we better \nnot forget what this Government shutdown really means. We have all \nheard the numbers. We know that 30,000 people a day are unable to apply \nfor Medicare. And we know this Government shutdown is costing us $200 \nmillion a day in lost productivity.\n  But the shutdown comes a little closer to home when we put human \nfaces on those numbers. One woman, an attorney from Seattle, called my \noffice yesterday. She is trying to adopt a child in China. For months \nshe has been filling out paperwork and dealing with bureaucratic \nredtape.\n  She finally got her plane ticket but because the United States \nConsulate in China is closed, she cannot get her baby's visa. So she \nwas forced to postpone her trip.\n  She has no idea when she will finally be united with her new baby \ndaughter. She is a real person. And she is hurting because of what we \nare doing on this floor.\n  Last weekend I was in central Washington for the opening of the \nYakima Valley Veterans Center. Many of the people I talked to wanted to \ncelebrate the opening of the new center, but because of the pending \nGovernment shutdown they were too worried about whether or not they \nwere going to receive their veterans benefits. Today's Spokesman-Review \npaper ran an article about a young man in Spokane, WA, who quit a \nstable computer-based job to take his dream job. He was going to become \na physical fitness director aboard a cruise ship. The young man was \noffered the job unexpectedly on November 4. He scrambled to get his \npaperwork taken care of and a passport in time to sail by November 25.\n\n  Unfortunately, this Government is shut down. He cannot get his \npassport and time is growing short.\n  I want to read that young man's words into the Record. They could not \nbe more to the point. He said:\n\n       This is a dream in my heart that finally manifested. The \n     Government is getting in the way of people's dreams. I've got \n     airplane tickets. Everything is settled. Everything but this \n     last hurdle.\n\n  These few people provide just a few examples of what a Government \nshutdown really means. They are angry and concerned. They have bills to \npay, families to care for, business to conduct, and dreams to fulfill. \nInstead, we are telling them, ``not now.''\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to act wisely. Let us move \non. Let us put together an honest and reasonable continuing resolution \nthat will get this country back on track.\n  My view is pretty straightforward. As a Member of the Budget \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee I know I have a job to do. \nThe job is to pass a budget plan and 13 appropriations bills. So far, \nthis Congress has done neither. In fact, just yesterday the House \nfailed to pass the Interior bill for the third time. There are five \nother bills that have not even made it to this floor yet.\n  Instead of getting our work done, we are debating a bill we know will \nbe vetoed. It will be vetoed because it stacks the deck against working \nfamilies and senior citizens in favor of unneeded tax breaks. We are \nnot moving the process forward one bit; we are ensuring that it will go \nnowhere.\n  I say it is time to get our work done. We can balance the budget. We \ncan stay true to our priorities. And we can do it without interrupting \nthe lives of regular, everyday people in our States.\n  All we need to do is pass a clean interim spending bill and then get \non with our business of finishing the overall budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I saw an article this morning where the \nSpeaker of the House was asked, ``What is sacred about 7 years?''\n  I thought that was a good question. I have been curious about that \nmyself.\n  And the Speaker said, ``Well, it was just intuition. All major \ndecisions are based on intuition.''\n  I do not like the idea of one man's intuition determining the fate of \nthe country. His intuition may not match mine. It may not match \nanybody's. Frankly, I think intuition is always a fine thing, if a man \nis getting ready to make an investment. I think his intuition is \nimportant in a lot of ways. But when it comes to putting in concrete \nthe time in which the Congress will have to balance the budget, I do \nnot want anybody's intuition. I would like to see some hard figures. \n\n[[Page S 17146]]\n\n  In this particular case, this amendment deals with Social Security. \nEverybody says we are going to balance the budget by the year 2002. If \neverything went swimmingly, according to every projection, we would \nstill, in the year 2002, have used $650 billion in Social Security \ntrust funds.\n  I am not quarreling with that. The Republicans can come back and say, \n``You did it. This President has done it.''\n  That is all well and true. But it still means there is $650 billion \nthat was used that has to be paid back, just as certainly as the \nnational debt has to be paid back.\n\n  I think I have to say the tax cut in this bill is the most repugnant \npart of it. What in the name of all that is good and holy are we doing \ncutting taxes $245 billion in the name of deficit reduction? We tried \nthat in 1981.\n  The Washington Post editorial this morning, which has been cited a \nnumber of times here today as though it came right out of the Holy \nBible, talks about how the Democrats have been demagoging the Medicare \nissue, and that Medicare really is in trouble, and that the cost of \nMedicare continues to go up. That is true. I do not quarrel with the \nidea that the Medicare system is in considerable trouble and needs to \nbe fixed. I think $270 billion in cuts out of Medicare over the next 7 \nyears is unacceptable.\n  The thing I find most unacceptable about it is that it is being used \nto provide a $245 billion tax cut. And for whom? The wealthiest people \nin America who have not asked for it. But the people who really need it \ndo not get it.\n  A Post editorial this morning obliquely suggested that the addition \nof $3 trillion worth of debt during Ronald Reagan and George Bush \nPresidencies was somehow or other Congress' fault, with no mention of \nthe fact that neither one of them could ever find their veto pen when \nthey were in the President's office. President Reagan never vetoed one \nsingle spending bill, Mr. President--not one. All he did was send out \nmillions of letters saying, you know, ``I cannot spend a dime that \nCongress does not appropriate.'' Congress cannot appropriate anything \nunless they have 67 votes to overcome his veto. But he looked through \nhis desk drawer time and again and could never find his veto pen.\n  The U.S. Government now owes four times as much money as it did when \nhe took office. It took 200 years to get to $1 trillion. It took 12 \nyears to get to $4 trillion. The Nobel award-winning economist at MIT \nsaid it was the most irresponsible economic policy in the history of \nthe world.\n  On that tax cut, Mr. President, I made this point yesterday, but I am \ngoing to make it every day that I can get the floor. You hear this \nunctuous, solemn business about the tax credit for our children. There \nare 5 million households in this country that have 11 million children \nin them. With those 11 million children and those 5 million households, \nthe parents--not the children--will get a partial or full $500 tax \ncredit. There are 8 million households in this country with 11 million \nchildren that will not get one single thin dime.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You bet.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Why would 8 million households not get it?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Because they have not paid income tax.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. A family with a man and a wife and three children making \n$25,000 a year do not pay any income tax. A man and wife with three \nchildren making $100,000 will pay $10,000 to $20,000. They get the full \n$1,500 refund. The people who need it, the man and wife with three \nchildren making $25,000 a year, do not get one red cent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does a family of three making $100,000 a year qualify \nfor the EITC?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Do they qualify for what?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does a family of three earning $100,000 qualify for the \nearned income tax credit?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Certainly. I hope so.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does a family making $320,000 a year qualify?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. They used to qualify for it. I do not know whether they \nare going to or not. That is another $32 billion.\n  We are not just depriving people of an education. We are not just \ndepriving people of school lunches. We are not just putting another \nmillion children in poverty under the welfare bill. We are not just \nsavaging the Medicaid Program for the poorest children in America to \nhave health care. We are also savaging a program that even Ronald \nReagan said was the best thing that was ever invented to keep people \noff welfare. We said ``no.'' No. If you are working for $4.25 an hour \nand trying to keep body and soul together and stay off welfare, in the \npast we have said, if you will stay off welfare, we will give you a \ncouple of grand at the end of the year. We are savaging that program.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania on one \nthing. I do not like taking pension funds. Do you know why we are \ntaking pension funds? Because the Senator from Pennsylvania will not \nsend a debt ceiling to the President that simply said we spent the \nmoney, let us pay for it. No. You want to put habeas corpus and \nregulatory reform on the debt ceiling, of all things. Of course the \nPresident vetoed it. I would never have voted for him again if he had \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, just by way of quickly responding to the \nearned income tax credit under the conference report that will be \ncoming out, no one, with the exception of families who have no \nchildren, no family that has children will get less money under it than \nthey would have gotten under current law. No family will get less money \nunder the earned income tax credit next year than they would have under \ncurrent law. Some will get more because some qualify also for the tax \ncredit for children. That is in the bill.\n  So do not talk about slashing the EITC, [the earned income tax \ncredit], for working families. We do not. In fact, the increase that is \nprojected that is in law under the President's 1993 Budget Act--those \npeople at least get that much, and some will get more. Particularly \nfamilies who are in the $15,000 to $20,000 to $25,000 range will \nactually get more because some of them actually do pay taxes.\n  I will be happy to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, what is the situation on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it would be interesting, would not it, to look in on \nthis recent conversation, this recent debate if you came from somewhere \nand you knew nothing about the background of what was going on here? I \nsuppose you would say, ``Gosh. What is this all about? What is the \nissue here?'' We are talking about all kinds of things. We are talking \nabout Medicare, slashing Medicare, when in fact it does not slash \nMedicare. We are talking about raising premiums on Medicare when in \nfact it does not raise premiums at all. They stay where they are.\n  You would say, ``Gosh. What is happening? What is this?'' You would \nhear this morning the Senator from Nebraska saying this resolution is \nridiculous. It deals with balancing the budget. I think you would go on \nto say there are some principles. What is ridiculous about a principle \nof balancing a budget that this body has not balanced for 30 years?\n  It would be interesting to sort of sum up the years that the \nopposition on that side of the aisle has been in this place and never \nhas balanced a budget. They talked about it. They say now we are for a \nbalanced budget. For 30 years they have not balanced the budget.\n  You would say, ``Gosh. What is going on here?'' Everyone who has \nrisen has said, ``I am for balancing the budget.'' And it has not \nhappened. I guess they would say, ``What is wrong?'' People who ran in \nthe last election particularly said we have a priority to balance the \nbudget. That is what we are talking about doing here. \n\n[[Page S 17147]]\n\n  I guess you might also be surprised at how difficult it would be if \nyou were a newcomer looking at it, and saying, ``Gosh. What should be \nso difficult about balancing the budget?'' You do it in your family, \nand I do it in my family. You do it in my business because you have to. \nDo you do it in government? Is that not financially and fiscally \nresponsible as we move into a new century? Is it not responsible to \nbalance the budget rather than continuing to charge it to your children \nand your grandchildren? Is that what it is about? If that is the issue, \nwhy are we talking about all of these other things?\n  A balanced budget is not extraneous. Someone rose this morning and \nsaid, ``Oh, gosh. This continuing resolution has extraneous materials \non it.'' Balancing the budget is, after all, the key issue. All we are \nasking is that the President certify that in 7 years he will join us in \nbalancing the budget, and use the Congressional Budget Office numbers \nthat the President said in his State of the Union Message we all needed \nto use so we all work in the same place. It is not a new idea.\n  The minority leader, who a short while ago objected to the idea of \nCBO, stood up not 2 weeks ago and said we all will do whatever \naccommodation to use CBO numbers.\n  So I think you would say, gosh, what is it? You would probably soon \nrecognize that part of it is philosophical. There is a difference in \nview. There is a legitimate view among liberals that we ought to have \nmore Government and more spending. That is a legitimate view. I do not \nshare it. I do not think the majority of people here share it. \nNevertheless, there is a populace view that is there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Order in the Senate, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chamber will be in order. May we have \norder in the Chamber, please?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, life does not often provide second \nchances, but the Congress is giving President Clinton just that. With \nthis continuing resolution, we are providing the opportunity for him to \nright the terrible wrong committed by vetoing the previous continuing \nresolution and shutting down the Government. This resolution will allow \nthe U.S. Government to reopen and remain open while Congress and the \nPresident resolve outstanding issues on the remaining appropriations \nbills and the Balanced Budget Act.\n  As a Presidential candidate, and early in his Presidency, President \nClinton told the American people that he wanted to balance the budget. \nHere is his chance to fulfill that pledge, since he has failed to send \na balanced budget plan to Congress. President Clinton said he wanted to \nuse Congressional Budget Office numbers. Here is his chance to commit \nto that. President Clinton recently stated that he raised taxes too \nmuch. The Congress will give him a chance to correct that mistake and \nfulfill his pledge for a middle-class tax break.\n  Madam President, President Clinton's veto of the previous continuing \nresolution brought the Federal Government to a standstill. Here is his \nchance to right that wrong. President Clinton must put aside his \nreelection concerns and focus on his responsibility to govern. By \nagreeing to this continuing resolution, he can do the right thing, \nrestore full Government services and put the hundreds of thousands of \nFederal workers who are facing the holidays without a paycheck back to \nwork immediately.\n  Congress and the President previously approved a continuing \nresolution which funded the Government through November 13. The \nCongress sought to extend it earlier this week, for the purpose of \navoiding a shutdown of the Federal Government. We are giving President \nClinton another chance to keep the Government operating and to fulfill \nhis promise to balance the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3057\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, subject to the majority leader's \nintention, as I understand it, we may set this bill aside. But given \nthe informal agreement we had this morning, I now send the second \nDemocratic amendment to the desk--I guess it is the third Democratic \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3057.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       Section 106(C) of Public Law 104-31 is amended by striking \n     ``November 13, 1995'' and inserting ``December 22, 1995.\n       Sec. 2. (a) The President and the Congress shall enact \n     legislation in the 104th Congress to achieve a unified \n     balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) The unified balanced budget in subsection (a) must \n     assure that:\n       (1) Medicare and Medicaid are not cut to pay for tax \n     breaks; and\n       (2) Any possible tax cuts shall go only to American \n     families making less than $100,000.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, I would just like to give the body a \nbrief report on the process of the Appropriations Committee of the \nSenate and where our bills are at the moment.\n  I would like to, first of all, indicate that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported all 13 bills to the floor by \nSeptember 27. The Senate has acted upon 12 of those 13 bills. I, first \nof all, say they were reported by September 15, and we acted upon 12 of \nthe 13 in the body by September 27. Right at the moment, four of those \nbills have been signed into law by the President. We have concluded the \nconference on three more, and we expect to conclude our conference on \nVA-HUD and the District of Columbia within either hours or within the \nnext day or two.\n  So we can say that that is the movement. \n\n[[Page S 17148]]\n\n  There is one bill that has eluded us, and that is the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill upon which the Senate has not acted. I want to say \nfurther that as we consider the continuing resolution, if this one is \npassed and vetoed or if the next one is passed and agreed to, we have \nto have a benchmark in relation to how we are going to fund Labor-HHS.\n  Up until now, the other side of the aisle has not permitted us to \nmove to bring up the Labor-HHS to be considered here on the floor.\n  So I think in order that we as the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee--I speak at least for myself--I would like to be able to \nconclude our job on the Senate side. It has to go to conference, of \ncourse, with the House-passed bill.\n  I would like to propound a unanimous-consent agreement at this time. \nI ask unanimous-consent that the majority leader, upon consultation \nwith the minority leader, be authorized to call up H.R. 2127, the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill for 1996.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There are a number of provisions that are troubling to a \nnumber of Senators who believe in a woman's right to choose, and that \nis one of the reasons why we have had trouble agreeing to bringing up \nthe bill. So I would have to object, unless I knew that those \nprovisions were being handled. So I would object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17147-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17148-S17170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 2126 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2126) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 15, 1995.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, it is my understanding that this will not \ntake any great length of time. I am also advised that about 400,000 \ncivilians, who might be affected by the Government shutdown, are \naffected by this bill. Maybe we can pass this bill and get it down to \nthe President.\n  Unless I misunderstand it, it would be about half the total. It seems \nto me that it is something we should do as quickly as we can. I do not \nknow the President's intentions with reference to this bill. At least \nit will be another major appropriations bill that we can send to the \nPresident.\n  I also understand that we have the legislative appropriations bill \nand the Treasury, Post Office bill, which have been completed, which I \nthink would be sent to the President if there was some indication that \nhe would sign those bills. Again, that would help in some areas, and \nsome of the people who are not essential could come back to work.\n  In the meantime, I will be discussing the pending legislation with \nthe Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, this is acceptable to our side. I \nthink, also, the foreign operations bill is prepared to be sent. So we \nare making progress on some of these bills. I think it is important \nthat we get as many done as we can. Some of them are going to be \nvetoed. This may be one of them. I think it is important to keep the \nprocess moving along, and this will accommodate that need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I might state, for the Senate's \nknowledge, that we have 2\\1/2\\ hours. I do not think we will use the \nwhole 2\\1/2\\ hours. I expect the vote to take place some time right \nafter 6, depending on who else might want to speak.\n  Just to set the record straight, I had reminded the majority leader \nof the number of people in the Department of Defense that were affected \nby the furlough process, and it was our estimate that it was \napproximately 400,000 that could be affected. I am told that it is \nsomewhere around 260,000 that actually have been furloughed so far. He \nwas correct that approximately 400,000 would be affected by the bill in \nthe long run.\n  We believe it is in the best interest of all concerned to get the \nbill passed. I am hopeful that we will get word from the President that \nhe will sign it so we can expedite delivery of the bill to the \nPresident.\n  This is now the conference report on H.R. 2126, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for 1996. I first want to start off by \napplauding the House for the expeditious move on this bill today, and I \nappreciate the support of both leaders for allowing us to bring the \nbill to the Senate now.\n  Senator Inouye and I have sought to move this conference report prior \nto the commencement of the fiscal year on October 1. The original \nconference report, however, was rejected by the House. That resulted in \na substantial delay in bringing the bill before the Senate, and I take \npart of the responsibility for that. We have been negotiating for a \nperiod of time on one particular issue.\n  Before proceeding further, however, I do want to express my high \nregard and thanks to the chairman of the House Defense Subcommittee, \nCongressman Bill Young, for the work he has done on this bill. This has \nbeen the first year that he has been the chairman of that subcommittee, \nand he was the chairman of our conference, and he has shepherded this \nlarge and complex bill through the House and then the conference with \ngreat skill. His determination to meet the needs of the men and women \nof the Armed Forces shows throughout the legislation.\n  I think Members should become aware of this bill because it is a very \ndifferent defense appropriations bill.\n  I also recognize the hard work and cooperation of the ranking member \non the House side, Congressman Jack Murtha. Senator Inouye and I have \nworked with Mr. Young and Mr. Murtha for many years now, and we \nappreciate their willingness to work with us on the tough issues in \nthis bill this year.\n\n  Madam President, the conference report before the Senate now closely \nmatches the bill previously filed under the report No. 104261. That \nreport has been available to all Senators since September 25. On that \nbasis, I do not intend to take the Senate's time to detail the contents \nof the report. Instead, I want to speak to the Senate today on why we \nneed this bill now and why I feel the President should sign this bill.\n  This pending bill provides about $1.7 billion more for defense than \nwas appropriated in the fiscal year 1995. Taking inflation into \naccount, this amount represents a decline in real spending for the \nPentagon. That is the reality of this bill. It really continues, in \nterms of real dollars, a downward trend in real defense spending for \nanother year.\n  This further decline in real defense spending comes in the face of \nincreased commitments of the United States overseas, increased \ndeployments overseas, and the determination by the Joint Chiefs that we \nneed more money for modernization for the Department of Defense.\n  Let me speak first about those overseas deployments. Today, there are \n241,000 U.S. military personnel permanently stationed overseas. That \ndoes not reflect their dependents. This is military personnel. It also \ndoes not reflect the contingency deployment to Bosnia, Iraq, or Haiti. \nThese are the day-to-day demands on the men and women of the Armed \nForces. They face these demands constantly.\n  Last September, we took a trip and met with some of our military \npeople in the British Empire, in London. We found, in many instances, \nthat our pilots, for instance, have been deployed in several different \nplaces within 1 year. We are stretching these people to the nth degree \nalmost daily now, in \n\n[[Page S 17149]]\nterms of the demands that face the Armed Forces in the United States \nand throughout the world.\n  Added to these actual permanent commitments are the additional \nunplanned and unauthorized contingency missions that the Commander in \nChief has sent our military people on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table that \nshows the current overseas military deployment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Active Duty, U.S. Military Personnel Overseas\n\n       241,000 soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel and Marines \n     including:\n     212,000--ashore\n     29,000--afloat\n\n         U.S. Military Personnel in Europe and European Waters\n\n       121,000 soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel, and Marines \n     including:\n     76,000--in Germany\n     12,800--in the United Kingdom\n     11,500--in Italy\n     7,400--afloat\n     3,100--in Turkey\n     2,800--in Spain\n     2,000--in Iceland\n     1,700--in Belgium\n     1,000--in Portugal\n     734--in The Netherlands\n     620--in Macedonia\n     490--in Greece\n       These totals include the following ongoing operations:\n     Deny Flight--Bosnia No Fly Zone\n     Provide Promise--humanitarian airlifts into Bosnia\n     Sharp Guard--sanctions enforcement in the Adriatic Sea\n     Able Sentry--Macedonia border observers\n     Provide Comfort--humanitarian aid to Kurds in Iraq\n\n U.S. Military Personnel in East Asia, the Pacific Region and Pacific \n                                 Waters\n\n       92,000 soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel, and marines \n     including:\n     39,600--in Japan\n     35,800--in Korea\n     15,600--afloat\n     320--in Australia\n       These totals include the following ongoing operations:\n     Joint Task Force Full Accounting--to determine the fate of \n         American POW's and MIA's\n     Cope North and Annualex--U.S. and Japanese forces naval and \n         air defense exercises\n     Foal Eagle--U.S. and Korean forces training exercise\n\n U.S. Military Personnel in the Near East, North Africa and South Asia \n                           and Related Waters\n\n       6,100 soldiers, sailors, Air Force Personnel, and marines \n     including:\n     1,400--afloat\n     1,200--in Egypt\n     1,050--in Saudi Arabia\n     900--on Diego Garcia\n     460--in Bhrain\n     435--in Kuwait\n       These totals include the following ongoing operations:\n     Southern Watch--Southern Iraq No Fly Zone\n     Vigilant Sentinel--deterring another Iraq invasion of Kuwait\n     Arabian Gulf Maritime Interdiction Operations--enforcing U.N. \n         sanctions against Iraq\n     Bright Star--U.S. and Egyptian forces training in Egypt\n\n  U.S. Military Personnel in the Western Hemisphere and Related Waters\n\n       17,000 soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel, and Marines \n     including:\n     8,000--in Panama\n     4,600--at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba\n     2,500--in Haiti\n     1,400--afloat\n\n    U.S. Military Personnel in Sub-Saharan Africa and Related Waters\n\n       3,500 soldiers sailors, Air Force personnel and Marines.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is a very interesting chart. I invite Members of \nthe Senate to look at that. I know we cannot print the map. I will not \nask to put it in the Record.\n  We have soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in Germany, in the \nUnited Kingdom, Italy, afloat on the seven seas, in Turkey, Spain, \nIceland, Belgium, Portugal, Netherlands, Macedonia, and Greece.\n  We are continuing such as: Deny Flight to the Bosnia no-fly zone; \nProvide Promise to the humanitarian airlifts in Bosnia; Sharp Guard--\nthis is the sanctions enforcement of the Adriatic Sea; Able Sentry to \nthe Macedonia border; Provide Comfort and humanitarian aid to the \nKurds. We have soldiers in Japan, Korea, and afloat in the Pacific.\n  We have 320 in Australia. We have a whole series of movements going \non with regard to North Korea.\n  In the Near East, Asia, South Asia, 1,400 are afloat; 1,200 are in \nEgypt; soldiers and sailors and marines are in Saudi Arabia and Diego \nGarcia, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Southern Watch, the no-fly zone in Iraq, \nand another deployment to deter a further Iraqi invasion in Kuwait has \nour men and women serving where they are needed. The Arabian Gulf \nMaritime Interdiction Operations that enforce the U.N. sanctions on \nIraq, and Bright Star, the United States and Egyptian forces that are \ntraining in Egypt are just another example.\n  We have additional forces in Panama and Guantanamo Bay Naval Station \nin Cuba, Haiti, and another 1,400 afloat down in the Western Hemisphere \nand related waters. Another 3,500 soldiers and sailors and Air Force \npersonnel are in the sub-Sahara in Africa and other areas in that part \nof the world.\n  Now, Madam President, that ought to tell anyone that we are dealing \nwith a situation now that has never been faced before in peacetime. We \nare the last superpower in the world, and we are acting like one. We \nhave our Armed Forces deployed around the former Yugoslavia, in the \nCaribbean, in Southwest Asia, and Korea. I am told by the Pentagon, we \nhave 14 ongoing contingency operations.\n  Just last week five Americans died in Saudi Arabia, the victims of \nanother terrorist attack. Our forces, as I said, are in Saudi Arabia \nand will remain there because of our commitments for some time.\n  In my judgment, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot be the world's \nonly remaining superpower and continuously reduce the amount of money \navailable to the men and women who carry out these chores for us around \nthe world. We cannot respond to every world crisis, to every \nhumanitarian crisis with this military force. These forces have to be \ncarefully allocated, and it has to be thought over where we send them, \nMadam President.\n  The President has committed United States military personnel to \noperations in Somalia, Rwanda, the Middle East, Northeast Asia, the \nCaribbean, and now to the Balkans. But nevertheless, this President has \nconsistently pressed to reduce our military forces, reduce the money \nfor modernization, and reduce the spending for defense.\n  Madam President, this is a bill that will determine whether or not \nthat stops. Despite its downward trend, we have to turn the corner on \nmodernization in this bill.\n  We have critics of this bill who say we have too much money. One is \nthe President of the United States. We significantly increased the \namount of money that is available to procurement and research and \ndevelopment for the Department of Defense in this bill. We did so to \nmeet the specific priorities identified by the service chiefs \nthemselves. Every significant procurement item in this bill is included \nin the military's modernization plans except the B-2. I am including \nthe F-22, the F-18, the LHD-7 amphibious assault ship, the third DGG-51 \ndestroyer, the Army's M1-A2 tank upgrade, the Comanche Scout helicopter \nand multiyear procurement of the Longbow Apache.\n  We did not come up with these programs. They were not added and \nthought up by me. The Pentagon has requested them.\n  Now, what we have done with our modernization initiative is to save \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 10 years.\n  Think of this: In the LHD-7 alone, we are going to save $700 million \nby continuing that procurement in 1996 rather than postponing it for 4 \nyears. Now, by continuing the ongoing line, we will have another LHD-7 \nand save $700 million.\n  More importantly, we are providing equipment to meet military needs \nnow for the people who are being deployed overseas. We are doing this \nnow rather than waiting 10 years to try and modernize the equipment \nthat they are currently using.\n  Some in the House claim this bill exceeded the amounts requested by \nthe military and the Joint Chiefs. What we have learned since we passed \nthis bill in September is we actually did not go far enough.\n  Recent press reports indicate that General Shalikashvili's chairman's \nprogram assessment for the Department's 1997 budget has determined we \nshould be spending about $60 billion for procurement. The budget \npresented to \n\n[[Page S 17150]]\nthe Congress by the President was $39 billion; this bill is $44 billion \nfor procurement. We have increased the President's request, but we are \nstill considerably below the amount that is listed as being the minimum \nby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  The Chairman's assessment--and this is General Shalikashvili's \nchairman's program assessment--reflects the decisions by our national \nmilitary leaders on what we need to meet our defense obligations and to \nprovide the men and women of the Armed Forces the equipment they need \nto minimize casualties.\n  Let me add, in my judgment, this is not a political document. I am \ntalking about the Chairman's program assessment. Every member of the \nJoint Chiefs and every vice chief was appointed by this administration. \nI, for one, am willing to accept and advocate their judgment.\n  On this matter, I ask unanimous consent that recent articles from the \nWashington Post and the Los Angeles Times be printed in the record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, for these reasons alone, in my \njudgment, the President has no alternative but to sign this bill. In \nour work on this bill the conferees have sought, to the maximum extent \npossible, to accommodate the concerns of the administration on this \nbill.\n  Now, we referred repeatedly to the statements of the administration \npolicy at the request of the Joint Chiefs as we accommodated the \nPresident's and his appointees' priorities. In the case of funding for \nthe Nunn-Lugar program, we preserve $300 million for 1996. We have \nsustained $195 million for the technology reinvestment program, which \nwas a program terminated by the House.\n  One exception was that the conference provided $493 million to \nprovide one last consideration of additional production of the B-2 \nbomber. The Senate bill did not, when we passed the bill here before, \ninclude funding for the B-2.\n  We have not voted on the B-2 since the control of the Senate changed \nto our side of the aisle. The House sustained funding for the B-2 on \nthree separate votes. They were adamant that this bill come back \napproving their position on the B-2.\n  While I have some concerns about the affordability of the B-2 in the \nnext few years, this funding permits the President to make a final \ndecision in the 1997 budget. He, of course, has the right to ask for a \nrescission if he does not want the money in this bill.\n  An important initiative included in this bill and supported intensely \nby Secretary Perry is funding for contingency operations. This year, we \nhad to pass a mid-year rescissions bill that realigned over $3 billion \nto pay for overseas contingency operations. That was because they were \nnot funded in the bill that covered 1995.\n  In this bill, for the first time, we are providing money at the \nbeginning of a fiscal year for these operations. Madam President, $647 \nmillion is funded in this bill for operations in Iraq and Southwest \nAsia. The Department readily concedes that no moneys were requested in \nthe President's budget for 1996 to pay for these ongoing missions. \nEveryone agrees we must pay the bills, and we decided to include the \nmoney now rather than wait for some supplemental process next year.\n  Madam President, in my judgment, as I said, this bill must be enacted \ninto law. Looming ahead of us is the potential deployment of United \nStates military forces to Bosnia. This bill makes no provision for that \ndeployment but expresses the strong concern of the conferees about the \nmerit of this mission and the belief that the President should consult \nand seek the authorization of Congress for any such deployment.\n  Simply put, however, without the money in this bill, there is no way \nthat the Department of Defense or the President could send 25,000 \nground troops to Bosnia.\n  We cannot have it both ways, Madam President. We cannot be against \nthis bill and also want to send troops to Bosnia without money.\n  In the view of this Senator, I cannot conceive of the circumstances \nwhere the Senate would vote to endorse a deployment of United States \nforces to Bosnia if there were no funds available to support that \nmission. This is especially true if those funds were not available for \nthe Department through the 1996 bill that we have before the Senate \nnow.\n  According to the Pentagon, a full-year mission to Bosnia will cost in \nexcess of $2 billion, and only with the money that is in this bill \ncould that be possible.\n  Again, we are not crossing that bridge. I, for one, do not support \nthat deployment. However, I do believe we must be up front about it. \nLet me point out that those who do want to support a deployment of \nforces to Bosnia ought to realize it would not be possible but for the \nfunding and the way the money is divided in this bill for the functions \nof the Pentagon.\n  Let me close with this, Madam President. I hope we can sustain the \nlongstanding tradition of bipartisan action on these defense issues. \nThis bill poses no severe policy issues. It provides funding consistent \nwith the congressional budget resolution and the Appropriations \nCommittee's 602(b) allocation to this subcommittee for the Department \nof Defense.\n  Senator Inouye and I have fought to present this bill on a \nnonpartisan basis and this conference report reflects that \ndetermination. The cooperation and partnership of my friend from Hawaii \nis still a very essential ingredient to this bill. I have worked with \nhim in the past, and he with me. We have rotated as being chairman of \nthis subcommittee. I continue to thank him for his work and his \ncommitment to the people in the armed services.\n  I would like to recognize the work of the subcommittee staff. It is a \nvery interesting staff, which enjoys substantial stability as far as \nprofessional competence is concerned. They are professional staff. The \nSenate has benefited from this approach, in my opinion. Jay Kimmit, \nPeter Lennon, Mary Marshall, John Young, and Mazie Mattson have been \nstalwarts on the committee staff for several years.\n  Some of them I brought on the staff when I was chairman before. The \nSenator from Hawaii maintained them as professional staff, and we have \ncontinued with them. They are real professionals.\n  With the transition this year, Jim Morhard and Sid Ashworth have come \nfrom the minority. Susan Hogan and Justin Wheddle have joined the \nsubcommittee staff. All have made contributions to the bill and to the \nsubcommittee. This has been especially true during the conference.\n  In addition, we have had the assistance of two detailees, Mr. Joe \nFenglar and Ms. Sujata Millick.\n  I might point out, in 1982 Charlie Houy joined the staff of the \nsubcommittee when I was the chairman. His counsel to Senator Inouye and \nthe members of the subcommittee is invaluable. He now works with \nSenator Inouye. It shows the professionalism that we all still value in \nour relationships. His contribution is invaluable and it is a pleasure \nto work with him in this new assignment as the minority chief clerk.\n  Madam President, this is a good bill. I do think it will meet the \nneeds of the men and women of the Armed Forces and our national \nsecurity. One of the reasons it is a good bill is because of the \ncontinued assistance that I have from my good friend, the chief of the \nmajority staff for the subcommittee, Steve Cortese, who is here with me \ntoday.\n  Our bill passed with a strong bipartisan support in the House. In my \njudgment, the Senate should adopt this bill now and permit the work of \nthe Department of Defense to move forward. The majority leader has made \nthe decision to bring it up now because of its impact on those who have \nbeen furloughed under the existing hiatus. I, too, hope the President \nwill sign this bill if we get it to him as soon as possible.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 11, 1995]\n\n   Pentagon Leaders Urge Accelerated 50 Percent Boost in Procurement\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       The uniformed leaders of the armed forces, worried about \n     aging weapons and equipment after a decade of declining \n     procurement, have recommended a roughly 50 percent jump in \n     spending on purchases over the next two years.\n\n[[Page S 17151]]\n\n       Clinton administration plans call for spreading the same \n     rise over four years. But top military officers are skeptical \n     about ever seeing all the money, noting that past projections \n     have rarely been realized.\n       So to highlight what they see as an urgent problem, the \n     military chiefs have asked that the Defense Department set a \n     goal of boosting annual defense procurement from about $40 \n     billion at present to $60 billion by fiscal 1998, not 2000 as \n     the administration has proposed. ``We now don't expect it to \n     go up like the projection shows it will. It never has before, \n     I don't expect it to now,'' said Adm. William A. Owens, vice \n     chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``And secondly, 2000 \n     is too late.\n       ``So our view is, you have to get to $60 billion as soon as \n     you can, and 1998 would be a good year.''\n       The recommendation was included in a budget assessment \n     submitted last month by Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Defense Secretary William J. \n     Perry. It reflected heightened concern about a potential \n     erosion of military capabilities unless purchases are \n     accelerated. It also marked a shift in focus from last year, \n     when the Pentagon, intent on shoring up the current readiness \n     of military units, reduced procurement to cover higher-than-\n     expected operational and maintenance costs. Procurement \n     spending has fallen to its lowest level since 1950, forcing \n     the military services to defer buys of jet fighters, \n     helicopters, ships, trucks and other assets to replace \n     earlier models entering, in some cases, their fourth or even \n     fifth decade of use.\n       ``We are significantly underfunded in the procurement \n     line,'' Owens said. ``Our thrust is to say we must do \n     something, we've got to fix it.''\n       He said the military chiefs are concerned not just about \n     low procurement but a rising ``bow wave''--the piling up of \n     postponed programs.\n       At the same time, Owens indicated the message from the \n     chiefs was not intended to be confrontational or divisive \n     with the Pentagon's civilian leadership, and may have been \n     aimed less at Perry than at the military services themselves. \n     By committing all the chiefs to an ambitious new procurement \n     goal, the memorandum is especially useful to Shalikashvili \n     and Owens in their nascent effort to exercise more central \n     discipline over individual service plans.\n       The memo, which represents the consensus view of the chiefs \n     and vice chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps \n     as well as regional commanders in chief, is said by Pentagon \n     officials to be short on details about just how to bolster \n     procurement and on what to spend the extra funds. ``It's a \n     broad statement, expressing a broad sense of concern,'' said \n     a senior defense official. ``But the details get a little \n     thin.''\n       Shalikashvili makes clear the chiefs do not expect the \n     added funds for modernization to come from higher overall \n     defense spending but rather through cuts in some programs \n     under development and other savings. Even with a Republican-\n     controlled Congress committed to boosting the defense budget, \n     the military leaders are assuming little if any growth in \n     military spending.\n       Nor are the chiefs suggesting reversing the priority given \n     last year to readiness over procurement--that is, draining \n     funds from the operational and maintenance accounts that \n     support current readiness to pay for more modernization. \n     Rather, the biggest adjustments proposed in the Shalikashvili \n     memo would involve cutting back on competing service programs \n     in such development areas as theater missile defense and \n     unmanned aerial vehicles and reducing modeling and simulation \n     activities.\n       Even so, these recommended savings would not come close to \n     providing the roughly $20 billion increase in annual \n     procurement the chiefs would like to see between now and \n     1998. ``We acknowledge the answers are not all there,'' Owens \n     said.\n       But he expressed confidence that substantially more funds \n     for procurement can be found by eliminating redundant \n     systems, embracing economical high-tech innovations and \n     realizing Pentagon plans to farm out more defense activities \n     to the private sector. Significantly, the chiefs have decided \n     not to look for more savings by shrinking troop levels below \n     the 1.45 million active duty service members called for in \n     the administration's plan.\n       In its 1996 budget proposal to Congress, the administration \n     provided for $39 billion in military procurement, a drop of \n     71 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars from the 1985 peak. \n     House and Senate defense appropriation committees have \n     tentatively agreed to raise procurement to $43 billion, but \n     their conference report has yet to win floor approval.\n       The administration's five-year budget plan envisions a 47 \n     percent increase in modernization spending between 1996 and \n     2001. But much of that is not projected to materialize until \n     the turn of the century--and assumes still uncertain savings \n     from military base closings and reforms in Pentagon buying \n     procedures. Responding to Shalikashvili in an Oct. 24 memo, \n     Perry agreed that $60 billion in annual procurement ``is an \n     appropriate goal'' and offered ``to work closely with you to \n     accelerate'' reaching it.\n       But Shalikashvili's initiative, known formally as the \n     chairman's program assessment, has come late in the 1997 \n     budget cycle. A final defense budget proposal is due at the \n     White House next month. Perry suggested major adjustments in \n     Pentagon plans would have to wait until next year and depend \n     largely on what more the services have to offer. ``I will be \n     particularly interested in seeing your specific program \n     recommendations for achieving efficiencies and funding \n     reductions in programs of lower priority from a warfighting \n     perspective,'' the secretary wrote. For the chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs to be weighing into the Pentagon budget debate \n     with his assessment is indicative of an increasingly \n     assertive Joint Chiefs' role in coordinating individual \n     service plans and articulating a consensus view of military \n     requirements. The Shalikashvili memo emerged from the \n     deliberations of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, a \n     panel headed by Owens and including the services' vice \n     chiefs. Over the past year and a half, Owens has strengthened \n     the panel's role in formulating common investment objectives \n     and reducing overlap among service programs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 12, 1995]\n\n              Joint Chiefs Seek More Funds To Update Arms\n\n                             (By Art Pine)\n\n       Washington--Reflecting growing concern over recent \n     reductions in defense spending, the nation's top military \n     leaders have warned that the Pentagon must boost its budget \n     for weapon modernization sooner than planned or risk eroding \n     military preparedness.\n       In a memo to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, the \n     military service chiefs recommend increasing the \n     modernization budget to $60 billion a year by fiscal 1998, \n     rather than fiscal 2000, as currently anticipated. The budget \n     now stands at $39 billion.\n       The unusual move by Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the heads of the four \n     individual services, is intended to serve as a warning flag, \n     both to the Clinton Administration and to the top generals \n     and admirals involved in putting together the military \n     budget.\n       Although President Clinton has promised to restore some of \n     the recent defense spending cuts by fiscal 2000, the services \n     say they are being squeezed and have had to use funds from \n     their modernization and procurement budgets to help maintain \n     military readiness.\n       There has been no immediate indication that the \n     Administration would adopt the Joint Chiefs' recommendation \n     in the fiscal 1997 budget, which is due out early next year. \n     Clinton is already under pressure to hold down spending \n     levels, and an increase of that size would be difficult to \n     grant.\n       Although Perry pledged in a return memo to Shalikashvili \n     and the other chiefs to ``work closely with you to \n     accelerate'' the budget increase, officials said the memo has \n     come so late in the budget preparation process that any \n     serious consideration is likely to have to wait until next \n     year.\n       Military leaders have been warning for months that many of \n     the weapon systems and types of equipment in need of \n     upgrading or replacement were not being modernized on \n     schedule, but there has been little extra money available.\n       As a result, all four services have put off purchases of a \n     wide array of new and replacement weapons and equipment, from \n     fighter aircraft and helicopters to ships, tanks and trucks. \n     They also have begun falling behind on maintenance.\n       Clinton asserted last winter that the squeeze on \n     modernization would be temporary and pledged to restore much \n     of the earlier cutbacks by the turn of the century. With \n     pressures on overall federal spending mounting daily, \n     however, military leaders have been skeptical that the White \n     House can come through.\n       In the fiscal 1996 budget that it sent Congress last \n     January, the Administration requested $39 billion for \n     procurement--a drop of 71% from the 1985 peak, after \n     adjustment for inflation. The Republican-controlled Congress \n     raised that to $43 billion, but the House and Senate bills \n     are stalled in a conference committee.\n       The Administration and the Joint Chiefs want the individual \n     services to provide at least some of the difference by saving \n     money in other areas, such as eliminating unnecessary \n     programs and transferring some jobs to civilian contractors, \n     but the effort is not yielding much.\n       Senior military officials insisted that the memo, while \n     strongly worded, is not intended to provoke a confrontation \n     with the Administration.\n       Critics have been contending for months that the \n     Administration has not been budgeting enough to finance the \n     size of military force that it has said it wants to maintain. \n     The White House insists that it can find the money through \n     savings coming from procurement reforms, but so far those \n     gains have been elusive.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the conference report is before the \nSenate for its consideration because of the extraordinary leadership \nand wisdom demonstrated by our chairman, the Senator from Alaska. If it \nwere not for his leadership I think we would still be back in H-140, \nthe conference room.\n  Madam President, this is a good bill. But before I proceed with my \nstatement, pursuant to the consent agreement reached by this body, I am \npleased to provide 20 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. \nDorgan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. \n\n[[Page S 17152]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the courtesy. I \nwant to say at the outset I understand it is far easier to be critical \nand to oppose. I regret very much, for that reason, that I cannot vote \nfor this conference report. I have voted for a number of conference \nreports, defense appropriations, and defense authorization bills. But I \nwant to explain, during this period of time, why I cannot vote for this \none.\n  Before I do that, I would like to respond to something the Senator \nfrom Alaska said earlier when I was not on the floor, because it will \nrelate to something I am going to talk about in this conference report. \nI had spoken about the juxtaposition of Star Schools and star wars. I \njust used it as a metaphor of the choices that we often make.\n  I pointed out in the continuing resolution that we were about to \nconsider, there is a 40-percent cut in funding in the small Star \nSchools Program, which is I believe a $25 million program whose funding \nwill be cut to $15 million, a 40-percent cut.\n  The Senator from Alaska said, since this is forward funded, these \nschools are not going to be cut. My point was, when you cut something \nfrom $25 million to $15 million, the Senator may be right, if they are \nforward funded they are not cut this year but if you cut the funding, \nsometime they are going be cut.\n  The reason the 40 percent was included in the CR, 40-percent cut, 40 \npercent of funding, was because the House has determined they want to \nkill the Star Schools Program.\n  The only reason I raise the point on the floor was, in the priorities \nthat we are involved with here in Congress, it is choosing one versus \nanother. Can we fund this or that or the other thing? What can we \nafford? What can we not afford?\n\n  The point I was making is the star wars program, which I am going to \ntalk about at some length here, is juxtaposed against star schools. One \nwe can afford; we have plenty of money for. The other we decide we \neither want to kill or we want to cut it back. The CR does take it from \n$25 million to $15 million. At some point in the funding cycle, that is \ngoing to affect someone. That was the point I was making.\n  Let me come to the point of my appearance on the floor on this piece \nof legislation. We are talking a lot about balanced budgets and \nspending and a lot of it is theory and debate. But the steps that you \ntake, albeit baby steps, to deal with budget deficits, is when you \nstart spending real money on the floor of the Senate. That is what we \nare talking about with respect to this bill. This is a spending bill. \nThis is not theory. This is not idle debate. This is a decision about \nwhether we spend money and how we spend money.\n  Now the question is, Who are the big spenders? Who on this floor \nwants to cut back on spending? Resist waste? Cut spending where it is \ninappropriate and unneeded? Let us see. Let us review.\n  This is the Defense Department. The men and women in our Armed Forces \nare critically important to preserving liberty in defense of this \ncountry. I understand that and salute them. I think they deserve our \npraise every single day. But all of us know there is waste in the \nPentagon. Why else would we hear about $700 hammers and $500 ash trays \nand $1,800 toilet seats? I know those are some older stories, but there \nare legendary stories about procurement problems, even in recent times.\n  But let us talk about the procurement in this bill. This bill is for \ndefense. The Pentagon said, with respect to T-39 trainers, they did not \nwant to buy any. The Congress said, ``I am sorry, you are wrong about \nthat. You might not want to buy any but we insist, we want to spend $45 \nmillion and we insist you buy 17 T-39 trainers.''\n  The Pentagon said, ``We do not need any EA-6 strike aircraft \nmodifications.'' We said, ``We are sorry, you are wrong about that. We \ninsist you spend $165 million.''\n  The Pentagon said, ``We do not need two amphibious assault ships.'' \nThe Congress said, ``Well, we must need one.'' And then the Congress \nsaid, ``Let us buy two, while we are at it. Let us buy two, one for \n$900 million and one for $1.3 billion. The sky is the limit. Let us buy \ntwo.'' So you add $2.2 billion.\n  F-15 fighters. Let us buy six of those. The Pentagon said they did \nnot want to buy any. We said, ``Pentagon, you are wrong about that. We \ninsist you buy them.''\n  ``F-16 fighter aircraft,'' we said, ``You ought to buy six.'' We are \ngoing to spend money for six of them. The Pentagon did not ask for \nthem. Cargo aircraft, three, $133 million.\n\n  Let me get some of the big ones. Black Hawk helicopters, Longbow \nhelicopters. I could go on. M-1 tank upgrades, heavy tactical vehicles. \nI come from a small hometown. We do not use those terms. It is called \ntrucks; heavy tactical vehicles, trucks, trucks the Pentagon said they \ndid not want, trucks the Pentagon did not order, and the trucks the \nPentagon did not need. But guess what? The Congress said let us buy \nsome trucks. Spend the money because we have a credit card. By the way, \nwe want to talk about cutting spending, but we want to buy trucks that \nnobody asked for.\n  That is not really the reason I came to the floor. I came to the \nfloor to talk about two big items, the B-2 bombers and star wars. B-2 \nbombers--the administration says let us keep the production line open. \nLet us keep the production line open. Congress says let us start buying \nmore B-2's. We have 20 of them. Let us buy 20 more. Let us obligate \nourselves to spend over $30 billion on B-2 bombers the Pentagon did not \nask for.\n  That is trouble enough. That is not really the reason I came to the \nfloor of the Senate. The reason I came to the floor of the Senate is to \ntalk about star wars. The cold war is over. There is no Soviet Union. \nThis afternoon as I speak we are crushing missiles over in the old \nSoviet Union, drawing down launch vehicles, and destroying warheads as \na part of our arms control agreement. But the cold war is not over \neverywhere. It is not over in this Chamber. The appetite to build \nthings we do not need with money we do not have rests right here on \nthis little line, ``national missile defense,'' albeit star wars, ABM. \nThe only one built in the free world was built in North Dakota, my home \nState. A couple of billion dollars was spent, and 30 days after it was \nopened and was declared operational it was mothballed. That is the way \nit works sometimes.\n  Now that there is no Soviet Union, we are involved in arms control. \nWe are destroying missiles and weapons on both sides. We have a \nCongress that says to the Pentagon, by the way, we insist that you \nstart deploying a star wars program. We insist that you deploy missiles \nin the ground by 1999 on an accelerated basis with a space-based \ncomponent and multiple sites, which will abrogate the ABM Treaty, among \nother things.\n  What is this? I do not understand. I guess I missed something. We \nhave people here who say we are out of money and in debt up to our \nneck. We want to pass an amendment to the Constitution to require us to \nbalance the budget. The very same people bring to the floor of this \nSenate an unending appetite to spend the public's money--as long as it \nis not on milk or shelter for kids--to spend the public's money on \nsomething called star wars. I think people can be excused for wondering \nwhat kind of air is being breathed in these Chambers. This makes no \nsense at all.\n  I mentioned earlier the juxtaposition of priorities. I do it again \nbecause--let me remind people what we are talking about this year. If \nyou say it is not related, you do not understand the process. We only \nhave a certain amount of money to spend. Of 55,000 kids, every single \none has a name who is going to be told, ``We are sorry. You will get \nkicked out of the Head Start Program.'' If you come from a low-income \nfamily, from a circumstance of disadvantage, tough luck. ``We do not \nhave any money for you. No Head Start Program for you, Timmy, Tommy, or \nJames.'' There are 600,000 kids, low-income, disadvantaged city kids, \nwill be told, ``We are sorry. No summer jobs. We cannot afford it. \nTough luck.'' And 2.2 million Americans will be told, ``We are sorry. I \nknow we have a low-income home heating program to help you pay the \nheating bills in the winter in States where you have harsh bitter \ncold.'' We say, ``We are sorry. Home heating is a luxury. You can do \nwithout it.''\n\n  I wonder if those who say that have been in these sheds or shacks \nwhere people sit on the floor with diapers and \n\n[[Page S 17153]]\nkids ill-clothed and the wind is howling through the cracks in the \nwalls, and have seen the desperate condition, especially on Indian \nreservations and elsewhere. Then would you say to these people, ``We \nare sorry. When it is 25 or 30 below, low-income home heating help does \nnot matter. You can do without.''\n  There are dozens and dozens of those kinds of choices. Then we say, \n``By the way, even though we cannot afford those things--which I happen \nto think are necessary--the sky is the limit when it comes to ships, \nplanes, and submarines and helicopters that the Pentagon did not \norder.''\n  But especially galling to me is the resurrection of the star wars \nprogram, to decide that we want to start building a monument that will \ncost $48 billion--$48 billion for a star wars program. We had people \nbring on the floor of the Senate charts that show us that North Vietnam \nis a big threat, and Libya is a threat, and Iraq is a threat. Lord \nwonders how they can sleep at night. Maybe that might be the problem. \nMaybe those who are so frightened by Qadhafi and others simply are not \nsleeping, and the result is a proposal to build a star wars program.\n  Everybody in here who thinks that ought to understand that a far \ngreater threat to this country, if in fact there is a nuclear threat by \na rogue nation, is not from a sophisticated intercontinental ballistic \nmissile. It is the threat from a nuclear bomb packed into a suitcase, \nor put in the trunk of a Yugo car and parked at a New York City dock. \nEverybody understands that is a much higher potential threat than some \nrogue nation getting an ICBM. Or what about a glass vial about that big \nfull of the most deadly biological agents known to mankind? Or what \nabout somebody that rents a truck and builds a fertilizer bomb? Do you \nall think that some rogue terrorist nation is going to get an ICBM and \na nuclear tipped warhead so we can spend $48 billion we do not have? \nLook, this is an appetite that simply cannot be satisfied.\n  I would vote for this conference report if there were several \nchanges. But I am not going to vote for a conference report at a time \nwhen this country is out of money. This country is choking on debt. \nThis country is saying to everybody, tighten your belts. And then we \nsay to those folks who are building a star wars program that we have \nbeen planning for 15 years, we know the world has changed, we know the \ncold war is over, we know there is no Soviet Union, but guess what? The \nappetite to build a star wars program goes unabated. Frankly, probably \none of the locations for the star wars program will be in my home \nState. I have some folks pretty upset with me. ``Why don't you support \nthis? This is jobs.'' It is not jobs. It is waste. I support things \nthat defend this country, that represent strength and represent the \nability to preserve liberty.\n  But I think when we start making choices, real choices on spending \nand come to the floor of the Senate with these kind of add-ons--I know \nthe Senator from Arizona was going to talk about some others--but \nespecially add-ons like the B-2 bomber program and a star wars program, \nI just wonder what people are thinking about.\n\n  Again, let me say we will probably be in session tomorrow, Saturday, \nSunday, and the rest of the week, over whether you balance the budget \nin 5 years, 7 years or 10 years. You know, those who want to do that \ndeal with the theory of it. They might just as well get a pipe, eat a \ncroissant with their feet up and ruminate forever about it.\n  The way you balance the budget is bring spending bills to the floor \nthat cuts spending. This bill adds $7 billion to the President's \nrequest for defense, and explained where it is added. But the most \nsignificant thing this bill does is it commits this country to two \nareas of spending--the B-2 bomber and the star wars program that will \nbleed tens and tens of billions of dollars in the next 5 and 10 years \nfrom the taxpayers' pockets in this country for something we do not \nneed.\n  I am anxious for those who support this bill, for those who say we \nhave plenty of money for star wars but not enough for Head Start, \nplenty of money for star wars, a star wars program the Secretary of \nDefense did not ask for, the star wars program the President says we do \nnot need--I am just anxious to see those folks who say we have plenty \nof money for star wars but not enough for star schools come to the \nfloor again and talk about their appetite to cut spending. If there is \nan appetite to cut spending, this is a good place to start. We do not \nhave to wait until January. We do not have to wait until December 1. A \ngood time to start would be today at 5:30, if we can get a chance to \nvote--maybe adding close to $400 million for star wars. It does not \nseem like a lot of money to some. But if you grow up in a town of 400 \npeople and graduate from a high school class of nine and do not \nunderstand much about $400 million, then understand they say we just \ncannot afford these other little programs that would help folks that \nare in need, help folks send their kids to college, and help folks do \nthe right thing. Then we start thinking maybe this is not just about \nthe old theoretical debates. Maybe it is once again the same old debate \nwe have every time we discuss money on this floor. Big interest and \nlittle interest, and little interest be damned. The big interest, guess \nwhat? Start smiling, because in our envelope behind door No. 1 is the \nbig prize for you.\n  I regret that I cannot vote for this conference agreement. But it \nseems to me, if all of the angst and all of the energy and all of the \nanxiety we have heard on the floor of the Senate now for the last \nseveral weeks about spending is indeed real, then those who express it \nshould come to this floor and auger in on questions like the B-2 bomber \nand like the star wars program, and, yes, like the other programs where \nwe have added planes, ships, submarines and helicopters that were not \nordered, were not needed, were not asked for. Come to the floor, stand \nup, and proudly pull up their suspenders and say, ``Count me in. I want \nto cut spending.'' Or will they come to the floor and just button their \nsuit and say, ``Well, here we go. I sure like this kind of spending. \nLet's add to it. Let's take 7 billion bucks and stuff the Pentagon's \npockets and let's decide that is our priority. Not star schools, star \nwars. That is our priority.''\n\n  It is, with all due respect to those who believe it is the right \nthing, a warped priority for this country's future. And I hope that \nwhen the dust settles on all of this debate, the American people will \nunderstand when some waive their arms and raise their voices and boast \nto the heavens that they are the ones who are against all the big \nspending, they are the ones who are between the taxpayers and calamity \nbecause they are the ones who want to cut the deficit, they are the \nones who want to balance the budget, I hope they will take a look at \nhow they voted on this, an obligation for my kids and yours to ante up \n$48 billion for a star wars program that does nothing to add security \nto this country.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 31 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to reserve the 3 minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Pursuant to the consent agreement, I am pleased to yield \n15 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank you and I thank the Senator from \nHawaii for his constant courtesy and helpfulness to all of us here in \nthe Senate.\n  I also regret that I must rise in opposition to this conference \nreport on the Defense appropriations bill. It is clear to me that the \nbill should be vetoed, and that the President is going to veto it.\n  Let me quote from a letter that the President sent to Congressman \nLivingston dated October 18. It said:\n\n       However, by appropriating $6.9 billion more than I \n     requested, the conference report did not address my \n     fundamental concerns about spending priorities. As the bill \n     now goes back to conference following its defeat on the House \n     floor, it is important that the conferees understand where I \n     stand. Absent a broader agreement with Congress that \n     adequately funds crucial domestic programs in other \n     appropriations bills, I will veto any defense appropriation \n     bill that adds extra billions for defense programs not in my \n     request.\n\n\n[[Page S 17154]]\n\n  Mr. President, the conferees did not address the President's \nfundamental concern about misplaced priorities in their second \nconference. And this conference report, like its predecessor, is full \nof unrequested, unneeded, and unsustainable add-ons. As for funding of \ncrucial domestic programs in other appropriations bills, particularly \nthe Labor, HHS, the VA-HUD and the Commerce, State, Justice bills, it \nis absolutely clear that we have made virtually no progress since the \nPresident wrote.\n  The fiasco of closing down the Government has only widened the gulf \nbetween the majority party and the President on what our domestic \npriorities should be. Indeed, the majority party's interest in cutting \nprograms for education, the environment, civilian research, heating \nassistance for low-income citizens, national service, Indian programs, \nand many others seems to grow as we proceed through this budget debate.\n\n  I voted against the bill when the Senate passed it early in \nSeptember. I thought it was worthy of a veto then. In my view, the \nconference has not improved it. In fact, it has made it worse.\n  This bill has truly become a weapons-for-everybody bill. When it left \nthe Senate, the bill was $6.45 billion above the President's request. \nIt is now $6.9 billion above the President's request. But that figure \nalone understates the net addition because, according to press reports, \nthe conference report that we are here considering takes back $1 \nbillion that the National Reconnaissance Office, [NRO] had accumulated \nin unspent funds. That money was spent on unneeded, unrequested, \nunsustainable weapons that were not in the Senate version of the bill, \njust as the other $6.9 billion were. If you adjust for the NRO money, \nthis bill is in fact about $8 billion above the President's request, \nnot $7 billion.\n  The conferees had enough money to buy ships, planes, trucks, \nhelicopters of every description, some of which--like a $20 million \nCyclone class patrol craft--were in neither bill prior to going to \nconference.\n  The total add-on package is in the range of $10 billion. There are \noffsets in the range of $2 billion as well.\n  The obvious question is what is it that justifies this extraordinary \nincrease in defense spending, and I for one cannot point to a threat.\n  We spend twice as much as all of our potential adversaries combined. \nIf we put together the budgets--our budget with those of our NATO \nallies and Japan--we and our allies are outspending our potential foes \nby more than 3 to 1. Of course, it will be argued that much of the \nadditional spending in this bill is somewhere in the Pentagon's budget \nfor the next 6 years. That was the argument that was made for the $1.3 \nbillion HLD-7 amphibious assault ship that the Senate debated when we \npassed the bill in August. The Navy planned to buy that ship in the \nyear 2001. That will undoubtedly be the argument that is used to \njustify the $900 million LPD-17 amphibious transport dock which the \nHouse insisted on in conference. The Navy planned to buy that in 1998.\n  Mr. President, this is really an extraordinary argument. Essentially \nthose who make it are saying that they can pick and choose anything in \nthe 6-year plan that the Department of Defense has that helps their \nState or district and that plan when you add it up totals about $1.6 \ntrillion. Where else in our budgeting this year are we finding the \nability to do that? The answer clearly is nowhere. Everywhere but in \nthis case of the Pentagon we cannot find enough for this first year's \nbudget, let alone find money to add $1 billion projects in the States \nor districts of powerful members of the Republican leadership.\n\n  But worse are the programs that do not even fit in the 6-year plan. \nSome of these have huge budgetary implications. The B-2, which was not \nin the Senate bill, has an outyear requirement for tens of billions of \ndollars. National missile defense, which my colleague from North Dakota \nspoke about, will require tens of billions of additional dollars not in \nthe 6-year plan. There is certainly no money in future year budgets for \nthe Hellfire-2 and the CBU-87 antiarmor munitions. The Pentagon's own \ninspector general told Congress that we already had enough of these \nmunitions to cover every target in a 2 major regional contingency \nscenario, and yet the Senate voted to continue to buy these unneeded \nweapons, and the conferees agreed to spend tens of billions of dollars \non them as well.\n  There certainly is no money in the 6-year plan for most, if not all, \nof the member interest add-ons in the research and development budget, \nwhich always seems to have an outyear requirement that goes on and on. \nI have in mind items that the Senator from Arizona has on his earmark \nlist, like the curved plate technology program, the Center for \nAstronomical Adaptive Optics--which presumably should be funded by the \nNational Science Foundation's astronomy program, if at all--the Pacific \nSoftware Research Center. There are many others.\n  It is frankly disconcerting to me that the Technology Reinvestment \nProject, which is a competitive and a cost shared program, was cut by \n$305 million while noncompetitive, noncost share programs like those I \nreferred to flourish in these supposedly austere budget \ntimes. Obviously, austerity stops at the door of the Pentagon as far as \nthis bill is concerned.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford these add-ons even under the \nRepublican budget. There is no money in the outyears to sustain the \nprograms. As Congressman Obey has repeatedly pointed out, the \nRepublican defense budget over the 5-year period from fiscal year 1998 \nto 2002 is less than the President's. Let me repeat that. The \nRepublican defense budget for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 is less than \nwhat the President has asked for. According to an article from the \nNovember 6 issue of Aviation Week, the Republican majority is \nconsidering reducing the net 7-year addition to the defense budget from \n$20 to $8 billion in the final negotiations over the budget with the \nPresident, whenever that negotiation occurs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article from Aviation Week be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, whatever figure emerges, this bill is \ninconsistent with it. This bill assumes future Congresses are going to \nspend tens of billions of dollars more for defense than the Republican \nbudget resolution allows.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year made clear in \nits report that it had not designed the authorization bill to be \nconsistent with the realities of the out-year Republican defense budget \ntotals. The committee said on page 3 of its report:\n\n       The Committee remains concerned about the adequacy of \n     funding levels for national defense programs in coming years. \n     * * * Budget levels proposed for future years do not \n     adequately fund even the level of forces required for the \n     Bottom-Up Review Force. * * * The limited progress reflected \n     in this bill cannot be maintained unless future funding is \n     increased.\n\n  Mr. President, increasing defense spending above the June budget \nresolution is not even on the table. Nor should it be. I hear no one in \nthe Republican leadership saying they want to increase defense spending \neven more. Despite the rhetoric in last year's campaign about the \nPresident not spending enough on defense, the fact is all the 7-year \nRepublican defense budget does in its current form is provide a 2-year \ninfusion of pork this year and next followed by 5 years in which \nRepublicans are saying that the President is being a tad too generous \nto defense. Mr. President, I say we should forgo the pork this year and \nnext. Let us put this money to better use in the domestic \nappropriations bill, particularly Labor-HHS, VA-HUD, and Commerce-\nState-Justice, all of which require additional funds to sustain \ncritical programs. I suspect that by the end of this year's budget \nprocess, at least some of the unneeded, unrequested, and unsustainable \nprojects will be stripped from this bill.\n  Mr. President, there are several other provisions which concern me in \nthis bill. When the Senate debated this bill in August, the senior \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, offered an amendment to trim \nthe defense export loan guarantee authority in this bill from $15 to \n$10 billion. The vote to table that amendment was 53 to 47. Yet the \nconferees came back with $15 billion in loan guarantees for defense \nexports, to the extent they are authorized. Unfortunately, a loan \nguarantee \n\n[[Page S 17155]]\nprovision is included in both the House and Senate versions of the \nauthorization bill. So if there is an authorization bill, this \nappropriations bill will put the taxpayers at risk to the tune of $15 \nbillion for defaults on payments for defense exports.\n  Mr. President, when Senator Kempthorne started working on this issue \na couple of years ago, he sought authority for a trial program to \nguarantee about $1 billion in defense exports to a limited number of \ncountries. At that time, it was a subsidized guarantee. Now it is \nsupposed to be paid for by the defense industry itself. But we have \nmoved in 2 short years from a $1 billion trial program to a full-blown \n$15 billion program of defense export guarantees.\n  Mr. President, we should not be attempting to prop up our defense \nindustry by turning it into the arms merchant for the world. It is our \nown troops who will too often be facing off against these weapons. \nInstead, we should be taking the lead in trying to negotiate arms \ntransfer restraints. There is a historic opportunity with the end of \nthe cold war and with nations across the globe attempting to free up \nfunds for economic development and useful infrastructure to scale back \nregional arms races. This loan guarantee provision is just bad public \npolicy and I regret it was not at least scaled back by the conferees \nafter the close vote on the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. President, I also regret the cuts made in this bill to the \ntechnology reinvestment project and SEMATECH. The $305 million cut in \nthe technology reinvestment project and the $50.5 million cut to \nSEMATECH in the last year that it was seeking Federal funds, send \nprecisely the wrong signal to the Pentagon's research bureaucracy. The \nsignal is that rather than leveraging the commercial sector in \ninnovative ways to save the taxpayers' money in developing and \nprocuring dual-use technologies, it is OK to hunker down and pursue \nduplicative, ultimately dead-end research with a military label on it. \nIn fact, not only is it OK, but it is the preferred approach of the \ncongressional majority.\n  This is again bad public policy which the Pentagon cannot afford to \npursue at a time of limited resources and which will come back to haunt \nus in the next century if it is not soon reversed.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on and cite additional problems with \nthis bill. I think the point is well made. And I will not delay the \nSenate further in discussing the details of the conference report. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against the bill. I urge the President to \ncarry out his threat to veto the bill. It reflects a set of priorities \nwith which I for one do not want to associate myself at a time when we \nare doing so much damage to many vital domestic programs.\n  Mr. President, as stated by the Senator from North Dakota, this bill \ndoes make a mockery of all the speeches that I have been hearing here \non the Senate floor about deficit reduction, about the need to balance \nthe budget, about the need the tighten our belts. The Congress can and \nmust do better than to ratify the misplaced priorities reflected in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to Mr. \nLivingston printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Livingston,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     conference report on the Fiscal year 1996 Defense \n     Appropriations Act. I want you to know that I appreciate your \n     hard work and leadership on this bill, as well as that of \n     Senators Stevens and Inouye. The Conference Report had many \n     commendable features. For example, a number of policy \n     provisions that raised serious constitutional and national \n     security concerns were satisfactorily resolved in conference, \n     and funding was secured for several programs that were of \n     particular importance to me and to the national security of \n     this country, including the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     program and the Technology Reinvestment Project.\n       However, by appropriating $6.9 billion more than I \n     requested, the Conference Report did not address my \n     fundamental concerns about spending priorities. As the bill \n     now goes back to conference following its defeat on the House \n     floor, it is important that the conferees understand where I \n     stand. Absent a broader agreement with Congress that \n     adequately funds crucial domestic programs in other \n     appropriations bills, I will veto any defense appropriations \n     bill that adds extra billions for defense programs not in my \n     request.\n       I am ready to work with Congress to ensure that we reach \n     that agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         [From Aviation Week & Space Technology, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n               Deficit Hawks Gain, Threaten Defense Hikes\n\n                    (By David A. Fulghum/Washington)\n\n       U.S. Republican lawmakers are considering a deal that could \n     cut $12 billion from promised defense increases--a key \n     element in the party's Contract With America.\n       Defense boosters and fiscal conservatives are trying to \n     craft compromise budget language that would make the cuts \n     over the next six years. The Republican leadership is \n     attempting to satisfy lawmakers who believe deficit reduction \n     should take priority over defense increases. The compromise \n     is aimed at gaining passage of the Fiscal 1996 reconciliation \n     bill, catch-all budget legislation that funds the entire \n     federal government.\n       The compromise defense language is still in flux. But if it \n     survives in the overall reconciliation bill, the Republicans' \n     much ballyhooed $20-billion defense spending hike above the \n     Administration's request could be slashed to only $8 billion, \n     according to a Democratic congressional aide. But a \n     Republican aide said it is not yet clear if all $12 billion \n     in cuts ``will be directly translated to defense.'' \n     Complicating matters, the fate of the reconciliation bill is \n     in serious doubt because of White House and congressional \n     squabbling over the best way to balance the budget.\n       If the Republican leadership decides for the sake of fiscal \n     peace with its deficit hawks to renege on its promised \n     defense increases, the Pentagon could find it impossible to \n     buy as much new armament as GOP defense hawks would like. \n     That includes C-17 airlifters, B-2 bombers, missile defense, \n     ships and submarines.\n       Moreover, organized resistance to defense hawks appears to \n     be mounting. A coalition of freshman lawmakers, heavily \n     influenced by Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.), has concluded that \n     defense is not a top priority, and they are forming a task \n     force to begin examining the whole issue of defense spending \n     early next year.\n       ``From the reconciliation bill will flow the defense budget \n     top lines,'' the Democratic congressional staffer said. If \n     there are major cuts, ``there will be no money to \n     sustain buying C-17s at a high rate or additional B-2s.''\n       The U.S. military is being unequivocal in its support for \n     purchasing an airlifter fleet made up of 120 McDonnell \n     Douglas C-17s. A plan to buy less expensive C-33/Boeing 747-\n     400 freighters or Lockheed C-5Ds has of late had shrinking \n     support in the Pentagon. However, congressional opponents of \n     purchasing an all-C-17 fleet contend there is still a flicker \n     of interest from the White House in the Boeing 747-400. \n     Consequently, they expect the Pentagon to leave the door open \n     for a mixed purchase at least through the 1996 presidential \n     election.\n       However, senior defense officials believe that the reasons \n     for buying a mixed fleet have disappeared. The C-141 fleet, \n     which C-17s are to replace, is no longer grounded and is \n     expected to soldier on in decreasing numbers well into the \n     next century. Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas has transformed \n     the C-17 from a troubled program to an operational and \n     technological success.\n       Congressional supporters of a mixed fleet point out that a \n     Pentagon recommendation to buy 120 C-17 equivalents is simply \n     an acquisition decision. It does not mean the money is in the \n     long-term defense budget.\n       ``It means they go from standing in the acquisition line to \n     standing in the budget line and that's a whole new ball \n     game,'' a Democratic staffer said.\n       Some staffers contend the Air Force can sustain only a \n     $2.5-billion per year investment in airlifters, which would \n     equal only eight C-17s. At that rate, the U.S. Air Force \n     would actually lose airlift capacity until 2007 because of \n     the retirement of C-141. Airlift could be sustained only by \n     buying some high-payload 747-400s, they said. Some \n     congressional and aerospace industry officials thought the \n     Pentagon might keep the C-33 option alive as a goad to \n     McDonnell Douglas to keep C-17 prices down.\n       Senior defense officials said they do not believe the \n     Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) will sustain the option, \n     choosing instead to use contractual methods to ensure \n     McDonnell Douglas prices stay low. Moreover, Air Force \n     planners believe the defense budget as now projected will \n     allow them to buy C-17s at a greater rate than eight per \n     year, thus avoiding an airlift shortage.\n       But, there are indications that defense planning could \n     receive some severe jolts. A senior Air Force official \n     candidly admitted that planners are being forced to ``look at \n     the issue with blinders on.'' They have not made budgetary \n     excursions to project what will happen if, for example, they \n     are forced to buy more B-2s. The requirement is considered a \n     likely inclusion in a compromise Fiscal 1996 defense \n     appropriations bill. If the Republican Congress forces the \n     Pentagon to buy more B-2s without additional long-term \n\n[[Page S 17156]]\n     funding, Air Force leaders will have to rebuild their budgets and \n     likely cut or stretch out C-17 purchases.\n       But in a move guaranteed to keep the airlifter debate \n     alive, Congressional Budget Office researchers have just \n     completed a study that offers compelling arguments for buying \n     a mix of aircraft to meet the Pentagon's requirement for 120 \n     C-17 equivalents.\n       ``Buying 32 more C-17s plus 30 C-3s would provide the same \n     delivery capability as 80 additional C-17s,'' the CBO report \n     said. ``That option would also be nearly $8 billion \n     cheaper.''\n       CBO researchers said the mix of C-17s and C-33s would cost \n     about $28 billion to buy and operate and would be a better \n     deal if there were adequate room on airfields to land and \n     unload the less maneuverable C-33s.\n       ``If, however, U.S. forces were limited to a few airfields \n     that had a small amount of ramp space [such as Macedonia], \n     the [C-17/C-33 mix] option might not deliver cargo as quickly \n     as would 80 more C-17s,'' the CBO report said. ``And such a \n     combination would not provide as much flexibility to handle \n     specific military missions such as strategic brigade airdrops \n     [flowing directly from the U.S. to a foreign battlefield].''\n       CBO noted that the first 40 C-17s cost about $300 million \n     each in 1996 dollars but predicted the company light like to \n     achieve a flyaway cost of $203 million each, without \n     government furnished avionics and engines.\n\n                       ESTIMATED COSTS IN 1996 DOLLARS OF THREE STRATEGIC AIRLIFT OPTIONS

\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am prepared to yield some time to the Senator from \nMaine. But I want to say to the Senator from New Mexico, I am saddened \nto hear those comments. I wish we had a little more time. I would be \nglad to disabuse him of some of the comments he made.\n  To the contrary, I am sure there are New Mexican men and women around \nthe world in some of these deployments we have made. I will be very \ninterested to see how he is going to vote on the deployment to Bosnia, \nwhether he supported the deployment to Somalia, whether he supported \nthe support for the Kurds, the humanitarian assistance to Bosnia that \nis going on now or the deployment to Macedonia or the Adriatic blockade \nor the blockade of Iraq.\n  I do not see how we can send our people, our young men and women, \nthroughout the world, and then complain we are providing them the \nequipment they need to survive. And in my judgment, the amount of money \nin this bill is literally a decline from last year in real terms. And I \nreally think that to request the President to veto this bill, and at \nthe same time to consider deploying forces to the Balkans, is just the \nheight of really--well, I do not want to use the word here on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  It boggles my mind to think some people will vote against this bill \nand then vote to deploy forces to the Balkans.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be glad to get to the Senator later on. But I \nwant to yield to the Senator from Maine 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, first let me thank both the Senator from \nAlaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their efforts in trying to \nnegotiate with their House counterparts. I and other Members have been \nlocked in negotiations for weeks now with our House counterparts on the \nauthorization bill, and we have yet to reach success. And so I \nappreciate the work that the Senators have put in and, especially, in \nworking out the differences in the funding requirements.\n  One area that troubles me is the B-2 bomber. For several years now I \nthink we have gone on record as saying no more than 20. We decided that \nseveral years ago.\n  At first there was a notion we had to have a penetrating bomber \nbecause after we fired off our ICBM's in an exchange with the Soviet \nUnion, we would need the B-2 bomber to penetrate Soviet air defenses, \nwhat remained of them, to go in and hunt down mobile missiles. When \nthat became rather impractical, to say the least, when we finally \nexposed the rationale for that, the Air Force at that point came back \nand said, well, we do not really need it as a nuclear penetrating \nbomber, perhaps we can use it as a conventional bomber.\n  They used to present us with a chart indicating that the B-2 will \nreplace some--I cannot recall the number now--but somewhere from 40 to \n50 aircraft. If you have one B-2, you will not need all these other \naircraft. This one B-2 can fly back and over. No jamming aircraft \nneeded, no F-15 escorts, and so on. I said, ``Fine, take all the B-2's \nand eliminate all the other aircraft. We do not want that tradeoff,'' \nthey said. ``We want to have the B-2 and all the other aircraft.''\n  But we are now on the eve of this particular conference report, and \nonce again, we find there is roughly $500 million included for the B-2 \nbomber. I want to ask a question of my colleague from Alaska as to \nwhether or not it is his and his colleague's intent, the managers of \nthe bill, to open up the B-2 line to start producing more B-2 bombers?\n  I can tell you why I am concerned about this. We are in the process \nnow of negotiating with the other body. The other body by 3 votes--3 \nvotes--approved additional funds for the B-2 bomber. They want to open \nup an entire new line to produce another 20 B-2 bombers. That is with \nlife-cycle costs of roughly $30 billion.\n  I want to know, where is the $30 billion going to come from? Now, I \ncould see some are making the case, saying, ``Well, maybe we need to do \na little more experimentation here on the B-2, that this is, by the \nway, 1970's technology. We are moving into the 21st century. We may \nhave to update the B-\n\n[[Page S 17157]]\n2 with some new research and development.''\n  I can see the case being made for the purchase of even spare parts \nfor the existing B-2 fleet. But I am really concerned that we might \nstart down the path, an irrevocable path, to build 20 more B-2 bombers, \nat a cost of $30 billion, and I do not know where the money is going to \ncome from.\n  So, I want to know from my friend from Alaska as to whether or not \nthe Appropriations Committee is committing itself and committing this \nbody to opening up this line, to taking the cap off, to starting \nanother process of building at least 5, 10, 20, more B-2 bombers. If \nthat is the case, I would have great difficulty with this measure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Maine \nthat, as I made the statement in the opening part of this discussion on \nthe bill, we have provided the money for the continuation of the line. \nThe decision will be the President's as to whether that will go \nforward, or at least it will be with the Armed Services Committee, \nbecause we have no authorizing language in the bill. We have just \nfunded it.\n  It is not within our province to start a multiyear procurement line \nwith an annual appropriations bill. I will say, though--I am \nconstrained to say that 20 B-2 bombers is equivalent to four Seawolf \nsubmarines. I have fought every Seawolf that has come before the \nSenate, and yet they are going forward. And we need Seawolf submarines \na lot less than we need B-2 bombers. At least B-2's are force \nprojections and capable of meeting some of our needs on an \ninternational basis. The Seawolf, in my judgment, is not needed at all. \nBut I tell the Senator that some of these decisions are not made by \nindividual members of either the Armed Services Committee, on which the \nSenator serves, or the Appropriations Committee, of which I am pleased \nto chair the subcommittee.\n  The answer to the question directly is, we have not opened up this \nline by the language in this bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank my friend for his comments. I point out this body \nhas gone on record saying no more than 20. Whether or not the Senator \nagrees with the need for the Seawolf--that is a debatable matter \nobviously--the fact is that the Senate has gone on record that no more \nthan 20 B-2 bombers should be built. And here we are at least opening \nup the prospect of a new line of more B-2's at a time when, in the \noutyears, I do not know where the money is going to come from.\n  I know that the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Hawaii, have \nbeen creative over the years in coming up with money that is necessary \nto fund our programs. But if you look past the year 2000, I do not know \nthat even he and the Senator from Hawaii can be persuasive enough for \ntheir colleagues to say we have to appropriate that kind of money.\n  By the way, looking at the SCN account, the Navy's shipbuilding and \nconversion account--and the Senator from Alaska can correct me on \nthis--we have roughly $4 billion in the SCN account. And in order to \nmeet the Navy's needs, by the year 2000, it is going to go up to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. Could I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be glad to give the Senator 1 more minute, but \nlet me precede that by saying we have provided the money for long lead-\ntime items for the new B-2 line, should the President decide to open it \nup. We have not funded money for any single B-2.\n  We have given the administration a chance to revisit the question of \nkeeping the B-2 line open by virtue of making the money available for \nlong-lead-time items for new B-2's should the decision be made to \nprocure them.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank my friend.\n  As I indicated before, we are going to be going in the SCN account, \nthe shipbuilding account, from $4 billion, roughly, up to $15 billion \nin the year 2000 and beyond to get the ships that the Navy indicates it \nis going to have to have in order to meet its requirements.\n  I do not know where that money is going to come from. I do not know \nhow we are going to have enough money in the shipbuilding account at \nthe turn of the century, and I am not sure there will be a Congress \nwilling to vote the money to fund it. That is one reason why I raise \nthe issue on the B-2.\n  I am at least consoled somewhat by the Senator's statement that it is \nnot the intent of the appropriators to open up a new line but rather it \nis the intent to leave it up to the President to decide whether he is \ngoing to overrule his own Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, both of whom indicated they do not need the B-2 or want \nit given the cost requirements of the program.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for his \ncontribution and his comments. Although we were criticized by another \nSenator on the floor, it is a fact that we have saved money by \naccelerating the decision to buy the LPD and LHD now. That, in fact, \nwill make room for the outlays that are necessary to carry on the ship \nprocurement that the Senator from Maine has mentioned.\n  But there is severe strain in the Department's budget in the \noutyears, and both the President and the Congress have noted that in \nterms of the last 2 years of the 7-year period. It will be a difficult \nthing to fund the items that are started, both in the shipbuilding and \nthe aircraft procurement accounts. However, there are decisions that \nare going to be made, I assume, that will take care of the outyears by \nthe authorizing committee.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I do not think I will consume the entire time allotted to me, I \ntell my colleagues.\n  First of all, I paid close attention to the colloquy between Senator \nCohen and the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, who I \nbelieve, along with the Senator from Hawaii, has worked very hard on \nthese issues for many, many years.\n  I note and I think it is an important aspect of what I am about to \nsay, that since 1985, the defense budgets have declined by 35 percent \nin real dollars, with another 10 percent decline by the turn of the \ncentury.\n  There is no possible way that we will be able to meet a Bottom-Up \nReview, a modified Bottom-Up Review or anything resembling it with \nthose kind of numbers staring us in the face, which is one reason why I \nwas a strong supporter of the $7 billion increase in defense spending, \nbecause I believe that we are terribly short and facing block \nobsolescence in items such as sealift, airlift, amphibious capability, \ntactical air, depot maintenance, that terribly unsexy word, 4 or 5, 6, \n10 years behind. Training funds are miserably short. We had a situation \nnot too long ago where the U.S.S. Inchon came back from 7 months off \nthe coast of Somalia, was back home approximately 2 weeks and then went \nout for another 3 months off the coast of Haiti. Mr. President, there \nis no way you will keep qualified men and women in the military under \nthose kinds of conditions that the crew of the Inchon was subjected to.\n  So, I believe that there is a clear and compelling requirement for us \nto increase spending, which increases the depth of my bitterness at how \nwe have spent this additional $7 billion. I can identify, and I will in \nmy statement, $4.1 billion, or over 60 percent of this total $7 \nbillion, wasted on projects which do little or nothing to enhance the \nreadiness of our forces today or to modernize our forces to ensure \ntheir future readiness.\n  We live in a very dangerous world. I strongly disagree with the \ncomments of the Senator from North Dakota about the fact, in his view, \nwe do not need to spend money on ballistic missile defense. I think any \ncasual observer of the passing scene will recognize the incredible \nthreat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nthe means to deliver them. We are finding out that in Iraq, Saddam \nHussein was very, very close to having both delivery capability and the \nweapons needed to have changed that conflict in a most dramatic and \nsignificant fashion.\n  So, I am not arguing for cuts in defense spending, but I am saying \nthis, \n\n[[Page S 17158]]\nand I am saying it as much and as sincerely as I have said anything on \nthe floor of this Senate: If we do not stop wasting these tax dollars, \nif we do not stop this pork barreling, if we do not stop spending money \non projects and programs that have no relevance to the post-cold-war \nera, the American people will not support a minimum level of defense \nspending.\n  One of the problems, I have to tell you, Mr. President, is we no \nlonger have a conceptual framework for the threats that face our \nnational security interest. The Bottom-Up Review, in its day, was an \nimportant step forward. It is no longer relevant because it cannot be \nbuilt. There is no way that we are going to maintain the Bottom-Up \nReview. But what we have to do is ascertain what the threats are to our \nnational security, which I have been over many times on this floor, and \nwhat we need to meet those.\n  The administration has failed to do it, and we in the Congress have \nfailed to recognize them. So, therefore, it opens the door wide to not \nonly pork barreling of additional projects, but also funding of major \nweapons systems, major commitments to multibillions of dollars in the \nfuture years that have no relevance to the threat.\n  I, obviously, speak specifically of the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf \nsubmarine. I was pleased to hear that the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman said this additional $493 million for the B-2, which is in \nthis bill, does not commit us to an additional $36 billion. I have been \naround here long enough, I have been around here long enough to know \nthat once you get your fist in the tar baby, you do not get out. If we \nstart that line up again, we are not going to shut it down until we \nhave expended an additional $36 billion, which we simply do not have.\n  Mr. President, I want to also point out, I find it interesting that \nthe President has threatened to veto this bill on the grounds that much \nof the spending is unneeded and much of it may be wasteful and \nunrequested items. If he should have ever vetoed a bill, he should have \nvetoed the military construction appropriations bill.\n  Did the President miss the fact that there was $700 million added on \nin the military construction bill which was neither requested nor \nrequired, items such as hypervelocity ballistic-range facilities, such \nas fire stations, such as a foundry renovation at Philadelphia Navy \nShipyard that is being closed, such as a dining facility at Fort Bliss, \na highway overpass at Fort Sam Houston?\n  Did the President miss all those? If the President was serious, then \nthe President of the United States would have vetoed the MilCon bill in \na New York minute.\n  What we are doing, I will tell you again, and, as I say, I am dead \nserious and the reason why I risk offending my hard-working colleagues \non these appropriations bills is the American people in 1994 said they \ndo not want any more of this pork barreling and wasteful expenditures \non defense and they will not support it. Everyplace I go, it is almost \na joke. I am not going to go through all of these tonight, because I \nhave gone through them so many times before.\n\n  Earmarks: $5 million grant to the Marine and Environmental Research \nand Training Station in Oregon for ``programs of major importance''; \n$25 million to the Kaho'olawe Island conveyance, where I am led to \nunderstand there is already $50 million sitting idle, not in either \nbill, not in either bill, it comes out in the conference; $3.4 million \nfor private physicians ``who have used and will use the antibacterial \ntreatment method based upon the excretion of dead, decaying spherical \nbacteria'' to work with Walter Reed Army Medical Center for a treatment \nof Desert Storm Syndrome. That may be a valid requirement. Why did we \nnot discuss it? Why did it appear in the final bill?\n  Authority to provide free medical care at Army medical facilities in \nHawaii to citizens of surrounding islands. I visited Hawaii, I \nunderstand that there are needs on the islands around Hawaii for \nmedical care. I also know that there are rural places in my State and \nthere are rural places all over America that do not have medical care \neither. Why do we not provide free medical care for all of them?\n  Prohibition on downsizing or disestablishing the 53d weather \nreconnaissance squadron; prohibition on using Edwards Air Force base as \nthe interim airhead for the National Training Center at Fort Irwin. \nThere is a little more to these than meets the eye.\n  Somebody wants to have a runway extended at Barstow Daggett Airport \nwhen the Army has determined that Edwards Air Force Base is the \nfacility that should be used and has plenty of facilities there.\n  So how do we beat that? We beat it by prohibiting using Edwards Air \nForce Base for our people to land and then be transported over to Fort \nIrwin. It goes on and on. Cleanup of the National Presto Industries \nsite in Eau Claire, WI. I have been through before. It was in \nlitigation in the courts. We had no business providing $15 million for \nthat until the courts had settled it. Then there is $7 million for the \nCenter of Excellence for Research in Ocean Science; $6 million for a \nPacific Disaster Center; $1.5 million for the Beaumont Army Medical \nCenter computer support; $3.5 million for distributed manufacturing \ndemonstration project; over $200 million in earmarked medical research \nprojects; a natural gas boiler demonstration, $2 million; earmark for \nMississippi Resource Development Center.\n  Here is one of my favorites: $5.4 million in unrequested funding to \ncontinue ongoing efforts with an established small business development \ncenter to be administered as in previous years, focused on developing \nagricultural-based services, such as bioremediation. The committee \nsupports targeted research and development projects and agricultural \ndevelopment activities in zones surrounding military installations.\n  What in the world does that mean? ``The committee supports targeted \nresearch and development projects and agricultural development \nactivities in zones surrounding military installations.''\n  Next is $8 million to be ``competitive awarded to a qualified \nWashington, DC, region-based institution of higher education with \nexpertise and programs in computational sciences and informatics \ncapable of conducting research and development that will further \nefforts to establish an effective metacomputing testbed.''\n  I will not even ask what that means.\n  ``The committee urges the Department to provide not less than $8 \nmillion in financial and technical support toward the study of \nneurofibromatosis. The committee urges the Department to provide not \nless than $1 million in financial and technical support toward the \nstudy of Paget's and related bone diseases.''\n  Report language calls for $5 million for instrumented factory for \ngears; $2.7 million for standard monitoring control system; $10 million \nfor FDS-deployable refurbishment and spares procurement.\n  The list goes on and on and on and on. I saw the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill that we passed yesterday. It was a clean bill, a \ngood bill. It did not have earmarks, it did not have special projects \nin it, which was a dramatic change from the previous years. It proved \nto me that we do not have to have this practice in appropriations \nbills.\n  Mr. President, we have 50,000 enlisted families in America in our \nArmed Forces that are eligible for food stamps. I suggest that if we \nhad additional money, maybe we ought to give them a pay raise--the \nenlisted people. Maybe we ought to do that and take them off of \neligibility for food stamps. Maybe we ought to do a lot more in the way \nof quality of life and make sure that there are enough ships like \nU.S.S. Inchon, so they do not have to spend 7 months at sea and come \nback and then go out for another 3 months.\n  Instead, we make sure that the Reserve and National Guard are not \nonly taken care of, but we also earmark funds and a list of specific \nequipment for them.\n  The bill also includes $977.4 million for unrequested Guard and \nReserve equipment. While the report allocates the funds among generic \ncategories of miscellaneous equipment for the Reserve components, the \nreport also strongly suggests that priority be given to a long list of \nspecific items. The report also specifies that the funds will be used \nto buy C-130 and C-126 aircraft, long a staple of congressional add-ons \nfor the Guard and Reserve. \n\n[[Page S 17159]]\n\n  Mr. President, I support the Guard and Reserve. I think the Guard and \nReserve are vital components in our ability to defend our Nation. But \nwhen we do not have the fundamental basics that our active duty forces \nneed, and the prospects of them getting it any time soon are remote, we \nhave to stop the earmarking.\n  I want to waste a little more time here on both the B-2 and the \nSeawolf. If this were 1989, before the cold war was over, there would \nbe no stronger supporter on the floor of the Senate than this Senator \nfor both of those programs. The B-2 bomber would have really been a \nvital and important part of the triad, which I was always supportive \nof. Now the B-2 bomber is being advertised as some kind of long-range \nattack weapons delivery system which will be stealthy.\n  I do not argue that, Mr. President. I really do not argue that at \nall. I would be curious which commander is going to send an over $1 \nbillion per copy aircraft anywhere in a conventional scenario. I have \nlong recommended that we not put ejection seats into that plane because \nthe pilot that ejected would be the subject of investigation for the \nrest of his or her natural life.\n  The fact is that this is an incredibly expensive weapon system for \nwhich there is no relevance today in the post-cold war era. What we \nneed in the post-cold war era, Mr. President, is the ability to project \npower over long distances with an ability to remain there for a \nsignificant period of time and have enough firepower to affect the \nbattlefield equation. The B-2 can do a little of that. But we do not \nhave enough of the tactical aircraft, the carriers, amphibious ships, \nthe airlift that were really the fundamental components of that \ncapability. So we have opened the door to another $36 billion over the \nnext 20 years to spend on B-2 bombers.\n  This, interestingly enough, is despite the objection of the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and even the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force. Why does the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, who is a fine and decent man, oppose the B-2 bomber? He opposes \nit for a broad variety of reasons, and I do not want to put words in \nhis mouth. But one of the reasons is he does not see enough money there \nin order to fund the F-22, which the Air Force and he believes--and \nthis could be a subject for debate on the floor--are a vital component \nin our ability to defend the Nation's vital national security interests \nin the next century. They need a follow-on fighter aircraft. If you \nsiphon off $36 billion in the next 20 years for the B-2 bomber, it is \nhard for them to see where you will get the money for the F-22.\n  As far as the Seawolf is concerned, Mr. President, it is well known \nthat during the Presidential primary, President Clinton went to \nConnecticut and said he would support the Seawolf submarine. It is \nclear that this is a jobs program. There is no doubt that there have \nbeen tremendous cost overruns. We now have two shipyards that can build \nnuclear powered submarines. We now have two of them. I can envision no \nscenario in the future where we have a requirement for two shipyards to \nbuild nuclear submarines. But perhaps more important, Mr. President, is \nthat we continue to hear this argument that the former Soviet Union, \nRussia, today, which cannot meet anywhere near its quota of \nconscription for the year; estimates are between a quarter and a third \nof those conscripted show up; they have an incipient revolt in Chechnya \non their hands, which has cost them the blood of many hundreds of their \nyoung fighting men and women; and their officers, which were moved out, \nand their families, out of Eastern Europe back into Russia, are living \nin boxcars.\n  The state of their military establishment, by all objective \nobservers' estimates, is in a terrible and horrendous condition--not to \nmention the threat that we have of how we are going to dispose of the \nnuclear weapons that abound throughout the former Soviet Union.\n  So, Mr. President, what we are supposed to believe, given the \nconditions and the threats to Russia's vital national security \ninterest, which they see clearly are as they have been for most of its \nhistory in the so-called ``near abroad,'' that they are going to spend \nan enormous amount of money that they do not have on fast, quiet \nsubmarines.\n  Mr. President, they are not. It does not make any sense. It does not \nmake any sense to believe that the Russians are spending billions of \ndollars on fast, quiet submarines when they cannot even get their \nofficers out of boxcars into houses, when they cannot make their yearly \nannual conscription to man their armed forces to any degree whatever, \nwhen they are fighting a guerrilla war in Chechnya, when they have \nproblems in practically every part of what the Russians call ``near \nabroad.''\n  I do not believe that the Russian defense experts are so naive and so \nuninformed that they sit around and say, gee, forget all those problems \nI just articulated, build some fast, quiet submarines.\n  Mr. President, we are really doing the American taxpayers a great \ndisservice.\n  I want to say, finally again, I appreciate the hard work that is done \nby the members of the Appropriations Committee. I know they have \ndifficult issues to wrestle with. I am sure that, in fairness, the \nchairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member should bring up the \nlegitimate point that the authorizing committee has so far failed to \ncome up with any legislation, so they have had to make many of these \ndecisions. I think that is a very legitimate statement on the part of \nthe appropriators.\n  I will say, finally, one more time, Mr. President, and the last time, \nand mark my words, if we keep doing this, if we keep wasting taxpayers' \ndollars in this fashion, we are going to lose the confidence of the \nAmerican people and at some point there will be great resistance to \nadequately fund our defense forces and we may see a threat posed to our \nnational security that we cannot meet because of our failure to \narticulate to authorize and to appropriate adequate funding to meet the \nreal threats to our vital national security interests.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 10 minutes, but I do want to thank \nthe Senator from Arizona for his contribution. He does not know how \noften we use his positions in conference in order to achieve savings--\nwhich he does not mention.\n  Some of the items he mentioned, I think, are legitimate complaints. \nOthers I think have legitimate military value. We can discuss that on \nthe floor.\n  His last comment is the correct one. We did not have the guidance of \nthe Armed Services Committee this time and we just did our best. I \nthink that is because of some of the problems we face here on the \nfloor.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nconference report on the Department of Defense [DOD] appropriation \nbill.\n  The amount of money provided in this measure is too high.\n  I argued for a lower figure when we debated the budget resolution.\n  And I argued for a lower figure when we debated the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The cold war is over.\n  The Soviet military threat is gone.\n  We are closing military bases. Our force structure is shrinking.\n  Defense budgets should be coming down--not going up. But we lost that \nbattle.\n  For unknown reasons, Congress decided on the higher number, and \nthat's that.\n  Mr. President, I didn't come here to argue about the size of the \ndefense budget.\n  I come to the floor to thank my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, \nfor his advice and assistance with the DOD unmatched disbursements \nproblem.\n  Last year, with the help of my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, we \nbegan the process of trying to fix the $30 billion unmatched \ndisbursement problem.\n  We established thresholds at which DOD must match disbursements with \nobligations--before making a payment.\n  This year, Senator Stevens helped to reenergize and continue that \nprocess. He is helping to keep the pressure on.\n  And DOD Comptroller John Hamre is doing his part. He's helping, too.\n\n[[Page S 17160]]\n\n  In the coming months, both the General Accounting Office [GAO] and \nDOD Inspector General [IG] will be conducting detailed reviews of DOD's \nemerging capability to prematch disbursements.\n  Next year, at this time, I hope we are in a position to lay out a \nroad map for ratcheting down the thresholds.\n  Next year, I hope we can move the threshold to zero.\n  Mr. President, as I have said many times, with $30 billion in \nunmatched disbursements, there are no effective internal controls over \na big chunk of the DOD budget.\n  That means those accounts are vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  Mr. President, we must keep the pressure on and keep moving down the \nroad toward the time when all DOD payments are prematched.\n  I thank Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and Mr. John Hamre for their \nhelp in trying to fix this problem.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to seek the advice and assistance of \nthe committee's leadership on another issue.\n  I am concerned about the possible existence of a slush fund at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency [CIA].\n  Recent press reports suggest that bureaucrats in just one CIA \noffice--the National Reconnaissance Office [NRO]--accumulated a pool of \nunspent money that totaled between $1 and $2 billion.\n  Now, I know that the committee has taken certain steps in this bill \nto recover some of the money.\n  The bill also includes restrictive language governing the \navailability of CIA appropriations.\n  The restrictive language is embodied in section 8070 of the bill.\n  I commend the committee for taking these important steps.\n  However, in my mind, the action taken in the bill is a short-term \nfix.\n  We need to get at the root cause of the problem.\n  We need to understand the mechanisms that allowed bureaucrats in the \nNRO--and possibly other CIA offices--to accumulate huge sums of money.\n  And we need to develop a long-term solution.\n  Mr. President, we must not allow the CIA to accumulate huge sums of \nmoney in a honey pot that lies outside of the law.\n  The CIA must handle unspent appropriations in ways that are \nconsistent with the requirements of title 31 of the United States Code, \nand in particular, the M account reform law.\n  Senator Roth and I have sent a letter on this matter to the committee \nchairman, Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to Senator Hatfield, along with an article from the \nWashington Post on the same issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mark: We are writing to express concern about the \n     possible existence of a slush fund at the Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) and to seek your help in launching \n     an independent review to determine the origins of the money \n     and root cause of the problem.\n       The source of our concern is a series of reports that \n     appeared recently in the Washington Post and New York Times. \n     These reports suggest that one office within the CIA--the \n     National Reconnaissance Office--has accumulated ``a pool of \n     unspent money'' that totals between $1 billion and $1.7 \n     billion and that some of these funds may have been used for \n     unauthorized purposes.\n       In the wake of these disturbing revelations, unnamed \n     intelligence officials readily admitted: ``The agency's \n     financial practices were governed by custom, not by written \n     rules. . . . Many of the financial practices were time-\n     honored, but they were not documented. . . . They were just \n     folklore'' [New York Times, September 25, 1995, page 11].\n       On the surface, based solely on these very sketchy news \n     reports, we have to conclude that the CIA's books need more \n     scrutiny. A potential multi-billion dollar slush fund in just \n     one CIA office plus a possible breakdown of discipline and \n     integrity in accounting equals a recipe for abuse.\n       We must not allow the CIA to accumulate a ``pot of gold'' \n     that lies outside of the law.\n       As you may remember, back in the late 1980's, Congress \n     discovered the infamous M account slush fund at the \n     Department of Defense (DOD) and at other agencies as well. \n     The M accounts, which were also known as the ``honey pot,'' \n     were being used by DOD to circumvent the law--primarily the \n     Anti-Deficiency Act (31 USC 1341)--and to fund cost overruns \n     and other unauthorized activities beyond the purview of \n     Congress. DOD, for instance, had stashed at least $50 billion \n     in these accounts.\n       After holding extensive hearings that examined abusive M \n     account practices as revealed in audit reports prepared by \n     the Inspectors General and General Accounting Office, \n     Congress took decisive steps to close down the entire M \n     account operation.\n       The M account reform legislation was signed into law by the \n     President on December 5, 1990. It is embodied in Sections \n     1405 and 1406 of Public Law 101-510. It closed the M \n     accounts, canceled billions in unspent balances in ``merged \n     surplus authority,'' and place strict limits on the \n     availability of ``unspent'' appropriations of the kind \n     described in the above-mentioned press reports. To the best \n     of my knowledge, this law applies to all government agencies, \n     including the CIA.\n       The M account reform law in combination with all the other \n     laws governing the use of appropriations--as spelled out in \n     Title 31 of the U.S. Code--are supposed to make it very \n     difficult--if not impossible--to create a slush fund within \n     any government institution.\n       If the CIA is indeed ``hoarding'' money, as White House \n     Chief of Staff Leon Panetta has suggested, and stashing it \n     away for a rainy day, then Congress needs to know about it. \n     We should know about it because we have passed a law that is \n     designed to prevent bureaucrats from accumulating money \n     outside of the law. If the CIA has succeeded in doing that, \n     then we would like to understand exactly how it was done. \n     There may be a loophole in the law that needs to be plugged.\n       For these reasons, we are seeking your advice and \n     assistance on how to initiate an independent review of the \n     CIA's accounting records pertaining to balances of \n     unobligated and unexpended appropriations.\n       We need to know if the CIA is complying with the M account \n     reform act. Toward that end, certain questions need to be \n     answered: Were the agency's merged surplus and M accounts \n     closed and balances canceled as required by law? Are expired \n     appropriation account balances being canceled after five \n     years as required by law? Is the agency protecting the \n     integrity of expired appropriations accounts as required by \n     law? Have the agency's no-year accounts been handled \n     according to law? No doubt, there are other important \n     questions, but these are the ones that immediately come to \n     mind.\n       Between August 1991 and October 1992, the GAO conducted an \n     audit of residual M account monies throughout the government. \n     The results of this audit were published in a report entitled \n     ``Agencies Actions to Eliminate M Accounts and Merged Surplus \n     Authority'' in June 1993, Report Number AFMD-93-7. \n     Unfortunately, the CIA was not among the agencies reviewed. \n     The GAO, we are told, cannot get the access needed to audit \n     CIA accounts. The inability of the GAO to audit the CIA's \n     books leaves a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding \n     government-wide compliance with the M account reform law.\n       Mark, we would like to feel confident that the monies \n     Congress appropriates for the CIA are being controlled and \n     used in ways that are consistent with the requirements for \n     Title 31 of the U.S. Code, and in particular, the M account \n     reform law.\n       We have never examined a financial management issue at the \n     CIA and need your advice on how to proceed with such a \n     review.\n       Your assistance in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n     William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 1995]\n\n               Defense Gives Its Accounting System a `3'\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       Despite efforts to turn around what the Pentagon concedes \n     is an error-prone, cross-eyed financial accounting system, \n     top Defense Department officials yesterday said that on a \n     scale of 1 to 10, the ability to track where $260 billion is \n     spent each year rates only a sorry ``3.''\n       ``We are far short'' of being able to produce clean, \n     auditable annual financial statements, Richard F. Keevey, \n     director of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told \n     a congressional panel yesterday.\n       Summoned by a subcommittee of the House Committee on \n     Government Reform and Oversight--called in part to respond to \n     Washington Post articles about the problem in May--the \n     department's top financial officers and investigators from \n     the General Accounting Office and the inspector general's \n     office explained, defended and criticized the way the \n     department manages the money Congress gives it.\n       Only three members of the subcommittee showed up, and one \n     only briefly, perhaps a testimony to how arcane and \n     complicated the subject can be.\n       Chairman Rep. Steve Horn (R-Calif.) described the state of \n     Pentagon bookkeeping as something not even up to the \n     standards of ``every Mom and Pop store in America.''\n       ``What you're telling us today is a disgrace to the \n     American fighting men and women,'' said ranking minority \n     member Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), her voice rising in \n     frustration before she bolted out the door for a quick floor \n     vote. ``I'm sorry, I'm a little upset.''\n       What was upsetting to Maloney and Horn was good news to the \n     Pentagon officials who \n\n[[Page S 17161]]\n     point out that their accounting problems are decades-old and are only \n     now getting better. For instance:\n       The accumulated amount of payments that cannot be traced \n     with certainty to particular purchases has fallen from $50 \n     billion in June 1993 to $20.5 billion in September.\n       The department now refuses to pay any bill larger than $1 \n     million without the proper bookkeeping. The threshold used to \n     be $5 million, although the higher figure still applies to \n     its major, trouble-plagued Columbus, Ohio, check writing \n     center because contractors there complained that a new \n     standard would dramatically slow payments.\n       On the other hand, department Inspector General Eleanor \n     Hill testified the financial data ``for the vast majority of \n     [Defense Department] funds remain essentially not in \n     condition to audit,'' according to Hill's written statement.\n       ``The same types of system problems and internal control \n     weaknesses that hamper preparation of annual financial \n     statements,'' she said, ``also impair the efficiency of day-\n     to-day operations.''\n       So concerned is the IG's office about the problems that it \n     is deploying 700 auditors to snoop around the finance and \n     auditing areas at the department. Still, it does not expect a \n     significant turnaround until the year 2000, she said.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are asking for advice on how to initiate an \nindependent review of the CIA's accounting records pertaining to \nbalances of unobligated and unexpended appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I would like some assurances from the chairman and \nranking minority member that they will work with us in developing an \nacceptable approach to our request.\n  Our purpose is simple.\n  We want an independent review of the CIA's unspent balances.\n  Are they being maintained and controlled according to law?\n  But how do we do that?\n  We need the committee's advice and assistance.\n  We have been told, in news reports, that CIA Director John Deutch is \nlaunching his own investigation to review the NRO's ``deliberately \nobscure fiscal practices.''\n  That is fine and dandy.\n  But that's not an independent review.\n  I hope the committee will work with us to find a way to conduct an \nindependent review of the CIA's unspent balances.\n  The taxpayers of this country have a right to know that their money \nis being spent according to law.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to ask the committee's leadership \nthese three questions:\n  First, could the committee conduct an examination of the CIA's \nappropriations accounts to determine whether they are maintained and \ncontrolled as required by law?\n  Second, could the committee do the job if assisted by knowledgeable \npersonnel from the DOD IG's office and the GAO?\n  Third, could the DOD IG do the job?\n  I just hope my two colleagues help us get to the bottom of sense \nthings. I know you have the same concerns I do. But I would like to \nmove forward with this, to make sure we are not--my point is, we are \nnot relying just upon internal CIA investigations to make sure this \ndoes not happen. We ought to have some sort of independent, outside \ngroup, make sure that the job is being done and done correctly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I welcome the attention of the Senator \nfrom Iowa to what we call the classified annex that discusses some of \nthe problems that are raised with regard to the CIA carryforward funds. \nOthers have referred to them as slush funds. I found no slush funds. I \nhave found carryforward funds that represent program changes, \nprogrammatic decisions not to spend money but carry the money into the \nfuture, and downsizing that led to savings that were from money that \nwas not limited in terms of years.\n  We have dealt with that. It is not proper, in my opinion, for us to \ndiscuss that here. I direct the consideration of the Senator from Iowa \nto discussing it with the Intelligence Committee. We take our lead from \nthe Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee, but this year \nwe did take an extraordinary initiative in dealing with these funds to \nmake sure they would not be carried forward. It is discussed in our \nclassified annex. I invite my colleague's attention to that.\n  I do not want to delay, if the Senator from South Carolina wishes \nsome time. I am saddened to hear my friend discuss the needs of the \nDepartment of Defense, however, in the terms he has. I wish he would \nsee these needs through my eyes. I get tired of seeing pilots fly C-130 \nE's that were made in 1964. I get tired of flying in VC-137's that were \nmade in 1938. I get tired of going out and watching the people on the \nflightline go to fly and train in F-14's that were made in the 1970's, \nthe early 1970's.\n  The 5-ton trucks we have in our Army were made in the 1960's, and we \nhave not replaced them since. The M-1 tanks were made in the 1970's.\n  You find me any other part of our economy that is asked to train and \nlive in things that are 30 years old. I remember, when I was a young \nman, how much General Patton criticized the Army because they were \ntraining in the 1940's in things that were made in the early 1930's. \nOur people pray that they train in things that were made in the early \n1990's.\n  Again, I say to my friend, criticize the amount of this money if you \nwish, but if you do wish to criticize them, then take action to reduce \nthe commitments of our people abroad. I read earlier today the number \nof our people who are permanently living abroad now. Almost 250,000 \nAmericans plus their dependents live abroad permanently as members of \nthe armed services. There is just no reason for those people to live \nand be in harm's way. Many of them are daily in harm's way, in \nequipment that is old. We are trying to upgrade our procurement. That \nis the basic decision we have made. We are trying to upgrade our \nresearch and development. That is another basic decision we made.\n  Senator Inouye and I face a severe amount of criticism concerning the \namount of money in this bill. We are now in a 7-year, level-funded \nconcept for the Department of Defense. We reached out and brought some \nof that, from the late 1990's, into this bill because we can save \nmoney. We are doing our best to stretch this money out so it will not \nmake additional demands on the American taxpayers.\n  At the same time, I ask, how many of us are driving home in 1964 \ncars? If the American public wants us to have a status as a world \npower, and we are the only world power left; if we want someone in the \nworld to have the capabilities we have; then we must fund our people so \nthey can carry out their responsibilities and live in doing it. We are \nlosing too many people, now, because they are flying and driving in and \non vessels that are too old. We are doing our very best to do it, and I \ndo not like to hear Members of the Senate complain about the amount of \nmoney we are spending given the commitments.\n  If you do not like the commitments, then use your power to stop the \ndeployment of our forces abroad. Consider again deployment of forces to \nBosnia. Consider whether we need to still have people in Haiti.\n  Did you know they were supposed to be out by March? They are still \nthere.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. They will be there until after the election, because \nthings are going to blowup if they get out, and it will make the \nPresident look bad.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But you have to finance them. If they are not going to \nget them back and you have to keep them there, keep them there safe. \nThey are still in Rwanda. Around Iraq, we have a no-fly zone. There are \nyoung pilots flying over that country every day to prevent them from \nlaunching once again and becoming the second largest Air Force in the \nworld.\n  I tell you, my friend, I understand the Senator from Iowa with regard \nto the financial management. Incidentally, those problems came about \nbecause we brought all the records into Washington. It used to be if \nyou wanted to audit these things, you could go to Denver, go to San \nFrancisco, go to Panama, go somewhere in the world and find those \nrecords.\n  Five years ago we just consolidated them in Washington. That is still \ngoing on. It is true that there are a lot of those disbursements and \nthe record of what was gotten for the disbursements have not been \nmatched up. That is a delay in the computerization program in terms of \nverifying expenditures once they have been authorized. I agree 100 \npercent. \n\n[[Page S 17162]]\n\n  We have done more in this bill, I think, than the Senator has ever \nhad done before to meet his objectives, and we agree we ought to have--\nand by the end of next fiscal year, 1997, I hope we will have--the zero \namount there.\n  We should be able to balance our checkbook. I do not know about the \nSenator from Iowa, but I still have trouble balancing my checkbook and \nfiguring out what I wrote the check for. I know where I wrote the check \nthat I got something for, but sometimes I do not write down what I \nwrite it for. That is what happened at the Department of Defense. No \none has brought before us positive fraud or thievery. It is a question \nof lining up the records of actual acquisitions with regards to \nauthorization for expenditure. We are doing our best to do that.\n  The other committee which I chair, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, will be happy to work with the Senator from Iowa on that \nmatter. I thank him for his consideration. The only thing I wish we \nwould do is look again at the amount of money we need to put up for the \narmed services, for the people who are doing the job for us to be in \nharm's way as a superpower. If we do not want to do that, then let us \ncut the budget. If you want us to do the job we are doing, then you \nhave to fund what these people need, and you have to give them the \nassistance that will help keep them alive.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I please have 2 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, in Iowa for the benefit of \nthe Senator, I drive a 1961 Oldsmobile 98. So some of us do drive \naround in old cars.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mine is a 1965 Ford.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The second thing is you complimented me for what I was \ndoing on accounting. But you castigated me for what I was saying about \nthe level of expenditures, it seemed to me. My point is they are very, \nvery tied together. It seems to me that before we put more money into \nthe pot, we ought to be able to prove what we are buying, and have a \nsystem of accounting that makes sure that every dollar that we put into \ndefense gets us a dollar's worth of defense.\n  The second thing, and more appropriate to what the Senator from \nAlaska was saying about the level of expenditure--I think I said this \non the floor in the debate originally--but I was told by leaders on \nmilitary issues in the House of Representatives when we were on the \nbudget--and I am the second senior person on the Budget Committee; so I \nwas involved in those discussions--confidentially they said to me, \n``Chuck, you know we have to have about $6 or $7 billion more than what \nthe President wants because we have to take care of our Members. We \nhave to take care of our Members.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. Who said that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am not going tell the Senator who said that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was not this Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am talking about leaders in the other body. ``We need \n$6 or $7 billion to take care of our Members,'' meaning projects that \nMembers had that they wanted in the Defense budget.\n  That is just exactly the amount of money that we are above the \nPresident's figures. So I figure we have about $6 or $7 billion in here \njust to take care of a bunch of pork barrelers.\n  That is what I am complaining about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from South Carolina, if you do not mind, \nasked us to yield him time. I will do so. Then we would be happy to \ntake care of the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  How long does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Such time as he uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in \ncomplimenting Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nDefense Appropriations and Senator Inouye, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for bringing this conference report to the floor. This has \nbeen a difficult conference for them and I congratulate them on their \ndiligence and perseverance in arriving at this conference report.\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated many times, these conference \nreports represent compromises made by both the House and Senate. They \nwill never please everyone. There are items in this report that I \nbelieve could be better, but on the whole it provides the critical \nfunds to ensure the continued readiness of our forces both in the near \nterm and in the out years.\n  Mr. President, we may soon have to vote on commiting our forces to \nmaintain the peace agreement in Bosnia. Although I may object to \nsending the forces, I am confident that they will have the means and \ntraining to carry out the mission. I am confident of that fact because \nover the past years the Congress has provided the funds to ensure their \ncapabilities. The conference report that we are considering today \nprovides the funds to ensure our armed services can continue to fulfill \ntheir mission and the tasks that are placed on them by our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my good friends, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye for their dedication to and support of our Armed Forces. \nThey have brought a sound conference report to the Senate and I urge \nthe Senate to support them and this conference report.\n  In closing, I want to say this: There is nothing more important to \nthis Nation than to keep a strong defense. It means our very survival. \nWe could do without a lot of things, many things. But we cannot neglect \nour defense, if we want to maintain this great Nation. Our Constitution \nprovides this country with the greatest freedom of any nation in the \nworld. It provides us with more justice, more opportunity, and more \nhope than any people have ever been provided in the history of the \nworld. And we want to keep this. But, to keep this, we have to keep a \nstrong defense.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for this fine \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I reserve the remainder of our time and Senator McCain's \ntime under my control.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am pleased to yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I wanted to comment on Senator Grassley's \nconcern. His concern is very well taken about the fact that we have an \ninadequate accounting system over at the Defense Department. But let me \ncarry it beyond defense also.\n  We also have an inadequate accounting system across all of our \nGovernment. Governmental Affairs worked on this going back about 7 or 8 \nyears in the late 1980's, and for the first time--it is unbelievable \nthat up until 1990 there was no requirement in the Federal Government \nto do a bottom-line audit at the end of the year. Some departments did \nit. Some agencies did it. Some did not. The Defense Department was one \nthat basically did not. We put through a Chief Financial Officer Act; \narcane, people did not even show up at hearings because it was such a \nboring subject. But once we passed that act, as Charles Bowsher, head \nof the GAO, said, it was probably the ``best financial management act \nthat we passed around here in the last 40 years,'' to quote his words.\n\n  Over in Department of Defense, they are trying to get that under \ncontrol. But back in the years before that we would not even give them \nthe money to do the upgrades on computers, and so on, to manage their \nequipment, manage their accounts.\n  I have been out to the DFAS Center, the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service, and have gone through what they go through on \ntrying to decide whether to pay a bill or not. Do you know what they \nare doing? They go from an office, and they go down the hall to a \nwarehouse. They go down a long line of hundreds of thousands of manila \nenvelopes, folders on metal racks, bring those files back, and lay them \nout on the table to decide. Yes, we will pay this, or not that, or \nsomething else. That is the way much of this work has been done.\n  They are making great strides. They have even contracted some of this \nout. \n\n[[Page S 17163]]\n I have been out there. I think we are making great strides and John \nHamre deserves a lot of credit for taking this on.\n  Have we solved the problems yet in the time period to 1990? No, we \nhave not. So we do not have the problem solved yet. But we are making \nprogress. Meanwhile, I can quote horror story after horror story about \nhow contractors have sent back in $700 million they said we had not \nsent bills in for, and things like that.\n  I wanted to add my support for Senator Grassley's concern. I share \nhis concern. I just want everyone to know that we are making progress \nin this area. I do not think we will have it by the end of next year, \nas Senator Stevens said. It is still a big job over there to get done. \nWe are making a lot of progress in this area. We never required that \nuntil 1990.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I said the end of fiscal 1997.\n  Mr. GLENN. I misunderstood. I am sorry.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report on the Department of Defense appropriations bill, and \nI would like to take this opportunity to outline several of my \nconcerns.\n  In the coming year, American families across this country will begin \nto feel the very real effects of the budget cuts this Congress has made \nin most of the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills. Programs across \nthe spectrum are being deeply cut or eliminated in an attempt to \neliminate this country's spiraling national debt.\n  Unfortunately, while the Republican spending bills make deep cuts in \nprograms for children, the poor, veterans, and the elderly, defense \nspending has been insulated from cuts and, in fact, increased \ndramatically. The bill before us increases defense spending by $7 \nbillion above the President's request, at a time when we are cutting \n$270 billion from Medicare, $170 billion from Medicaid, $114 billion \nfrom welfare, $36 billion from nutrition programs, and $5 billion from \nstudent loans.\n  Mr. President, I have a deep and strong respect for our Nation's \nmilitary, which is second to none in the world. Our Armed Forces \ndeserve the gratitude of this Nation for the protection and security \nthey provide to the American people. Congress has an obligation to \nensure that our military personnel are adequately compensated for their \nwork, and that they have the best tools possible to work with as they \nundertake their many and difficult missions.\n  But in this era of shared sacrifice where no one is spared the budget \nax--not children, seniors, nor veterans--I cannot support a bill that \ngoes so far beyond the Pentagon's request for defense spending and \nfails to cancel even a single major weapons program. This bill is a bad \ndeal for the taxpayer and a bad deal for our military, who will have to \nlive with unrequested and unneeded weapons systems provided for them \nfrom a Congress that refuses to take no for an answer.\n  During the cold war, Americans made sacrifices here at home so that \nour national resources could be used to defeat communism around the \nglobe. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and with it, the Warsaw Pack. The \nSoviet Union officially dissolved in 1991. We fought the war, and we \nwon.\n  In the aftermath of the cold war, I believe American families deserve \nto live in a safer and more stable world. They deserve to know that \nmore of their tax dollars are going to educate their children and \npolice their streets.\n  Time and again when this body has debated domestic spending bills my \nRepublican colleagues have urged us to have the courage to cut funding \nfor this program or that program--saying they have outlived their \nusefulness.\n  So why, Mr. President, does the bill we are voting on today continue \nfunding for several cold war-era programs that have clearly outlived \ntheir usefulness? And where, Mr. President, are the calls for courage \nto terminate programs we cannot afford?\n  For example, the conference report provides $700 million as a \ndownpayment on a third Seawolf nuclear-powered attack submarine. Nearly \neveryone acknowledges that this third Seawolf is not necessary to meet \nforce structure requirements. This program, as my colleagues know, was \ndesigned to combat the ``great Soviet Navy''--a Navy that is now in \nport and in serious need of repair.\n  Supporters of this program claim that construction of this third \nSeawolf is needed to preserve the submarine industrial base. But Mr. \nPresident, overall the Seawolf program has cost the taxpayers of this \nNation $12.9 billion. In this budget climate, it is inexcusable to \ncontinue funding the Seawolf, especially given the lack of mission for \nthis submarine.\n  Likewise, it is simply unforgivable that the bill before us \nresurrects funding for the B-2 bomber program, providing $493 million \nto keep that program alive. This, despite the fact that several years \nago Congress agreed to terminate this program after 20 planes had been \nbuilt, because Congress recognized that in the aftermath of the cold \nwar, this aircraft lacks a realistic mission.\n\n  Nonetheless, it appears that Congress is on a path to fund yet \nanother 20 planes which, according to the Pentagon, will cost $31.5 \nbillion in the coming years. The Pentagon does not want this program, \nand clearly cannot afford it.\n  The Pentagon does not want to take on the immense financial \nobligations of further B-2 procurement--knowing that this unneeded \nsystem will take precious and scarce dollars away from other \npriorities.\n  Let's keep these issues in perspective. The unmasked for and unneeded \nfunding this bill provides for the B-2 bomber--the $493 million--is \nmore than enough money to pay the tuition, room and board, and book \ncosts of all the undergraduates at the University of Washington for \ntheir entire 4 years. That's 20,500 students.\n  And as I've noted, the money provided this year is just a downpayment \non the $31.5 billion that will ultimately be needed to build 20 more \nplanes. For that amount, 1.3 million Washington State residents could \nget a 4-year education at the University of Washington.\n  Ironically, the conference report we are considering today fails to \nfund one program that I believe is a real cost saver for the Pentagon \nand the taxpayer, and provides an effective response to our Nation's \nairlift problems. The Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft Program \n[NDAA], designated as a pilot program under the Federal Acquisition and \nStreamlining Act of 1994, is an ideal model that demonstrates how \ncommercial products can support military missions. I am disappointed \nthat the conference committee failed to provide funding for NDAA, which \nstands to improve our current airlift shortfall and provide several \nbillion dollars in budgetary cost savings.\n  So, Mr. President, as we ask teachers and students to accept dramatic \ncuts in education spending, worker training programs, and student loan \nprograms, so too must we find ways to trim our defense budget.\n  And as we ask preschoolers and their parents to accept deep cuts in \nHead Start funding, we must find ways to trim our defense budget.\n  And as we ask rural Americans to accept cuts in mandatory agriculture \nspending, we must find ways to trim our defense spending.\n  And as we ask children and the elderly to shoulder billions in \nMedicare and Medicaid cuts, we must find ways to trim our defense \nbudget. In America today, one in four children, and one in three \ninfants, are covered by Medicaid.\n  And as we ask our Nation's scientific community to accept millions in \ncuts for basic research, we must find ways to cut our defense spending.\n  In the coming years, the Republican budget blueprint increases the \nveterans' contribution for GI bill education benefits, and freezes \nfunding for the VA's medical system at the 1995 level for the next 7 \nyears, cutting access to health care for veterans around the Nation. \nUnder the Republican proposal, the VA will be forced to close the \nequivalent of 35 of its 170 hospitals and deny care to over 1 million \nof our Nation's vets.\n  Proponents of this bill point to recent declines in defense spending \nwith alarm. While spending for our military is down from the mid-1980's \nlevel, we must keep this trend in perspective. The United States today \nhas the largest military budget and the most powerful military force in \nthe world.\n  The combined military budgets of Russia, Iraq, China, North Korea, \n\n[[Page S 17164]]\n  Libya, Iran, Syria, and Cuba total $95 billion annually. That is one-\nthird the level of U.S. defense spending. Each year, the United States \nspends more than the next nine of the world's biggest military spenders \ncombined.\n  In fact, this country spends so much for defense, even the Pentagon \ncan't keep track of it all. According to the GAO and the Pentagon's \ninspector general, as well as the Pentagon's Controller John Hamre, \nbillions of defense dollars are lost year after year due to poor \nrecordkeeping and lax accounting practices at the Department of \nDefense.\n  At the very least, Congress should hold defense spending to the \nPresident's level until the Pentagon can fix their payment procedures \nand bring some accountability to the system. We owe that much to the \nNation's taxpayers.\n  But most of all, in order to project strength abroad, we must gain \nstrength here at home. Our national security, in my view, will not be \nstrengthened by yet more guns and missiles. We need to restore global \neconomic leadership. We must invest in our children and their future--\nin their education and their health. We must rebuild our cities and our \ninfrastructure, and invest in technology and scientific research.\n  We must ensure that the economy our children inherit in the next \ncentury is sound and growing.\n  So, in closing, Mr. President, it is with regret and disappointment \nthat I must vote ``no'' on this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President I am pleased that we are able to consider the \nDefense appropriations bill conference report today. I commend Chairman \nStevens and Senator Inouye for their work in hammering out the \nnecessary compromise allowing us to bring this bill to the floor. The \nDefense appropriations bill, which funds the greatest share of the \nNation's defense spending, is one of the most important bills we pass \neach year.\n  This year the Republican-led Congress is keeping our promise to the \nAmerican people to restore our national security. We have turned the \ncorner on defense spending. As a result of the Republican leadership \nand the hard work of the chairman, Senator Stevens, we no longer head \ndown the path to a hollow military. Most of the funds Congress added \nwill restore funding for the procurement and research & developments \naccounts--accounts neglected by the current administration. Without \nthis funding, the armed services face a nearly insurmountable \nmodernization bow wave in the very near future.\n  The President and administration officials have spoken at length \nabout maintaining readiness, but they've failed to consider the impact \nof the insufficient funding on the readiness of our forces in the \nfuture. This administration has maintained short term readiness at the \nexpense of our future forces. And no one should forget that the \nPresident's force plan required significant force enhancements. But \nthose enhancements have not been fielded. The bottom line is that under \nthe Clinton administration, our forces have become smaller, but not \nmore capable.\n  With this bill the Republican-led Congress sends a very clear \nmessage. We have fulfilled our responsibility to provide our forces \nwith the most modern equipment available, ensuring their overwhelming \nsuperiority on the battlefield. We have taken steps to ensure that our \nforces, though smaller, maintain the ability to project power around \nthe world--quickly and decisively. This Congress has taken the lead in \nprotecting both our deployed forces and our home land against ballistic \nmissile attack.\n  The President and many on the other side of the aisle oppose this \nbill. But the choice is clear. If you vote for this bill, you vote to \nrestore our national defense. If you vote against it, you vote to \ncontinue down the path to a hollow force.\n  In closing, I again commend the chairman and ranking member for their \nwork on this critical legislation and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, providing funds for our national defense is \none of the most important functions we in Congress are entrusted with. \nI take with particular seriousness my duties on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense, since we provide taxpayer dollars for weapons, \npeople, and training.\n  I have the deepest respect for our subcommittee chairman, Senator \nStevens, and for our ranking member, Senator Inouye. For many years, \nwhether the Congress is controlled by Republicans or Democrats, the \nheads of this subcommittee have provided reasoned, nonpartisan \nleadership on defense issues.\n  This bill will spend $6.9 billion more than the President's request \nat a time when virtually every other discretionary spending account is \nbeing cut. I would support this expenditure if there were an imminent \nthreat to the Nation, of if there were some glaring deficiency in our \ndefenses. Neither of those conditions have been met, in my judgment. \nWhile we are cutting Medicare, school loans, and veterans benefits, \nthis bill spends $493 million for more B-2 bombers that the President \ndidn't request and that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe Air Force Chief of Staff say they do not want. Twenty more B-2's \nwill cost us $31 billion, and there are no funds in our 5-year defense \nplan for these planes. This program is questionable from a defense \nperspective, and especially irresponsible in the larger context of our \npursuit of a balanced budget.\n  I was also disappointed that the House conferees were successful in \nincluding restrictions on a woman's right to choose an abortion at \nDepartment of Defense medical facilities. This provision has no place \non an appropriations bill and I am saddened that the Senate has \naccepted this provision in conference.\n  There are other aspects of this bill that I disagree with, but the \nincreased funding, additional B-2 bomber procurement, and antiabortion \nlanguage caused me to respectfully disagree with my chairman and \nranking member, and to vote against this conference report.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. October 1, Mr. President. Every year, we have until \nOctober 1 to pass the 13 necessary spending bills that keep our \nGovernment running. This year, when it became clear that Congress would \nnot be able to complete floor action on these bills by this deadline, \nwe passed a continuing resolution to keep the Government running until \nNovember 13. Still, the additional 6 weeks proved insufficient for \nCongress to complete action on these bills.\n  Our Government is now shut down because Republicans in the House and \nRepublicans in the Senate cannot agree with each other on what should \nand should not be included in these bills. In large part, the \nappropriations bills presented before us have been seriously flawed, so \nmuch so that Republicans themselves cannot agree on them. As Republican \nHouse and Senate conferees continue to bicker in back rooms, several \nhundred thousand Federal employees are home, waiting for a paycheck \nthat is not coming. The so-called faceless, nameless bureaucrat waits, \nwondering how he or she will put food on the table, make the next \nmortgage payment, or prepare for the coming holiday season. Thousands \nof citizens wait to obtain a passport, a visa, file for Social \nSecurity, and so on. Congress has once again failed the American \npeople.\n  It is time to put this budget impasse behind us. We will only be able \nto do so if the majority party presents us with fair and responsible \nspending bills to send to the President's desk.\n  This brings me to the legislation we now face, the Department of \nDefense appropriations report. As the Republicans claim to want a \nbalanced budget, they now put before us a defense spending bill bloated \nbeyond one's wildest imagination. Let me remind my colleagues on the \nopposite side of the aisle that the cold war is over. Let me repeat \nthat. The cold war is over.\n  We must put an end to outdated notions--outdated notions of America's \ndefense needs and outdated notions of the threats to U.S. security. The \nDefense appropriations bill reported out of the conference committee is \ndesigned for the cold war era--an era that has ended. This budget \nembodies outdated notions and adopts an outdated approach to our \nnational security. I therefore urge that the conference report be \nrejected.\n  Rather than focusing on threats that no longer exist, we must begin \nfocusing on the realities of the present day and the fundamental \ntransformations that are shaping the world and our country. \n\n[[Page S 17165]]\nChief among those transformations are the end of the cold war and our \nrunaway debt. These transformations have enormous political, strategic, \nand economic implications. They are changing the way we must view the \nworld and the role of the United States in that world.\n  The end of the cold war, for example, has brought a period of \ntransition. We are no longer faced with a Soviet threat. Rather, we are \nconfronted with a period of transition--a work in progress--as Russia \nand other countries move to define themselves and their relationships \nwith the United States and the rest of the world. This transition \nperiod has brought with it different and very real threats for which we \nmust be prepared. Ethnic conflicts and renegade nuclear proliferation, \namong others, are threats that must be recognized, met, and defeated.\n  Economically, these transformations have changed the way that we \nproduce things, the services that are offered and the way that we must \ncompete in global markets to be successful. Jobs have been lost and our \nenormous debt places very real limits on our spending choices. This has \nvery real implications for U.S. security interests, which obviously \ndepend not only on military power, but on economic power as well. It is \ncrucial that our military power be supported by a strong and vital \neconomy and work force. This in turn requires fiscal responsibility, \nnot the current runaway deficit spending. It also requires difficult \nchoices. In short, we simply cannot afford to waste millions of dollars \non outdated programs that will not serve our national security or our \neconomic interests.\n  But that is precisely what this defense budget does. Rather than \ndirecting scarce resources where they are needed, this budget funds \nexorbitantly expensive and unnecessary programs.\n  As you will remember, I spoke against the Defense appropriations bill \nwhen it was considered by this body in August. Since then, that bill \nhas gone to committee to be reconciled with the House version. What has \nresulted is even worse than could have been expected. No program was \neliminated. Rather, when there were competing budget items in the House \nand Senate bills, the committee accepted the extravagances of both, \nnever mind that they were redundant or not even necessary in the first \nplace.\n  Take, for example, the funding of two types of marine amphibious \nassault ships--the LHD-7 amphibious assault ship included in the Senate \nbill--a ship that the administration did not even request. In the House \nbill, funding was provided for the similar PD-17 amphibious assault \nship. Rather than choose one or the other, this budget funds both at a \ncost of almost $2.3 billion. This is fiscal irresponsibility and it is \nnot in our national security interests.\n  This budget also provides for increases for the B-2 bomber program--\nan increase that the Pentagon doesn't even want. Indeed, the Pentagon-\nsponsored May 1995 study opposed any further purchases for this system. \nBut throwing such recommendations to the wind, this budget increases \nfunding by $493 million.\n  Not only does this budget fund B-2 increases, it provides over $2.2 \nbillion for the competing F-22--a program that the House appropriations \nsubcommittee zeroed out as long ago as 1989 for its highly unrealistic \nassumptions about funding levels and possibly unrealizable technical \ngoals. Now, the F-22 is 1,300 pounds overweight, its stealth signature \nis larger than expected and there are questions about its software. But \nthis budget continues to fund it although both the CBO and GAO found \nthat the lower cost F/A-18E/F could do the job.\n  This budget also provides $700 million for a third Seawolf submarine \nthat we simply do not need and that is far too costly. Although the \nBush administration proposed halting this program in 1992, we have \nalready funded a second one, and this budget would add a clearly \nunnecessary third.\n  This budget provides $757.6 million for the continued development of \nthe V-22 Osprey, a program that the Bush administration tried to kill 4 \nyears ago and whose mission can be performed more cheaply and reliably \nwith the procurement of CH-53E helicopters.\n  This budget provides $299 million for the Comanche. Not only is the \nComanche unproven and experiencing developmental problems, its air \ncombat missions can be performed at a much lower cost by the Apache. \nEven the Defense Department had proposed limiting this program to the \nproduction of two prototypes. But this budget not only continues to \nfund those prototypes, it increases funding by $100 million over the \nadministration's request for full-scale production.\n  With all these increases, it is not surprising that this budget \nexceeds the administration's request by nearly $7 billion. But this \nincrease in funding does not represent an increase in our national \nsecurity. Rather such fiscal irresponsibility will do more to harm our \nnational security than to improve it.\n  Too much of this $243 billion Defense budget represents nothing more \nthan a jobs program. It funds defense contractors for weapons that we \nsimply do not need and increases funding for programs like the B-2 \nagainst the Pentagon's own recommendations. It is true that the end of \nthe cold war era has required a substantial drop in jobs in the defense \nsector. Defense jobs will decline from 7.2 million to 4.2 million by \n1996. This job loss in the defense industry clearly must be addressed. \nHowever, the answer is not found in funding jobs through unnecessary \nweapons programs.\n  This is a budget for a time now gone, not a budget for today, let \nalone tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 2126, the 1996 Department of \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member, and all the \nconferees, for bringing the Senate a bill that meets the most critical \nneeds of the U.S. military for the defense of our Nation.\n  The conferees have achieved this significant accomplishment even \nthough the Defense Subcommittee contributed additional defense spending \nauthority to both the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, which I chair, and the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. These subcommittees also fund vital programs related to \nour national defense.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement on defense appropriations \nprovides a total of $243.3 billion in budget authority and $163.2 \nbillion in new outlays for the programs of the Department of Defense in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the conference agreement provides a \ntotal of $243.3 billion in budget authority and $242.9 billion in \noutlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The Senate bill is within the subcommittee's revised section 602(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the pending bill to the subcommittee's 602(b) \nallocation pursuant to the 1996 budget resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I thank the conferees for their consideration of several important \nitems that I brought to their attention.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT        \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................        -50     79,678\n  H.R. 2126, conference report....................    243,087    163,009\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..............    243,037    242,688\n                                                   =====================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........         40\n  H.R. 2126, conference report....................  .........  .........\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........  .........         40\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........  .........\n  H.R. 2126, conference report....................        214        214\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions..................          0          0\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory..........................        214        214\n                                                   =====================\n      Adjusted bill total.........................    243,251    242,941\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................    243,042    243,472\n\n[[Page S 17166]]\n                                                                        \n  Nondefense discretionary........................  .........         40\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................        214        214\n      Total allocation............................    243,256    243,726\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................         -5       -784\n  Nondefense discretionary........................  .........         -0\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total allocation............................         -5      -785 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

I wonder if I might engage the distinguished chairman \nin a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Certainly. I am always happy to hear from the senior \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman. Mr. President, let me begin by \nacknowledging again the efforts of the chairman and the committee for \ntheir diligent and steadfast efforts to produce a fiscal year 1996 \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the committee's support for \nthe historically black college and university and minority institutions \n[HBCU/MI] account, particularly language within the account that \nencourages the Department to continue its support for minority \ninstitutions, including Hispanic-serving institutions [HSI's], through \nacademic collaborations for research and education related to science \nand technology. This language carries a considerable amount of \nimportance for the education and research community in my home State of \nNew Mexico.\n  Three Hispanic-serving institutions in my State; the University of \nNew Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico Highlands \nUniversity have teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico, the \nlargest minority institution in the country, to develop an academic \nprogram that will foster the growth of Hispanic students in science and \ntechnology. This collaboration was created out of the need to \nstrengthen the competitiveness and capabilities of Hispanic students in \nthese fields. Such a collaborative effort will effectively contribute \nto the development of a critical mass of talent and substantially \nenhanced research opportunities for DOD that are uniquely available at \nthese institutions. As we look to advance the Department's research \ncapabilities, programs such as the ones established between these fine \ninstitutions of higher learning should be encouraged.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would note that my colleague makes a strong case in \nsupport of this initiative. I, too, understand the importance HBCU/MI \nprograms play in the research efforts and capabilities of the \nDepartment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman for his support of the HBCU/MI \naccount and I urge the committee's continued support for future \nresearch activities at these institutions related to our national \nsecurity interests.\n\n\n     ballistic missile defense organization technology development\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to discuss an item that \nconcerns the Phillips Laboratory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I welcome such a discussion with the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am concerned that language in the report accompanying \nthe Senate-passed Defense appropriation bill, specifically Report 104-\n124, contains language regarding ballistic missile defense that is \nsubject to misinterpretation. The language states the following:\n\n       In order to optimize follow-on technology development, the \n     Committee directs BMDO to designate the Army Space and \n     Strategic Defense Command (SSDC) as a center of excellence \n     for technology development. The Committee believes that \n     commonality in requirements offers the potential for cost \n     savings through centralized screening and common, technology \n     development, with SSDC functioning as the executive agent to \n     BMDO, to help assure that duplication is avoided, and \n     efficiencies are maximized.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We certainly would not want this language to be \nmisinterpreted. Would you elaborate on your concerns?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One of the goals of this language is to avoid \nduplication, save funds, and maximize efficiency. These goals are \nsupported by everyone. However, certain aspects of the language, as \nwritten, could be misconstrued to mean that Phillips Laboratory missile \ndefense programs and the associated technologies could be transferred \nto SSDC.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was not the intention to transfer any programs. I am \ntold that SSDC works primarily on ground-based systems, while the \nPhillips Laboratory works primarily on space-base systems. Furthermore, \nthere are a number of order DOD commands and laboratories which can \nserve BMDO's technology needs in these and other areas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I agree with the chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee. I sought clarification to make clear that the intent is \nnot to move programs. Thus, the proposed space-based laser, the \nairborne laser, and the supporting space-related technologies should \nremain at Phillips Laboratory. The laboratory has made great progress \nin these areas.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was never our intention to do otherwise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator and would just like to clarify one \nadditional point. It is clearly not the intent of this language to give \nany authority to SSDC or BMDO with regard to any Air Force-funded \nprograms at the Phillips Laboratory. It is only intended to have effect \non the SSDC and BMDO Programs. Is that the understanding of the \ndistinguished chairman?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is my understanding of the language's intent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished chairman for the opportunity \nto be heard on this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I had hoped we could avoid a train wreck as \nwe try to wrap up our budget and appropriations work. Now I hope we can \nwork together in a bipartisan way to solve these problems, for that is \nsurely what the public wants. And the public wants us to function with \ncommon sense in an intelligent way to keep the Government going as we \nmake these decisions.\n  But the public also knows it does not make sense to be adding $7 \nbillion to the defense budget so we can build more B-2 bombers, F-15 \nand F-16 fighters, and other equipment that the Pentagon doesn't want, \nand at the same time threaten to cut education, crime prevention, and \nother programs that are so critical to the security of our people.\n  And so I rise to indicate that I cannot support this conference \nreport, as I voted against final passage of the Senate bill several \nmonths ago. While the conferees have removed some of the provisions of \nthe bill that I opposed, this bill still has far more total funding \nthan the Pentagon needs and more than the Department of Defense asked \nfor.\n  The President has already indicated that he would veto the bill. On \nOctober 18, in a letter to House Appropriations Committee Chairman \nLivingston, where he said:\n\n       . . . by appropriating $6.9 billion more than I requested, \n     the Conference Report did not address my fundamental concerns \n     about spending priorities. . . . Absent a broader agreement \n     with Congress that adequately funds crucial domestic programs \n     in other appropriations bills, I will veto any defense \n     appropriations bill that adds extra billions for defense \n     programs not in my request.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the President's letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     conference report on the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense \n     Appropriations Act. I want you to know that I appreciate your \n     hard work and leadership on this bill, as well as that of \n     Senators Stevens and Inouye. The Conference Report had many \n     commendable features. For example, a number of policy \n     provisions that raised serious constitutional and national \n     security concerns were satisfactorily resolved in conference, \n     and funding was secured for several programs that were of \n     particular importance to me and to the national security of \n     this country, including the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     program and the Technology Reinvestment Project.\n       However, by appropriating $6.9 billion more than I \n     requested, the Conference Report did not address my \n     fundamental concerns about spending priorities. As the bill \n     now goes back to conference following its defeat on the House \n     floor, it is important that the conferees understand where I \n     stand. Absent a broader agreement with Congress that \n\n[[Page S 17167]]\n     adequately funds crucial domestic programs in other appropriations \n     bills, I will veto any defense appropriations bill that adds \n     extra billions for defense program not in my request.\n       I am ready to work with Congress to ensure that we reach \n     that agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that veto writing has been on the wall even \nlonger. Alice Rivlin, OMB Director indicated 10 weeks ago, when this \nconference report first went before the House, that the President would \nveto it. I would ask unanimous consent that her letter to House \nMinority Leader Gephardt of September 29, 1995 be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I understand that the House may consider \n     the conference report on the FY '96 defense appropriations \n     bill today.\n       As he has shown in his 10-year plan, the President that we \n     can balance the budget and maintain a strong defense without \n     sacrificing critical investments in education and training, \n     science and technology, environmental protection, and other \n     priorities--all of which are essential to raise the standard \n     of living for average Americans. By providing $6.9 billion \n     more than the President requested, however, this bill would \n     divert funds from our needed investment in these critical \n     areas.\n       Now that the House has passed 12 of the 13 appropriations \n     bills and the Senate all but two, the trade-of between \n     defense and domestic investments are all the more clear. In \n     an environment of limited resources, we have to use available \n     funds as prudently as possible. We simply cannot allocate \n     nearly $7 billion more than we need at this time for defense, \n     and starve our needed investments in education and training \n     and other priorities.\n       The changes to the bill in conference, while commendable in \n     many instances, do not address the Administration's \n     fundamental concerns about spending priorities. For this \n     reason, in the absence of an agreement between the \n     Administration and Congress resolving these important issues, \n     the President would veto this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Alice M. Rivlin, Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The President's original Pentagon budget provided for a \nstrong defense. It funded the priorities of the armed services and \nrecognized that in the post-cold war world we have to prepare for \ndifferent threats, not conduct business as usual. We cannot afford to \nbuy equipment that is in excess of our military requirements, or make \nlong-term funding commitments that are not sustainable, like signing up \nfor another $30 billion or higher tab for 20 more B-2 bombers. If we \nfollow that course, we are actually robbing from our future security, \nrobbing resources that should go into keeping our troops well-trained \nand keeping our forces in high readiness and high morale, modernizing \nequipment in areas we ignored for too long, and continuing research and \ndevelopment on future modernization.\n  Instead, the conferees have sent us a bill that includes $493 million \nas a down-payment on what will be at least a $30 billion program to \nbuild 20 more B-2 bombers not requested by the Pentagon. Secretary of \nDefense Perry has been saying all year that we should not add funding \nfor more B-2's. He said, as this bill was taking shape in September \nthat the B-2 money ``was put in against my explicit advice.''\n  Was Bill Perry, the acknowledged ``father of stealth'', alone in his \njudgment? No, that judgment is shared by the General Shalikashvili, by \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by the President. The Senate bill did \nnot include that money for B-2's. In fact, it was in the original \nDefense authorization bill mark of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and the committee voted to cut it out, by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 13-8.\n  What else did the conferees include that was not requested by the \nPentagon and not authorized by the Senate? For 6 new F-16 fighters, \n$159 million. That is a program we in the Senate have voted to \nterminate at least three times, including this year. We have a surplus \nof F-16's in the force; we do not need any more. The conferees included \n$311 million for 6 new F-15 fighters, also not requested and not \nauthorized by the Senate this year. For an LHD-7 landing ship $1.3 \nbillion that was not even in the 5-year defense plan, but was moved \nforward for purchase in this appropriations bill.\n  That is not all. The conference report also doubles the Defense \nDepartment's request for national missile defense research, from $370 \nmillion to $745 million, and funds a $30 million Antisatellite Weapons \nProgram that was not requested by the Pentagon.\n  What was not funded in the conference report? Ongoing operations, \nmisnamed ``contingencies'' by the Pentagon, receive some finding, about \n$600 million, but not the full $1.1 billion we know we will have to pay \nin fiscal year 1996 for ongoing operations that are already in place. \nThis shortfall is a direct threat to readiness, precisely the area that \nso many in Congress expressed concern about just within the last year. \nTraining and maintenance accounts could end up being the source of \nfunds to pay for these operations and that could hurt the readiness of \nsome divisions.\n  The Technology Reinvestment Program, which is trying to preserve our \ncutting edge research capability for the future by supporting dual-use \ndevelopment programs on a cost-shared, competitive basis, was slashed \nby more than half by the conferees to only $195 million. And Mr. \nPresident, there is much more.\n  This conference report is not in step with our priority security \nrequirements; not in step with the priorities of the Joint Chiefs, the \nSecretary of Defense and the President. It is not fiscally responsible. \nWe can and should do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Five minutes or three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 15 minutes \nand 30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that I have been watching this \nsubcommittee deliberation on this very important defense authorization \nappropriations bill. I know how hard it has been to get this bill \nthrough. I have watched the negotiations with the House Members. I have \nwatched the negotiations between the Members. I have heard some of the \ndebate on the floor in the last few hours. Of course, there are things \nthat one Member may not think are the priorities for another Member. \nBut there is an equal force on the other side that does not like \nsomething else in it. It is very difficult to bring people together.\n  But the bottom line here in the big picture is that we have put more \ninto defense appropriations this year than the President sent up here, \nand we did that in a bipartisan effort because so many of us are \nconcerned that we have a false sense of security, that we are in a safe \nworld, that the United States can pare down its military, and we do not \nhave to be the superpower that is ready in any eventuality. That is not \nthe case. I compliment Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for bringing \nthe parties together and forging a bill that does spend enough money to \nmake sure that we are going into the next century strong.\n\n  It is not as strong as I would like it to be. There are other \npriorities that I might like to see. I understand the concerns of some \nof the Senators who have spoken here, but the bottom line is, we are a \ndeliberative body and we have to give and take on priorities as long as \nwe meet the cap that we have put in the budget resolution, and that is \nexactly what we have done here.\n  So I compliment the two Senators who are the chairman and ranking \nmember of this very important committee.\n  I want to say especially that one of the concerns that I have that \nhas been met in this bill is something I hope we are going to talk \nabout in the next few days, and that is the sense of the Senate that is \na part of this bill which says that ``no funds available to the \nDepartment of Defense shall be obligated or expended for deployment or \nparticipation of United States Armed Forces in any peacekeeping \noperation in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless such deployment or \nparticipation is specifically \n\n[[Page S 17168]]\nauthorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of this act.''\n  Now, this excludes the kind of operations we have had this year--the \nair cover, the participation that we have had on the periphery. That is \nexcluded, but it does have a sense of the Senate that we will not spend \nfunds unless we specifically authorize those funds for that kind of \npeacekeeping operation.\n  This is just the beginning of the real debate that is going to come \non the floor of this Senate in the next few weeks about what the role \nof our armed services should be in Bosnia. I am going to argue very \nforcefully that it is not our role to send American troops on the \nground in Bosnia. We are starting that debate tonight when we pass this \nbill.\n  We are saying it is the sense of the Senate that we must be consulted \nand we must pass specific authorization and appropriations before we \nsend our troops in, and that that is for a number of reasons. It is \nbecause we have not staked out the United States security interest that \nwould require troops on the ground. It is because we have not staked \nout that this is going to be the death of NATO if American troops are \nnot on the ground. In fact, I think it is the opposite. I think it is \nimportant that we have the strength of NATO by saying exactly what our \nleadership role will be, and there are many things we can do that do \nnot include our troops on the ground.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I am just saying that the sense of the Senate will \nbe passed tonight. It is very important, and I hope the President of \nthe United States is listening to this debate. I hope he is listening \nto the importance to all of us that he come to Congress for enactment \nbefore he sends peacekeeping troops to Bosnia.\n  I thank the two leaders on this bill. I appreciate what they are \ndoing for this country, and I am going to support the bill \nwholeheartedly. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield back all the time on this side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, which I understand will take 10 minutes, and I apologize \nfor limiting the time, that the rollcall vote commence at 6:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. [Nunn], is \nunable to be with us this afternoon because of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, and he has requested that his statement be made a part of the \nRecord.\n  Before I submit the statement, I would like to read from his second \nparagraph, and I quote:\n\n       This is a good bill, Mr. President, and I believe the \n     Senate should support it and the President should sign it. \n     Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye have produced a conference \n     report which addresses our national security needs in a \n     fiscally responsible manner.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Inouye, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record):\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to start by commending the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for the all hard work I \nknow they have put in to bring this conference report before the \nsenate.\n  This is a good bill, Mr. President, and I believe the Senate should \nsupport it and the President should sign it. Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye have produced a conference report which addresses our \nnational security needs in a fiscally responsible manner. Anybody who \nhas known Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye as long as I have would \nexpect nothing less.\n  This conference report preserves funding for some of the \nadministration's top priorities, such as the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, the Technology Reinvestment Program known as TRP, \nand the third Seawolf submarine.\n  The House bill eliminated funding for the Seawolf and the TRP, and \ncut the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program almost in half, so this \nconference agreement preserve the Senate position on some key items of \ninterest to the administration. This bill also avoids legislative \nprovisions that try to dictate to the President when or how he can \ndeploy our military forces.\n  As I have stated on many occasions, I believe the defense budget has \nbeen cut too far, too fast. Our forces are simply much busier than I \nbelieve anyone really anticipated when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw \nPact were dissolving. Today our force structure is much smaller than it \nwas 5 years ago. We all agreed that based on the reductions in the \nthreat and the increased warning time for any kind of global conflict, \nthese reductions were prudent and necessary.\n  But the smaller force we have left is busier than it has ever been. \nThe fact is we simply cannot keep on reducing the defense budget the \nway we have been. The people are wearing out. The equipment is wearing \nout. So I think the budget resolution moved us in the right direction \nby providing for a small increase for defense over the next few years.\n  I do not think a lot of people realize how small that increase is. \nFirst of all, compared to the baseline concept that we use for \nentitlement programs, defense is not even getting an increase. The \namounts provided for defense in the budget resolution over the next 7 \nyears do not even come close to keeping the defense budget as large as \nit is today, after taking account of inflation. We would need to add at \nleast another $100 billion over the next few years to stay even \ncompared to a so-called current services baseline.\n  Compared to the administration's plan, the budget resolution \nincreases defense by only $19 billion over the next 7 years, which is \nequivalent to a 1-percent increase over the administration plan. That \nis the defense increase Congress has agreed to. Many of us felt the \nincrease should be larger, especially in the outyears from 2000 through \n2002, when defense is projected to be lower under the budget resolution \nthan under the administration's plan. I also recall very well that over \nthe past 5 or 6 years defense was the only part of the budget coming \ndown, so it seems that the principle that defense has to be cut if \nsomething else is being cut is not always applied consistently.\n  Most of the increases in this bill over the administration's plan are \nin the modernization accounts which are the key to future readiness. We \ncannot continue to stay in the deep procurement through we have been in \nfor the past few years indefinitely. We have cut procurement deeply to \ntake advantage of the shrinking force structure, but our military can't \nlive off its stock of old capital forever any more than any business \ncould.\n  I want to briefly discuss the one program that represents two tenths \nof 1 percent of the funding in this bill, but that seems to get more \ndiscussion than the other 99.8 percent of the programs in this \nconference report. Many people argue, and I am sure they truly believe, \nthat the B-2 bomber is unaffordable. In my view, Mr. President, the \nargument that the B-2 is unaffordable is No. 1, false, and No. 2, a \nfalse issue.\n  Over and over I have seen people focus on the price of the B-2 \nwithout ever hearing a word about the cost of the collection of systems \nyou would need to do the same job without the B-2. People tend to look \nat it as if the choice were buying the B-2 or doing nothing. They don't \nlook at the whole picture.\n  The only real argument I hear from the Defense Department against the \nB-2 is that they would like to have it but they don't want to give \nanything up to get it. But that is a false issue, because Congress has \nmade more funds available over the next few years specifically for \nprograms like the B-2. It is not necessary to slow down the \nmodernization of one part of our forces in order to modernize our \nbombers.\n  I am disappointed that this conference agreement does not fund the \nCorps SAM program at the requested level as in the Senate bill. The \nCorps SAM program represents just 1 percent of the funding for the \nballistic missile defense program, and I regret that this conference \nagreement did not contain full funding for this important program on \nwhich we have asked for allied cooperation.\n\n[[Page S 17169]]\n\n  While the modernization accounts always get the most attention, this \nconference agreement also seeks to protect current readiness by \npartially funding the cost of ongoing operations which were not \nincluded in the administration's budget. The conference agreement \nincludes $647 million to fund the fiscal year 1996 costs of our \ncontinuing missions in and around Iraq, operations Provide Comfort in \nNorthern Iraq and Southern Watch in Southern Iraq. This was one of the \nadministration's highest funding priorities, if not the highest. The \nconferees added nearly $1 billion to the requested level in the \nreadiness accounts--pesonnel and operation and maintenance--and much of \nit was to fund these ongoing operations.\n  In my view, it made no sense to add substantial funds to the defense \nbudget request without taking account of must-pay bills we know we are \ngoing to face either this fall or next spring.\n  By providing funding for these ongoing operations, Congress has not \nonly attempted to avoid a readiness problem in next year, but it may \nallow us to actually make some progress in one of reducing the backlog \nof maintenance and repair on our barracks and other facilities where \nour forces live and work. The bill adds $700 million to the request to \nthe reduce the maintenance backlog on barracks and other facilities. \nThis is not the first time Congress has added funding for real property \nmaintenance or depot maintenance.\n  But what usually happens, and what would most certainly happen this \nyear if we did not set aside funds to cover the cost of these ongoing \noperations, is that the increases we set aside for maintenance get \ndiverted to cover must pay bills. I hope that the approach the \nconferees have taken in this bill will allow us to avoid that trap.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. No bill is. But I think \nthis is a good bill, a bill that should be signed, and I once again \ncommend Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their \nleadership.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to this \nconference report. The conference agreement is a good compromise \nbetween the interests of the House and Senate. It is truly a bipartisan \neffort in the long tradition of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Chairman Stevens and I worked together with Chairman Bill Young and \nthe ranking member, Jack Murtha, of the House National Security \nSubcommittee in formulating the final conference agreement.\n  It has been a long journey, but the end result is a bill that \nwarrants the support of all my colleagues.\n  The conference agreement under consideration has three priorities: It \nprotects critical military readiness programs, it fully funds the needs \nof our men and women in uniform, and also provides a much-needed \nincrease for modernizing our forces.\n  In total, the conference agreement recommends $243.3 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense, an increase of $6.9 billion compared to the \nPresident's request.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out to my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, that this bill is consistent with the administration's \npolicy objectives. It does not legislate changes in the ABM Treaty or \nthe Missile Defense Act. It contains no limitation on the President in \nhis conduct of foreign affairs.\n  One of the most contentious issues to be resolved by the conferees \nwas abortion. On September 29, the House voted against the first \nconference agreement because of abortion language.\n  For the past 6 weeks we have worked hard to reach a compromise which \ncan pass both Houses. The conferees agreed last night to incorporate \nlanguage mirrored on that which both the House and Senate passed \nyesterday on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill.\n  The language would allow for abortions to be performed in military \nhospitals when the life of the woman was endangered or in the case of \nrape and incest.\n  Most of my colleagues will remember that both the chairman and I have \nvoted against this policy many times over the past two and a half \ndecades. We are recommending it now because it reflects the policy \nalready agreed to by both bodies.\n  The bill before you provides $81.5 billion for operation and \nmaintenance to protect the readiness of our forces. This amount is $700 \nmillion more than requested by the President. It supports the military \npersonnel levels requested by the President; it funds a 2.4 percent pay \nraise for our military personnel and increases their basic allowances \nsubstantially--all consistent with Senate recommendations.\n  The bill also raises procurement spending by nearly $6 billion, up to \n$44 billion.\n  To those who suggest that the bill provides too much for \nmodernization I would note that, even with these increases, we are \nstill spending less than half of the amount the Senate recommended for \nprocurement 10 years ago.\n  Throughout this year, Chairman Stevens and I asked each of the \nmilitary Chiefs of Staff to meet with the Defense Subcommittee to \nreview the needs of their respective services. The recommendations for \nprocurement spending match these requirements very closely.\n  Let me also point out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff are reportedly \nseeking an increase of an additional $60 billion for procurement in \nfuture budgets. That amount is $16 billion higher than we recommend in \nthis bill. I think my colleagues should realize that recommendations on \nprocurement in this bill are the minimum that must be provided.\n  Mr. President, there have been reports that the White House might \nveto this bill. I hope that this is not correct.\n  The conferees have gone a long way to resolving the objections that \nwere raised by the President when the bills passed their respective \nHouses. The policy statements on Bosnia, and abortion have been \neliminated. Funding eliminated by the House for technology \nreinvestment, for cooperative threat reduction, and the Seawolf \nsubmarine have been restored as requested by the President. The \nconferees have reduced funds from the House-passed level for missile \ndefense. In each case these recommendations are consistent with White \nHouse wishes.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is essential that we invest in the \nreadiness, quality of life, and modernization programs funded by this \nbill. I am in full support of this legislation. It is a good, fair, and \nvery important bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I just wish to spend 9 minutes commenting on \nstatements made by my colleagues in this debate.\n  One of my illustrious colleagues stated that he sees no threat on the \nhorizon; why are we spending all of this money, which reminded me of \nthe early days of a war that was fought 50 years ago.\n  Five days ago, we gathered to commemorate the end, the victorious end \nof this war, but I also recall those years just before December 7. I \nwas young enough to remember that, Mr. President. A year before \nDecember 7, because Members of the Congress did not see the threat \nwhich many of us thought was just obvious, we nearly defeated the \nSelective Service law. It passed by one vote. At the moment of its \npassage, our merchant vessels were being sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by \nGerman submarines, the Germans were rampaging all over Europe, London \nwas being bombed, the Japanese were rampaging all over China, Nanking \nwas being raped, Peking was falling and we saw no threat. And December \n7 came as a brutal surprise to many of us. Not to me, Mr. President, \nand thank God for that one vote, we had the draft.\n  Two years before December 7, the very famous general from Virginia, \nGeneral Patton, reported for duty at Fort Benning in Georgia. He was \ntold to organize an armored division. When he got there, he saw 375 \ntanks. At least they looked like tanks. The only trouble is that over \nhalf of them would not roll. They were not operational.\n  This may sound facetious, but it is not. He called up the War \nDepartment and said, ``I need some money because these tanks need \nparts, otherwise they won't move.'' And the War Department said, \n``Sorry, sir, we have no money.''\n  Fortunately, General Patton was one of the wealthiest men in the \nUnited States at that time. He took his checkbook, went to Sears, \nRoebuck in Atlanta, GA, and bought parts, and that is how we developed \nthe 1st Armored Division in the United States. Thank God somebody had a \ncheckbook.\n  One of my colleagues also said that some of these activities that we \nhave \n\n[[Page S 17170]]\nfunded in this bill were not authorized, were not requested by the \nPresident, were not requested by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the freedom to criticize, the freedom to disagree, the \nfreedom to discuss, to debate and make decisions are very important in \nthis democracy. This is not a dictatorship. The President does not tell \nus I want that ship and nothing else.\n  I want to review history, recent history.\n  We have been told that the most important weapon system in Desert \nStorm was the F-117, the Stealth fighter bomber, and if it were not for \nthat, we would have lost lives, many lives, because this Stealth bomber \nwas the one that was able to knock out all of the radar stations, which \nmade it possible for our fighter planes and bombers to go in. It might \ninterest you to know, and I think we should remind ourselves, that the \nadministration and the Pentagon opposed building the F-117. This \nCongress persisted. I am certain the chairman of the committee \nremembers that.\n  Let us take another weapon system that was most important in Desert \nStorm, the Patriot. If it were not for the Patriots, the casualties on \nour side would have been at least double. The Patriots were able to \nknock out the Scuds. Thank God we had the Patriot. The administration \nopposed it, the Pentagon opposed it, but we in the Congress and in this \ncommittee insisted upon it.\n  In 1978, the President of the United States vetoed a defense \nappropriations bill that carried the Nimitz-class nuclear carrier. It \nis the most powerful weapon system we have today. Thank God the \nCongress persisted, and we overrode that veto.\n  There is another aircraft that my colleague from Alaska is the most \nknowledgeable expert on, the V-22 Osprey. The Pentagon did not want it. \nThe White House did not want it. This committee insisted upon it. Now \neveryone wants it.\n  So, Mr. President, much as we would like to suggest that we are the \nrepository of all wisdom, it is not so. The democracy that we cherish \nhere is made up of many minds, and the wisdom from all of these many \nminds, hopefully, will reach the right decision. And we would like to \nbelieve, Mr. President, that the decision we present to you today is \nthe right decision. I cannot tell you, in all honesty, that there is no \npork in this bill. But those who advocate and those who have fought and \nsupported these provisions in their belief that it is essential to our \ndemocracy. And, also, I am certain all of us agree that when one enters \ninto a conference, you cannot hope to get everything you want. You can \nget some of it. You will have to give in to some.\n\n  This is the compromise that we have reached. It was not easy, Mr. \nPresident. But I think we have done a job that we can stand before our \ncolleagues and say that we have done our best, and we are presenting \nour best to the Senate of the United States. I notice that my time is \nup.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:25 having arrived, under the \nprevious order, the yeas and nays having been ordered, the question is \non agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have voted today for the Defense \nAppropriations Conference Report because I believe it is fundamentally \na sound and necessary bill which will fund critical defense functions \nfor the current fiscal year. This bill is not perfect. It funds \nprocurement of a few weapons systems which the Secretary of Defense and \nthe military service chiefs have said they do not need or want; I would \nhave preferred that such systems not be funded. But on balance I \nbelieve the right programs are funded, critical modernization for our \narmed forces will take place, and critical skills of defense workers \nacross the country, including in my State of Connecticut, will be \nmaintained. At the same time, I am very troubled that this \nappropriations conference report includes language that prohibits \nabortions in military facilities. My record of opposition to language \nthat creates unfair barriers to legal abortion services is clear. I see \nno reason why this restrictive provision needed to be included on a \ndefense appropriation bill and I oppose it. No one should misconstrue \nmy vote today for this important appropriations bill--a bill which is \neven more critical as many defense workers have been furloughed along \nwith thousands of other Federal employees caught up in our current \nbudget crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17148-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17170-S17178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It \nis also my personal view, and the view of most of our colleagues, that \nthe best way to do that, of course, is to send a clean resolution to \nthe President. I offered the point of order in the hope that we could \nstrip away the extraneous matters and get back to what we tried to do \nthis morning, which was to offer a clean continuing resolution. \n\n[[Page S 17171]]\n\n  It appears, however, that that would entail a good deal of \nparliamentary discussion and negotiation and procedure that, in my \nview, would be counterproductive, frankly, because it would take us at \nleast through another day.\n  It was not my intent to surprise the majority leader. I thought we \nhad an understanding about the point of order, and there was some \nmisunderstanding. For that reason, as well, I think it is propitious at \nthis point to pick up where we left off prior to the time the point of \norder was offered.\n  So I have discussed the matter with the majority leader, and I am \nprepared to offer our second amendment, as we had agreed to do earlier \ntoday. This would expedite our consideration of the continuing \nresolution and will allow us to get the bill down to the President, \nallow us to continue the negotiations in good faith, and to find, at an \nearlier date rather than a later date, some resolution.\n  I have no doubt that if this bill goes to the White House, the \nPresident will be required to veto this one, as well. So we will be \nback to where we were prior to the time we offered this.\n  So I am looking for, and the majority leader is looking for, a way in \nwhich to find some resolution. It is in that good-faith effort that I \nhave asked for the unanimous consent.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3057\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3057.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       Section 106(c) of Public Law 104-31 is amended by striking \n     ``November 13, 1995'' and inserting ``December 22, 1995''.\n       Section 2. (a) The President and the Congress shall enact \n     legislation in the 104th Congress to achieve a unified \n     balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) The unified balanced budget in subsection (a) must \n     assure that:\n       (1) Medicare and Medicaid are not cut to pay for tax \n     breaks; and\n       (2) any possible tax cuts shall go only to American \n     families making less than $100,000.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will take a minute to thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. We had a miscommunication, and I will let it go at \nthat. We have to work together. We do not surprise each other. I think \nwe are on the right track.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from South Dakota would agree \nto 40 minutes equally divided, or more?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, 40 minutes, I think, is adequate time to consider \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Prior to a vote or a motion to table in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, there will be no second degree \namendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. I ask unanimous consent that what was just stated be \nthe order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding, also, that following disposition of \nthis amendment, maybe after some debate, we will go to final passage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my understanding, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment starts where the last \namendment left off. It simply says that we ought to have a resolution \nthat takes us at least through the month of December, setting as a \ntarget date December 22. That is what the earlier amendment did. This \namendment would accomplish the same thing.\n  Second, it uses the same level of spending for all of those agencies \nof Government affected as the previous continuing resolution--the same, \nagain, as the amendment we proposed this morning.\n  So in an effort to accommodate what I hoped would be a very serious \nnegotiation on reconciliation, we would offer this continuing \nresolution, with the expectation that we could avoid facing another \ncrisis for at least for another 4 weeks. So we start with an \nappreciation that it is going to take longer than a couple of weeks to \nresolve all of the outstanding differences that we have with respect to \nreconciliation. If that is the case, rather than revisiting the issue, \nlet us be serious about a continuing resolution. Let us move this date \nto a point that is practical, that is prudent, that accepts the fact \nthat we may not be able to finish our work prior to that time.\n  Second, Mr. President, it simply says if we are going to insist in \nthis resolution that there be a 7-year budget, that we use the 7-year \nbudget timeframe within which to resolve all the other differences, \npriorities, and circumstances that we have, and then let us do a couple \nof other things. Let us also, since we are setting some parameters \nhere, decide that we are not going to use the Medicare trust fund as a \npool from which to draw resources to pay for a tax cut. Let us not do \nthat. And let us not use this process, this particular piece of \nlegislation, to exacerbate income distribution even more than it is.\n  In other words, let us not build upon what is already happening in \nthis country, where more and more of the wealth is being shifted to the \nupper-income levels. And to avoid that, let us assume that there will \nbe a tax break; or let us just say if there is a tax break, the \nresources we will spend for those tax breaks will all go to those \nmaking under $100,000 a year--that is, no tax breaks for those making \nmore than $100,000 a year.\n  So, Mr. President, that is really what this amendment does. First, it \nallows us to do our work through December 22. Second, it sets funding \nlevels where they have been in the past continuing resolution. Third, \nit says if we are going to have a 7-year budget resolution, let us at \nleast recognize that that is a constraint that might warrant a couple \nof other constraints--the first being the protection of Medicare from \ncuts to finance tax breaks. We have had votes on it in the past. I \nthink this Senate has been on record now on a number of occasions that \nit is not right, that it is not acceptable, that it is not something \nthat even some Republicans have indicated they can support--to block \nthe use of Medicare resources for purposes of a tax cut--under any \ncircumstances.\n  I, frankly, think that is one of the most challenging of all the \nthings that we are going to be facing as we sit down to negotiate a \nfinal reconciliation package. How do you pay for the tax cut? I know we \nare told by CBO that there is going to be roughly a $170 billion \ndividend. Frankly, I am amazed that we can project a dividend 7 years \nout without really knowing whether there is going to be a recession or \nwhat kind of economic growth there is going to be.\n  We are going to have less economic growth, I remind my colleagues, \nusing CBO growth projections at 2.3 percent than we have had in the \nlast 25 years. In the last 25 years, we are told that the growth, on \nthe average, was 2.5 percent. So what CBO is telling us is that we are \ngoing to have a balanced budget at the end of 7 years, but the growth \nis only going to be 2.3 percent, two-tenths of a percent less than what \nwe have had historically. That seems inconsistent to me, and it is hard \nto understand how one generates dividends from that. But let us assume \nthere is a dividend of some $170 billion. The tax cut is over $220 \nbillion. It may even be $245 billion, if our House colleagues have \ntheir way.\n  So the question is: Where does the additional amount of revenue come \nfrom? We all know that this is all pretty flexible here. We all know \nthat, in the meantime, before the dividend is realized, that revenue \nhas to come from somewhere because the tax cuts start immediately. \nWell, the tax cut revenue is going to come from pools of resources \nalready in the budget. And the only pools of resources available are \nMedicare and Medicaid, to the degree we need large revenue sources to \npay for the tax cut.\n  Mr. President, that has been our concern from the very beginning, a \nvery legitimate concern about paying for tax cuts from revenue that is \nalready \n\n[[Page S 17172]]\ndedicated to virtually the most important function, in my view, \nvirtually in the entire budget. The health care of senior citizens, the \nhealth care of those who are unemployed, insured only by Medicaid, the \nhealth care of those who are going to nursing homes--that is what we \nare talking about, providing a safety net, some security, to those \npeople who have counted on it now for 30 years.\n  Mr. President, that is a fundamental question that in our view ought \nto be addressed. If we are going to set out 7 years as a precondition, \nit is our view we also ought to set out preconditions about where \nMedicare and Medicaid resources go.\n  We recognize the need to bring about trust fund solvency. We are not \ntalking about solvency here. We are talking about $270 billion in cuts, \n$181 billion more than what the trustees tell us we need for solvency. \nFor what reason? Unfortunately, it is our view, it is to provide the \ntax cuts that, in our view, simply are not necessary in many cases.\n  That is the first stipulation.\n  The second stipulation is that if we are going to have those tax \ncuts, at least ensure they go to those who have the greatest need. Make \nsure it is working families whose incomes are already stretched with \ncollege and a whole range of difficulties. Make sure they are the ones \nwho are held harmless in all of the cuts and to make sure, to the \nextent we can, that if we have tax cuts, they go to those working \nfamilies who need it the most.\n  I really do not know that somebody making $2 million or $3 million or \n$4 million needs a tax cut, regardless of the circumstances. I do not \nthink somebody with our income level, regardless of what it may be now \nunder this difficulty we are facing, needs a tax cut.\n  We do not need a tax cut. And certainly no one making more than \n$1,000,000 a year needs a tax cut--not if we are really serious about \nbalancing the budget, not if we are really serious about bringing down \nnot only the deficit but the debt.\n  I have always been curious, and I have never had one of my \nconservative friends respond to this, are they not as concerned about \nthe aggregate debt as they are about the deficit? The aggregate \ndeficits total $6 trillion.\n  So even if we reach a balanced budget, we still have $6 trillion of \nindebtedness out there--$6 trillion. I have not heard one of my \nRepublican colleagues give me any indication as to what they think \nought to be done with that.\n  How are we going to buy down that debt? Are we going to be content to \nleave it out there to continue to pay the interest on it? It seems to \nme before we start talking about tax breaks not only should we dedicate \nour efforts to reducing the deficit but we should dedicate our efforts \nto reducing the debt as well.\n  I know my colleague from Massachusetts is here. How much time \nremains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I inquire of Senator Daschle if he would possibly yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It seems to me, and I ask whether the Senator would \nagree with me, that the President of the United States, when the \ninitial continuing resolution was sent down there, it had the increase \nof the premium--some $52 billion.\n  At that time, he vetoed it and our Republican friends said, all \nright, we will not put in that increase for the premiums. All we are \ninterested in is a balanced budget.\n  Now we have the real intention of our Republican friends, because I \ndo not know whether the minority leader has had a chance to examine the \nreconciliation that will be up here on the floor tomorrow which right \nhere on title VIII has all of the premium increases that would have \nbeen increased on the continuing resolution, they went through it and \nsaid all they were interested in was a balanced budget.\n\n  Here we have--tomorrow we will be addressing these issues. Is the \nSenator familiar that all of those increases in Medicare are going to \nbe part of their program?\n  The point I am just making is all day long and just recently this \nevening we heard about the willingness of Mr. Gingrich and our \nRepublican leader who wanted to get a balanced budget.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have the $270 billion Medicare cuts, the $52 \nbillion in additional premiums which will result in $2,500 additional \npremiums, the Medicaid cuts of $180 billion, the student loan cuts of \n$4.9 billion, and the raid on the pensions which we passed here, 94 to \n5--$20 billion raid on worker pensions.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that this argument that is being made \nhere that we have to pass this this evening and all we are interested \nin is trying to get the President to sign this so we can have a \nbalanced budget, we are glad to work the priorities out with the \nPresident, that is rather a hollow statement and comment given the fact \nthat our Republican friends have worked this out in a closed session \nwith effectively only Republicans participating, and they are doing \njust what we warned they would do in terms of cutting the Medicare $270 \nbillion and tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals at $240 billion? \nDoes the Senator agree with me that has some inconsistency in terms of \nwhat this issue is really all about?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts makes a very, very good \npoint. This is just the beginning.\n  The real debate will begin perhaps as early as tomorrow when we get \nthe reconciliation package. As the Senator noted, none of us have had \nthe opportunity to see this package yet. It will be on the floor in the \nnext 48 hours at some point.\n  We know, given what the House did and what the Senate did, there are \nhuge cuts--three times more cuts than we have ever seen before, for \nMedicare, cuts that go deeply into the program, that go way beyond \ntrust fund solvency, cuts that will be used to create the pool of \nresources, to create the tax cuts that the Republican majority \ncontinues to want to defend.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Even if the President signed this resolution tomorrow, \nthese Medicare cuts of $270 billion would still be up here on the floor \nof the Senate--our senior citizens ought to know it--and there is every \nindication that the votes are there to pass it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is right. We may have taken it out of the \nlast continuing resolution. It was dropped from the CR, but it is in \nthe budget reconciliation bill. It is in the permanent legislation. It \nis in the language that we are going to be voting and debating \nbeginning tomorrow, in all of its detail, spelling out exactly how \ndeeply they are going to cut into the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nWe will see it tomorrow.\n  We know it is there tonight. We know that there is a huge cut in \nMedicare. We know that is the pool of resources from which they will \npay for the tax cut. That much we know. All the other details we still \ndo not know.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, because I see my friend and colleague, this is \none Senator who finds this whole exercise of Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole \nto be rather a hollow one. This idea that all you have to do is \nindicate to us that we are headed for a balanced budget goal and we are \nquite ready to sit down with you and work out the priorities. I do not \nknow how many times I have heard that on the radio and heard it last \nnight. All the while, the priorities are going to be voted on by this \nbody under a very strict time agreement, which will be $270 billion \ncuts in the Medicare Program.\n  I think our senior citizens ought to understand who is standing up \nfor them in this debate. It has been the President. It has been the \nminority leader. It is the Senator from Nebraska, and I am proud to be \nsupporting their efforts.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his comments. I yield to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I want to ask a question, too, of our Democratic leader.\n  First, we have been hearing on television and here on the floor that \nthe Democrats do not want to balance the budget in 7 years.\n  I have looked--and I do not think we have emphasized that the very \nfirst part of the amendment you have offered says the President and the \nCongress shall enact legislation in the \n\n[[Page S 17173]]\n104th Congress to achieve a unified balance of the budget no later than \nfiscal year 2002.\n  As I understand and interpret that--but I want to hear it from the \nlips of my leader--here is a case where we are proposing to balance a \nbudget by the year 2002; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  There is a way to balance the budget by the year 2002. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska has voted for it. The Senator from South Dakota has voted \nfor it. Many of our colleagues have voted for it.\n  If you do not have a tax cut, if you use reasonable economic \nprojections about what will happen in the next 7 years, there is a real \npossibility that you could achieve a meaningful balanced budget in \nperhaps even less than 7 years.\n  But it is the Republican insistence on a tax cut, it is the \nRepublican insistence on economic growth projections that go way below \nwhat we have experienced historically, for at least the last 25 years, \nthat make many of us very skeptical about whether it is achievable in 7 \nyears.\n  Mr. EXON. Then the Republican charge that I have heard over and over \nand over again, that the Democrats simply do not want to balance the \nbudget in 7 years, is blown pretty much sky high with the amendment \nthat you have offered on behalf of the minority?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. This \nmakes it very clear that it is not our desire to oppose a 7-year \nbalanced budget amendment necessarily. What I said this morning holds \nthis evening. It is our desire to ensure that we have to have some \nbetter understanding of what we are talking about here.\n  We will support a 7-year budget resolution if we know that Medicare \nis not going to be used to pay for tax cuts; if we know that any tax \ncuts incorporated into the legislation will be targeted to those making \nless than $100,000 per year. Those kinds of things are fundamental to \nour enthusiasm, our level of support for whatever else may have come \nfrom the negotiations during reconciliation.\n  Mr. EXON. If I understand the amendment, then, offered by the \nDemocratic leader, that we just talked about, it provides for balancing \nthe budget by the year 2002; and then second and equally important it \nsays that, if we have a tax cut, that tax cut would be limited to only \nAmerican families making less than $100,000 a year? So if you made over \n$100,000 a year you would not get any tax cut, if we have one. If we do \nhave a tax cut all of it goes to those making $100,000 or less, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have just heard a preposterous \nargument. The Republicans are saying to the President of the United \nStates: Mr. President, we have been working since the beginning of this \nyear to develop a balanced budget that is real, that the true \nauthenticator of economics, the reliable group that the President told \nus to work with, says is in balance in the year 2002.\n  The President does not like our priorities. He does not like to give \ntax cuts, apparently. And perhaps the Democrats do not want to give any \ntax cuts. So, we are suggesting that here is a compromise. You do what \nyou want, but we are going to vote on what we want. And we will go to \nconference with you, Mr. President.\n  You are not bound to anything. If you do not want any taxes you go to \nthe table and say we do not want any. If you do not want to reduce \nMedicare savings, you go to the table and say you do not want to. If \nyou want to bring the CPI to the table, you bring it to the table. \nWhatever it is. We are only asking for a commitment that, in 7 years, \nyou will have a balanced budget using conservative economics. So that \nwe will not be burned again, and think we got a balanced budget only to \nfind that we got a lot of it as a gift from economic assumptions that \nwere too high.\n  For, as the distinguished occupant of the chair has said, if the \nOffice of Management and Budget, which makes it easier to balance the \nbudget because you do not have to cut so much if you have these \nexciting high economic assumptions--if they happen to be wrong, you \nnever get a balanced budget. That is not the case if we use the \neconomics we propose. If we happen to be wrong you get a surplus. And \nwhat would be wrong with that?\n\n  That is one argument. But let me repeat it just slightly--just a \ndifferent way. We have been hearing from the other side: Do not tell \nthe President what to do. We have been trying to say we are not trying \nto tell him what to do. All we want is a commitment to a balanced \nbudget in 7 years, using real economics. That is all we want. The \npriorities are up to you. But we have our priorities. We want a vote on \nthem and we want to send them to the American people and send them to \nyou and you veto them. And all we are saying is, this Congress, with \nthe President who is now in the White House, we get together and our \nonly commitment is to produce a balanced budget in 7 years using real \neconomics. There is no other commitment.\n  The Democrats tonight are saying wait a minute. We would like to tell \nyou what is going to be in that budget in advance, when they have not \nhad to vote on anything. They have not produced a balanced budget. They \nhave not told us what they would restrain and what they would not \nrestrain--I take it back. Mr. President, 19 have; 19 Democrats put a \nbudget before us.\n  Incidentally, they used the same economics we used and they got a \nbalanced budget. They did not want to cut taxes so they did not cut \ntaxes. But they produced one. What is the discussion about? Now they \nwant to tell us how to run that budget when they have not voted on \nanything. They have not voted on what to do in Medicare and Medicaid \nand taxes. And they would like, now, to tell us: Wait a minute, we \nwould like to tell you in advance what we cannot do.\n  All we are suggesting is, Mr. President, sit down with us, and your \nteam and some Democrats, and just use one benchmark. Do you want a \nbalanced budget in 7 years using real economics? No other test. That is \nthe only issue.\n  Now, Mr. President, because the issue has been raised about Medicare, \nMedicaid and taxes, we must speak to them. So let me refresh \neverybody's recollection.\n  The Washington Post today lends real credence to why we should vote \nthis particular amendment down and why the people of this country ought \nto listen to the rhetoric of the last 15 minutes and be very suspicious \nof what it is really about. This editorial today, by the Washington \nPost, called ``The Real Default'' addresses the demagoguery of the \nPresident of the United States and the leading Democrats, who choose to \nmake the case to the senior citizens for them not to worry. We do not \nhave to change anything in Medicare. Everything is rosy. And this calls \nit what it is.\n  It will destroy any opportunity to get a balanced budget. It will put \nus in a position where we are living year by year to see whether the \nsenior citizens have a program of health care. Once again, at this \npoint in my debate, I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial \nprinted in the Record. I will merely read one part of it.\n\n       We've said some of this before; it gets more serious. If \n     the Democrats play the Medicare card and win, they will have \n     set back for years, for the worst of political reasons, the \n     very cause of rational government in behalf of which they \n     profess to be behaving.\n\n  Meaning there will be no chance to fix the budget of the United \nStates.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n                            The Real Default\n\n       The budget deficit is the central problem of the federal \n     government and one from which many of the country's other, \n     most difficult problems flow. The deficit is largely driven \n     in turn by the cost of the great entitlements that go not to \n     small special classes of  rich  or  poor  but  across  the \n     board to almost all Americans in time. The most important of \n     these are the principal social insurance programs for the \n     elderly, Social Security and Medicare. In fiscal terms, \n     Medicare is currently the greatest threat and chief offender.\n       Bill Clinton and the congressional Democrats were handed an \n     unusual chance this year to deal constructively with the \n     effect of Medicare on the deficit, and they blew it. The \n     chance came in the form of the congressional Republican plan \n     to balance the budget \n\n[[Page S 17174]]\n     over seven years. Some other aspects of that plan deserved to be \n     resisted, but the Republican proposal to get at the deficit \n     partly by confronting the cost of Medicare deserved support. \n     The Democrats, led by the president, chose instead to present \n     themselves as Medicare's great protectors. They have \n     shamelessly used the issue, demagogued on it, because they \n     think that's where the votes are and the way to derail the \n     Republican proposals generally. The president was still doing \n     it this week; a Republican proposal to increase Medicare \n     premiums was one of the reasons he alleged for the veto that \n     has shut down the government--and never mind that he himself, \n     in his own budget, would countenance a similar increase.\n       We've said some of this before; it gets more serious. If \n     the Democrats play the Medicare card and win, they will have \n     set back for years, for the worst of political reasons, the \n     very cause of rational government in behalf of which they \n     profess to being behaving. Politically, they will have helped \n     to lock in place the enormous financial pressure that they \n     themselves are first to deplore on so many other federal \n     programs, not least the programs for the poor. That's the \n     real default that could occur this year. In the end, the \n     Treasury will meet its financial obligations. You can be \n     pretty sure of that. The question is whether the president \n     and the Democrats will meet or flee their obligations of a \n     different kind. On the strength of the record so far, you'd \n     have to bet on flight.\n       You'll hear the argument from some that this is a phony \n     issue; they content that the deficit isn't that great a \n     problem. The people who make this argument are whistling past \n     a graveyard that they themselves most likely helped to dig. \n     The national debt in 1980 was less than $1 trillion. That was \n     the sum of all the deficits the government had previously \n     incurred--the whole two centuries' worth. The debt now, a \n     fun-filled 15 years later, is five times that and rising at a \n     rate approaching $1 trillion a presidential term. Interest \n     costs are a seventh of the budget, by themselves now a \n     quarter of a trillion dollars a year and rising; we are \n     paying not just for the government we have but for the \n     government we had and didn't pay for earlier.\n       The blamesters, or some of them, will tell you Ronald \n     Reagan did it, and his low-tax, credit-card philosophy of \n     government surely played its part. The Democratic Congresses \n     that ratified his budgets and often went him one better on \n     tax cuts and spending increases played their parts as well. \n     Various sections of the budget are also favorite punching \n     bags, depending who is doing the punching. You will hear it \n     said that someone's taxes ought to be higher (generally \n     someone else's), or that defense should be cut, or \n     welfare, or farm price supports or the cost of the \n     bureaucracy. But even Draconian cuts in any or all of \n     these areas would be insufficient to the problem and, \n     because dwelling on them is a way of pretending the real \n     deficit-generating costs don't exist, beside the point as \n     well.\n       What you don't hear said in all this talk of which programs \n     should take the hit, since the subject is so much harder \n     politically to confront, is that the principal business of \n     the federal government has become elder-care. Aid to the \n     elderly, principally through Social Security and Medicare, is \n     now a third of all spending and half of all for other than \n     interest on the debt and defense. That aid is one of the \n     major social accomplishments of the past 30 years; the \n     poverty rate for the elderly is now, famously, well below the \n     rate for the society as a society as a whole. It is also an \n     enormous and perhaps unsustainable cost that can only become \n     more so as the baby-boomers shortly begin to retire. How does \n     the society deal with it?\n       The Republicans stepped up to this as part of their \n     proposal to balance the budget. About a fourth of their \n     spending cuts would come from Medicare. It took guts to \n     propose that. You may remember the time, not that many months \n     ago, when the village wisdom was that, whatever else they \n     proposed, they'd never take on Medicare this way. There were \n     too many votes at stake. We don't mean to suggest by this \n     that their proposal with regard to Medicare is perfect--it \n     most emphatically is not, as we ourselves have said as much \n     at some length in this space. So they ought to be argued \n     with, and ways should be found to take the good of their \n     ideas while rejecting the bad.\n       But that's not what the president and congressional \n     Democrats have done. They've trashed the whole proposal as \n     destructive, taken to the air waves with a slick scare \n     program about it, championing themselves as noble defenders \n     of those about to be victimized. They--the Republicans--want \n     to take away your Medicare; that's the insistent PR message \n     that Democrats have been drumming into the elderly and the \n     children of the elderly all year. The Democrats used to \n     complain that the Republicans used wedge issues; this is the \n     super wedge. And it's wrong. In the long run, if it succeeds, \n     the tactic will make it harder to achieve not just the right \n     fiscal result but the right social result. The lesson to \n     future politicians will be that you reach out to restructure \n     Medicare at your peril. The result will be to crowd out of \n     the budget other programs for less popular or powerful \n     constituencies--we have in mind the poor--that the Democrats \n     claim they are committed to protect.\n       There's a way to get the deficit down without doing \n     enormous social harm. It isn't rocket science. You spread the \n     burden as widely as possible. Among much else, that means \n     including the broad and, in some respects, inflated middle-\n     class entitlements in the cuts. That's the direction in which \n     the president ought to be leading and the congressional \n     Democrats following. To do otherwise is to hide, to lull the \n     public and to perpetuate the budget problem they profess to \n     be trying to solve. Let us say it again: If that's what \n     happens, it will be the real default.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Having said that, let me make sure those who are \nlistening tonight do not misunderstand a couple of things.\n  If you want to know what is in our budget it should not come as a \nsurprise to you. It has been sitting on your desk most of the day. So, \ntomorrow when we vote, here it is, the Congressional Budget Act. If not \nall day, it is here now. If you are interested there it is. I will tell \nyou what is in it.\n  Medicare is not cut. Medicare will grow 7.7 percent a year for the \nnext 7 years; 7.7 percent.\n  Medicaid will grow at the rate of 5.5 percent a year. Medicaid will \ngrow 42 percent. Would anybody have guessed that from what we are \nhearing here on the floor of the Senate?\n  Inflation is at about 2.5 percent. Medicare is going to grow at 7.7 \npercent. In fact, Medicare spending will go from $178 billion to $294 \nbillion. Medicaid spending, that is the program for the poor, from $89 \nbillion to $127 billion. I do not think either of those, to any \nAmericans listening, are cuts. They are substantial increases and they \nwill suffice and they will have a very valid program for the seniors \nand the poor people in health care. We will do it more efficiently with \nmore choice.\n  Having said that, let us talk a minute about preserving the Medicare \ntrust fund. Mr. President, when the seniors and the other side reads \nthis budget, this Balanced Budget Act of 1995, they are going to find \nsomething very, very interesting and very exciting for senior citizens.\n  We made a conscious decision that we wanted to make the trust fund \nsolvent, not for 5 years, or 7 years, but for 15 to 17 years. And you \nwill read in this that every single penny that is saved in Medicare, \nnot just the hospital trust fund savings, every single penny goes into \nthe trust fund to save the health care program for the senior citizens.\n  So how can we put it in the trust fund and spend it on tax cuts at \nthe same time? Every penny of it is in the trust fund. Somebody might \nget up and say, ``Are you serious, Senator Domenici?'' We have never \ndone that before. We have never put savings from the general tax fund, \nwhich is what pays for part of this, we have never put it in that trust \nfund. We decided we would because we want to make it solvent for a long \nenough period of time for us to work on it, not just until the next \nelection, but for 15 to 17 years. You cannot put it in the trust fund \nfor the seniors and spend it for taxes also.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, having said that, let me suggest that we \nfirmly believe in an annual increase in Medicaid, the program for the \npoor, of 5.5 percent. If you add to it some flexibility in the delivery \nof it, it will be an excellent program covering more poor people than \nare covered today because you will have the flexibility of managed care \nand other delivery systems, which everyone knows are more efficient.\n  If that is the case and when we are finished with all our budget work \nwe have an economic dividend, that is, a surplus, what would the \nDemocrats have us do with it? I assume, from hearing here on the floor, \nthat they would have us spend it. For I can draw no other conclusions. \nThey would have us spend it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just finish this thought. I would submit that, \nif you balance the budget and if you had been fair by the seniors by \nputting every single savings in the trust fund so their fund is \nsolvent, if you are giving the poor of America a 5.5-percent increase \nevery year for Medicaid and there is a dividend left over of a surplus, \nI submit that you have an exact case of Republicans versus Democrats.\n  For what would they do with it? They would spend it. They would say, \nput it back in the budget and spend it on this, that, or the other. \nWhat do we say? Very simple. We say give it back to the taxpayer. And, \nas a matter of fact, the old tired, wornout argument that they are \ngiving it back to the rich \n\n[[Page S 17175]]\ninstead of the middle-class, middle-income Americans, is not true. Just \nfind the section on taxes and read it. Some $141 billion of those tax \ncuts go as tax credits to the American families with children, and no \none over $100,000 of earnings gets one penny.\n  What is wrong with that? You speak of being profamily, which is \nrhetoric; but you give them back tax dollars to spend, and you are \nhelping them with their family. The only thing conceivably that is for \nthe rich under their rubric is capital gains, which goes to everyone. \nAnd that merely says we want you to invest more in America so you can \nmake it grow and have a better economic life for the future.\n  I will be pleased to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Did I hear the Senator correctly say that the growth of \nMedicare would be 7.7 percent per year?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Does the Senator recall that under the health care \nproposal offered by George Mitchell last year the growth rate on \nMedicare was held to 7.1 percent per year?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe that is right. It was 7.1 or 7.2.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the Senator's memory that Senator Kennedy endorsed \nthe 7.1 percent of the President's health care program?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My recollection is that he was wholeheartedly in favor \nof that program.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the Senator's memory that Senator Daschle endorsed \nthe 7.1 percent of Senator Mitchell's proposal?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My recollection is that he wholeheartedly supported it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the Senator's recollection that the majority of \nthe Democratic Members of the Senate endorsed the 7.1 percent growth \nrate in Medicare?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe that is the case.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Does the Senator not agree with the Senator from Utah in \nfinding it interesting that since we proposed to allow Medicare to grow \nmore rapidly than the President did, more rapidly than the bill \nendorsed by a majority of the Members of the Democratic Party in the \nSenate, that we are now being pilloried as those who would slash \nMedicare?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe that is an understatement.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Perhaps we should choose the 7.1 percent level that they \nendorsed in the previous Congress when they controlled it and thereby \nslash Medicare a little more.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe we would get their support.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am not that optimistic.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to read one further sentence out \nof the Washington Post's analysis of the President's position on this.\n\n       Medicare premiums was one of the reasons he alleged for the \n     veto that has shut down the government--and never mind that \n     he himself, in his own budget, would countenance a similar \n     increase.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I voted earlier today for a clean \ncontinuing resolution, which simply extended current funding for a \ncouple of weeks, to open up the Government and allow for budget \nnegotiations to move forward. A simple, clean extension of Federal \nfunding, without all the ideological bells and whistles attached, \nshould have sailed through this place and would have been signed by the \nPresident lickety split. But that effort failed.\n  I intend to vote for the pending Daschle substitute amendment as \nwell, because it is a significant improvement over the Republican \nversion, which would have harsh consequences for a host of federal \nefforts to protect children, the vulnerable elderly, and other \nAmericans who have been caught in the middle of this unnecessary budget \nshowdown. Now that the earlier clean continuing resolution has failed, \nthis substitute is the surest, quickest, fairest way remaining to get \nthe Federal Government up and running, and to ensure that Federal parks \nare opened, Social Security applications are again taken, Veterans and \nother benefit checks are sent out, passport offices are opened, FBI law \nenforcement training is renewed, and other key Federal functions are \nbeing performed.\n  This Daschle substitute provides for additional interim funding at a \nrate of 90 percent for a host of Federal programs that were wiped out \naltogether by House versions of appropriations bills, and that would \notherwise suffer cuts of 40 percent in the Republican version of this \nbill. These include the Low Income Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP], \neducation for disadvantaged kids, Goals 2000, Safe and Drug-Free School \nefforts, regional economic development programs, homeless assistance, \nand many others. I don't know about other Senators, but energy \nassistance in my State has completely run out of money, and people are \ngetting their fuel shut off across my state. This is a real crisis, Mr. \nPresident, which I described in greater detail earlier this week on the \nSenate floor. This substitute will help bring an end to this energy \nassistance crisis.\n  The substitute also embodies other important principles for which we \nhave fought. For example, it provides that Medicare and Medicaid \nsavings are not to be used to pay for tax cuts. It provides that should \nany tax cuts be included in a final budget agreement, they should only \ngo to families with incomes under $100,000. While I have opposed broad-\nbased tax cuts before we get the budget into balance, I believe that \nthis provision moves us in the right direction, and will help to ensure \nthat massive Medicare cuts made by the Republicans will not be used to \npay for tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Finally, it sets a deadline of December 22, which gives us more time \nto get our work done: to send to the President the numerous \nappropriations bills which have been stuck for months in Congress, and \nto send them to him in a form that he can sign into law.\n  There is a provision in this substitute that, while it does not have \nthe force of law, suggests that Congress should enact a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. I have consistently opposed this, observing that \nsince it took us 15 years to get into this mess, starting with the \nmassive Reagan tax cuts and defense build-up of the early 1980's, it \nwill take us more than 7 years to get out of it. The President has also \nopposed this date, observing rightly that the spending cuts it would \nrequire in Medicare, Medicaid, and other areas would be draconian and \nirresponsible, and would likely destabilize the economy.\n  I agree. I do not believe that we can get there by 2002 without \nexcessive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, job training, poverty \nprograms, and other key Federal investments in the character, skills, \nhealth, and educational opportunities of American families. And we \ncertainly can't do it by then if a majority of my colleagues continue \nto refuse to scale back defense spending and corporate welfare. But it \nis true that we must eventually get to balance, and I believe that we \ncan do it; it's just that it will take us 2 or 3 years more than this \nsuggests.\n  Mr. President, most of us acknowledge that we are here today, in the \nmidst of a Government shutdown, for one major reason: Congress has \nfailed to do its job. Let's do our job tonight, and get this substitute \npassed and on to the President for his signature. We have so far been \nable to move only a few appropriations bills to the President this \nyear, and even many of those Republicans in Congress knew would be \nvetoed.\n  Let us for a change keep the interests of the American people in \nmind, get this substitute bill signed into law, and then begin a full \nand robust debate on the real budget, which slashes Medicare and \nMedicaid in order to pay for massive tax breaks for Americans \nwealthiest citizens, starting tomorrow.\n  I look forward to that debate. I do not believe the extremist \nproposals put forward by Speaker Gingrich and his band of merry \nfollowers in the House are America's priorities. I do not believe \nsimilar proposals contained in the Senate-passed version of the budget \nbill were America's priorities. I believe this debate, and the \nelections next year, will bear that out. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. \n\n[[Page S 17176]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will yield the remainder of our time in a \nmoment to the Senator from California.\n  I simply thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for finally, at \nlong last, giving us the figures that he has been working on now behind \nclosed doors for weeks, months, if not years, to arrive here--not all \nday, less than an hour or two ago. We have not had a chance to look at \nit. But at least tomorrow we will proceed to a debate on this.\n  I appreciate his giving us the information at least a few hours in \nadvance of the major debate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, anyone who believes the Republicans want \nto protect Medicare just must be living on another planet. I have to \ntell you. You go back through history, you will see who voted in \nMedicare. It was the Democrats.\n  I listened to Newt Gingrich from a couple of weeks ago. He wants \nMedicare to wither on the vine. The majority leader bragged to a group \nthat he led the charge against Medicare.\n  So, do not be fooled. If they support Medicare, they ought to now \nsupport the Daschle resolution. It says balance the budget in 7 years, \nbut protect Medicare and keep the tax cuts for those earning under \n$100,000.\n  They keep saying they love Medicare. They keep saying they want to \nprotect Medicare. They keep saying they want to balance the budget in 7 \nyears. They keep saying they care about the middle class.\n  This is the moment of truth. Let us come together. I serve on the \nBudget Committee. I offered some amendments that passed to keep the tax \ncuts for people earning under $100,000. We all said we were for \nMedicare.\n  What does the Daschle resolution simply say? It simply says we will \nbalance the budget in 7 years, and at the same time we will not use \nthose tax cuts. We will not use the cuts in Medicare to fund those tax \ncuts.\n  It is a wonderful and should be a bipartisan effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Wall Street Journal said the assumptions are wrong. I \nhope we will support Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to leave the floor. I believe the \nmajority leader is en route. He wants to speak for 3 minutes or so. But \nlet me have a few closing remarks.\n  I say to the Democrats on the other side who have voted to balance \nthe budget in 7 years--and there are 19--I say to them that they ought \nto vote this down and vote for the Republican resolution which will put \nthe Government back to work and does nothing more than what they have \nbeen for. It says during this Congress we will pass the balanced budget \namendment. It will be a 7-year budget, and it will use the economics \nthat they used heretofore in their own approaches.\n  So I ask them to be consistent tonight, and tonight not join with the \ndemagogry of just because it is Republican we can sell the American \npeople that it is anti-senior citizen, that it is anti-poor people.\n  Let me repeat. The Social Security trust fund will be solvent under \nthis proposal for 15 to 17 years and not one penny of the savings in \nany part of Medicare will go to tax cuts. It goes into a trust fund for \nthe seniors of America.\n  Now, you will not hear that tomorrow, and you do not hear that \ntonight. But we care about senior citizens, and we want their fund \nsolvent.\n  We also care about little kids, and maybe we even care more about \nchildren that have not been born. And the truth of the matter is, if \nyou listen to that side of the aisle, money grows on trees.\n  It does not grow on trees. Somebody pays for it. If we do not change \nthings, Mr. President, lo and behold, the money tree will be without \nmoney and the children not born will be paying up to 80 percent of \ntheir earnings for our bills.\n  What a wonderful life they will have and how thrilled they will be at \nthe adult leadership of this decade. They will look at us and say: Who \nwere they kidding as they ran around trying to scare seniors while they \nput America into a bankrupt position where we did not have enough money \nto pay, so we borrowed it. We were not around when it was paid back so \nour children and grandchildren have to do it.\n  Now, I stand pretty proud that after all these years we are on the \nbrink of passing a real balanced budget. But I do not say that the \nPresident of the United States must accept that. I say he ought to \naccept only one thing and so should they, and that is, let us balance \nthis budget. We do not know whose way yet. Maybe half the President's \nway, half our way. But let us commit ourselves to that, and then let us \nopen Government and let our people go back to work.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute, 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me close this then, Mr. President.\n  I remain thoroughly amazed at the President of the United States and \nhis continual day-by-day arguments that the Republicans in the Congress \nare busy about doing all kinds of actions that will hurt people when we \nhave not seen a balanced budget from him. We have seen everything from \na commitment to 5 years, to one that said maybe 10 years, to one with a \nwhole batch of new economics that said maybe 8 years, and yet even \ntonight he says he will not sign anything that will harm Americans, \nthat will harm seniors, that will hurt the poor, and yet he tells them, \nI am for a balanced budget.\n  It just does not ring true. What would ring true would be a very \nsimple gesture when we send this bill to him if he signed it and if the \nvery next day he set up a team and said, let us get this going.\n\n  I do not know which budget is coming out of it. I do not know whose \npriorities will prevail because, after all, the Congress is Republican \nand the President is Democrat. But we assume in those meetings we would \nall be Americans. But we cannot go there not knowing where we are \nsupposed to end up. We cannot just say it will all come out all right. \nWe have been at it for years. It has not come out all right. We have \nhad all kinds of meetings. It has not come out all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time for as much \ntime as I may consume.\n  I did not hear all of the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, but let me respond to what I did hear.\n  I know that the Senator from New Mexico has had the opportunity to \nserve under many Presidents, and he has seen Republicans and Democrats \nin the White House. He knows what the record is for the 1980's and \nearly 1990's. Frankly, I think there is a difference between talking \nand doing.\n  We heard a lot of talk in the 1980's about the importance of a \nbalanced budget, but the fact is we rolled up a deficit five times what \nwe had prior to the time a Republican President took office in 1981--\nfive times, from $800 billion now to almost $6 trillion. So there is a \ndifference between talking and doing.\n  The Senator from New Mexico did not mention that the United States \nhas the lowest deficit of any country on a per GNP basis, any \nindustrialized country except Norway. We are lower now than every other \ncountry. Why? Because the President showed some courage, showed some \nleadership, was able to convince the Congress in 1993 to take the \nsingle biggest step toward deficit reduction that we have seen in \ndecades.\n  And what happened? We have the best economic growth. We put 7.5 \nmillion people to work. We have actually seen a downward trend in the \ndeficit now for 3 years running. That has not happened since the \n1940's. So I hope everyone understands what the record is here.\n  This amendment says we want to continue building on what the \nPresident has done for the last 3 years. We recognize that we have to \ngo further. We recognize the job has not been finished. We recognize \nthat we have to set \n\n[[Page S 17177]]\na time certain, and if you want to insist on 7 years, we have no \nproblem with that necessarily. But we also want to recognize that the \nfundamental investments that this country has made in better health, in \nbetter economic opportunities be protected.\n  That is all we are saying; that it is not an either/or; that we can \nbalance the budget, but we do not have to do it on the backs of senior \ncitizens who need health care. And if we are going to do a tax cut, we \ndo not have to give it to those who do not need it.\n  That is really what this amendment is saying. We want to balance the \nbudget. We want to continue to work with our Republican colleagues, \neven though we did not get much help in 1993 when we committed to that \nplan. We want to make it work now. But we also strongly believe that it \nis important to commit to the kind of protection, the kind of security, \nthe kind of opportunity that American people now have had since 1965.\n  This amendment is very simple, and, frankly, I do not know how people \ncould vote against it. If you support a 7-year budget and if you \nsupport this concept of not using Medicare to pay for a tax cut, and if \nyou support tax cuts but recognize the need to ensure some economic \nequity, then you will want to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto lay on the table amendment No. 3057. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am voting for the House-passed \ncontinuing resolution. As we have debated this measure throughout the \nday, I supported various amendments which have been proposed which I \nthink were perfectly reasonable, but now the question is whether to \nvote for or against this continuing resolution. The fatal flaws in the \nprevious version have been removed. Thanks to the President's resolve, \nMedicare beneficiaries do not face a Medicare premium increase, and I \nhope and expect the President will continue to persevere with regard to \nthe extremist reconciliation bill, which contains even greater \nincreases for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Balancing the Federal budget has been my priority since first coming \nto the Senate, and this resolution commits us to a legislative approach \nto reaching that goal by 2002. I ran on that issue. I proposed an 82-\nplus point plan with specific, balanced cuts to achieve a balanced \nbudget in 5 years, and I was proud to support the President's $600 \nbillion deficit reduction package during the 103d Congress, a package \nthat contained many of the provisions I included in my own plan.\n  I have also been proud to participate in other deficit reduction \nefforts, including the bipartisan proposal put together by Senator \nKerrey (D-Nebraska) and Senator Brown (R-Colorado), and the package \ndeveloped under the leadership of Senator Kerry (D-Massachusets).\n  To me, the language in this continuing resolution means no more and \nno less than a commitment to achieving a balanced budget by 2002 and it \ndoes so without mangling our Constitution. It does not endorse in any \nway the extremist reconciliation plan that will be before us shortly, a \nplan which is not based on the goal of a balanced budget but on the \nreckless, politically self-serving desire of providing a fiscally \nirresponsible tax cut--tax cuts apparently scheduled to be mailed to \nvoters only days before the 1996 elections.\n  I firmly believe there is significant bipartisan support in the \nSenate for a responsible budget measure that achieves a balanced budget \nin 7 years, or even sooner. Such a plan would reject the reckless $245 \nbillion tax cut, make prudent reforms to our Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms, and would ask all areas of Federal spending to share in the \nburden of deficit reduction, including our military, and the special \ninterests that benefit from the massive spending done through the Tax \nCode.\n  That is the formula for a budget plan that cannot only be enacted \ninto law, but can be sustained over the entire lifetime of the \nglidepath to a balanced budget. It is very much like the alternative \nbudget plan I supported that was offered by Senator Conrad (D-North \nDakota) during the budget resolution debate last spring, and is a \nbudget I believe the President would sign. I hope we can soon begin to \nwork toward such a budget.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to announce how I will vote on the \npending continuing resolution--and why.\n  Earlier today I voted for the Democratic ``clean'' continuing \nresolution because I believe that is the appropriate way to authorize \nthe continued operation of the government, even though I have long \nsupported the 7-year commitment to balance the budget using CBO \nnumbers. The Republican Majority opposed that amendment, and it was \ndefeated, despite the fact that the lapse in agency spending authority \nwas caused by the failure of Congress to pass the 13 appropriations \nbills on time.\n  I also voted for the Democratic substitute which would have required \na unified balanced budget in 7 years while assuring that Medicare and \nMedicaid would not be cut to pay for tax breaks and any tax cuts would \ngo only to families making under $100,000. I supported this amendment \neven though I have said repeatedly that I do not believe we should pass \nany new tax cuts at all, no matter how well targeted, until we actually \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  But that amendment met the same fate as the first Democratic \nsubstitute.\n  I voted as I did on these Democratic substitutes because I could do \nso in good faith--and because I wanted to support the President and the \nminority leader.\n  But the question before us now is whether to vote for or against a \ncontinuing resolution that would end this indefensible partial shutdown \nof the Federal Government, which has created unnecessary uncertainty \nfor hundreds of thousands of blameless federal workers, generated \nhardship for countless Americans, disrupted many local \n\n[[Page S 17178]]\neconomies, and further eroded confidence in our government and its \nleaders.\n  I have always said that achieving fiscal discipline would present \ntough choices. And this vote presents one of these tough choices. I \ntake the minority leader's opposition to this resolution and the \nPresident's expected veto very seriously. I would like to continue to \nsupport them tonight as I have on so many other occasions. But fiscal \nresponsibility is at the very core of everything I have ever stood for \nas a public official. And the conditions attached to this pending \nresolution incorporate precisely the advice I have urged both privately \nand publicly.\n  To be sure, it was Congress that precipitated this government \nshutdown by failing to pass appropriations bills on time. And it then \nexacerbated the problem by challenging the President of the United \nStates, a President whom I know for a fact has been fully prepared to \nnegotiate seriously on spending priorities for a long time.\n  And none of this had to happen.\n  Even though this situation could--and should--have been avoided, \nemotions are raw today. Too many American families have suffered \nneedless disruption and uncertainty. Too many hardworking federal \nemployees have been held hostage by our actions and denigrated as non-\nessential, which diminishes the value of their labor and their service \nto their county. So while I continue to support the position of the \nPresident and many of my Democratic colleagues that a ``clean'' \nresolution is the appropriate way to proceed, I cannot in good \nconscience vote against a measure that reflects the kind of fiscal \nrestraint I believe is necessary and would end the protracted agony of \nso many of the people I represent.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are now ready for final passage. I wonder if we might \nget an agreement on debate on final passage. Maybe 30 minutes equally \ndivided, or we could vote and everybody could talk.\n  By popular demand we will vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Jan Muirhead, a \nfellow Tennessean and a former colleague, for her continuing dedication \nand commitment to serving others. A cardiovascular clinical nurse \nspecialist and coordinator at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center \nHeart and Lung Transplant Program, Jan has devoted countless hours and \na lifetime of energy to her patients.\n  These patients of all ages came to Vanderbilt knowing that their \nfuture literally depends on the availability of a compatible and \ntransplantable heart or lung. They knew if that heart or lung is found, \nthey would surely face a difficult operation and a long recovery. But \nthey also knew that Jan Muirhead was there with them through every \nstep--she has been their nurse, their teacher, their supporter, their \ncounselor, and most of all, their friend.\n  Mr. President, my friend Jan Muirhead is a native of Memphis, TN. The \ndaughter of a prominent pathologist, helping others is in her blood, in \nher heart, and in her soul.\n  Jan has been the anchor for the Heart and Lung Transplant Program at \nVanderbilt since its inception in 1985, but her career in public \nservice began years before, in 1975, when she graduated with a bachelor \nof science in nursing from the University of Kentucky. After \ngraduation, she worked as a staff nurse in Vanderbilt's neonatal \nintensive care unit and in the surgical intensive care unit. She later \njoined the department of cardiac and thoracic surgery to work with Dr. \nHarvey Bender. In 1983, Jan moved to Seattle to get her master's degree \nin nursing from the University of Washington, where she was awarded the \nCIBA-GEIGY Award for the outstanding cardiovascular nursing pathway \nmaster's student.\n  After completing her degree at the University of Washington, Jan \nMuirhead returned to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where she \nand Dr. Walter Merrill established the heart transplant program. I \njoined the program 1 year later, and over the subsequent 8 years had \nthe pleasure and the privilege of working daily with Jan. During that \ntime, I witnessed first-hand her tireless energy, her commitment to \nothers, her enthusiasm for her job, her selfless devotion, and above \nall, the warmth and dedication she showed to the thousands of patients \nwhose lives she touched.\n  She recently earned certification as an adult nurse practitioner from \nVanderbilt's school of nursing--yet another sign of her continuing \ncommitment to providing the best quality care and the most up-to-date \nadvice. In fact, patient education is one of the most important \nservices Jan provides for patients at Vanderbilt. When a transplant \npatient is admitted to the medical center, Jan sits down with them, \ndiscusses their medical condition, explains how donors are matched, and \nprovides details of the surgical procedure they will undergo when that \nmatch is found. She diligently directed the entire postoperative course \nfor the transplant patient. The thought of undergoing transplant \nsurgery and enduring a tough recovery is very scary, but for years, Jan \nhas calmed patients' fears.\n  Mr. President, Jan Muirhead has also been honored by her colleagues. \nIn 1991, she received the Nursing Research Award in Paris, France, from \nthe International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. She has \nserved as secretary and a member of the board of \n\n[[Page S 17179]]\nthe Middle Tennessee chapter of the American Association of Critical \nCare Nurses, and in 1994, Jan was chairman of the abstract review \ncommittee of the International Society of Heart and Lung \nTransplantation. She is an active member of the American Heart \nAssociation and the Association of Critical Care Nurses. She is the \nauthor and principal investigator of numerous articles and chapters on \nheart disease and transplantation.\n  Now, Mr. President, my close friend Jan Muirhead leaves Vanderbilt to \nmove to Dallas, TX, where she will participate in a Baylor University \noutreach program for geriatric patients. So, today, I would like to \nthank Jan for her outstanding service to her patients and to her \ncommunity. Her pioneering spirit, her unending commitment, and the \nunselfish love she has shown toward her patients and her colleagues \nwill be missed at Vanderbilt. I wish her all the best as she embarks on \nthis new venture in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17178-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PUBLIC/PRIVATE VENTURES' STUDY\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to my colleagues \nattention the exciting results of a 5-year study that public/private \nventures released today. As a national board member of Big Brothers/Big \nSisters of America, it brings me great pleasure to share with you the \nnews of public/private ventures' study of the Big Bothers/Big Sisters \nProgram--the first ever to assess the impact of youth of any major \nmentoring program.\n  At last we have scientifically reliable evidence that proves what we \nhave known intuitively for years--mentoring programs can positively \naffect young people.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Big Brothers/Big Sisters is a \nfederated movement of over 500 affiliated agencies located in all 50 \nStates. The Big Brothers/Big Sisters movement began in 1904 to provide \none-to-one services to boys and girls in need of additional adult \nsupport and guidance. While the environment in which today's youth \noperate is vastly different than that of 90 years ago, basic core \nservices of Big Brothers/Big Sisters remains the same--to provide \nresponsible, consistent adult role models to children at risk. The need \nfor additional adult support and guidance for our Nation's youth has \nnever been greater, however, than at this time. Currently 38 percent of \nall of America's children live without their fathers. The Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters Program presently supervises about 75,000 youth-adult \nmatches, but as the public/private ventures report proves an expansion \nof the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program would have a positive effect on \nour Nation's youth.\n  The public/private ventures study concludes that young teenagers, who \nmeet regularly with their Big Brother or Sister, are less involved with \ndrugs and alcohol, do better in school and have better relationships \nwith their parents and peers than do youth not in the program. In fact, \npublic/private ventures found that ``Littles'' who met their ``Bigs'' \nregularly were: 46 percent less likely than their peers to start using \nillegal drugs and 27 percent less likely to start drinking; 52 percent \nless likely than their peers to skip a day of school and 37 percent \nless likely to skip a class; more trusting of their parents or \nguardians, less likely to lie to them, and felt more supported and less \ncriticized by their peers and friends.\n  Most of the 959 youth in the research sample were between the ages of \n10 to 14, nearly 60 percent were members of a minority group, more than \n60 percent were boys and most were poor or near poor. Many lived in \nfamilies with histories of substance abuse and/or domestic violence. \nThey are representative of our Nation's youth placed at-risk. Keeping \nthis in mind, it is evident that the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program \nsuggests a strategy that the country can build upon to make a \ndifference--especially for youth in single-parent families.\n  And since mentoring programs work through the efforts of volunteers, \nonly modest funds are necessary to have far-reaching impact. The Big \nBrothers/Big Sisters Program is an innovative and effective program \nwith the potential of having a substantial positive impact on our \nNation's youth with a small investment. That is why I was pleased to \ninclude the Character Development Act [CDA] as one of 18 bills in a \nlegislative package which I have called the Project for American \nRenewal. The Character Development Act will link public schools with \nlocal mentoring organizations to give more children the chance to reap \nthe benefits of a one-to-one relationship. The Character Development \nAct is based on a small, innovative, Federal program known as the \nJuvenile Mentoring Program [JUMP]. JUMP is a competitive grant program \nwhich allows local, nonprofit social service and education agencies to \napply cooperatively and directly for grants from the Department of \nJustice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. These \ngrants are used to establish mentoring services utilizing law \nenforcement officials and other responsible individuals as mentors.\n  As we, as policymakers, begin to look at mentoring, we need to keep \nin mind another telling conclusion of the study. The benefits of \nmentoring do not occur automatically. If programs are supported by the \nkind of thorough screening of volunteers, careful matching and \nextensive supervision required by Big Brothers/Big Sisters, they can be \nexpected to produce similar results. In programs that lack the \nestablished infrastructure of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program, the \none-to-one relationship evaporates too soon to positively affect the \nyouth.\n  While the study's most dramatic findings are the degree to which \nparticipation in Big Brothers/Big Sisters prevents a young person from \nstarting to use drugs and alcohol, the authors also noted the fact that \nBig Brothers/Big sisters participation produces an unusually broad \nrange of outcomes for youth--improved school behavior and performance \nand better relationships with friends and family. The Big Brothers/Big \nSisters Program results in improvements in attitudes, performance, and \nbehavior--with ``littles'' one-third less likely than their peers to \nreport hitting someone.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in commending Big Brothers/Big \nSisters for their continued commitment to our Nation's youth and \nrecommend to my colleagues that they visit a local affiliate in their \nState so that they may see for themselves that mentoring can and does \nindeed work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17179-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17179-S17180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on October 25, 1995, the Prime Minister \nof Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, spoke in the Capitol Rotunda at a ceremony \ncommemorating the 3,000th anniversary of the founding of the City of \nJerusalem by David. I had the honor to introduce him. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record my remarks on that occasion.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Remarks of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan\n\n       My pleasant and most appropriate task this afternoon is to \n     introduce one of Jerusalem's most illustrious sons.\n       History will acknowledge him as the unifier of the City of \n     David--the Chief of Staff whose armies breached the barbed \n     wire and removed the cinder blocks that has sundered the city \n     of peace.\n       History will honor him as the magnanimous leader of a brave \n     people--brave enough to fight against daunting odds--perhaps \n     even braver still to make peace.\n       History will remember him as the last of the generation of \n     founders--the intrepid children of a two thousand year dream. \n     Almost certainly, the last Israeli Prime Minister to play a \n     leading role in the War for Independence, he was also the \n     first --and to this day the only--Prime Minister to be born \n     in the Holy Land.\n       He is a proud son of Jerusalem. As a young man he dreamed \n     of a career as an engineer. But destiny had other plans and \n     he fought and led for almost half a century so that his \n     people could live in peace and security.\n       Nobel Laureate, statesman, military hero, friend of our \n     nation where he served with distinction as an ambassador in \n     this very city, he honors us today by joining us in our \n     festivities--the Prime Minister of Israel, the Honorable \n     Yitzhak Rabin.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, twelve days later, I, along with many \nSenate and House colleagues, stood by his casket, first at the Knesset, \nlater on Mount Herzl where he was buried. It was an experience none of \nus will forget. No one has captured the moment and the momentous \nconsequences better than Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who \n\n[[Page S 17180]]\nwas there also. I ask unanimous consent that his reflections, ``The \nLight of a Fierce Fire,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Nov. 20, 1995]\n\n                       The Light of a Fierce Fire\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n       The poet was once asked, ``If your house was burning and \n     you could save only one thing, what would you save?'' The \n     poet answered, ``I would save the fire, for without the fire \n     we are nothing.''\n       It was Yitzhak Rabin's destiny not to be saved from the \n     frenzy of a madman. But bullets cannot so easily extinguish \n     what Rabin's bravery and vision ignited, the fire of Israel's \n     commitment to peace. He might so easily have died in the din \n     of battle, this man who made war when he had to. But he died \n     instead amid the clamor of peace, with the acclaim of a mass \n     peace rally of Iraelis still in the air and still in his \n     mind. It would be his last wish that the flame of peace, for \n     which he gave his life, should not be dimmed by anger and \n     despair. His state funeral, for all its sadness, was \n     inspiring as an occasion for the vindication of his hopes, \n     for a new dedication to Israel's security from America and \n     for a demonstration of goodwill by some former Arab enemies.\n       President Clinton led a bipartisan delegation that included \n     the congressional Republican leadership, former President \n     Bush and former Secretary of State George Shultz. It was more \n     than a respectful gesture of protocol. This was a statement \n     of emotional and psychological support from the most powerful \n     nation in the world to a small, isolated country, living in a \n     perilous neighborhood and in a time of great national trauma: \n     We do more than share your grief, we understand your fears; \n     and we will not desert you as you have so many times in your \n     history been deserted. All Americans could take pride in \n     President Clinton's splendid eulogy; in the uniqueness of \n     America's compassion and friendship that extended beyond a \n     calculation of narrow national interest; in the honor of the \n     hand outstretched at a time of need to an ally and friend. \n     The president rose to the moment. The hundreds of thousands \n     of people who lined the roadside and saw the American \n     delegation were clearly moved.\n       Of equal significance was the roll call of certain Arab \n     countries (excluding Saudi Arabia) and especially the \n     emotional speech of King Hussein of Jordan. His words \n     referring to Yitzhak and Leah Rabin as ``my brother'' and \n     ``my sister,'' which Muslims usually reserve for one another, \n     and the tears shed by both the king and his queen, made a \n     deep impression on the Israelis for their humanity and \n     ability to overcome the past. Here, clearly, were keepers of \n     Rabin's flame of peace, continuing a line that began with \n     Egypt's late president Anwar Sadat.\n       It is hard for outsiders to appreciate the effect on \n     Israelis of the worldwide outpouring of sympathy and \n     condolence, with some 80 nations represented at the funeral. \n     The Israelis are a traumatized people. They have for so long \n     been alone, so long believed they could not rely on anyone \n     but themselves, so long expected the world to stay silent in \n     their times of trouble. The extensive response resonates for \n     a people who remember how the world closed its doors to \n     millions of Jews in the 1930s. Their deaths in the Holocaust \n     were but an obscene multiple of the deaths endured in the \n     crusades and programs of earlier centuries when the Jews were \n     betrayed by those who had the power to save them.\n       Israel was to be the end of that vulnerable status of \n     perpetual minority, an end to exile and alienation, and a \n     beginning of a normal and natural form of national existence. \n     Israel was home, the new home in the old country, proclaiming \n     that the Jews had formed a self-reliant community and did not \n     need others to fight their battles for them. Now they had \n     their future defined by their own family; the farmer, the \n     kibbutznik, the jet pilot, the shopkeeper, the schoolteacher \n     could coalesce with a traditional language, with their own \n     bible, their own culture. This self-reliance is a matter of \n     great pride. Jews could look after their own family. When the \n     Jews were kidnapped in Entebbe, Uganda, it was the Israelis \n     who took care of it. A Jewish majority could eliminate Jewish \n     vulnerability, and with their own state, the Israelis could, \n     they thought, be like all other nations and like everyone \n     else. The passion for wanting to be normal extended to the \n     notion that to be accepted, Jews did not have to justify \n     themselves by winning the Moral Man of the Year Award every \n     year--at the cost of their own survival. To be 10 percent \n     more moral than other nations would make them a light unto \n     the world; if they were expected to be 50 percent more moral, \n     they would be dead.\n       And yet Israel cannot be just another secular country. This \n     very land forces the Jews into a dialogue with their \n     religious past. The land was defined through religion, \n     through the divine promise to Abraham, the covenant with the \n     Father and the covenant with the people of Israel. For many \n     religious Zionists, the victory of the Six-Day War, and the \n     subsequent opening to resettlement of the greater land of \n     Israel, were clear signs that God was guiding the secular \n     Zionist revolution toward the ultimate realization of the \n     prophetic vision of history. That is why, for some religious \n     Jews, admitting the existence of a Palestinian nation whose \n     homeland is the Holy Land is tantamount to violating the \n     integrity of the Jewish people's covenantal identity. But the \n     Jews faced a dilemma. They had come home to find peace and \n     safety, only to find that their neighbors also claimed this \n     tiny piece of land as their home. Even worse, how do you \n     share a home with someone who says: ``You have no right to be \n     here?''\n       It is the great contribution of Yitzhak Rabin that has \n     brought a moral answer to this dilemma. There are those \n     Israelis who emphasize self-reliance and remember Rabbi \n     Hillel's saying, ``If I am not for myself, who is for me?'' \n     Rabin understood Rabbi Hillel had a second part: ``When I am \n     for myself, what am I?'' He saw that the Jews could not \n     control 2 million Arabs without frequent resort to a violence \n     that would erode the moral and Jewish character of the state \n     and, with that, its support in the world. He sought a new \n     definition of Israeli strength and normalcy that incorporated \n     not just military power but also moral and economic \n     fortitude. He decided to end the Israeli occupation of \n     Palestine and any pretense that Israel cold become a \n     binational state in which one people ruled another.\n       He was uniquely qualified for this adventure. Those to his \n     political right had the strength but not the will to take a \n     calculated risk for peace. Those to his political left had \n     the will but not the strength. He alone, at the time, had the \n     capacity to persuade the divided and wary Israelis to accept \n     a compromise arrangement with the Palestine Liberation \n     Organization that held great promise for peace but also great \n     risk. But the risk was seen as a risk from the Arabs, not the \n     risk of Jew killing Jew. What the right-wing fanatics were \n     blind to is that their murderous intransigence threatened the \n     state that gave them succor and its necessary acceptance by \n     the world. Without the flame of peace, they would have \n     nothing but bloodshed threatening every Israeli's personal \n     security.\n       The debate over security in Israel is different from the \n     quarrel with the extremists. Many moderate people all across \n     Israel are concerned about giving up land, because for years \n     their leaders told them this land was essential to their \n     national security. In Israel, security decisions are made in \n     the context of the terrible reality that a single Israeli \n     strategic blunder may mean not only military defeat but a \n     genocidal threat to the very existence of the state--one that \n     the world could not forestall, even if it were willing to. \n     Many Israelis ask: Will the peace process be the beginning of \n     a new future or the beginning of the end?\n       The Israelis are determined to avoid another genocide, this \n     time in Israel. The decision to exchange lawfully captured \n     territory for the promise of peace from those who have \n     constantly threatened violence is fraught with unprecedented \n     risk. Israel will not survive in this neighborhood by \n     superior morality in the absence of superior real strength. \n     Arab moderation is in direct proportion to Israeli strength. \n     If the Arabs could defeat Israel, who could doubt that sooner \n     or later they would try?\n       Can Shimon Peres, a durable politician less trusted by \n     Israelis, lead the people in pursuit of Rabin's twin goals of \n     peace and security? He is a consummate international diplomat \n     and served with great distinction as prime minister a decade \n     ago. His ardent desire for peace may be part of his problem, \n     for many people believe he is too eager to cut a deal, too \n     dovish and not skeptical enough about security issues, too \n     wrapped up in his own ambitions. So his challenge is to \n     relieve the worries of Israelis as well as meet the needs of \n     the Palestinians.\n       In this effort, American support is crucial. Rabin said he \n     was elected to take risks for peace. President Clinton said, \n     ``If that is your goal, I will do my best to minimize the \n     risks you must take.'' That is the fire of friendship and \n     support that will enable Israel to fulfill what Rabin so \n     bravely began.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17179-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17180-S17181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OUR HATS OFF TO RICHARD EKSTRUM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on many occasions I have taken the floor \nto talk about agriculture in South Dakota. The wonders of American \nagriculture tell a story that is not told often enough. Individual \ninitiative and determined efforts have led to scientific discoveries \nthat advanced agriculture. The inspirational strength of family, \nloyalty and faith also have contributed to the wonder that is American \nagriculture.\n  In no American workplace is there found greater productivity, \ncooperation, neighborly concern, creative use of applied science, hard \nwork, and independence than on the farm and ranch. It gives me great \npride to witness the ability of our farmers and ranchers to provide \nabundant and high quality food and fiber for all our citizens and \nmillions of others throughout the world. The story of American farmers \nand ranchers is truly a wonder of the modern world.\n  There is the story of Richard Ekstrum of Kimball, SD. This week \nRichard will be stepping down as President of the South Dakota Farm \nBureau. He has held that position since he \n\n[[Page S 17181]]\nwas first elected to it in 1975. Richard's leadership has helped to \nshape the vigorous South Dakota livestock industry. His accomplishments \nare many, too many to list here. But for those of us who know him, it \nis agreed that his boots will be hard to fill.\n  Richard Ekstrum has provided me with invaluable advice and counsel \nthroughout my years in the House and Senate. He has been a tireless \ndefender and promoter of South Dakota and American agriculture. After \neach meeting with him I know exactly what needs to be done. All \nmeetings with him are productive. I will miss his regular advice and \nleadership, but I am heartened to know he is still just a phone call \naway.\n  Richard recently was quoted as saying, ``I will always be part of \nFarm Bureau and Farm Bureau will always be a part of me.'' Similarly, I \nwould like the Record to reflect that Richard Ekstrum will always be a \npart of South Dakota agriculture, and vice versa.\n  Richard owns and operates a 3,500 acre general livestock and grain \nfarm near Kimball, SD. He and his two brothers operate this farm, which \nhas a commercial farrow-to-finish hog operation and produces purebred \nSimmental cattle.\n  Richard first joined Farm Bureau in 1967 and rose through the ranks \nof the Brule County Farm Bureau organization to become President of the \nSouth Dakota Farm Bureau in 1975. He was elected in 1980 to the Board \nof Directors of the American Farm Bureau Federation, a position he held \nfor a decade. He has travelled the globe--28 countries in total--to \npromote and advance American agriculture. He recognizes that the \ncontinued strength of American agriculture rests with its ability to \ncompete in the world market place. That is part of the reason why \nRichard Ekstrum is a recognized and respected national leader in \nagriculture.\n  The strength of the Farm Bureau organization is rooted on the farm. \nThe history of the South Dakota Farm Bureau is impressive. As early as \n1913, several county Farm Bureaus were organized and operating in South \nDakota. In 1917, the operating county Farm Bureaus formed the South \nDakota Farm Bureau Federation. Today the South Dakota Farm Bureau is my \nState's leading agricultural organization and a highly regarded voice \nfor South Dakota farmers and ranchers.\n\n  Much of the success of the South Dakota Farm Bureau can be attributed \nto Richard Ekstrum. Under his leadership the organization witnessed its \nlargest membership growth. Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, membership \naveraged 3,100 farm families. During the 1970's, its programs were \nexpanded and since 1977 family membership in the South Dakota Farm \nBureau has grown each and every year to the point where it represents \nmore than 10,000 South Dakota farm and ranch families.\n  One of the many programs sponsored by the farm bureau and strongly \npromoted by Richard is the South Dakota Farm Bureau Young Farmers and \nRanchers Committee. This group provides opportunities for greater \nparticipation by young, active farmers and ranchers. It helps young \nfarm bureau members analyze their particular agricultural problems and \ncollectively find solutions that best meet their needs. I am very \npleased with the success of this program. I have said on many occasions \nthat we need to do more to promote the promise of farming for younger \ngenerations. These young people represent the future of South Dakota \nagriculture.\n  Richard Ekstrum and the South Dakota Farm Bureau are committed to the \ngoal of improving net farm income and strengthening the quality of \nrural life. I commend Richard for his loyalty to and hard work for the \nSouth Dakota Farm Bureau. He has left his mark on the landscape of \nSouth Dakota agriculture and his community. His wife Agnes and his two \ndaughters can be truly proud. I know Richard will continue to be active \nin his church, in civic and private organizations, the South Dakota \nFarm Bureau and in South Dakota agriculture.\n  Richard is known for saying, ``Of all the hats that I wear, I like \nthe one of being a farmer the best.'' Today, on behalf of all South \nDakotans, I take my hat off to Richard Ekstrum.\n  As I stated before, the wonders of American agriculture tell a story \nthat is not told often enough. It is a story of proud Americans, like \nRichard Ekstrum, who do their part in the world's most proficient \nindustry, day after day. I enjoyed and will continue to tell the many \nstories of South Dakota men and women who contribute to the greatest \nstory ever told--American agriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17180-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE CHATTANOOGA RONALD McDONALD HOUSE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commend the \nChattanooga Ronald McDonald House, which will celebrate its fifth \nanniversary in a ``Blaze of Glory'' this weekend.\n  The Ronald McDonald Houses provide a loving atmosphere for seriously \nill children to be close to their families while they are cared for in \na nearby hospital. Often, these houses are considered to be the \nfamilies' home away from home during these hardships. The ``House That \nLove Built,'' which is the name of the Chattanooga Ronald McDonald \nHouse, has assisted almost 1,800 families from 32 States and 2 foreign \ncountries, and is 1 of 162 Ronald McDonald Houses in the United States.\n  This weekend will mark the fifth anniversary for the Chattanooga \nRonald McDonald House. They will celebrate the anniversary by burning \nthe recently resolved mortgage on the house in a ``Blaze of Glory.'' \nMr. President, I would like to thank the staff, the more than 300 \nvolunteers and the donors that have made the ``House That Love Built'' \na safe and useful tool in treatment of our catastrophically ill \nchildren. Their combined efforts will not go unnoticed, and I wish them \nwell in their celebration this weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17181-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17181-S17182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OWENSBORO LEGENDS OF RACING HOMECOMING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, anytime someone from our hometown gains \nnational recognition for their talents, we all feel a sense of pride \nand ownership--that somehow we've contributed to that success.\n  I know all those from the city of Owensboro and from Daviess County \nwill be doing their share of boasting during the Owensboro Legends of \nRacing Homecoming.\n  It provides us with a chance to show off some of our homegrown \ntalent, and to thank these racers and crew members for representing our \ncommunity so well in competitions across the country.\n  I know all Kentuckians are just as proud as I am of Darrell and \nMichael Waltrip, Jeremy Mayfield, and the Green boys--David, Jeff, and \nMark. Any weekend we turn on the television and watch the NASCAR races, \nwe enjoy it that much more knowing that they're successes reflect so \nwell on Owensboro, and our entire State.\n  Working closely with the NASCAR drivers are nine pit crew members \nfrom Owensboro and Daviess County who have achieved the highest level \nof success in their field. I want to congratulate Jeff Chandler, \nKenneth Davis, Kerry Everly, Terry Mayfield, Stephen McCain, Donnie \nRicheson, Barry Swift, Bobby Waltrip, and Todd Wilkerson for their hard \nwork and excellent performances.\n  They're part of one of the fastest growing sports today. It's \nestimated that attendance records will double, with 6 million fans \nexpected to go to the races this year.\n  These are all men of excellent character, who've demonstrated what \ncan be accomplished with hard work and dedication. I join all \nKentuckians in congratulating not only them, but their families, who \nhave stood by and supported these racers and pit crew members over the \nyears. I couldn't be more proud of their achievements, and I wish them \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n\n                          THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as of the close of business yesterday, \nNovember 15, the Federal debt stood at $4,988,340,050,374.57. We are \nstill about $12 billion away from the $5 trillion mark. Unfortunately, \nwe anticipate hitting this mark sometime later this year or early next \nyear.\n  On a per capita basis, every man, woman and child in America owes \n$18,935.82 as his or her share of that debt.\n\n[[Page S 17182]]\n\n\n                CONGRESS WILL PROTECT AMERICA'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we paused last week, as we do each November \n11th, to honor American veterans who have given so much to their \ncountry for the cause of freedom. As a nation, we stop on Veterans Day \nto express our gratitude for their service and their sacrifice. And it \nis worth questioning whether the freedom which we embrace in America \nwould have spread across the world had those sacrifices not been made.\n  Because of their profound love for their country, veterans understand \nbetter than many people how important it is that we face the problems \nplaguing this Nation. ``Congress is doing exactly what I want it to do, \nin spite of some who oppose the progress we are making,'' wrote a \ndisabled veteran from Shoreview, MN, who urged me to continue pressing \nfor a balanced budget.\n  So in much the same way Americans once united during wartime, we are \nnow united in peace, working together as a nation to create a \nGovernment strong enough to meet the needs of its veterans today, while \nit safeguards the freedom our veterans ensured for us.\n  That is why I find it so appalling that veterans would be singled out \nby the President and his administration to be the latest political \npawns in their budget maneuverings.\n  Mr. President, I have received a copy of a press release issued by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs just 2 days ago, and I am utterly \ndisgusted by the scare tactics it employs and the blatant \nmisrepresentations it contains.\n  ``Nearly 3.6 million veterans, widows, and children may have to wait \non their monthly benefits checks due to the Government shutdown,'' it \nbegins. ``Unfortunately, some veterans and their families may become \nbudget casualties,'' said VA Secretary Jesse Brown.\n  Suggesting that veterans--many of whom sustained grave injuries and \nlost close friends and family members in battle--could become \ncasualties themselves, this time of a budget war, is tasteless and \nextreme. It is shocking to me that the U.S. Government would dishonor \nour veterans this way, playing on their fears and resorting to these \nkinds of tactics in an attempt to score political points for the \nPresident.\n  In his press release, Secretary Brown claims that all President \nClinton has asked for from Congress is a stopgap spending bill free of \ncontroversial riders. That is precisely what Congress will deliver to \nthe President this week--a stopgap bill that gives him the funds he \nneeds to run the Government, and asks him to pledge he will work \ntogether with Congress to balance the budget within 7 years. Yet even \nbefore he sees our bill, President Clinton is vowing to veto it.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who have so proudly served in this \nNation's Armed Forces will not be left in the cold, and to suggest that \nthe Government would ever allow that to happen is the height of \nirresponsibility. By signing the temporary spending legislation this \nCongress is preparing to send to the White House, veterans benefits \nwould be designated as an essential Government service. I urge the \nPresident to do so, so that this Nation's veterans will continue to \nreceive their monthly benefit checks on schedule and without delay.\n  The press release from the Department of Veterans Affairs, however, \nunderscores the lengths this administration is willing to go as they \nattempt to derail our efforts to balance the budget. But do not be \ntaken in by the political rhetoric--it is inflammatory and it is harsh, \nbut it is nothing but rhetoric. A similar situation occurred earlier \nthis year, when the President tried to gain some political mileage \nscaring senior citizens with his Medicare misinformation. And so it was \nonly a matter of time before he would go after the Nation's veterans, \ntoo.\n  It is indeed unfortunate that this President is so out of touch with \nthe military and the sacrifices demanded by those who serve in uniform \nthat he would attempt to frighten American veterans in such a manner.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in denouncing these \ndesperate tactics. They disgrace our veterans and serve no useful \npurpose in the very serious debate over the financial future of this \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17181-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS \n      FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1996--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 96\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In declaring my intention to disapprove House Joint Resolution 122, \nthe further continuing resolution for fiscal year 1996, I stated my \ndesire to approve promptly a clean extension of the continuing \nresolution that expired on November 13.

A bill to assess the impact of the NAFTA, to require further \nnegotiation of certain provision of the NAFTA, and to provide for the \nwithdrawal from the NAFTA unless certain conditions are met; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      the nafta accountability act\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement [NAFTA] has been a total disaster for our Nation. Virtually \nall of the promises made when it was passed have turned out to be \nhollow and shallow rhetoric.\n  We have gone from a trade surplus with Mexico to an unprecedented and \nunbelievable trade deficit. Our economy is being drained, while jobs, \nplants, and opportunities move out of this country. It is time to admit \nthat NAFTA is a lemon. When we get a lemon we take it back. We demand \nthat the promises made when it was sold be kept. If not, then our only \nchoice is to withdraw from NAFTA.\n  This coming Monday will be the 2d anniversary of the passage of the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement [NAFTA] by the Senate. Today I am \npleased to introduce the NAFTA Accountability Act. I am also pleased to \nhave Mr. Byrd, Mr. Heflin, and Mr. Campbell as original cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  As we approach the second anniversary of NAFTA, we need to remember \nthe promises of NAFTA. The advocates of this trade agreement promised a \nmore vibrant economy, a stabilized economic framework, more high-paying \njobs, increased exports, improved \n\n[[Page S 17184]]\nliving standards, reduced trade distortions, and improved \ncompetitiveness for the United States in global markets.\n  At the same time we were promised, the environment would be \nprotected, the public welfare would be safeguarded, and basic human \nrights would be enhanced.\n  Yet, the facts show that NAFTA just doesn't measure up to its \npromises. It is clearly evident that NAFTA has been a colossal failure \nfor the American people.\n  It is what used car dealers politely call a lemon. We have been sold \na bill of goods. Like most lemons from a used car lot, it is costing us \nway more than we expected, and it is not getting us where we want to be \ngoing.\n  It is time to make NAFTA accountable. We need to measure the actual \nresults of NAFTA after 2 years of operation against the promises made \nto get NAFTA passed.\n  In fact, we should compare NAFTA's performance against the goals set \nforth in NAFTA's own preamble and statement of objectives. In \nintroducing the NAFTA Accountability Act we are setting some benchmarks \nfor NAFTA.\n  We would establish eight benchmarks. Three of those benchmarks would \ndirect the President to renegotiate critical areas of failure within \nNAFTA including: Trade deficits, currency exchange rates, and \nagricultural trade distortions.\n  Five of those benchmarks would establish specific measurements by \nwhich NAFTA would be judged, including: Jobs, wages and living \nstandards; the manufacturing base of our country health and \nenvironment; illegal drug traffic; and basic individual rights and \nfreedoms.\n  If the President cannot renegotiate NAFTA, and if the administration \ncannot certify that these benchmarks have been met by December 31, \n1996, then Congress withdraws its approval of NAFTA.\n  The record of NAFTA is very clear. We have gone from a trade surplus \nwith Mexico to a trade deficit. In 1992, we had a $5.7 billion trade \nsurplus with Mexico. By the end of this year, we will have at least a \n$15 billion trade deficit. Some are now estimating that deficit closer \nto $17 billion. The total trade deficit this year with Mexico and \nCanada will be over $30 billion.\n  One of the underlying reasons for the trade deficit has been the \ndevaluation of the Mexican peso. This past week, the peso plunged once \nagain down to a record low of 7.8 pesos to the dollar. it is estimated \nthat the Mexican peso is now being supported through $30 billion in \nloans, much of it from unwilling U.S. taxpayers.\n  Another critical front is the trade distortions in agriculture. This \npast year, Canada exported 85 million bushels of wheat and 75 million \nbushels of barley into the United States, despite the fact that the \nUnited States itself is the major exporter of wheat.\n  In contrast, you can't move a single bushel of wheat across the \nCanadian border without being stopped and turned back. In one case a \nwoman who was bringing a grocery sack of wheat across the border into \nCanada so that she could make some whole wheat bread had to dump out \nthe wheat, before she could enter Canada.\n  When NAFTA was being debated, its promoters promised at least 220,000 \njobs. Those numbers have turned totally upside down. Rather than job \ngains of 220,000, we have job losses of at least 220,000. Some predict \njob losses by the end of the year of 300,000 and more.\n  Recently there was a survey of companies that had said they \nanticipated job growth under NAFTA. Fully 90 percent of those companies \nnow admit that there has been no job growth with NAFTA.\n  I think one of the most striking examples of the promise versus the \nreality of NAFTA, are the estimates made by a trade economist as \nreported by the Wall Street Journal.\n  Gary Hufbauer is an economist with the Institute for International \nEconomics. His estimates of job growth were used extensively prior to \nthe passage of NAFTA. In one Wall Street Journal article prior to the \npassage of NAFTA, he had predicted 130,000 new jobs in 5 years.\n  In April of this year, Hufbauer had to eat his rosy scenario \nestimates. Here is what he said in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The best estimate for the jobs effect of NAFTA is \n     approximately zero. The lesson for me is to stay away from \n     job forecasting.\n\n  Hufbauer was right, he should have stayed away from job forecasting. \nA couple of weeks ago, Hufbauer revised his estimate again. As reported \nin the Wall Street Journal, Hufbauer is now saying that the surging \ntrade deficit with Mexico has cost the United States 225,000 jobs.\n  These are real jobs, and real people losing their jobs. Within the \nlast couple of weeks, we have seen a number of plants closing, jobs \nmoving, and layoffs.\n  The nation's largest underwear maker--Fruit of the Loom--at the end \nof October announced the closing of six domestic plants, a cut back at \ntwo other plants and lay off of 3,200 workers. A spokesman for the \ncompany, Ronald Sorini, was quite candid. He said, ``What you are \nseeing is the cumulative impact of NAFTA and GATT.''\n  Take the case of Tri-Con Industries which operates a car-seat cover \nplant. Ten days ago, this company announced it was closing its plant \nand moving its 200 jobs to Mexico.\n  Another firm, Ditto Apparel, announced this week that it would lay \noff 215 workers at its Colfax, Louisiana plant. They make private-label \njeans at that plant. The personnel director at the plant, a fellow \nnamed Don Vann was also very candid.\n  In speaking of NAFTA and GATT, he said, ``I'm telling you, those are \nthe nails that are going to be in the coffin of the apparel industry in \nthis country. It's going to be awfully hard for some people who have \nbeen long-term employees here. The sad part is, there is just nothing \nanyone can do.''\n  Well, I don't agree that there is nothing anyone can do. We can hold \nNAFTA accountable. We can require that either NAFTA lives up to its \npromises, or we withdraw from NAFTA.\n  The NAFTA Accountability Act is simple. If NAFTA does not live up to \nits promises by December 31, 1996 and if the President does not \nrenegotiate key provisions, then the Congress will withdraw its \napproval of NAFTA.\n  Essentially this would be a performance audit. If it doesn't pass \nmuster, then it's ``out-the-door buster.''\n  I hope that today's introduction of this bill, will bring about a \nnationwide grassroots review of the promises and the realities of \nNAFTA. It is time that America's body politic understood what America's \ngrassroots already feels--NAFTA is undermining their individual and \nfamily security, and clouding future opportunities.\n  While they have a deep concern about our nation's budget deficits, \nthey are just as concerned with our nation's trade deficits. These \ntrade deficits mean lost jobs, fewer opportunities for our families, \nand deficits in family budgets.\n  In closing, I would also like to call attention to an excellent \narticle which was recently published in the Journal of Commerce. Dr. \nCharles W. McMillion, an economist here in Washington, DC has a \ncompelling message about the reality of NAFTA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Nafta: This Is Success?\n\n                       (By Charles W. McMillion)\n\n       It might seem odd that someone would claim to explain the \n     ``reality'' of a global trade relationship without mentioning \n     the net export balance, its composition or change over time. \n     But John Manzella does just that as he shows very little \n     interest in the ``reality'' he claims to present. (Nafta \n     Hasn't Cost America Jobs, October 20)\n       Manzella asserts that U.S. trade with Mexico under the 1994 \n     Nafta agreement ``continues to deliver, on jobs and more.'' \n     Surely he excludes Mexico from his fantasy, where no one \n     doubts that over one million net jobs have been lost, incomes \n     reduced by 30-50%, the economy in its deepest depression \n     since the 1930s, political and religious leaders murdered and \n     more. . .\n       But he also does not mention that U.S. net exports to \n     Mexico have been declining since 1992; that the U.S. now \n     faces net export losses to Mexico of well over a billion \n     dollars each month; or that U.S. trade losses to Mexican \n     production are now concentrated in high technology and high \n     value added industries such as electronics and autos.\n       The fact is that the much celebrated U.S. pre-Nafta surplus \n     of $5.7 billion in net exports to Mexico in 1992 became \n     monthly deficits by the fall of 1994--even before the \n     December, 1994 collapse in Mexico's attempt to maintain its \n     overvalued peso by spending \n\n[[Page S 17185]]\n     virtually all of its $30 billion in foreign reserves. Now, the peso is \n     supported by $30 billion of ``loans,'' mostly from unwilling \n     U.S. taxpayers. And still the global markets are rapidly \n     devaluing the peso as they have done for the past 20 years. \n     U.S. net export losses to Mexico will reach about -$16 in \n     1995.\n       Manzella falsely claims that those of us who understand the \n     lunacy of Nafta do not mention U.S. exports to Mexico. In \n     fact, we tediously detail those exports. Most are component \n     parts contracted out for further manufacture in Mexico and \n     re-exported back into the U.S. According to the Government of \n     Mexico, these parts now account for 81% of Mexico's global \n     imports, up from 72% last year, and perhaps 90% of US-made \n     exports to Mexico, up from 75% last year.\n       Since contracting out work to Mexico is even cheaper now \n     with the peso at market rates, it is not surprising that \n     exports of components to Mexico have continued to rise in \n     1995. The small fraction of exports of capital goods to \n     Mexico have fallen by -32% as construction of anything other \n     than export platforms has all but collapsed. The almost \n     insignificant export of global consumer goods to Mexico has \n     plunged by -41.5%--far more for any goods made in the U.S.\n       Exports are usually considered to ``create'' jobs because \n     making additional goods in the U.S. to sell as exports--a car \n     or a computer--requires hiring additional U.S. labor. \n     However, most U.S. exports of components to Mexico do not \n     represent new production but merely the contracting out of \n     work previously done in New York, Pennsylvania or \n     elsewhere in the U.S. It is therefore quite likely that \n     even so-called U.S. ``exports'' to Mexico displace far \n     more U.S. jobs than they create.\n       Manzella claims that the contracting out of component parts \n     to Mexico is a clever government strategy to counter ``fierce \n     competition from Asia and Europe.'' Yet, even with the dollar \n     far weaker in Asia and Europe than ever before in history, \n     U.S. trade losses have skyrocketed faster and higher than \n     ever before. Net export losses for U.S. manufacturing alone \n     soared from -$66 billion in 1992 to a record -$159 billion in \n     1994, and perhaps -$200 billion in 1995.\n       In the first eight months of 1995, Mexico has a trade \n     surplus of $10 billion with the U.S. but a trade deficit of \n     -$5.5 billion with Asia, Europe and the rest of the world.\n       Clearly, increased production by multinational corporations \n     in Mexico is not displacing production and jobs in Asia and \n     Europe but in Mexico and in the U.S.\n       Manzella's belief that declining net exports under Nafta \n     have created U.S. jobs is based not only on his ignorance of \n     the nature of U.S. exports to Mexico, but also on his strange \n     view that imports do not displace jobs. (Although he \n     discredits his own strange view by noting that ``. . . more \n     U.S. jobs and production stay at home'' when imports have \n     some U.S.-made content.)\n       When producers in the U.S. lose sales to imports they are \n     forced to produce less and to eliminate jobs. It is \n     unfortunate that Manzella, as many politicians, has not yet \n     learned this basic fact of business life. But it should not \n     confuse any serious analysis of recent U.S./Mexico trade.\n       The most recent Department of Commerce calculus is that $1 \n     billion of production supports 16,000 jobs. This would \n     suggest that the U.S. net export loss of about -$16 billion \n     to Mexican production in 1995 would displace over 250,000 \n     jobs. But since most of the $40 billion in U.S. exports to \n     Mexico is not new production but merely contracting out work \n     that was previously done in communities across the U.S., this \n     figure is certainly far too low.\n       Perhaps even more important is the depressing effect that \n     Nafta has added to the declining purchasing power of U.S. \n     wages. Throughout the economy, workers and their firms have \n     taken further cuts in real pay and benefits to keep their \n     jobs from being contracted out or to lower prices to meet the \n     cycle of reduced demand.\n       Manzella repeats as fact the claim of embarrassed \n     politicians that Nafta had nothing to do with Mexico's \n     current account and peso crisis last December. Manzella seems \n     to think it was just coincidence that Mexico's external \n     balance became wildly unbalanced immediately after Congress \n     passed fast-track authority for Nafta. Does he believe that \n     after a generation of net capital flight it was coincidence \n     that over $60 billion of hot portfolio ``investment'' poured \n     into Mexico? Was Mexico's flood of imported component parts \n     just coincidence?\n       In fact, there is no question but that Nafta created the \n     enormous and unsustainable short-term imbalances in Mexico. \n     For the longer term, Nafta's guarantees to foreign investors \n     are devastating local Mexican producers that must now compete \n     against Walmart, Microsoft and Sony's facilities in Mexico \n     but without their access to global capital. This will \n     continue to undermine employment and earnings in Mexico--\n     and therefore consumer demand--for many years to come.\n       It is a cruel, political joke to suggest that Nafta is \n     protecting U.S. exports contracting out jobs to Mexico. \n     Furthermore, even the net export U.S. trade deficit with \n     Mexico is already far worse than the previous record--$7.7 \n     billion deficit following Mexico's 1982 crisis. The deficit \n     will be twice as severe for the full year.\n       Finally, Mr. Manzella cites the gain of large numbers of \n     U.S. jobs during business cycles since 1982 to argue that \n     merchandise trade losses do not cause job loss. He seems \n     unaware that while the U.S. population has grown by 30 \n     million since 1982, and 26 million net new jobs have been \n     created, all of these new jobs have been in the non-traded \n     service sector.\n       Since 1982, the U.S. has accumulated manufacturing trade \n     losses of $1.3 trillion. Far from creating manufacturing jobs \n     to accommodate our growing population and economy, we have \n     1,300,000 fewer manufacturing jobs today than in 1982.\n       Contrary to 18th century theory and modern political \n     rhetoric, U.S. trade with Mexico and other low cost export \n     platforms is destroying millions of high wage, highly \n     productive jobs and replacing them with low wage, low \n     productivity service jobs. It is sharply undermining growth \n     and prosperity for all to provide leverage for a very few to \n     capture increasing shares of a slowing global economy.\n       Manzella and anyone else who considers Nafta a success, for \n     Mexico or for the U.S., should reconsider their priorities. \n     We can do much better. America should lead the international \n     community in an urgent new effort to address today's new, \n     post-Cold War, information-age realities and to provide \n     growth and prosperity for ourselves and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17183-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 44\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 44, a bill to amend title \n4 of the United States Code to limit State taxation of certain pension \nincome.\n\n\n                                 S. 978\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the names of the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Baucus], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the \nSenator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings], the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], the Senator from \nNevada [Mr. Reid], and the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 978, a bill to facilitate contributions to \ncharitable organizations by codifying certain exemptions from the \nFederal securities laws, to clarify the inapplicability of antitrust \nlaws to charitable gift annuities, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1220, a bill to provide that Members of Congress shall not be paid \nduring Federal Government shutdowns.\n\n\n                                S. 1414\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Pressler], the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] were added as cosponsors of S. \n1414, a bill to ensure that payments during fiscal year 1996 of \ncompensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities, of \ndependency and indemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans, \nand of other veterans benefits are made regardless of Government \nfinancial shortfalls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17185-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17185-S17186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATE RESOLUTION 195--TO HONOR FREDERICK C.

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague Senator \nSpecter to submit a resolution which pays tribute to Frederick C. \nBranch, the Marine Corps' first African-American commissioned officer. \nThe fiftieth anniversary of this historic event will be honored \ntomorrow night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This man's dedication and \nperseverance paved the way for the some 1,200 African-American Marine \nOfficers serving their country today, 50 years later. I would like to \n\n[[Page S 17186]]\nenter into the Record a recent article published in The Navy Times \nwhich recently celebrated his remarkable career. This article details \nhis determination in becoming a young officer.\n  Fifty years later, Lt. Branch returns to Quantico, Va.--The Marine \nCorps first black lieutenant was greeted at Officer Candidate School by \nthe school's first black commander, 50 years after his commissioning.\n  Frederick C. Branch, one of the original Montford Point Marines and \nnow a retired science teacher, visited the school where his wife Peggy \npinned him with the gold bars of a second lieutenant on Nov. 10, 1945.\n  Back then, the South was segregated and blacks drank from separate \nwater fountains. ``Whenever we left the base, we ran directly into \nthose segregation laws,'' said Branch, his face framed by peppered hair \nand moustache and his walk helped slightly by a cane.\n  During one rail trip, he recalled, he (then a corporal) and 200 other \nnoncommissioned officers were returning to the United States from the \nSouth Pacific, where they were stationed in 1944. Stopping at a \nrestaurant, he and two other blacks were not served and were referred \nto another eatery--literally on the other side of the railroad tracks, \nhe said.\n  Branch was drafted into the Corps in 1943, and was the first black to \ngraduate from officer training in 1945. Six others preceded him but all \nwere dropped because of injuries or academics, even though all six were \ncollege graduates.\n  It remains a sore spot but nevertheless it did not dissuade him from \napplying. However, ``I did not encounter any flack during training at \nall,'' he said.\n  Branch was a reserve officer but served on active duty and was a \nbattery commander with an anti-aircraft unit at Camp Pendleton. He then \ntook what he learned as a Marine into the schoolhouse in 35 years as an \neducator.\n  The Branches' return to Quantico a half-century later saw to a \nslightly different Corps. The basics of screening and training \npotential leaders remained the same, although more specialized, he \nsaid. And Marine leaders reflect the Nation's ethnic and racial \ndiversity, like Officer Candidate School commanding officer, Col. Al \nDavis.\n  ``Now officers are integrated,'' Frederick Branch said. ``Here, the \ncommander of OCS is black, and his staff is black and white.''\n  Officer training actually was conducted a short distance away on the \nQuantico Marine Base, but Branch wanted to visit with school officials \nand learn a little about today's screening and training of Marine \nleaders. During a short morning tour, Branch and his wife watched \nofficer candidates training in the ropes and obstacle courses before \ngiving lunch a try at the OCS chow hall.\n  Branch said he would like to see black representation among officers \nincrease further. But he took note of the advancements in the last few \ndecades that brought a black three-star general and first black \naviator, a black two-star general and three brigadier generals, two of \nwhom are on active duty.\n  ``The black officers now have advanced all the way up to three stars, \nand there is still room for improvement,'' he said.\n  Frederick Branch rose to the rank of Captain and proudly fought with \nhis fellow soldiers in Korea before leaving the service in 1972.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17185-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n    CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996 JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n\n                       daschle amendment no. 3055\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE proposed an amendment to the joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Finance, it is my responsibility to monitor our trade \nagreements relating to financial services. It is a responsibility we \ntake seriously.\n  Earlier this year, the subcommittee held a hearing on the WTO \nnegotiations regarding financial services. We heard testimony from both \nadministration and industry representatives. Based on those hearings \nand close monitoring of the talks, we took a strong position in \nopposition to the proposal that was put forward. The administration, \ncorrectly, took the same position.\n  In recent weeks, the subcommittee staff has been monitoring the \nimplementation of other agreements including the United States-Japan \ninsurance agreement which is formally known as ``Measures by the \nGovernment of Japan and the Government of the United States Regarding \nInsurance.'' Based on those initial reviews, we have some significant \nconcern regarding implementation of the accord.\n  Ambassador Mickey Kantor has often emphasized the importance of \nensuring faithful implementation of our trade agreements. Great effort \nis invested in reaching agreements--once the investment is made, \nvigilance is needed to ensure that they bear fruit in terms of new \nopportunities for our businesses, U.S. exports, and jobs.\n  Senators will remember the considerable efforts expended recently by \nthe USTR to conclude accords under the United States-Japan Framework \nAgreement. More than a year has passed since the first agreements were \nreached; I believe it is now an appropriate time to conduct an \nassessment of those initial agreements and what, if anything, they have \naccomplished.\n  One of the first agreements reached was the one covering insurance. \nJapan has the largest life insurance market in the world, and the \nsecond largest nonlife market, after the United States. Despite the \nenormity of this market, all foreign insurers hold less than a 3-\npercent market share, a far lower share than every other advanced \nindustrialized country. Japan is currently deregulating its insurance \nmarket following the Diet's passage of a new insurance business law in \nJuly of this year. If pursued in accordance with the bilateral \ninsurance agreement, we can expect deregulation to provide significant \nnew benefits for Japanese consumers and businesses, as well as new \nopportunities for competitive foreign insurers.\n  However, developments occurring in Japan today indicate that new \nthreats may be confronting United States insurance interests. These \nthreats can be prevented if the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement \nis faithfully implemented.\n  Specific provisions of the insurance agreement were designed to \nensure that the interests of foreign insurers were not undermined by \nthe deregulation process. In a letter from Ambassador Kantor to the \nU.S. insurance industry of October 11, 1994, detailed definitions of \nthe key terms of the agreement were outlined, together with \n\n[[Page S 17187]]\nUSTR's expectations of what would result. Full compliance with these \nterms, as defined in Ambassador Kantor's letter, is essential if the \nagreement is to achieve its objectives.\n  Because faithful implementation of this accord is so important, \nSenator Boxer, the ranking member on the subcommittee, and I recently \nsent to Ambassador Kantor a letter requesting a detailed and \ncomprehensive report to the committee this month on all actions taken \nto date by the Government of Japan to implement its obligations under \nthe insurance agreement. It is my hope that the Senate's interest will \nserve as a constructive influence to help ensure that this important \nagreement, and other agreements, stay on track and live up to their \nfull potential.\n  Mr. President, I ask that our letter to Ambassador Kantor, as well as \nAmbassador Kantor's letter to the U.S. insurance industry of October \n11, 1994, be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow:\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: We are writing to share with you our \n     commitment to ensuring full and effective implementation of \n     trade agreements between the United States and Japan. You \n     have often stated it is not enough simply to reach agreements \n     with our trading partners, but that we must also be vigilant \n     in guaranteeing that the rights gained under those agreements \n     are fully realized. We could not agree more strongly.\n       As part of our Subcommittee's ongoing oversight \n     responsibilities in this regard, we would like to request a \n     detailed report on the results of actions taken to date to \n     implement the commitments defined in the U.S.-Japan Insurance \n     Agreement and in your October 11, 1994 letter to the U.S. \n     insurance industry concerning certain key aspects of the \n     Agreement.\n       We are concerned about reports that, as the implementation \n     date for the new Japanese Insurance Business Law approaches, \n     developments in Japan may pose serious threats to U.S. \n     insurance interests. For example, plans by large Japanese \n     insurers to enter the ``third sector'' through newly created \n     subsidiaries, pose both a major commercial threat to U.S. \n     insurers and a probable violation of the insurance agreement. \n     The Subcommittee is particularly concerned about the \n     inadequacy of actions taken to date by the Ministry of \n     Finance to ensure compliance with those provisions related to \n     this activity.\n       Accordingly, we request you provide a report to the \n     Subcommittee on these and other actions taken to date by the \n     Government of Japan to implement obligations under the \n     agreement, as well as the results of those actions. Please \n     also describe additional actions USTR will take to ensure \n     ongoing implementation of the agreement's other provisions.\n       We would appreciate receiving your report within the next \n     two weeks so we may proceed with our review. The Subcommittee \n     is considering a future hearing to review the results of \n     various U.S.-Japan trade agreements; your report on the \n     insurance agreement will help us prepare for any such \n     meeting.\n       We appreciate your efforts on behalf of U.S. insurers, and \n     look forward to your report.\n\n       Sincerely,\n\n     Barbara Boxer\n     Christopher S. Bond\n                                                                    ____\n\n         The United States Trade Representative, Executive Office \n           of the President,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 1994.\n     Mr. H. Edward Hanway,\n     Chairman, International Insurance Council,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hanway: I am writing to express my sincere \n     appreciation for the industry's support during our \n     negotiations with the Government of Japan on insurance. I am \n     pleased to confirm that we have achieved agreement with the \n     Government of Japan, through which Japan and the United \n     States will undertake ``Measures by the Government of the \n     United States and the Government of Japan Regarding \n     Insurance''. The goal of the Agreement is to achieve \n     significant improvement in market access in Japan for \n     competitive foreign insurance providers and intermediaries.\n       With respect to the third sector issue, the Agreement \n     states that:\n       ``With regard to mutual entry \\1\\ of life and non-life \n     insurance companies into the third sector, the MOF intends \n     not to allow such liberalization to be implemented as long as \n     a substantial portion of the life and non-life areas is not \n     deregulated, taking into account the fact that dependency of \n     some medium to small and foreign insurance providers on the \n     third sector is high, and that these medium to small and \n     foreign insurance providers have made the efforts to serve \n     the specific needs of consumers in the third sector. \n     Furthermore, with respect to new or expanded introduction of \n     products in the third sector, it is appropriate to avoid any \n     radical change in the business environment, recognizing that \n     such change should depend on medium to small and foreign \n     insurance providers first having sufficient opportunities \n     (i.e. a reasonable period) to compete on equal terms in major \n     product categories in the life and non-life sectors through \n     the flexibility to differentiate, on the basis of the risk \n     insured, the rates, forms, and distribution of products.''\n     \\1\\ ``Mutual entry'' means the ability of life insurance \n     companies to introduce existing, new or modified rates, \n     products, or riders in the third sector currently allowed to \n     non-life insurance companies, and the ability of non-life \n     insurance companies to introduce existing, new or modified \n     rates, products, or riders in the third sector currently \n     allowed to life insurance companies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Based on a confirmation made during the negotiations with \n     the Government of Japan, I would like to affirm the \n     following:\n       (1) with respect to existing large Japanese life and non-\n     life companies, ``avoid any radical change'' means, among \n     other things, that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will \n     maintain existing administrative practices concerning the \n     third sector and not allow such companies to expand their \n     third sector presence;\n       (2) with respect to subsidiaries that existing large \n     Japanese life and non-life companies might form after the new \n     insurance law takes effect, ``avoid any radical change'' \n     means, among other things, that such subsidiaries will be \n     treated the same as existing large life and non-life Japanese \n     companies and accordingly will not be allowed to surge into \n     the third sector;\n       (3) ``major product categories'' includes automobile \n     insurance; and\n       (4) ``a reasonable period'' means three years.\n       With regard to rate and from liberalization, in addition to \n     the specific commitments made in the Agreement, I would like \n     to affirm that:\n       (1) with respect to the threshold for application of the \n     special discount rate applicable to the large commercial \n     risks of fire insurance, the discount will be reduced from 2 \n     to 1.5 billion yen for factory fire insurance and from 1.5 to \n     1 billion yen for general fire insurance; and the threshold \n     for storage (warehouse) insurance will be unchanged; and\n       (2) with respect to the minimum insured amount of the large \n     commercial fire insurance policies to which the deductibles \n     rider can be attached, the minimum insured amount will be \n     decreased from 5 billion yen to 1.5 billion yen.\n       The Agreement creates binding obligations on the Government \n     of Japan enforceable under U.S. trade laws, such as Section \n     301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. The Agreement \n     provides for follow-up consultations between the Government \n     of Japan and the United States Government. We expect to hold \n     such consultations twice a year during the first three years \n     upon signing of the Agreement, and annually thereafter. With \n     U.S. insurance industry's assistance, we expect to monitor \n     closely developments in the third sector to ensure that the \n     Government of Japan is in compliance with the Agreement.\n       We very much appreciate the International Insurance \n     Council's support and assistance during our negotiating \n     efforts and look forward to working with the Council to \n     ensure effective implementation of the Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17186-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TREASURY-POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Bill Janklow said he is \n     worried his state might be getting hooked on gambling \n     revenue.\n       Janklow said South Dakota has been saturated with gambling. \n     State government is heavily dependent on gambling revenue, \n     with video lottery proceeds accounting for between 15 percent \n     and 17 percent of the general fund budget, Janklow said.\n       If the economy slows down and people have to limit \n     spending, gambling will be one of the first expenses people \n     cut out, Janklow said. The resulting drop in state revenue \n     would ``hit us right between the eyes,'' Janklow said.\n       Gambling revenue should have been treated as ``one-time \n     money'' and not intended to continue each year, Janklow told \n     a meeting of the Sioux City Downtown Rotary club Monday.\n       But changing the state's reliance on gambling revenue will \n     be difficult, Janklow said. Tax revenues in South Dakota grew \n     at three times the rate of inflation in the nine years before \n     he took office for a third time this year, Janklow said.\n       If taxes grow at about the same rate as income, people \n     grumble, but do not revolt, Janklow said.\n       ``That's what we had (last year), a revolt,'' Janklow said.\n       Voters defeated a ballot measure that would have slashed \n     property taxes by one-third. A property tax cut plan proposed \n     by Janklow and passed by the Legislature promises homeowners \n     and farmers a 20-percent tax cut.\n       South Dakota's economy will have to grow to offset money \n     lost to the property tax cut, Janklow said.\n       A few state lawmakers have said a state income tax is the \n     best way to ease South Dakota's financial straits. Janklow \n     said the state's voters will never agree to that.\n       ``Working people are always going to vote no (on an income \n     tax) because they know the government is not going to be \n     honest,'' Janklow said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17187-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FURLOUGH OF WORKERS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have decided on a day-to-day basis \nthat my staff will report for work during the partial shutdown of the \nFederal Government. I have reached this decision for two reasons.\n  First, the Republican leadership has indicated that Federal workers \nwho are furloughed will be paid retroactively even though they did not \nwork. Since they will be paid, I believe that members of my staff here \nin Washington and in my offices in Michigan should work for that pay. I \nask that a letter to Representative Constance Morella of Maryland from \nSpeaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  Second, during this period of crisis, it is perhaps even more \nimportant for my constituents to be able to contact me to express their \nviews, and to seek information and assistance. Many are experiencing \ndifficulties obtaining normal services from the Government because many \noffices are closed or not at full strength.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Constance Morella,\n     106 Cannon House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Connie: We will be sending soon to President Clinton a \n     bill to continue funding for the federal government through \n     December 1, 1995. Besides providing for government services, \n     this bill also funds federal workers' salaries.\n       If the President decides to veto this vital legislation to \n     keep government operating, the possibility exists that some \n     federal workers may be furloughed. In the event that this \n     takes place, it is our commitment that federal employees will \n     not be punished as a direct result of the President's \n     decision to veto funding for their salaries. Should this \n     happen, we are committed to restoring any lost wages in a \n     subsequent funding bill.\n       Again, we want to reasure you that if the President vetoes \n     the continuing resolution and requires federal workers to be \n     furloughed, we are committed to restoring any lost wages \n     retroactively.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker of the House.\n     Bob Dole,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17188-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         YOUTH VOLUNTEERS--1995\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, today I call to the attention of my \ncolleagues two people who have made a difference and saved someone's \nlife. Everyday in communities across America men and women come face to \nface with life-threatening situations. In most cases, and usually \nwithout fanfare or widespread recognition, people make the quick \ndecisions and take the actions that make a difference and save lives. \nThis is the story of two of those people.\n  On July 14 of this year, Sharon Mann and Thomas Prezkop of Andover, \nMA were enjoying a Friday night cruise aboard the Desperado in \nGloucester Harbor when they noticed something out of the ordinary. They \nheard the sound of an engine racing out of control and in the darkness \nturned to investigate. From a distance they saw the lights of a small \nvessel circling and knew that something was wrong. Upon approaching the \nlocation they heard a man's cries for help. Closing in on the man's \nvoice, they found Kevin Govoni in the cold water, threw him a life \npreserver and then pulled him aboard their vessel. Mr. Govoni was in \nbad shape. The circling vessel had hit him and the propeller had badly \nslashed his legs. Compounding Mr. Govoni's serious injuries, he was \nsuffering from hypothermia from being immersed in the 50-degree water. \nWorking as a team, Ms. Mann tended to Mr. Govoni by removing his soaked \nshirt, covering him, and applying first aid to stop the severe bleeding \nwhile Mr. Prezkop headed the Desperado toward the nearest Coast Guard \nstation and called ahead to have an ambulance waiting.\n  Upon their arrival at Coast Guard Station Gloucester, Mr. Govoni was \ntransferred by ambulance to a local hospital. In hindsight, it becomes \nclear that with no other vessels in the vicinity, if Ms. Mann and Mr. \nPrezkop had simply decided not to get involved, a life could have been \nlost. However, due to their quick action and excellent judgment, a life \nhas been saved and Mr. Govoni is recovering from his injuries.\n  Thomas Prezkop and Sharon Mann are real heros--like heros who appear \nevery day in this country. They are the ones whom we should be \nrecognizing and admiring before so-called stars and celebrities. I \nrecognize and salute the actions of Mr. Prezkop and Ms. Mann and I am \nglad to see that the service that specializes in such rescue, the U.S. \nCoast Guard, also recognizes a job well done. This Monday, November 30, \n1995, the Coast Guard will award Mr. Prezkop and Ms. Mann the Public \nService Commendation for demonstrating courage and initiative in saving \nlives, qualities in keeping with the highest traditions of the Coast \nGuard. These awards are well deserved. On behalf of the people of \nMassachusetts, I wish to acknowledge our debt to them and express \nprofound appreciation for their unselfish actions.\n\n[[Page S 17189]]\n\n\n                          U.S. BUREAU OF MINES\n\n Mr. BENNETT. I wish to bring to the attention of the chairman \nof the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee a matter of great \nimportance to the State of Utah--the matter of the impending closure of \nU.S. Bureau of Mines facilities throughout the United States. The \nfacility in Salt Lake City will be closed and 115 jobs will be lost. \nThe Salt Lake City facility has conducted valuable research in \nenvironmental remediation and water research. While I am disappointed \nthat the Senate acceded to House demands that the Bureau of Mines be \nclosed, I also recognize the long-term benefits resulting from the \nearnest efforts to reduce the budget deficit and downsize the Federal \nGovernment. And in recent weeks, a silver lining emerged in the cloud \nsurrounding the closure of the Salt Lake City facility. Mr. President, \nthe chairman will be pleased to learn that efforts are underway right \nnow to make preparations to privatize the Salt Lake City Bureau of \nMines facility.\n  I would be remiss if I did not commend the staff of the Salt Lake \nCity facility for their tremendous efforts to find a viable alternative \nwhich will prevent the technical expertise which has been accumulated \nfor years from going to waste. On their own initiative, several \nemployees have prepared a list of options in light of the pending \nclosure. The most promising option and the one that the people of Utah \nare the most excited about, would permit the privatization of the \nBureau of Mines facility. An interested group of investors and the \nemployees of the Bureau of Mines have been in close contact in recent \nweeks to work out the details. Sufficient funding has been secured and \nshould the facilities be transferred to the State of Utah, the State \nwould in turn take the necessary steps to ensure the continued \noperation of these facilities under a consortium of private and State \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, the chairman knows, there is legislative language in \nH.R. 1977 which grants the Secretary of Interior the authority to \nconvey without reimbursement, the title and all interest of several \nBureau of Mines facilities to various State university and government \nentities. While the Salt Lake City facility is not mentioned directly, \nthe language permits transfer of such facilities as the Secretary deems \nappropriate. May I ask the chairman if such a transfer would be \nappropriate for the Salt Lake City facility?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Utah raises a very good point. Of course \nthe transfer of the Salt Lake City facility would be appropriate. From \nwhat the Senator from Utah has explained to me, this is a unique \nopportunity to accomplish several goals at once. In keeping with our \nefforts to downsize the Federal Government, we can privatize certain \ngovernment services, reducing the burden on the taxpayer while \nretaining essential research capabilities within the State of Utah. \nSuch a transfer would permit the private sector, State university and \nthe State of Utah to work in a cooperative effort to continue important \nenvironmental remediation research efforts.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the chairman's understanding that this action \nshould occur as soon as possible?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is my understanding that quick action is essential to \nthe successful transfer of the facilities in Salt Lake City. While the \nfiscal year 1995 Interior Appropriations Act provides the Secretary of \nthe Interior authority to transfer only certain Bureau facilities, both \nthe House and Senate versions of the fiscal year 1996 Interior bill \ngive the Secretary broader authority to transfer other facilities such \nas those in Salt Lake City. This authority was requested by the \nadministration, is supported by both the House and Senate, and I have \nevery reason to believe will be signed into law when action on the \nfiscal year 1996 bill is completed. I would urge the Bureau, the State \nof Utah, and other entities involved in the proposed transfer of the \nSalt Lake City facilities to work together in anticipation of this \nauthority being granted. I will do everything in my power to see that \nthe fiscal year 1996 bill is enacted in the coming weeks.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman for his explanation as well as the \nexcellent manner in which has managed this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17188-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRIME MINISTER YIZHAK RABIN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, like most Americans, I am shocked \nand grief stricken by the brutal and senseless assassination of Prime \nMinister Yitzhak Rabin. My heart grieves not only for Israel and its \npeople for the loss of their leader, but for all peace loving peoples \nin the Middle East. Most especially, my heart grieves for the family of \nPrime Minister Rabin: his wife Leah, their children and their \ngrandchildren. Our prayers and heartfelt sympathy are with them as they \ndeal with the most personal of life's tragedies in the most public of \ncircumstances.\n  Father, grandfather, husband, patriot, soldier, statesman, Nobel \nlaureate and peacemaker, Prime Minister Rabin was a man of many parts. \nHe dedicated his life to the service of his country and his life \nmirrored the evolution of his country. As a young man, his valor in the \ncause of freedom helped create the State of Israel. As an older man, he \ndefended Israel in battle against enemies that threatened the existence \nof his homeland. As a senior statesman, he relentlessly pursued the \ncause of peace with Israel's adversaries with boldness and courage. \nPerhaps only a person hardened by the experiences of war could put \naside anger over the past and undertake the risks of pursuing peace \nwith hostile neighbors.\n  Mr. President, the world has lost a great leader, and we are all \ndiminished by his passing. He died before fulfilling his dream: \npeaceful coexistence with all Arab neighbors. The peace process must go \nforward. We, the world community, must continue and fulfill what he \nstarted. We cannot reward this act of extremism by halting or slowing \nnegotiations. We must use this occasion to show all extremists capable \nof using violence that the killing of Prime Minister Rabin will not \nfrustrate or stop the peace process. We must unite in this time of \ntragedy and pursue peace with renewed vigor and purpose.\n  Mr. President, when I heard the news of Prime Minister Rabin's tragic \ndeath, I was reminded of the death of another great martyr in the cause \nof Middle East peace, former President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. The \nsimilarities in their lives and the circumstances surrounding their \ndeaths cannot be ignored. Both knew the hardships of war and understood \nthe risks of peace. Both understood the need for honest dialogue with \nadversaries and the value of compromise. Both were slain at the hands \nof countrymen who were opposed to their making peace with former \nenemies. We would do well to learn from their boldness and courage.\n  Mr. President, Israel deserves our unqualified support at this time \nof national tragedy. We must make it clear to all who would be \nopponents and disrupters of peace that we intend to continue and \nfulfill what Prime Minister Rabin started: conciliation between Israel \nand its Arab neighbors. This legacy must not be lost with his senseless \ndeath.\n  Tzedek! Tzedek! Terdofe!: Righteousness! Righteousness! you shall \npursue!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17189-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17189-S17193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ELI 1995 ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n Mr. CHAFEE, Mr. President, last month the Environmental Law \nInstitute [ELI] met here in Washington to bestow its highest honor, the \nEnvironmental Leadership Award, to a well known, internationally \nrespected businessman, lawyer, public servant and Republican, Mr. \nWilliam D. Ruckelshaus.\n  As many of us in this body know, the Environmental Law Institute has \nplayed a major role in shaping environmental policy and law, here in \nthe United States and abroad. Over the past 26 years ELI has provided \nthoughtful environmental information, research, and policy analysis to \na diverse constituency of government, business, and academic interests. \nPublisher of the Environmental Forum and the Environmental Law \nReporter, ELI remains a resource and the place to go for answering the \ntoughest environmental questions.\n  ELI's 1995 annual award dinner opened with an interesting keynote \nspeech by Dr. Stephan Schmidheiny. Dr. Schmidheiny, chairman of UNOTEC \nAG, a multinational industrial group, founded the Business Council for \nSustainable Development and \n\n[[Page S 17190]]\nserves as a director of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Nestle, and Union Bank \nof Switzerland. Far from advocating throwing out the environmental baby \nwith the bath water, Dr. Schmidheiny advanced the view that \nenvironmentalism makes good business sense. A businessperson himself, \nhe highlighted positive and voluntary steps taken by the business \ncommunity to live up to environmental responsibilities in an \nincreasingly open and international setting.\n  Dr. Schmidheiny's remarks proved to be a fine introduction to ELI's \n1995 honoree. Bill Ruckelshaus represents everything that is best about \nbusiness, government service, and commitment to a clean and health \nenvironment. A former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nas well as Deputy Attorney General of the United States. Mr. \nRuckelshaus served as the first Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. He is currently chairman of the board of Browning-\nFerris Industries, Inc., one of the Nation's largest waste management \ncompanies. Bill's breadth of experience gives him a unique and valuable \nperspective on the current state and future of environmental protection \nin the United States. What's more, his career represents a shining \nexample of the interaction between business and environmental \nprotection.\n  Mr. Ruckelshaus' acceptance speech underscored the fundamental need \nfor a clean environment and outlined a program to reform our current \nsystem of environmental protection. Most importantly, his remarks \nfocused not on tying the Environmental Protection Agency's hands, but \nallowing EPA to get the environmental job done.\n  On recent criticism of environmental protection, Mr. Ruckelshaus \nconcluded:\n\n       * * * There is a cottage industry now writing books and \n     articles stating that many of our environmental concerns are \n     a lot of hooey. * * * My answer to that is the same as it has \n     been for a number of years. Our efforts in America are not \n     about controlling a few chemicals or saving a few species. \n     There are more than five billion people on this globe living \n     in under-developed nations who want to live as well as we do \n     materially. And they are going to try to get there. If they \n     all try to get there in the same way we got there, \n     wastefully, scattering pollution, unduly impacting our \n     natural resource base, then all of us are in a world of \n     trouble.\n\n  It was a thought-provoking speech from an advocate for both business \nand the environment--a perspective overshadowed lately by the rush to \nturn back the calendar to a day that has truly come and gone--when our \nresources were believed to be limitless and immune from harm. With \nseveral environmental statutes currently before the Congress for \nreauthorization, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, Superfund, and \nthe Clean Water Act, his speech is especially timely. I congratulate \nBill for receiving ELI's 1995 Environmental Leadership Award and ask \nthat the text of his remarks as well as Dr. Schmidheiny's be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                         Stopping the Pendulum\n\n                      (By William D. Ruckelshaus)\n\n       It is conventional for people receiving awards of this \n     nature--for environmental leadership--to make some remarks in \n     favor of the environment, which is usually taken to mean our \n     current system of environmental protection. This might seem \n     to be particularly desirable in a season characterized by the \n     most violent anti-environmental rhetoric in recent memory \n     coming from the Congress. For example, I believe at least one \n     Member has compared the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     the Gestapo. I don't think he meant that as a compliment. My \n     cue as an awardee is to come forth and while away at the \n     forces of darkness, vow to hold the line and protect our \n     environmental progress at all cost and so on. But, at the \n     risk of you taking back this fine award, which I do truly \n     appreciate, I have to tell you that I am disinclined to do \n     that tonight.\n       Here is why. We are gathered here to celebrate the twenty-\n     fifth anniversary of the Environmental Law Institute. It \n     coincides with the same anniversary of EPA. That's a period \n     representing much of a working lifetime. Some of us have been \n     in the environmental protection business in one way or \n     another for at least that long, or longer, and we should be \n     able to recognize certain repeating patterns. And so we do. \n     We recognize, as perhaps the newer members of Congress do \n     not, that the current rhetorical excess is yet another phase \n     in a dismaying pattern. The anti-environmental push of the \n     nineties is prompted by the pro-environmental excess of the \n     late eighties, which was prompted by the anti-environmental \n     excess of the early eighties, which was prompted by the pro-\n     environmental excess of the seventies, which was prompted. . \n     .but why go on? The pattern is quite clear. The new Congress \n     may believe that it is the vanguard of a permanent change in \n     attitude toward regulation, but unless the past is no longer \n     prologue, then as sure as I am standing here, the pendulum \n     will swing back, and we will see a new era of pro-\n     environmental lurching in the future.\n       So what is wrong with this picture? Aren't changes in \n     emphasis part of the fabric of democracy? Yes, but in the \n     case of environmental policy, these violent swings of the \n     pendulum have had an unusually devastating--perhaps a \n     uniquely devastating--effect on the executive agency \n     entrusted to carry out whatever environmental policy the \n     nation says it wants. The Environmental Protection Agency is \n     now staggering under the assault of its enemies--while still \n     gravely wounded from the gifts of its friends. That is an \n     exaggeration: the Environmental Protection Agency, like the \n     IRS, has no friends. As far as I can see, there is not \n     coherent politically potent constituency devoted to making \n     sure that the EPA can make the best possible decisions and \n     carry them out effectively.\n       Currently, some members of Congress seek to stop the Agency \n     from doing what previous Congresses have mandated it do by \n     refusing to give it the funds to act. A little like cheering \n     the launch of an airplane flying from New York to Los Angeles \n     while giving it the gas to reach Chicago, and then decrying \n     the crash in Iowa as further evidence of pilot ineptitude. \n     And we wonder why trust in the EPA has eroded.\n       The impact of all this on the agency is devastating. EPA \n     suffers from the battered agency syndrome. Domestically, it \n     is hesitant, not sufficiently empowered by Congress to set \n     and pursue meaningful priorities, deluged in paper and \n     lawsuits, and pulled on a dozen different vectors by an ill-\n     assorted and antiquated set of statues. Internationally, it \n     is nowhere near the position it should occupy in global \n     environmental debates as the representatives of the largest \n     industrial nation and one with an enviable track record of \n     environmental improvement: in short, it is an agency \n     paralyzed by the conflict between its statutory mandate and \n     sound public policy, and a public debate which erroneously \n     depicts the social choices in apocalyptic terms.\n       And this is why I do not wish to join the rhetorical firing \n     line on either side, neither to slash at EPA for doing what \n     Congress told it to do, nor to argue for increased resources \n     and for a defense in the last ditch on behalf of the current \n     array of legislation and regulation. Instead, I would like to \n     take all of us, in a sense, above the smoky battlefield, as \n     in a balloon, and discuss, in the relative quite of the \n     upper, cleaner air, what is really wrong with the American \n     environmental system and what to do about it.\n       The first step, as in all recovery programs, is to admit \n     that the system is broken, severely broke, broken beyond hope \n     of any easy repair. Repairing it is going to take serious \n     effort, hard work--hard work--hard work, by a great many \n     people, over an extended period of time. Privately, many of \n     you in this room on all sides of this debate have admitted \n     that to me many times. Despite the current rhetoric in this \n     city, there is no simple fix, no sliver bullet; just the \n     opportunity to do a lot of good for our environment and by \n     example to the environment of every place else.\n       Once we acknowledge that, we can dismiss the strawman \n     problems that those simple fixes are supposed to address, \n     and penetrate to the underlying actual defects. The \n     currently prevailing myth, of course, is that EPA's \n     problems are essentially bureaucratic. ``A bureaucracy run \n     amuck,'' is how it's usually put. And the illustrative \n     text is the EPA horror story, usually featuring an \n     arrogant bureaucrat from the nest of vipers inside the \n     Beltway making some hardworking honest fellow out in the \n     pure heartland of America do something utterly stupid. To \n     accept this view, we must imagine the apocryphal \n     bureaucrat wandering freely through fields of policy and \n     musing, ``What can I do today that will really drive them \n     up the wall? If they think they've seen dumb, wait until \n     they see this!''\n       And naturally, the conclusion from this view of things is \n     that if you can somehow tie up EPA, strip it of resources, \n     burden it with even more legal challenges, you will have gone \n     far towards solving the problem.\n       Well, in fact, the image of EPA as an overweening \n     bureaucracy is miscast. In fact, if anything, it is an \n     underweening bureaucracy. Any senior EPA official will tell \n     you that the agency has the resources to do not much more \n     than ten percent of the things Congress has charged it to do. \n     In addition, they are not empowered to allocate that ten \n     percent so as to ensure a wise expenditure of the public \n     treasure. The people who run EPA are not so much executives \n     as prisoners of the stringent legislative mandates and court \n     decisions that have been laid down like archaeological strata \n     for the past quarter-century.\n       Having said that it is also fair to say that we should not \n     be surprised if, having been given Mission Impossible, having \n     been whipped both for doing things and for not doing things, \n     having been prevented from using their judgment like ordinary \n     folks do, the people of EPA get insensitive, thick-skinned \n     and defensive. This is where many of those ``can you believe \n     this one'' horror stories originate. I have traveled to the \n     Hill with senior EPA officials and listened to \n\n[[Page S 17191]]\n     Members of Congress rail away about the unreasonable things foisted \n     upon their constituents. Often it was the case that the \n     complaints were justified; and when I asked these EPA \n     officials privately what they thought about the Congressional \n     laments, the response was usually something like, ``That's \n     just the role he's forced to play; he's been going on like \n     that for years'' or ``It goes with the territory''. There was \n     often little sense that this expression of Congressional \n     outrage was a problem to be solved by the application of \n     intelligence, cooperation, and creativity. It was like a \n     game, where the rules were crazy and nobody was allowed to \n     win. It is therefore no wonder that EPA representatives \n     occasionally act like the Red Queen in ``Alice'' when they \n     venture beyond the Beltway to try to do all the impossible \n     things that Congress has told them to do in some 10 massive, \n     separate and uncoordinated statutes. I am not trying to \n     excuse irrational behavior. I'm trying to get us all to \n     understand its root causes.\n       How have we come to this pass? EPA was launched on a huge \n     wave of public enthusiasm. Its programs have had an enormous \n     and beneficial effect on all our lives. The gross pollution \n     we were all worried about twenty-five years ago is either a \n     memory or under reasonable social control. Why is EPA now the \n     agency everyone loves to hate?\n       Well, I think there are four reasons, three built into the \n     very core of EPA, and one that results from the peculiarities \n     of our times.\n       First, there is the belief that pollution is not just a \n     problem to be worked out by society using rational means, but \n     a form of evil. And I think in the early days of \n     environmentalism this was a plausible idea to many of the \n     people drafting the initial set of laws. Industry at that \n     time didn't take environmental degradation seriously, and \n     there was considerable bad faith shown, lies, cheating, and \n     so on. I further think it can be demonstrated that things \n     have changed now, in two respects. First, nearly all major \n     industrial leaders know that environmentalism is here to \n     stay, and so firms wish to avoid charges that they are \n     insensitive polluters, just as they wish to avoid defects in \n     quality. The customers don't like it, and believe it or not, \n     paying attention to the environmental impact of technology or \n     processes benefits the bottom line and therefore has become a \n     permanent factor to be weighed by corporate America.\n       In addition, the most significant threats to our \n     environment now seem to lie, not with major industrial sites, \n     but in the habits of we ordinary Americans: we like to drive \n     big, powerful cars, use a lot of electricity, generate a lot \n     of waste, enjoy cheap food, live in grassy suburbs and \n     collectively send pollution in massive amounts to often \n     distant airsheds and waterways.\n       The laws, and the enforcement policies that follow them, \n     are still looking for that evil polluter, and in the same \n     place--major facilities. Since the relative threat from these \n     has decreased, EPA is ever more like the drunk looking for \n     his keys under the lamp-post. More effort, more irritation, \n     less achievement to show.\n       This phenomenon is directly related to the second major \n     flaw--the commitment to perfection built into the language of \n     our major statutes. In addition to the mistaken belief that \n     absolute safety was both possible and affordable, the theory \n     was that if standards were set extremely high, sometimes on \n     scant scientific evidence, and an extremely tight time frame \n     was set to achieve those standards, then there would be \n     constant pressure on industry and on EPA to make \n     continuous improvements. The nation was committed to a \n     sort of pie in the sky at some future date, a date \n     extended further and further into the future as inevitably \n     EPA missed nearly every deadline set for it. Each time a \n     new generation of clean technology came into use, the \n     response from EPA had to be. ``That's great--now do some \n     more'', whether that ``more'' made any sense as a priority \n     or not. It can be argued that the present system has \n     produced significant environmental benefits. True it has; \n     the environment is a good deal less toxic than it once \n     was.\n       But look at the cost. Even though the environment has \n     improved, EPA and the environmental community are pervaded by \n     a sense of failure. In fact, that failure was foreordained by \n     the promise of an unattainable future. In addition, pursuit \n     of perfection inevitably leads to the pursuit of \n     trivialities, which yield more of those famous EPA horror \n     stories. The business of environmental protection devolves \n     into an endless debate about arcane scientific procedures--\n     one in a million or one in a billion. The important moral \n     force of EPA is frittered away, and still we cannot summon up \n     the energy to deal with real environmental problems. We \n     cannot direct our attention outward to help the global \n     problems crying out for assistance from the most powerful \n     nation on earth. I do not believe this is what we started out \n     to do twenty-five years ago.\n       The mission impossible of pursuing perfection leads \n     directly to the third quandary--the devolution of all \n     important environmental decisions to the courts. As is well \n     known, nearly every major EPA decision ends up in the \n     judicial system, one result of the determination of the early \n     drafters of our legislation, who were--no surprise here--\n     environmental lawyers, to allow the most liberal provisions \n     for citizen suits. The result has been that most of the \n     environmental protections that are actually--rather than \n     theoretically--put into place are the result not of the \n     deliberations of scientists or engineers or elected \n     representatives or responsible appointed officials, but of \n     consent decrees handed down by judges. A grim irony or poetic \n     justice, depending on your point of view, is the current \n     proposal by the majorities in the House and Senate to allow \n     even more opportunities to block action by way of lawsuit, \n     this time favoring those who would stop EPA action.\n       I hope I don't offend when I say that when we lawyers get \n     involved, things tend to slow down a bit. That means both \n     that environmental improvement is delayed, sometimes \n     indefinitely, and that all involved in these drawn-out \n     proceedings face crippling, costly uncertainties. The \n     transaction costs of any environmental progress under these \n     conditions are often an appreciable fraction of the costs of \n     the substantive environmental remedies. Superfund is the \n     great exemplar here, a program designed to clean up abandoned \n     dumps that somehow transformed into a program in which the \n     only people allowed to clean up are the consultants and the \n     litigators.\n       Yes, we built this system, you built it and I built it, \n     that moved America along toward a cleaner environment, but \n     the system is now broken and must be repaired, in some cases, \n     in the teeth of the immediate interests of many in this room. \n     That's one reason why repair will be incredibly hard.\n       Another and fourth reason is that peculiar quality of our \n     times I mentioned earlier, which is the nearly steady thirty \n     year erosion of trust in all public institutions, \n     particularly those situated here in our nation's capital.\n       You've all read the polls. People don't trust government, \n     but they don't trust the press or business either. We are \n     down to Walter Cronkite, Mother Teresa and Colin Powell.\n       At the absolute epicenter of this institutional hell of \n     mistrust is the EPA. This is largely because advocates for \n     address to our environmental problems and their allies in \n     Congress feared for the implementation of their program in \n     the event of a hostile administration, and their antidote was \n     to write stringent mandates, restrictions, and timetables \n     into the EPA's basic statutes. As I've tried to argue here, \n     tying the Administrator's hands in this way does not \n     necessarily advance the achievement of substantive \n     environmental goals; paradoxically, it may even retard them. \n     Promising unachievable perfection simply assures trust \n     eroding failure. And, of course, now we have a Congress that \n     has so far shown itself unwilling to do the hard work \n     necessary for meaningful reform. Instead, it is intent on \n     further snarling a system it sees as another example of \n     liberalism gone wild.\n       I don't think universally applied risk assessment or cost \n     benefit analysis or refusing to fund mandates from previous \n     Congresses that this Congress doesn't like will pass both \n     Houses and be signed by the President. Nor do I believe the \n     Congress could override a Presidential veto of these \n     approaches to reform. I believe the result will be the much \n     maligned gridlock. In fact, we may already have reached it.\n       We have to assume that at some time in the future--probably \n     when this current version of gridlock is more apparent--we \n     will be able to deal seriously with the reform we all \n     recognize is needed. What would that reform look like?\n       First of all it would have to be effective. It must be able \n     to address those problems that a consensus of knowledge and \n     research has identified as the worst environmental risks. \n     This requires an administrative structure capable of \n     marshaling resources to address those problems, in whatever \n     media they occur, and the discretion and flexibility to \n     allocate those resources effectively. This means that \n     Congress is going to have to return to its Constitutional \n     role of setting national policy and providing vigorous \n     oversight, and leave the EPA to get on with implementing that \n     policy, free of direct supervision from 535 administrators.\n       Second, reform has to produce efficiency. It has to provide \n     the maximum reduction of risk to human health and the \n     environment per dollar invested in controls or incentives. \n     This implies, first, a vast simplification of environmental \n     rule-making. We cannot go on with a system in which the \n     physical volume of the paper necessary to establish a permit \n     approaches the physical volume of the waste to be controlled. \n     Also, some finite well-understood limits should be \n     established for what our society is prepared to pay for a \n     certain level of environmental health, together with some \n     reasonable relationship between what is paid and what we get \n     for it. In other words, environmentalism has to leave the \n     realm of quasi-religion and take its place among the \n     realities of the state, along with national security, social \n     welfare, health and justice--pretty good company, by the way.\n       Third, the system must better reflect the essential \n     democratic values of our society. The day is past when a \n     dozen or so youngish people can sit in a windowless room in \n     Waterside Mall in Washington D.C. and after a year or so, in \n     the last stages of exhaustion, emerge with a set of absolute \n     commands for a major economic sector. We need a system that \n     reflects the real choices of the American people as to what \n     levels of protection they desire locally for local problems, \n     and that builds upon the basic good sense of communities in \n     balancing their environmental and other social values. \n     Needless to say, no one can be allowed to clean up by loading \n     pollution on to a neighbor, and so the new \n\n[[Page S 17192]]\n     system has to be carefully designed to be consistent with regional, \n     national and global environmental goals.\n       Finally, the system has to be fair. It cannot impose an \n     undue burden of either risk or expense on any one portion of \n     the population, or allow the transfer of risk from one place \n     to another without fully informed consent. It cannot, for \n     example, expect private landowners to carry the full cost of \n     species protection, nor can it expect farm workers or people \n     living near industrial plants to suffer inordinate risks for \n     the economic benefit of the general population.\n       It hardly needs saying that no petty adjustment of the \n     current set of laws can easily achieve these objectives. The \n     nation needs a new, single, unified environmental statute \n     supervised by a single authorizing committee and a single \n     appropriations committee in each house of Congress. Not the \n     12 laws and 70 committees we now have. I am fully aware of \n     the political difficulty of achieving this nirvana, but it is \n     no more vaulted in aspiration than zero cancer risk with a \n     margin of safety below that--an impossible assignment EPA has \n     labored with for decades.\n       How to get there is, of course, the problem. The kind of \n     rhetoric we are seeing now on both sides of the debate will \n     not help, nor will the careless budget slashing in which the \n     current Congress is indulging. It almost seems as if many \n     Members of Congress believe that environmental protection is \n     nothing but an aspect of liberalism, and since liberalism is \n     discredited, we can happily return to converting every \n     environmental value we have left into ready cash. In my view, \n     like some of the Democratic Congresses of the past, the \n     Republican Congress is too often promising more than can \n     be delivered, and thereby contributing to the very lack of \n     trust in government that got them elected in the first \n     place. The result of all this could be a cordless bungee \n     jump named Ross Perot.\n       What one piece of a right answer could look like is slowly \n     emerging form local experiences in this country and from the \n     experience of some other nations. It involves a new sort of \n     consensus process, in which all the significant stakeholders \n     are brought together to hammer out a solution to a set of \n     environmental problems. This approach is particularly \n     applicable to problems confined to specific geographic \n     regions. The critical thing about such a process, and the \n     only way to make it work, is that all participants have to \n     understand that the process is the entire and exclusive \n     theater for decisions, therefore Congress and other \n     legislative bodies have to mandate the process. There will be \n     no appeal, and no way to weasel out of the deal. This is \n     critical; no consensus process can survive the idea that one \n     of the parties can get everything it wants--without \n     compromise--at some other forum.\n       A process of this type has been used successfully by the \n     state of Washington in working through the competing \n     interests of timber companies, environmentalists, Indian \n     tribes and local communities regarding the cut of timber on \n     state lands. On a large scale, the Netherlands now runs its \n     entire environmental program out of consensus groups covering \n     every major industry and district. Industries can meet \n     national guidelines in just about any way they choose, but \n     they have to play the game. The Dutch call the national plans \n     developed through such processes ``coercive voluntary \n     agreements.''\n       Whether a process that seems to work to work in a small, \n     crowded nation with a long culture of cooperation in the face \n     of danger would work here in a big, mostly empty country, \n     where the tradition is more libertarian, is an open question. \n     But somehow we have to get past this situation where EPA is \n     out there in the boat and everyone else in on the shore \n     jeering as the ship of state floats by. Somehow, we have to \n     use whatever civic consciousness and sense of community we \n     have left to bring all the interests into the same boat and \n     give them an oar. Don't jeer--row! Because if EPA sinks while \n     we watch, we all get pulled under.\n       A lot of people don't believe this; there is a cottage \n     industry now writing books and articles stating that many of \n     our environmental concerns are a lot on hooey. If that's \n     true, why do we need an effective EPA? My answer to that is \n     the same as it's been for a number of years. Our efforts at \n     environmental improvement in America are not about \n     controlling a few chemicals or saving a few species. There \n     are more than five billion people on this globe living in \n     under-developed nations who want to live as well as we do \n     materially. And they are going to try to get there. If they \n     all try to get there in the same way we got there, \n     wastefully, scattering pollution, unduly impacting our \n     natural resource base, then all of us are in a world of \n     trouble.\n       Supposing that's not true? Supposing somehow, magically, \n     the global development process will take place and not cause \n     all the terrible things to happen to the environment that \n     some predict? Well, I for one, would be delighted if that \n     were the case. Twenty-five years from now, when they come by \n     the nursing home and say ``Ruckelshaus, you were a damn fool \n     about ozone depeletion or fisheries destruction,'' I'll just \n     smile. Meanwhile, you can call me a conservative old \n     Republican, but I don't care to bet the future of the \n     country, and the planet, and the free institutions we're \n     worked so hard to preserve, on that scenario being true. We \n     need to take the prudent steps necessary to bring the major \n     global problems under control, and we need to lead the world \n     in that effort--because, you know, there is really no one \n     else--and to do that we need effective, efficient and fair \n     governmental institutions, among which is EPA. And we have to \n     begin the hard work of fixing it, or suffer the incalculable \n     consequences of our failure.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Remarks by Dr. Stephan Schmidheiny\n\n       Thank you. I was extremely relieved to learn that it is not \n     part of my assignment tonight to say a lot of nice things \n     about Bill Ruckelshaus. I have known him too long, and have \n     so much admiration for his person and his achievements in all \n     his many fields of endeavour that if praise were my \n     assignment we would be here for days.\n       But I must take this opportunity to thank Bill for the \n     leadership he showed when we were putting together the \n     Business Council for Sustainable Development's report to the \n     1992 Earth Summit. He always offered compelling logic, and \n     always rallied our less courageous members.\n       He also gave me an important word of advice on an early \n     draft of the report, in which I had begun with all the usual \n     environmental gloom and doom as a rallying call to action. \n     Bill took me aside, and in the confidential tones an uncle \n     might use to explain sex to a backwards nephew, he said: \n     ``Stephan, don't do it that way. Business people stop reading \n     immediately when they come upon bad news. To seduce business \n     people, you have got to start by telling them how good things \n     are going to be. Only then do you add a few side problems, \n     such as the loss of the world's forests, oceans, animals, air \n     and ozone layer.''\n       Now, many of you are lawyers, and I know that lawyers are \n     different. You not only have a higher tolerance for bad news, \n     you actually thrive on it, and make your livelihoods out of \n     it. Even so, I shall start with good news anyway.\n       The good news is that in many parts of the world business \n     is beginning to live up to its new responsibilities. As \n     markets become more open and more international, business is \n     ever more obliged to see that its activities work for, rather \n     than against, the goal of sustainable development.\n       The World Business Council for Sustainable Development now \n     consists of more than 120 companies and is still growing. We \n     have spun off national BCSDs in Asia, Eastern Europe, and \n     throughout Latin America. The Councils have been involved in \n     a broad spectrum of activities. The WBCSD has developed a \n     ``Joint Implementation'' programme in which industrial and \n     developing world companies are cooperating to reduce \n     greenhouse gases in the most internationally cost-effective \n     ways. The BCSD of Columbia, composed of large companies, is \n     showing small companies in such inherently dirty business as \n     tanning and metal plating how they can save money by \n     producing less waste and pollution.\n       This is a perfect example of the WBCSD paradigm of eco-\n     efficiency--adding ever more value while using ever less \n     resources and producing ever less waste and pollution.\n       There are many reasons why companies should not get \n     involved in eco-efficiency. First, many governments still \n     actually subsidize waste--the waste of energy, water, forest \n     products, pesticides and fertilizer. Second, even if not \n     subsidized, many environmental resources are priced too low. \n     This is especially true of pollution sinks--such as rivers, \n     soil, and the atmosphere. Thus the act of polluting is just \n     not as expensive to companies in the marketplace as it should \n     be.\n       I think that these disincentives are fading. I think there \n     are a number of trends pushing companies toward increased \n     eco-efficiency. Taken separately, no single one is \n     convincing. Taken together, they become a powerful force.\n       In many parts of the world regulations are getting tougher \n     and--more important--enforcement is getting tougher; more and \n     more CEOs are finding themselves in court for non-compliance; \n     more use is being made of economic instruments--taxes, \n     charges and tradable permits--to encourage companies towards \n     constant improvement; banks are more willing to lend to \n     cleaner companies; insurers are more willing to insure \n     cleaner companies; investors are increasingly interested in \n     investing in cleaner companies; the best and the brightest \n     graduates are more willing to work only for cleaner \n     companies; ``green consumerism'' is becoming more mature, \n     switching from brand loyalty to company loyalty; the general \n     public feels a growing right to have a say in what our \n     companies do; the search for eco-efficiency can motivate a \n     company and its employees to become more innovative on many \n     fronts; eco-efficiency is an excellent avenue for introducing \n     the concept and the practice of Total Quality Management (and \n     indeed it is hard to talk about Total Quality Management \n     without including environmental quality in terms of eco-\n     efficiency); media coverage of pollution and environmental \n     liability problems is becoming more sophisticated--and thus \n     harder for companies to shrug off; many of the people to whom \n     the company directors are related (spouses, children) are \n     becoming more concerned and sophisticated about environment \n     and social issues.\n       Given the recent antics of the U.S. Congress, you may be \n     surprised to hear me list tougher regulations as a present \n     trend. I shall let Bill Ruckelshaus comment on the activities \n     of the lawmakers here. But I am convinced that the American \n     people will ultimately prove unwilling to return to a time \n\n[[Page S 17193]]\n     when U.S. rivers caught fire and whole towns had to be abandoned.\n       Internationally, a recent survey of multinationals by the \n     Economist offered a long list of examples of successful \n     companies involved in eco-efficiency and community \n     development activities: Western chemical companies becoming \n     vigilant in policing the industry to decrease pollution \n     scandals; computer companies pushing for higher environmental \n     standards; accountancy firms helping post-communist countries \n     set up modern accounting systems; and oil companies \n     guaranteeing to build schools and airports and act as green \n     watchdogs in return for drilling rights. All of these \n     activities are so obviously investments in present and future \n     business that, the survey concluded, ``it seems that behaving \n     like good corporate citizens makes eminent business sense''.\n       It also noted that multinationals tend to help the \n     countries in which they operate by using international \n     standards wherever they go. ``On the whole they find it \n     easier to operate one set of rules everywhere in the world. * \n     * * So multinationals clamor for more global--and usually \n     higher--standards partly because it makes their lives easier, \n     partly because it imposes the same standards on their \n     competitors.''\n       The general philosophy at the WBCSD is that since trends \n     are moving towards greater eco-efficiency, the smart company \n     will back such trends, encouraging governments where they \n     need encouragement, while getting their own corporate houses \n     in order to be ready as eco-efficiency becomes the norm \n     rather than the exception.\n       This process is reaching into unexpected parts of the \n     business world--such as the financial community. I recently \n     helped to lead a WBCSD Working Group on Financial Markets and \n     Sustainable Development. We had been worried that the \n     financial markets, which much be the engine of any kind of \n     development, might be inherently opposed to the goal of \n     sustainability. We worried that they encourage short-term \n     thinking, that they under-value environmental resources, \n     and that they rigorously discount the future.\n       Our work--which will be published as a book early next \n     year--found that these fears were largely justified. But we \n     also found a surprising amount of encouraging activity in a \n     financial community. Bankers are moving beyond concern for \n     Super Fund liability to realize that a loan to a dirty \n     company is simply becoming a more risky loan--as dirty \n     companies have more difficulty being financially successful. \n     The fact that many banks have signed a statement committing \n     themselves to support sustainable development is not \n     particularly impressive. That the signers have recently hired \n     an NGO to report on how they are honouring their commitment--\n     now that is impressive.\n       Insurance companies have become sensitized by liabilities \n     for contaminated industrial sites and by losses due to what \n     looks to them like the first financial effects of global \n     warming. Conservative companies like Munich Re and Swiss Re \n     are--in their demands for government action to limit climate \n     change--sounding more radical than the more militant \n     environmental groups.\n       Even those professions with reputations as fonts of boredom \n     and conservatism--the accountants and the auditors--are \n     working on new forms of accounting that account for the \n     nature as well as capital.\n       So, we have dealt with industry: it is improving. We have \n     dealt governments: by advising them to take advice from the \n     more progressive businesses. We have even found cause for \n     hope among the financial community.\n       That leaves the lawyers. What can be done with the lawyers? \n     I am willing to frankly state that in my personal opinion the \n     greatest threat to the competitiveness of US business is not \n     low foreign wages or Oriental inventiveness; it is the US \n     legal system. First, it adds more and more every year to the \n     cost of doing business. As a whole, it represents a \n     tremendous transaction cost to the US economy and society.\n       Second, the laws covering the different sectors and \n     concerns--banking, business, energy, agriculture, \n     transportation, taxes--have grown up in such an ad hoc manner \n     that they now positively war with one another. And this, of \n     course, only fans the flames of enthusiasm for litigation. I \n     am often advocating the use of common sense in addressing \n     environmental challenges. At a time when payments to the \n     legal profession routinely exceed those to victims or the \n     actual costs of clean-up, then a move towards more common-\n     sense approaches would appear timely.\n       I am criticising the US system because I stand on US soil \n     before US lawyers. We in Europe also suffer from legal \n     adhocracy or ``piecemealism''; though I do insist that you in \n     the US continue to lead the world in money-wasting \n     litigiousness, as you lead the world in so much else. And I \n     admit that, in this instance, we are genuinely afraid that \n     you may become successful exporters of the another US \n     product--your legal system.\n       I do not offer an answer. But I have been deeply and \n     profoundly impressed with the work of Bill Futrell and the \n     Environmental Law Institute in what they call ``sustainable \n     development law''. I hope we in Europe can learn from this \n     ELI work. We too need to go back to legal basics, to--as Bill \n     Futrell suggests--organise laws around human activities. We \n     need to develop pollution laws and resource laws that operate \n     in harmony. This would not only produce a more common-\n     sensible set of laws, it might even decrease the growing \n     tendency to seek complex legal solutions to simple business \n     problems.\n       While speaking of the work of the Institute, I want to \n     acknowledge the help it gave to both the BCSD and the \n     International Chamber of Commerce in these groups' \n     preparations for the Earth Summit.\n       This occassion tonight has been a great pleasure for me--to \n     have been asked by a most prestigious institution to honour a \n     man not only of great prestige, but of great wisdom, warmth, \n     and incisive humour. Maurice Strong told me that whenever the \n     Brundtland commission reached a completely hopeless impasse, \n     Bill Ruckelshaus would begin slowly in his deep growl of a \n     voice: ``Well, you know, this reminds me of the time * * * '' \n     He would tell a funny, carefully considered story; the \n     tension would collapse, and cordial progress would resume.\n       It is a great joy to be here with you all, and it is always \n     a wonderful treat to be in the same room with Bill \n     Ruckelshaus.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, here we are in day four of a partial \nshutdown of the Federal Government, and the only Federal employees that \nare not feeling any pain regarding their paychecks are the Members of \nCongress. We are treated differently, and that is wrong.\n  I know that twice the U.S. Senate passed my no-budget--no-pay \namendment, and we have done it with bipartisanship. We have done it \nwith Senator Dole and Senator Daschle, with the Republican leadership \nand the Democratic leadership. I am very proud of that. Congressman \nDurbin is trying to get this through on the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, and we are very hopeful that will occur. But at \nthis point, it is stymied.\n  I think it is shameful. I think it is embarrassing. I think it is a \nheight of hypocrisy that the Members of Congress, who have caused this \nproblem because we cannot figure it out, are still getting our pay. And \nI am very pleased that Senator Snowe has introduced a bill. We have \nworked on it together, and we are trying very hard to bring it forward \nbecause the other efforts of the Senate are not enough at this time.\n  The problem we face is that one of the amendments we passed is on the \nDistrict of Columbia bill, and that is stuck. The other one we passed \nis on reconciliation, and that is not here yet. We continue to get our \npay while all other personnel--and Senator Harkin pointed this out to \nthe Senate yesterday--are not getting their pay.\n  So I would like to ask unanimous consent that I send to the desk now \nfor its immediate consideration a no budget-no pay bill that will treat \nthe Members of the Senate and the Members of the House exactly like \nFederal employees, and I hope there will not be any objection because \nwe are on record before and I would like to take us on record now in a \nseparate bill because the American people are disgusted with this \nsituation as, indeed, they should be. And, yes, there are colleagues \nwho are giving their pay to charity. There are colleagues who are \nputting their pay in escrow. And some are not even talking about it. \nThat is very, very noble. But that does not address the institutional \nfailure here.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to take up the no budget-no pay bill right \nnow.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, on behalf of \nseveral Senators on both sides of the aisle who were informed on the \nlast vote that would be the last vote and have therefore left the \nSenate Chamber, without commenting on the merits or demerits of the \nproposition put forward by the Senator from California, I will object \non behalf of the Senators who are absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would \nlike to ask the proponent of the unanimous consent request, the Senator \nfrom Indiana objected to taking up the Boxer bill because, he stated, \nthere was an understanding there would be no more votes today. It would \nseem to me that we could take up the Boxer bill with an understanding \nwe would vote tomorrow, or take it up and add it to this list. I wonder \nif the Senator would add the Boxer bill to this list to take up \ntomorrow and we can put a time certain, we can just put an hour of \ndebate on it and vote on it, a half-hour. That would be fine.\n  Mr. COATS. I would just reply to the Senator from Iowa, there are a \nnumber of Senators who have expressed either support for or opposition \nto this legislation. They are not now in the Chamber because they were \ninformed that the Senate essentially concluded its business. I cannot \nspeak on their behalf or add unanimous consent on their behalf without \ncontacting them. And obviously they have left the Chamber.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No one contacted this Senator to ask if it was OK to take \nup these measures tomorrow.\n  Mr. COATS. It was cleared with the minority leader.

Mr. President, I wish to add a few comments to the issue \nthat the Senator from California raised with respect to legislation \nthat would require that Members of Congress and the President be \ntreated in the same manner as those Federal employees whose pay will be \nsuspended during this period of a shutdown.\n  I think we all recognize the hardships this poses to the hundreds of \nthousands of Federal employees across the country. I think at the same \ntime we are experiencing this shutdown, Members of Congress and the \nPresident should have their pay suspended.\n  That is why I have introduced this legislation that complements the \nlegislation introduced by the Senator from California and that is now \npart of the DC appropriations bill. But until such time as that becomes \nlaw, we still have to address this issue with respect to this present \nshutdown and making it retroactive. I just do not happen to believe \nthat we as Members of Congress and the President should be treated any \ndifferently.\n  I regret that we have not been able to bring this legislation up \ntonight so that we have a chance to put ourselves in the same position \nas every other Federal employee. That is what this legislation would \ndo. Interestingly enough, it has the support of 21 Members of this \nSenate, including the Senate majority leader. I worked with the Senator \nfrom California [Mrs. Boxer] on this issue as well.\n  We should be able to bring up this legislation, and we should be able \nto vote on it so that we move in the direction of being in the same \nposition, sharing the same difficulties, the same economic hardships as \nthose individuals who see their pay suspended during this period of \ntime.\n\n  Unfortunately, we do not know how long this shutdown will continue. \nNevertheless, I do not think that we as Members of Congress want to be \nviewed differently, putting ourselves into another group as we are \ngoing through this shutdown. We should not be immune or isolated from \nthose difficulties that Federal employees are now experiencing.\n  That is true for those employees who work in our offices, and I have \n15 such employees who are not working at this moment in time. Why \nshould I not have my pay suspended if their pay is being suspended? I \nthink most of us would agree. So I hope that we will be able to have \nthis opportunity tomorrow to address this issue and to pass this \nlegislation. It is a matter of fairness, and it is a matter of equity.\n  I hope the President signs the continuing resolution that just passed \nin the Senate and in the House of Representatives. But if that does not \nhappen, we still would go on into a prolonged shutdown, and I do not \nthink that we should be getting our pay, not experiencing any \ndiscomfort, while Federal employees who are not able to work and even \nthose who are still not going to be paid at this moment in time.\n  So I urge my colleagues to insist that this legislation be considered \ntomorrow. I appreciate the support that is being given to this issue by \nthe Senate majority leader. In fact, there were 21 of us who sent a \nletter to the Senate majority leader asking for this legislation to be \nconsidered, and he supports that effort. I hope everybody will do so \nbecause this is absolutely essential.\n  I think we are facing enormous difficulties as it is with public \nconfidence in the political process, but I do not think that that \nconfidence should be undermined further by the fact that we are somehow \nin this separate category, somewhat isolated from the problems that \nFederal employees are currently facing. \n\n[[Page S 17195]]\n\n  At the beginning of this year, the first piece of legislation that \nthis Congress considered and, indeed, enacted and signed into law by \nthe President was the Congressional Compliance Act that required \nCongress to abide by the same laws that apply to the rest of this \ncountry. I think that this legislation certainly reaffirms that policy \nand moves us in that direction. It is a matter of fairness. It is a \nmatter of equity. It is right.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleagues, the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from California, in supporting this \nlegislation to have Senators and Congressmen treated the same as all \nother Federal employees.\n  I agree with the Senator from Maine on everything she said but for \none thing. If the majority leader of the Senate wanted this bill up, he \ncould have brought it up tonight. That is the power of the majority \nleader. If the majority leader wanted this up tomorrow, he could have \nincluded it in the unanimous-consent request to bring it up tomorrow, \nand we would vote on it tomorrow.\n  So let us have no doubt about it, it is up to the majority leader \nwhether or not we vote on this or not and no one else on this floor. \nWith that one exception, I agree with everything else the Senator from \nMaine said.\n  She was right, as was Senator Boxer, that earlier this year one of \nthe first bills we passed was a bill to make sure that all the laws \nthat apply to other people apply to Members of Congress. We all \napplauded that, voted for that, that we all live under the same laws. \nPeople cannot understand why we had gone so long without doing that, \nbut we did it. But there was one glaring loophole. When it comes to our \npocketbook, we want to be treated differently than all other people and \nall other Federal workers.\n  As the Senator from California said, there are hundreds of thousands \nof Federal workers who went home today not knowing that they are not \ngetting paid for the work they do. There are others who are not even \ngoing to work and not getting paid. But our pay is automatic. It is \nlike an entitlement. We have an entitlement for our pay. No matter what \nhappens, we continue to get paid.\n\n  We just finished a day of activity here, the last vote of the day. \nThere are five Senators left on the floor. Everybody has taken off. \nThey have gone home secure in the knowledge that no matter what \nhappens, the paychecks we get next Monday will be full. We will get \npaid for every day that we are here.\n  That is kind of a nice thought, is it not, Mr. President? It is kind \nof a nice thought to go home in the evening after a long day's work and \nknow that when your next paycheck comes, you are going to get paid. \nThink about it, think about all those workers, think about our staff \npeople here, think about all the Federal workers, think about the air \ntraffic controllers if you will, Mr. President, who are out there \nworking a very high-stress job, safely guiding aircraft through crowded \ncorridors. It is a high-tense job. It is a job that requires a lot of \nskill, intense concentration, good judgment and decisiveness. Air \ntraffic controllers put in a hard day's work. Just think, Mr. \nPresident, they are going home tonight knowing that next Monday when \nthey get their pay, they will not be paid for the work they did today \nor the work they did yesterday or the work they did the day before.\n  How do you think that works on someone's mind? These are people like \nyou and me. They have homes, mortgages, kids in school and illnesses. \nWe are very smug around here, are we not? We are so smug around here \nbecause nobody can touch us. We get our pay; we do not care what \nhappens.\n  I tell you, I think it is one of the grossest things that is going on \ntoday in Congress and in the Federal Government that we can shut it \ndown, throw all these people out or force people to come to work, so-\ncalled essential people have to go to work but they are not getting \npaid. I thought we did away with slavery in this country. They have to \ncome to work, but they are not going to get paid. It is just not \njustifiable.\n  So I think at least we ought to take up the bill and pass it. It just \nsays if we are not doing our jobs, we do not get paid like other \nFederal workers until this bill passes. Apply the same rule that \napplies to air traffic controllers, drug enforcement agents, Medicare \nfraud investigators, FBI agents, Defense Department personnel--everyone \nelse. Make the same laws apply to us.\n  You wonder sometimes why people in this country are so cynical about \nCongress. Well, you do not have to wonder too long when you see what is \nhappening now. So smug around here, we can do all this. We do not care \nwhat happens. Send all these workers home. Make them come to work. Tell \nthem they do not get paid.\n\n  I see our distinguished majority leader is back on the floor. I think \nwe ought to take up the bill tomorrow and just pass it. I cannot \nimagine any votes against it. Who would be against applying the same \nlaws to us as apply to other Federal workers so we do not get our pay \nthe same way as anybody else in the Federal Government until this \nsituation is resolved?\n  When this goes on, I can understand why people are so cynical about \nthe Federal Government, cynical about Congress. All the good that we \ndid earlier this year in passing that Congressional Accountability Act \nand applying laws to Congress that other people have to live by \nprobably all got flushed down the toilet right now with this kind of \naction, because people know that we are getting paid. Other people \nworking for the Federal Government are not getting paid. It is not \nfair, and I think we ought to take up the Snowe bill tomorrow and pass \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent, if I am not a cosponsor, to be added as a \ncosponsor of that bill. I think we ought to bring it up and pass it as \nsoon as possible. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a minute or two. The \nSenator from Delaware wishes to speak and then the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Pell. Are there any other Members on that side who wish \nto speak? If not, I will put it on automatic pilot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17194-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to comment on \nthe vote that we just had. It seems to me when the vote is 60 to 37, we \npretty much replicated what happened in the House about midnight last \nnight, where 48 Democrats joined Republicans in a bipartisan effort to \nopen up the Government, take the lid off, put people back to work and \nbalance the budget in the next 7 years.\n  It seems to me that is the best of both worlds. I am very proud of \nthat strong bipartisan majority of 60 Senators who stood up tonight for \nour Federal workers and for a balanced budget which will mean a \nbrighter future for our children and our grandchildren.\n  I think we keep losing sight of why we want to balance the budget and \nwhy should we be concerned. I must say, we \n\n[[Page S 17196]]\nhave to keep reminding ourselves, the language we use does not resonate \nbecause we keep talking about balanced budget, CR's, debt ceiling \nextensions, and it does not mean a thing to many people, but their \nchildren mean a lot to people and their grandchildren mean a lot, and \nthat is what this debate is all about. It is not about numbers, it is \nnot about a continuing resolution, it is not about a debt ceiling \nextension, it is not about any of us in this Chamber; it is about \ntrying to do something for a lot of our young people who are going to \nwant to find jobs.\n\n  I must say, as I read the Washington Post editorial again and again \ntoday--because I could not believe it; it was a good editorial--it \ntalked about the real default, the default of leadership on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  I must say, as the Senator from New Mexico said earlier, when you do \na lot of heavy lifting, you get a lot of criticism. We have been doing \na lot of heavy lifting. We believe the American people gave us somewhat \nof a mandate to make fundamental change last November, and we have kept \nour word and our promise. We have worked together, and we have had some \nbipartisan support, just as we have had tonight. So it is not just a \nRepublican effort. We had a number of Senators join us earlier this \nyear on a balanced budget amendment. We lost by one vote. We hope to \nbring it up again.\n  Now, President Clinton says a lot of things at different times and in \ndifferent ways. Yesterday, at a news conference or in a short \nstatement, he mentioned the phrase ``balanced budget'' 16 times, by \nactual count. If the people who watched television last night saw the \nclips of what he has been saying in the last 2 years, he talked about a \n5-year balanced budget when he was a candidate, then maybe 10 years, \nmaybe 9, maybe 8, maybe 7.\n  Now, I think the President could indicate that he is in good faith by \nsigning this bill. There is nothing in this bill that is going to \nhamstring the President of the United States. Nothing commits him to do \nanything, except it says we shall enact a balanced budget amendment in \nthe next 7 years, using CBO estimates--updated CBO estimates--the very \nestimates that President Clinton asked us to use. CBO is the \nCongressional Budget Office, for those who do not understand these \ninitials all the time. But when he first spoke to a joint session of \nCongress, he boasted about using CBO--Congressional Budget Office--\nfigures in his budget and said they had been, as I recall, fairly \naccurate over the years. And they have been accurate over the years.\n  So we are not asking too much of the President of the United States. \nI am not one who advocates shutting down the Government of the United \nStates. I would like to find some resolution, and if we cannot do it \nwith this continuing resolution, maybe we can figure out a way tomorrow \nto resolve the differences.\n  What harm does it do the President of the United States to sign a \nbill that says we will have a balanced budget by the year 2002? He said \ntoday on television that he did not mind the 48 Democrats voting with \nRepublicans last night because it was not binding. Well, if it is not \nbinding on the 48 Democrats, why should it be binding on the President \nof the United States if he signs it?\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues tonight who said to our Federal \nworkers that it is time to go back to work, and said to the President \nof the United States, it is time to balance the budget. Again, I say, \nas I said earlier today, I do not think it does a lot of good to have \npress conferences every day where we say one thing and the President \nsays something else. Why do we not sit down together, without the \npress? We are all adults. I believe the American people are looking to \nall of us for leadership. So the Government has been shut down Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, and it will be shut down tomorrow. Is that enough \ntime? I think it depends on the leadership that we can produce in the \nnext 24 hours. If not, we are going to go into the next week and then \ninto the next week. I do not see much opportunity next week to have any \nresolution.\n\n  So I say, first of all, Mr. President, sign this resolution. It is \nnot a bad resolution. I am told that the only objectionable feature is \nthe balanced budget language, which does not legally bind the President \nof the United States. It seems to me that we may be very close. If the \nPresident would sign that tomorrow, and we send it down tomorrow--and I \nassume we will--then everybody can come back to work on Monday, and we \ncould go on about the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which we hope to \nfinish tomorrow night around 10, 11 o'clock, maybe a little later. And \nthen on Saturday morning, we will take up a conference report or two, \nand then Members could be off with their families for Thanksgiving, as \nmany would like to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17195-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I would like to comment on three items. \nOne, I compliment Senator Boxer and Senator Snowe for their initiative \nto treat us like everyone else; that is, if we are working and other \nFederal employees are working, and they are not getting paid, we should \nnot get paid. Most of the public in our home States do not realize that \nall of us have voted for that already. We voted for that twice already. \nUnfortunately, the House of Representatives has either inadvertently \nor, in fact, refused to bring that up. I will not make a judgment about \nthat. But we have been on record for some time.\n  I think it makes good sense. I just depart from one comment made by \none of our colleagues who supported this initiative. I do not think the \nCongressmen and Senators are smug about this. The truth about this much \nof this is artificial. I have been here for 23 years and although we \nhave never had this extent of a crisis, we have shut down for a couple \nof hours or a day. In every case, it has been standard operating \nprocedure that everybody is made whole. The Federal employees--\neverybody is made whole.\n  So I do not think most of our colleagues thought that this sort of \nstupidity would go on as long as it has. Therefore, I do not think my \ncolleagues sat there and said, ``By the way, I know people like the \nstenographer here, who is working, and I know he is not getting paid, \nand I do not care; ha, ha, ha, he is not going to get his paycheck.'' I \ndo not think anybody thought about that.\n  I want to make this clear. Sometimes, in our zeal, we make it sound \nlike this place is a little more heartless than it is. The truth is \nthat there is an artificial element to this and, in all probability, \nnobody is going to end up losing a cent in this --unless this does go \non for weeks or a month, which none of us wish to happen, and I think \nprobably none of us believe will happen.\n  Now, sometimes we do stupid things. Sometimes ego and pride and \npolitics and partisanship get in the way and everybody wakes up one \nmorning and says, ``My Lord, how did we get here?'' I am hopeful that \nwill not happen. That leads me to my second point.\n  My second point. I have great respect--and I mean this sincerely--for \nSenator Dole, the majority leader. I have served with him and next to \nhim for 23 years now. You cannot be around somebody that long and not \nget some sense of the man, the person. I do not know anybody who is \nsmarter in this place, and I do not know anybody who is a better \nlegislator in this place, or that I have had any better relationship or \ndealings with than him. I make one distinction in what he said. When he \nsaid the President is not bound in any real way if he were to sign the \ncontinuing resolution that the Senate sent to him, and he then \nmentioned the CBO figures, Congressional Budget Office figures--and he \ndid accurately say the President, in the past, had mentioned \nCongressional Budget Office figures. But whether the President said it \nin the past or not, we all say things that turn out not to make so much \nsense sometimes--at least I have. \n\n[[Page S 17197]]\n\n\n  The truth of the matter is that it is important for the public to \nknow not whose figures are right, but just to understand the debate. \nThere is a fundamental difference in the outcome of a balanced budget \nand in how much you have to cut to get to a balanced budget, based upon \nhow rapidly the economy grows or does not grow.\n  Now, the figures are infinitesimally small when you say them. For \nexample, the Congressional Budget Office says the economy will grow, on \naverage, over the next 7 years, at 2.4 percent per year. And along \ncomes the Office of Management and Budget in the executive branch, and \nthey say, no, the economy, over the next 7 years, will grow, on \naverage, 2.6 percent per year. The public up there says, ``What is the \nproblem? What difference does it make which number you accept?'' Well, \nI am not saying who is right. By the way, you know that old joke, I say \nto the former Governor of Missouri, now the Presiding Officer--I am \nsure he has asked a lot of economists about the impact of what happens \nin his State. But it reminds me of that joke that used to go like this: \nGive me a one-armed economist because every economist you speak to, no \nmatter who they are, in their estimates, they say, ``On the one hand'' \nit could be this, and ``on the other hand'' it could be that.\n  I would love to find a one-armed economist who would only tell me \nthis is what is going to happen.\n  Well, back to the central point, the difference between a 2.4 and 2.6 \ngrowth rate in the economy over 7 years is almost one-half trillion \ndollars more that would have to be cut from the Federal spending.\n  Right now if you said to me, I am sitting there and I say ``OK, I am \nPresident''--I am not President obviously--``I am President.'' You say \nto me, ``OK, I will agree to balance the budget in 7 years,'' and I \nlook out there, and I say, ``All right.''\n  By the way, what is the magic? Why did we not say 5 years? Why did \nthe Republican Party not say 5? Why did the President say 10? Why did \nwe not pick 6? The truth is, it is of little relevance in terms of a \ngoal. It is a practical relevance in terms of how much you cut and how \nrapidly you cut.\n  But back to the central point. I am sitting there as President. You \ncome to me and say, ``I have good news. We have signed on to 7 years.'' \nGreat. That is what I say. ``I can do this in 7 years.'' But the \nnumbers they gave us are that we have to balance everything based upon \nthe economy only growing this fast.\n  Mr. President, what that means is those cuts, that $1 trillion in \ncuts you were going to find to balance it over 7 years, you have to \nfind $1.5 trillion. And you say, what does that mean? That means I \neither have to give no tax cut at all or that means I have to make \nmajor cuts in Medicare, or that means I have to make significant cuts \nin education. And for what? For the want of 1 year? For the want of 2 \nyears?\n  I lay you 8 to 5, which is what is disturbing me, the American people \nare way ahead of all of us--the President, the Speaker, the leadership, \nDemocrats, Republicans. They no more believe that we are going to \nbalance the budget in 5 years than 7 years or 7 years than 8. They do \nnot care if it is done in 8 years or in 6 years. They just want to know \nwe are serious and we made a decision.\n  The glidepath of this Government spending over the next decade is \ngoing to be this way--down, and real numbers, real cuts, real changes. \nThat, I agree, there is a mandate to both parties on that. But do you \nthink anybody who sits home and says, ``Well, I have been thinking this \nover. I listened to that debate in Congress, and my grandchildren are \ngoing to be put in serious jeopardy if we do this in 10 years instead \nof 7. This means the health and welfare of my granddaughter.''\n  Do you believe anybody thinks that? What they are sitting home saying \nis ``God, all those guys and women down there, all they do is talk. \nThey keep promising balanced budget amendments. I do not believe they \nwill do it any time.'' That is what they really say about us all.\n  The truth is, I have been here 23 years. I have never seen a time--\nand I say this with total sincerity--where the overwhelming majority of \nthe Members of this body have done anything other than agreed we have \nto balance the budget, and mean it.\n  I introduced a balanced budget amendment in 1984 that got nowhere. I \nam a Democrat that voted for the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. I have introduced on four occasions--four occasions--entire \nplans to balance a budget, knowing I am not President and I am not the \nleader, but for illustrative purposes. I tried with Senator Grassley \nback in the 1980's to freeze all Government spending, including Social \nSecurity, including everything.\n\n  The truth is the last election did one thing. I do not know whether \nit really made you guys a majority party for long. I do not know. We \nwill find out. I know one thing it did. What it did was it made sure \nthat there was nobody left on the left in my party who, in fact, said \nwe do not care about moving the budget toward balance.\n  These folks mean it. We all mean it. The public knows we mean that. I \nthink they look at us and say, ``You are all being kind of childish.''\n  For example, I bet--and I should not say this because I do not know \nwhether the Senator from Missouri, the Presiding Officer, would agree--\nI bet I could find 20 Members at least on the Republican side of the \naisle if I were in charge of this outfit--and I am not--we could sit \ndown and say, ``Here is the deal. You guys want a balanced budget in 7 \nyears and you want CBO numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do \nnot want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as \nmuch as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you \nwant.''\n  So we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference \nbetween the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB figure of 2.6. Take 2.5--that \nis $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a \nbigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is \nall we need--not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on \nthat.\n  You have to make a deal on taxes, too. As much as you want to help \nwealthy folk, and I want to help them, too, tell them to wait until the \nend of the line. We will not give them anything. We will not raise \ntheir taxes, but we will not give them a tax cut.\n  Just those gross numbers--by the way, also make a deal, satisfy the \nPresident. Do not do this in 10 years. Do it in 8 years. Do not do it \nin 7--you give a year, we give up 2 years.\n  Do you think the American public will go home and say, ``Boy, they \nall sold out. Boy, they all do not mean this. Boy, that is ridiculous. \nBoy, my grandchild is now in real jeopardy. Boy, my child's future I \nborrowed against now another 18 months''? I think they would say they \nare finally acting like mature adults.\n  I respectfully suggest, to go back to the original point I made, the \nmajority leader said, what difference does it make whether it is CBO or \nOMB? Let me tell the difference. That is like saying to me, ``Joe, you \ngot to forge this creek, the Ardent Creek. You have to forge it, and it \nis 43 feet wide where the rapids are, and you have a hook at the end of \nthe rope.''\n  It makes a difference whether you give me a 48-foot rope or you give \nme a 38-foot rope whether I can get across that creek. If you give me a \n38-foot rope, I cannot make it without getting awful wet and put in \ndanger. Give me a 48-foot rope I can throw that sucker across, hook it \naround the tree, and have no problem bringing myself across.\n  That is the fundamental kind of difference between these numbers. \nThese numbers are real. They make a difference.\n  I might add, the DuPont companies of the world, the Fortune 500 \ncompanies of the world who all of us say are better at estimating what \nwill happen than we, they all say the growth rate will be about 2.9 \npercent per year. They say we will have $1 trillion difference from \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office says.\n  Let me say, if you ask whether I accept a DuPont Co. economist or a \nFederal bureaucrat's economist, I tell you where I go, this Democrat. \nIf you ask whether I take an economist from Maryland National Bank or \nfrom the Chrysler Corp. in my State, I know which I would take. I would \ntake the private sector guy.\n\n  What I am told is--and I may be wrong, but I do not think I am--I am \n\n[[Page S 17198]]\n  told the blue chip analysis, that is taking all the blue chip companies \nwho have analyzed what the growth rate is going to be, the consensus is \nit is going to be about 2.9 percent per year.\n  I will tell you what. If we agree to their numbers, I can balance the \nbudget and not cut Medicare and not hurt education and not make the \nchanges I do not want to make and I can do it in 5 years.\n  This makes a difference. It makes a difference what numbers you pick. \nLike I said, it is like that rope. You tell me I have to get across a \n40-foot creek with rapids and if I slip in the rapids I go over the \ndam, and you give me a 30-foot rope, I have a problem. You give me a \n50-foot rope, I can do it. So the difference here is the length of the \nrope we are giving the President.\n  I will conclude by saying the Presiding Officer is the only \nRepublican in the Chamber--and by the way I am not suggesting anybody \nelse should be in the Chamber. All reasonable people are home at 10 \nminutes to 10 at night, and I do not know why I am doing it, because I \nam not sure that the four people in here, who are kind enough to be \nlistening to me, are listening. But I would respectfully suggest the \nfollowing.\n  The reason why a guy like me is a little bit suspect of the \ninsistence on the CBO numbers is--I will be real blunt with you --I \nbelieve this is more than about balancing the budget. I believe this is \nabout eliminating programs, or drastically changing programs that the \nRepublican Party, understandably and defensibly, historically has not \nliked.\n  But it can be cloaked in balancing the budget now. Because if you \ngive me the 30-foot rope, I have to get rid of education. I cannot pull \neducation across that creek with me on my back. I cannot take Medicare \nacross that creek with me on my back. I cannot take a lot of things \nacross there--baggage that some of my friends on the Republican side, \nand some Democrats, do not think we should be doing anyway.\n  So I think what the President should do--presumptuous of me to \nsuggest what the President should do. But, if the President called up \nand asked me tonight, Joe, what do you recommend about this? I would \npick up the phone and I would call Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich and I \nwould say, Fellows, look, come on down. Let us have a cup of coffee. \nAnd I would promise Newt could sit at the head of the table. I would \nlet him sit behind my desk. And I would say, Here is the deal. Let's \nmake a deal. Let's split the difference on the numbers, not between the \nprivate sector, but the two Government bureaucrats who said what the \nnumbers were. Split the difference and let us split the number of \nyears. I will take off 2, you add 1. And let's get back to work, and \nthen let us fight about the details, which is what appropriations bills \nare about.\n  I hope we do that. I am not suggesting my particular formula, I say \nto the Presiding Officer. I am not so presumptuous as to say that is \nthe only way to do it. But I do know one thing. Legislation is the art \nof compromise, not weakness, compromise, because we have very divergent \nviews.\n  I have come to know a bit more about the Presiding Officer. He and I \nhave divergent views on a number of issues, but I truly respect him. \nAnd I think he respects me. There is no reason why we could not work--I \nhave to give something. You are never going to agree with my \nphilosophy. I am never going to agree with yours, on the whole. So we \nhave to give something.\n  I do not mean to paint it--I would like it if the Senator from \nMissouri and I could settle this, but I know neither one of us are in \nthe position to do this. But the larger point is simple. I think it is \ntime for us to sort of--I was going to say act like grown-ups. That \nimplies they have not been. I think it is time to say, OK, everybody \nhas made the point. Let us get back to work. Let us split the \ndifference on these things. Because the truth of the matter is, if the \nPresident agreed to an 8-year balanced budget with CBO numbers, or OMB \nnumbers, does anybody believe that means he is less committed to \ngetting to a balanced budget? He locks himself to a balanced budget on \nthose terms.\n  So the issue is not if. The issue is how. I think we could settle \nthis quickly. I hope we will do it.\n  My colleagues are here. I will not do it tonight, but I was going to \nmake a statement, and I will do it tomorrow, on a third point. That is \nMr. Helms'--and I love Senator Helms--outrageous, in my view, holding \nup of the START Treaty and holding up the Conventional Weapons Treaty. \nBut I will save that for another moment. Maybe the Senator would be on \nthe floor, because I would rather deal with him on the floor. As my \ncolleagues know, I never say anything that references another Senator \nwithout telling him first. It is nothing derogatory, but I hope he will \nreconsider. We are about to lose the START Treaty, and that is the \nthing that eliminates all those Russian missiles that could be aimed at \nus again.\n  My colleagues are waiting to speak. I thank my colleagues and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from October 23 to November 3, 1995, the \nUnited States was host to an intergovernmental conference convened \nunder the auspices of the U.N. Environment Programme to adopt a Global \nProgramme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from \nLand Based Sources of Marine Pollution. My colleagues know that I have \nlong had a strong interest in the protection of the environment, and in \nparticular of our oceans. In fact, in 1973, legislation was enacted \nthat I introduced to create the position of Assistant Secretary of \nState for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific \nAffairs. I was pleased that the Congress and the President agreed with \nmy strong feeling that increased cooperation with respect to the \nprotection of our oceans be given greater focus and visibility at the \nState Department.\n  As far back as 1977 I introduced a resolution that required countries \nto conduct environmental impact assessments before carrying out \nactivities that might impact the environment of another country or of a \nglobal commons area. The U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) was to be \nthe recipient of these impact assessments and in July 1995, I \nintroduced Resolution 154 calling on other nations to adopt a similar \napproach. UNEP has retained its key role in the protection of the \nenvironment worldwide and the Washington Conference on Marine Pollution \nwas but the latest example of its ongoing efforts to encourage all \ncountries to cooperate in the protection of the environment.\n  This Conference was convened as a result of the U.N. Conference on \nEnvironment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. It \nrecognized the fact that more than 80 percent of marine pollution \noriginates from terrestrial sources and its aim was to ensure that all \nthe Parties would coordinate their efforts in trying to reduce such \nsources of pollution. The two outcomes of the Conference were the \nGlobal Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment \nform Land-Based Activities, adopted at the end of the Conference, and \nthe Washington Declaration, which was adopted by its high-level \nsegment. Both the Programme of Action and the Declaration complement \nthe legal regime set up by the Law of the Sea Convention which was \nsigned by President Clinton and is still pending before the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to an article published \nin the Washington Post on November 4, 1995, which highlights the risks \nnow weighing on our oceans and the need to take urgent action. I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be included in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have always been a very strong supporter \nof the Law of the Sea Convention because it sets up a new Constitution \nfor the Oceans and because it is the perfect tool to put an end to such \ndestructive measures as ocean dumping and other forms of direct \npollution. In that respect, the Law of the Sea addresses the marine \nsources of oceans pollution. The Washington Conference aimed to \n\n[[Page S 17199]]\ncomplement this approach by addressing the impact of terrestrial, and \nindirect, sources of marine pollution. The Programme of Action adopted \nby the Conference contains a series of practical steps that governments \ncan adopt, while the Washington Declaration provides us with a \nframework to further our international cooperation.\n  At the national level, countries can, and should, restrict negative \nimpacts by better and stronger regulation of sewage discharges and by \ncontrolling the production and use of pesticides, fertilizers and other \npersistent organic pollutants that are known to cause considerable \ndamage to marine life. At the international level, cooperation needs to \nbe increased, with a view to imposing more stringent controls on the \nmost dangerous of substances, such as DDT, PCBs, and other persistent \norganic pollutants. The Washington Declaration recognizes this by \ncalling for the development of a global legally binding instrument for \nthe reduction or elimination of persistent organic pollutants. At this \nstage, it is still unclear what form such a treaty should and will \ntake, but it is of the utmost importance that the United States become \nan active participant in these negotiations.\n  By definition, marine pollution is a global problem, and while it \ncannot be solved by individual nations, we all have a responsibility to \ncooperate in attempting to save our oceans. The United States has \nalways been at the forefront of similar efforts in the past and we \ncannot shrink from our responsibilities in these times of crisis. The \nLaw of the Sea Convention and the Washington Programme of Action are \nthe two vital instruments through which we can finally put an end to \nthe excessive pollution of our oceans. This is a chance for the United \nStates to prove that it really intends to address and solve the very \nimportant issue of marine pollution by ratifying the Law of the Sea \nConvention, by implementing the Programme of Action in earnest, and by \nbecoming a leader in the negotiations of a treaty on the regulation of \npersistent organic pollutants.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          Experts Seek Global Treaty On Toxic Ocean Pollutants\n\n                             (By Gary Lee)\n\n       Alarmed by rising levels of pollution in the world's \n     oceans, a conference of environmental experts from 102 \n     countries yesterday called for new global controls on the use \n     of DDT and 11 other toxic chemicals that are often discharged \n     into waterways.\n       The Washington gathering, sponsored by the United Nations \n     Environment Program (UNEP), urged industrial and developing \n     countries to negotiate a global treaty restricting the spread \n     of a dozen persistent organic pollutants, a group of \n     industrially produced chemicals that frequently wind up in \n     oceans and other water supplies. Participants in the two-week \n     meeting, which ended yesterday, approved a program of action \n     that included the call for a treaty.\n       Persistent organic pollutants were targeted for more \n     stringent international regulation because they are highly \n     toxic, remain in the environment for long periods and can \n     spread thousands of miles from the point of emission, \n     conference delegates said.\n       After accumulating in fish and other marine mammals, such \n     chemicals work their way through the food chain and may \n     eventually be consumed by people. They can cause severe \n     health problems, said Clif Curtis, an adviser to the \n     international environmental organization Greenpeace. Studies \n     have linked some of the compounds to cancer, neurological \n     damage and defects of the reproductive system and immune \n     system in various animals, including humans. Creatures \n     occupying positions near the top of the food chain--such as \n     fish that eat smaller fish, marine mammals, seabirds and \n     humans--are at greater risk of such effects because more of \n     the toxic substances accumulate in their tissues. Greenpeace \n     advocates a worldwide ban on the production and use of \n     persistent organic pollutants.\n       The campaign for new restrictions on the chemicals is part \n     of a growing movement to save the oceans, considered by many \n     environmentalists to be the world's last under-regulated \n     biological frontier, from further degradation.\n       ``The oceans of the world are interdependent,'' Vice \n     President Gore told the gathering in a speech this week. \n     ``The only way to stop the degradation of marine environment \n     from land-based activities is to share the solutions.''\n       ``If we're going to take the cleanup of the oceans \n     seriously, [persistent organic pollutants] must be banned,'' \n     said Salef Diop, an adviser to the Senegalese environment \n     ministry and delegate to the conference.\n       While the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty and other \n     international agreements regulate ocean dumping and other \n     forms of direct pollution, the UNEP conference focused on \n     restricting land-based activities that indirectly contribute \n     to the pollution of oceans--such as the use of organic \n     pesticides that are washed into rivers and end up in the \n     ocean.\n       The conference pointed out in its recommendations that \n     individual countries can help fight ocean pollution through \n     national policies, such as the reduction of sewage discharges \n     and control of pollution from nonpoint sources like farmland. \n     Land-based activities are responsible for 80 percent of ocean \n     pollution, according to Magnus Johannesson, a senior \n     environmental official from Iceland.\n       The substances pinpointed by the conference as requiring \n     more stringent controls include the pesticides DDT, \n     toxaphene, chlordane, heptachlor, endrin, aldrin, mirex and \n     dieldrin, as well as byproducts of industrial combustion such \n     as dioxins, furans, hexachlorobenzene and the group of \n     chlorinated substances known as polychlorinated biphenyls \n     (PCBs). Although dozens of other chemicals pose a threat to \n     oceans, these 12 are most widely used and most toxic, \n     according to environmentalists.\n       After controls are in place, others could be added to the \n     list if scientific consensus indicates that they are harmful \n     to marine life, conference delegates said.\n       The U.S. has already moved to ban the use or spread of many \n     of the compounds, but at least two--chlordane and \n     heptachlor--are still produced by American companies for \n     export abroad, Clinton administration officials said.\n       Although banned in the United States in 1972, DDT is still \n     widely used in India and some other developing countries to \n     protect crops against insects. Heptachlor and toxaphene are \n     also used heavily in some countries.\n       Safer alternatives exist, but some research will be needed \n     to determine whether they can be substituted cost-effectively \n     in those countries that still rely on chemicals that end up \n     as persistent organic pollutants, conference delegates said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17198-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17199-S17200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE EXECUTION OF KEN SARO-WIWA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last Friday, amid the strong protests of the \nAmerican and British Governments and countless human rights \norganizations, the Nigerian Government executed Ken Saro-Wiwa, a noted \nauthor, environmentalist and human rights activist, and eight of his \ncolleagues. I must say that these executions represent a flagrant \nviolation of human rights and I am outraged. These executions reflect \nthe refusal of the brutal regime of General Abacha in Nigeria to abide \nby the most basic international norms. Moreover, such actions deserve a \nswift and harsh response from the U.S. Government.\n  Since seizing power in a military coup in June 1993, General Abacha \nhas systematically eliminated any perceived rival by intimidation, \nlifelong imprisonment and most appallingly, by means of execution. Mr. \nSaro-Wiwa and his eight colleagues now join the ranks of Nigerians whom \nthe Abacha government has successfully silenced. Despite these brutal \ndeaths, I am confident that the causes for which these leaders died \ncannot, nor will not, be destroyed.\n  Ken Saro-Wiwa spent much of his life fighting against the military \ngovernment and the rampant pollution of the land and water in his home, \nOgoniland, caused by unregulated oil production. Threatened by his \npersistent and popular campaign, the Nigerian Government charged Ken \nSaro-Wiwa and his colleagues for the murder of four pro-government \nactivists. The State Department and human rights groups report that Mr. \nSaro-Wiwa was nowhere near the murder scene and was denied a fair \nchance to defend himself. Further, there is evidence that witnesses \nwere paid to testify against Mr. Saro-Wiwa. Topped with a military \ntribunal appointed to try the case, Ken Saro-Wiwa never had a chance.\n  Mr. President, Nigeria is a critically important country for United \nStates interests in Africa. Nigeria has made significant contributions \nin the course of regional and international affairs, such as its \ninvolvement in restoring peace in Liberia, in resolving the regional \ndrug issue, and last year's commutation of the death sentence to life \nimprisonment for General Obasanjo and other alleged coup plotters.\n  This latest action, however, undermines international and American \nconfidence in General Abacha's announced transition to democracy. The \nimpact of Nigeria's problems, inflicted primarily by the Abachan \nregime, threatens to extend throughout West Africa, harming the \npolitical and economic prospects of its neighbors. General Abacha's \nrefusal to heed the calls of the international community, including \nthose made from these chambers, \n\n[[Page S 17200]]\ndemonstrates his unwillingness to engage in quiet diplomacy. Humane \nprinciples and a commitment to democratic ideals compel us to respond \nforcefully to the Abachan regime. While the Clinton administration has \ncalled on the United Nations to consider an embargo on sales of \nmilitary equipment to Nigeria, Congress should consider taking the lead \nin identifying and enacting strong measures that hurt the Abachan \nregime.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude with reiterating my outrage \nat General Abacha and his regime's complete disregard for basic human \nrights and international legal standards. I believe that relations \nbetween our two countries cannot be normalized until the appalling \nabuse of human rights, especially toward the Ogoni people and their \nleaders, comes to an end.\n  Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly. And I want to be brief \nbecause I know the pages are anxious, and so is the Presiding Officer. \nBut I would like to speak for a moment on the continuing resolution, \nthe debate that was just concluded, and make a few brief comments about \nit. And then I will file a more expansive statement at a later time.\n  Mr. President, this is the third day of the Government shutdown, and, \nquite frankly, this is a disgraceful way to conduct the people's \nbusiness.\n  The Government is shut down because, in my opinion, macho posturing, \npique, and those things are being substituted--attitudes and old \ngrudges are being substituted--for substantive debate and serious-\nminded search for compromise.\n  And we are here also because this Congress has not done its work. \nOver 6 weeks into this fiscal year, and only four appropriations bills \nare now law. Most of the bills are stalled here in Congress, not \nbecause of disputes over funding levels and philosophical debates, and \nthe like, but frankly because of the efforts by the majority party to \nattach unrelated riders that are designed, in some instances, to erode \nwomen's right for choice, or to deregulate pollution, or to cut away \nworkers' collective bargaining rights.\n  So we have to resort to a continuing resolution. This continuing \nresolution that we just passed funds the Government for roughly 5 \nweeks. It also calls on Congress and the President to balance the \nbudget in 7 years.\n  Frankly, that provision does not belong in the bill. That issue \nshould be left to negotiations between the President and the Congress \non the permanent budget, not on this temporary, partial budget.\n  That was, however, why I supported the amendment offered by the \nminority leader. And, frankly, that is why I supported the amendment \noffered by the majority leader. But, quite frankly, it was the wrong \nplace. Quite frankly, also, Mr. President, there is nothing \nparticularly magic in 7 years. What is important is the objective. What \nis important is meeting our obligation to leave our children something \nmore than a legacy of debt. And what is important is balancing the \nbudget in a way that helps both individual Americans and our country \ngenerally.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can balance the budget while not \nundermining health care for the elderly or for the poor, without \npushing millions of children into poverty, and without denying access \nto a college education to additional millions of young Americans.\n  I think it is possible to balance the budget over 7 years in a way \nthat will make the future brighter for our children and that will help \ncreate prosperity for all of us. I hope the parties will seek and find \ncommon ground with that in mind.\n  We have to reduce Federal deficits, but there are other objectives \nthat cannot be forgotten. We cannot just on the one hand transfer costs \nfrom the Federal balance sheet to the balance sheets and the budgets of \nAmerican families. We cannot cut back on essential investments in areas \nlike education on which our competitiveness and, therefore, our \neconomic strength, security, and wealth ultimately depend. We cannot \nmake cuts that  close more doors to more Americans who are already \nanxious about their futures, and who are very hard pressed because, \nwhile the cost of achieving the American dream is rising, their incomes \nare not.\n\n  Mr. President, this continuing resolution is not a balanced budget \nplan. It simply buys Congress and the President a little more time to \nproduce a plan. It is all too clear that we need that time because the \nbudget priorities reflected in the reconciliation bill that we will act \non tomorrow are clearly mistaken, in my opinion.\n  That reconciliation bill contains a foolish $245 billion tax cut. And \nI think one of my colleagues responded by saying to talk about a tax \ncut at a time that you are talking about reducing the deficit and \nbalancing the budget is like announcing that you are going on a diet \nand asking someone to pass the dessert.\n  Even though the President has cut the deficits in half over the last \n3 years, given the scope and the extent of our deficit problem, this is \nnot the time for a tax cut. I add, Mr. President, parenthetically with \nregard to the specific parts of the tax cut--and I serve on the Finance \nCommittee--there is nothing objectionable--well, there is little \nobjectionable--about the tax cut with the specific ingredients in it. \nBut, quite frankly, the tax cut is very much like a chicken in every \npot, the oldest political ploy in town, to give a little bit of \nsubstance to the constituents. It could not come at a worse time. The \ntiming and context is wrong. I believe it does not belong as part of \nreconciliation when we are talking about balancing the budget and \ncutting protections that are vitally dear, if not vital to Americans.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation bill that we are going to take up \ntomorrow unnecessarily jeopardizes the elderly, the poor, the children, \nand students by asking them for a hugely disproportionate share of \nbudget savings that the bill requires over the next years 7 years while \nat the same time protecting tax expenditures, and many other business \nsubsidies and loopholes from the clever.\n  I believe we need a new plan, one that meets the needs of ordinary, \nhard-working Americans, and one that embraces opportunities for \nAmericans in the future rather than diminishing them. What we need to \ndo, therefore, in my opinion, is to end this temporary budget crisis, \nand to put the Government back to work.\n  What we need to do is to defeat the reconciliation bill tomorrow, and \nvote against it, because we have to, given the technicalities of it, \nact on it before we can get to the compromise. Kill the reconciliation \nbill tomorrow, and go back to work on a more balanced, more fair, and \nmore workable budget plan that does not treat millions of Americans as \nexpendable people.\n  Most of all, we need to act to meet our obligations to the American \npeople by crafting a budget based on their needs, and that is based on \nthe American priorities of all of our community, a budget built on the \nproposition that people's futures--and not just abstract accounting \nnumbers--is what is really at stake here.\n  We have a chance to define ourselves as one community, to recognize \nthat we are all in this together, and to fix our budget problems by \nsharing the sacrifice and addressing our collective needs as Americans. \n\n\n[[Page S 17201]]\n\n  Mr. President, this Congress can decide to be like so many corporate \nCEO's, laying off millions of Americans, discarding them, and ignoring \nthe contributions that they have made in the past, and that they can \nmake in the future. Or, we can recognize the truth--that our only \npermanent asset lies in the talents and the abilities of our people--\nand we can construct a budget that helps Americans utilize their \ntalents, and create wealth for all of us today, as well as for \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, in that case, I believe the choice is obvious. I hope \nwe will commit to coming together to find a common ground, and to \nrecognize that we are indeed all in this together, and we need to have \na budget that reflects that.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/16/senate-section/article/S17200-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
