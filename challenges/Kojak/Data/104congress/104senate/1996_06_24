Before the problems pile up and the demands of the day hit \nus, we deliberately stop to commit our way to You, to trust in You, to \nrest in You, and wait patiently for You. Nothing is more important than \nbeing in an honest, open, receptive relationship with You. Everything \nwe need to be competent leaders comes in fellowship with You. We are \nstunned by the fact that You know and care about us. We are amazed and \nhumbled that You have chosen us to bless this Nation through our \nleadership. In response we want to be spiritually fit for the rigorous \nresponsibilities. So, we turn over to Your control our personal lives, \nour relationships, and all the duties that You have entrusted to us. We \ntrust You to guide us. We seek the source of our security and strength \nin You. We will not run ahead of You or lag behind but will walk with \nYou in Your timing and pacing toward Your goals. You always are on time \nand in time for our needs. May the serenity and peace that we feel in \nthis time of prayer sustain us throughout this day. We thank You in \nadvance for a great day filled with incredible surprises of sheer joy. \nIn Your all-powerful name.

Today there will be a period of morning business until the \nhour of 2 p.m. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes \neach. At the hour of 2, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1219, \nthe campaign finance reform bill. There will be no rollcall votes \nduring today's session of the Senate, and under the consent agreement \nreached last week, a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill, \nS. 1219, will occur at 2:15 tomorrow.\n  Senators are reminded that in accordance with rule XXII, first-degree \namendments may be filed until 2 p.m. today and second-degree amendments \nmay be filed until 12:30 on Tuesday.\n  This week the Senate will also resume consideration of the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. I hope the Senate will complete action \non this bill as early as possible this week.\n  Also, we are continuing our efforts to reach some agreement with \nregard to the consideration of the small-business tax measure and the \nminimum wage legislation. I wish to emphasize that we hope to get an \nagreement on that and complete action on the DOD authorization bill and \nmove to the DOD appropriations bill.\n  In order to achieve that, it is going to take a lot of cooperation \nfrom all the Members, all the Senators, between the two leaders, and \nthose who have amendments to offer. So I emphasize once again that we \nhave to move forward on the DOD authorization bill. The chairman will \nbe working on that. Senator Thurmond, from South Carolina, and Senator \nNunn, the ranking member, are intent on moving this legislation \nforward.\n\n  I have tried to be considerate of the Senate and the Members' desires \nto have an opportunity to have supper with their families, have \nreasonable hours, but from what I saw last week and what I experienced, \nI do not know if we can continue that. We are going to make progress on \nDOD authorization on Tuesday and Wednesday. If it means staying late, \nwe are going to do that.\n  Again, I want to be sympathetic and cooperative with Members on their \nschedule demands and their desire to be with their families, but if \nthey do not respond in kind, then I, like previous leaders, have no \noption but to force the Senate to stay late to do its work.\n  Senators should expect a busy week this week with votes throughout \nthe day every day, including Friday, and there will be, as I said, \nrollcall votes maybe into the evening in order to get the work done as \nnecessary.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to reach the unanimous-consent \nagreement with regard to the consideration of campaign finance reform \nlegislation. I think it is legislation that deserves an opportunity to \nbe debated. We will have that opportunity this afternoon and in the \nmorning, and then we will go to a cloture vote at 2:15.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6677-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6677-S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I thought this would be a good time \nto remind my colleagues of the unfinished business that is still \nwaiting to get done.\n  As we head toward the Fourth of July and another recess, we also need \nto remember that the days to take action in Congress are running out. \nIt is not only late June, we also have very few days of legislative \nsession left.\n  Will this be the Congress remembered only for what it did not get \ndone? Will this be the Congress that spent all of its time and millions \nof taxpayers' dollars only on camera-filled hearing rooms to learn \nabout the White House Travel Office and to turn every pebble over on \nWhitewater?\n  Instead, this should be a Congress capable of doing something about \nthe day-to-day struggles of hard-working Americans. But to produce, we \nneed some basic steps taken. The calendar needs to be pulled out, votes \nscheduled, final agreements reached, and work completed.\n  I think of three actions that will help millions of Americans, \nincluding West Virginians.\n  No. 1, it is time to wrap up the Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance \nbill. Members from the other side of the aisle are determined to \ninclude something called medical savings accounts. I might add that I \nhear absolutely no clamor for MSA's from constituents, beyond employers \nthat are thinking about using this device as a substitute for the \nhealth insurance they now subsidize for employees.\n  But the key point is that the heart of Kennedy-Kassebaum involves \nchanges that will make sure insurance is there for people when they \nreally need it. When they need coverage for the very illness or \ncondition that is now labeled a pre-existing condition. When they need \ncoverage, but have to change jobs and now find their insurance \ncanceled.\n  These are the changes that affect millions of Americans, and many, \nmany West Virginians. This is the work we need to get done before this \nsession of Congress runs out.\n  No. 2, this Congress still has the time to enact welfare reform. This \nis an area begging for reason and common sense. No one is going to get \nexactly their way on something as complicated and contentious as \nchanging the welfare system. But it is not hard to figure out what \nAmericans expect from us. They want to know that welfare is not a haven \nfor avoiding work, responsibility, and the rules that most hard-working \ncitizens play by.\n  The Democratic leader has just laid out another detailed plan, known \nas Work First Two, that reflects exactly what we need to do on welfare \nreform. It is a tough, no-nonsense plan to require adults to work or \nprepare for work. It does not make a point of punishing innocent \nchildren, who have done nothing wrong.\n  It is time to move away from politics, rigid positions, and posturing \non welfare reform. The President has proven he will not sign a bill \njust because of its label. We should not waste any more time on \nlegislation that belongs to one faction or simply rubber-stamps what \nsome Governors have asked for. We need to work out our differences, and \nproduce the bill that will turn welfare into a last-resort--for the \nsake of poor families and the hard-working taxpayers who want reform.\n  Finally, I find it shameful that this Congress has still not been \nable to enact an increase in the minimum wage. And I want to elaborate \nsome on this subject, because it is so important to the people of my \nState.\n  A few weeks ago, the Washington Post ran an article telling us that \nthe CEOs of major companies got a 23-percent raise in their \ncompensation in 1995. According to the consulting firm of Pearl Myers & \nPartners, the average salary of a CEO was $991,300 with the remaining \nin stock options and bonuses. Twenty years ago, the top CEO earned \nabout 40 times as much as the typical worker. Today, that same CEO \nearns 190 times as much.\n  We know from study after study, town meeting after town meeting back \nhome, that wages for most other Americans are stagnant and that most \nworkers have every reason to feel insecure about their income, their \njobs, and their health insurance. The people who work 8 hours every \nday, making products and providing needed services, deserve a living \nwage. They should not be left behind. The gap between the rich and the \npoor continues to polarize the country into the haves and have-nots, \nand that is downright un-American.\n  As others have already said, whatever economic tide that is rising \nseems to be lifting a lot of yachts, and not much that carries the rest \nof Americans. Working families today are making less than they did 20 \nyears ago. Look at what has happened to a single worker over those 20 \nyears. He or she has watched the collapse of communism, voted in four \nPresidential elections, seen computers become a part of every day life, \nand watched the stock market rise over 5,000 points. For the worker \nrelying on the minimum wage, his or her most recent paycheck is worth \nless than the first one in purchasing power.\n  And some wonder why hard-working American families feel left out of \nthe American dream? The stagnation of wages over the past 20 years is \nobvious to parents struggling to pay their bills.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues who still do not support a minimum \nwage increase to listen to this: When adjusted for inflation, the \ncurrent Federal minimum wage of $4.25 an hour is worth 27 percent less \nto workers and their families than that amount in 1979. Measured in \n1979 dollars, the minimum wage is only worth $3.10 an hour. A minimum \nwage worker earns $8,840 a year. This is not a living wage, in fact, it \nis barely a sustainable wage. Even with an expanded earned income tax \ncredit, earning $4.25 an hour does not lift a family out of poverty.\n  No matter what the opponents say, minimum wage earners are not a \ncollection of teen-age burger-flippers. Sixty-nine percent of all \nminimum wage earners are adults over the age of 21. Women make up 60 \npercent of all minimum wage workers and are usually a single parent \ntrying to keep their families together. These workers are playing by \nthe rules, paying rent, utility bills, health care premiums, food and \nclothing for their families. They are working long and hard hours, and \nthey do not want to slip into welfare and dependency.\n  They deserve our admiration, our respect, and they deserve a raise.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, over 100,000 workers would get a \nraise if we pass the Democratic amendment to raise minimum wage to \n$5.15. Almost 24 percent of West Virginia's work force would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage--about one out of four workers.\n  Let me share the story of just one woman in West Virginia. When her \nhusband was injured in the mines and denied disability coverage, she \nwent to\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nwork to support her family. The only job she could find was a minimum \nwage job at a lumber yard located miles away from her home. The work \nwas hard, and after 9 months she broke her ankle on the job. Her family \nincome last year was only $8,500. While on workers compensation, the \nsection where she worked at the lumber yard closed and her job was \neliminated. Now, both of her teenage sons are working to help support \nthe family. Imagine trying to support a family of four on such a small \nincome. But this woman just wants another job as soon as her physician \nallows her to go back to work.\n  This West Virginian deserves a raise--and if we raise the minimum \nwage to $5.15, and her family gets their full earned income tax credit, \nthey will be lifted out of poverty.\n  It is a sad day in America when we do not help a West Virginia family \nthat works hard to raise their children above the poverty line.\n  We in Congress have the ability to bring badly needed relief to this \nfamily and about 12 million workers in America. We should come together \nin a spirit of decency and common sense, restore some glimmer of hope \nfor these families, and raise the Federal minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage has not been raised for 4 years, but the prices of \neverything else, from rent to food has gone up each and every year. \nRaising the minimum wage is essential to help families and reinforce \nthe fundamental American values of hard work and self-sufficiency.\n  And we all know that solely raising the minimum wage is not the \nsilver bullet that will erase the gross inequity between the haves and \nhave nots. Nor, will this act alone restore the economic vitality of \nworking Americans that deserve so much more from the society they \ncontribute to. But it is a simple, important, obvious step in the right \ndirection to reward and encourage work. It tells hard-working American \nfamilies that we value their right to a decent life.\n  Mr. President, it is long past the time when the U.S. Senate should \nget the chance to vote for an increase that is shamefully overdue.\n  I conclude by reminding everyone listening how little time there is \nleft to get anything done that is relevant, meaningful, and helpful to \nhard-working Americans. But there is still the time to take three \nbasic, important steps that deal directly with what weighs on the minds \nand shoulders of families in West Virginia, in Mississippi, from \nCalifornia to North Carolina.\n  The bipartisan Kennedy-Kassebaum bill--a bill with the most basic \nhealth insurance reforms should get settled and enacted, now, this \nweek, immediately.\n  Welfare reform, drawing on plans from both sides of the aisle, should \nget worked out, put into final legislative form, and sent to the \nPresident in a form that he can sign in good conscience--in a form that \nwill make welfare dependency something to avoid and work something \nexpected.\n  An increase in the minimum wage, the most basic and decent step we \ncan take for millions of Americans who are doing everything possible to \nwork, avoid welfare, and be productive citizens.\n  If my colleagues want to continue endless hearings on what fascinates \nthem about 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, so be it. But just a little time, \nsome modest leadership, and some amount of attention to the calendar \nmust go into producing something for the people who are waiting for \naction that makes a difference in their lives.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in my 22 years here in the Senate, I have \nhad a chance to witness many historic events in this Chamber. When I \nleave the Senate, I hope to write a book about some of these.\n  One of the truly historic events was a speech given by our former \nmajority leader, the senior Senator from Kansas, Senator Dole. I think, \nMr. President, that there will be historians who read the Record of \nthat event; but in reading the Record they will read only the words. \nThey will not really see the event. I would like to add, for those \nhistorians who may read that, that at the time Senator Dole gave his \nspeech, most of the Republicans and most of the Democrats were on the \nfloor.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, when Senators speak, even though we \nmay all be on the floor, ofttimes we do not listen. This was an \nexception. Every single Senator on the floor listened, and listened \ncarefully. They heard a speech that was vintage Bob Dole--plain, to the \npoint, with flashes of the humor that we know so well. Even when he was \ncorrected by the then distinguished Presiding Officer, the President \npro tempore, when the President pro tempore spoke of his around-the-\nclock filibuster, Senator Dole ad libbed, ``And that is why you are not \noften invited to be an after dinner speaker.''\n  There is far more than just humor in that there is real affection \nfrom Senators of both parties--affection for a man who earned it. He \nearned it as one of the finest Senators I have had a chance to serve \nwith. I have been here with great majority leaders, such as Senator \nMansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Mitchell and, of \ncourse, Senator Dole. I was thinking how good it was to be in a Senate \nled by Senator Dole on the Republican side and Senator Daschle on the \nDemocratic side. It is not just his leadership, but his role as a U.S. \nSenator that earned him respect and affection from both sides of the \naisle.\n  I began serving on the same committee with Bob Dole when I came here \nas a junior member of the Agriculture Committee. I watched how he \nworked with Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern, as well as key members \non the Republican side, on nutrition matters--school lunch, school \nbreakfast, and food stamps. After Senator McGovern and Senator Humphrey \nwere gone, it fell on me to pick up our side of the aisle on that.\n  Throughout the years, there were a number of Dole-Leahy and Leahy-\nDole amendments on nutrition that passed. I have worked with him on \nmajor farm bills. This last one was the Dole-Leahy-Lugar farm bill in \nthe Senate.\n  When Senator Dole was ready to leave the Senate, I went to see him, \nand I spoke to him and told him that it had been a privilege to work \nwith him and that there were an awful lot of people who were fed--\nhungry Americans--because of legislation we were able to work on \ntogether.\n  It certainly was not just me, by any means. I think of another giant \nin the Senate, Pat Moynihan, who stood in the well of the Senate, with \nSenators milling around, and had a conversation with Senator Dole. It \nwas in the early 1980's when we thought the reform of Social Security \nwas dead. Senator Moynihan said to Senator Dole, ``Let us try one more \ntime.'' And because the two of them worked first on what was best for \nthe country--not necessarily what was best for each other's political \nfuture or the future of the parties--and they worked in a nonpartisan \nfashion, they saved Social Security. It required two Senators of that \nstature, with respect on both sides of the aisle, to do it, and \nSenators who were willing to put everything else aside.\n  So much will be written during this year, and each of our parties \nwill support our nominee for President. No matter which way the \nPresidential election comes out, the country should understand that it \nbenefited by Senator Dole being in the Senate. I say this as a Member \nof the other party. I hope that all Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, will realize that the Senate itself is bigger than any one \nof us. We owe a duty not just to our political fortunes, but to the \nU.S. Senate and to help be the conscience of this great Nation. We have \nto work together, first and foremost, for what is best for the Nation, \nnot each other.\n  I salute the good Senator, my good friend, Senator Bob Dole, and I \nwill miss him here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1219, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1219) to reform the financing of Federal \n     elections, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the subject of today's debate is \nostensibly campaign finance reform. It is currently fashionable to say \nthat all of our ills as a nation are caused by incompetent \nofficeholders--or worse, politicians who have been bought by special \ninterests through the process of campaign contributions. So we are \ngathering to debate a bill that is supposed to fix that.\n  Who can possibly be in favor of a system like that? To some, this \nshould be an easy vote. Destroy the status quo. Anything would be \nbetter. So I am in favor of destroying the status quo, Mr. President, \nbut I reject the idea that anything will be better, and particularly \nthe bill that is before us.\n  I believe there is at stake here an issue that is far more \nfundamental than campaign finance reform. Perhaps without realizing it, \nwe are dealing with the most crucial political questions that any \nsociety can confront, issues that were confronted and resolved by those \nthat we now refer to as the Founding Fathers.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I wish to deviate from the direct bill in \nfront of us long enough to move this debate into a context that goes \nback to the Founding Fathers.\n  I begin with the writings of James Madison, commonly called ``the \nfather of the Constitution.'' His work, along with that of his fellow \nVirginian, Thomas Jefferson, is now on display in the National \nArchives, America's most hallowed document, our political scriptures, \nif you will: the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the \nBill of Rights.\n  However, today I am not going to be quoting either from the \nConstitution or the Bill of Rights, both of which were products of \nMadison's genius, but rather from what has come to be known as the \nFederalist Papers, a series of political tracts written during the time \nthat the Nation was debating the ratification of the Constitution. At \nthat time, there were many people who were afraid of the impact the \nConstitution would have on their existing Government, and to allay \nthose fears, James Madison, along with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, \nset forth the clear statement of the intellectual and philosophical \nunderpinnings of American Government.\n  It has added relevance to the debate on campaign finance reform \nbecause in the 10th of this series of publications, that which has come \nto be known as the 10th Federalist, Madison addressed the fundamental \nquestion of what to do about what we now call special interests.\n  The 18th century word for ``special interest'' was ``faction,'' so I \nwill use the terms ``faction'' and ``special interest'' \ninterchangeably.\n  Quoting now from the 10th Federalist, I give you Madison's definition \nof what a faction is. Faction:\n\n       . . . a number of citizens . . . who are united and \n     actuated by . . . common impulse of passion or . . . \n     interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens.\n\n  I can think of no better description of a special interest than that \none.\n  Madison then tells us, ``There are two methods of curing the \nmischiefs of faction: * * * removing its causes'' or ``removing its \neffects.''\n  He then tells us, ``There are again two methods of removing the \ncauses of faction: * * * by destroying * * * liberty'' or ``by giving \nto every citizen the same opinions, the same passions and the same \ninterests.''\n  Appropriately, Madison then describes the first remedy, that is, the \ndestruction of liberty, as ``* * * worse than the disease.'' I think \nall Americans would agree with this. Controlling the mischiefs that \ncome from special interests by destroying the basic liberty that \nguarantees each American his or her own right of opinion would destroy \nthe very basis of the Nation in which we live.\n  Now, referring to the second way of dealing with factions, that is, \n``* * * giving to every citizen the same opinions * * * passions * * * \nand interests,'' Madison says, ``The second * * * is as impractical as \nthe first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues \nfallible * * * different opinions will be formed.'' He summarizes, \n``The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man.''\n  Again, Mr. President, no contemporary writer could place the \nsituation more precisely than Madison has. Special interests arise \namong us because we are free, and, as long as we are free we will \ndisagree to one extent or another.\n  Madison continues. He says, ``The inference to which we are brought \nis, that the causes of faction cannot be removed * * * and that relief \nis only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.'' He then \ntells us, ``* * * relief is supplied by the republican principle.''\n  Now, by using the word ``republican,'' Madison is clearly not \nreferring to the modern Republican Party. He is differentiating between \na democracy and a republic as a governmental form. He says, ``The two \ngreat points of difference between a democracy and a republic are, \nfirst, the delegation of the government in the latter, to a small group \nof citizens elected by the rest. Secondly, the greater number of \ncitizens * * * over which the latter may be extended.''\n  Referring to the greater number of citizens that are governed by a \nrepublic, he tells us why this will defeat the pressures of special \ninterests. Quoting, ``The influence of factious leaders may kindle a \nflame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a \ngeneral conflagration throughout the other States.''\n  I will say more about this in a moment, but for now it is his point \nof the difference between the democracy and a republic which I wish to \nstress. In a pure democracy, every decision is made by the vote of \nevery citizen; in a republic, as Madison says, ``The delegation (goes) \nto a small number of citizens elected by the rest.'' It is this \nrepublican form of government that the Constitution gives us and under \nwhich we have lived for well over two centuries.\n  Now, since the representatives in our Republic are freely elected, as \ncontrasted to those who were chosen by the Communists to serve in the \nRepublics of the old Soviet Union of Republics, modern commentators use \nthe term ``democracy'' to describe us, and if we interpret the word \n``democracy'' to mean a system where everybody gets to vote, I have no \nobjection to that term. However, as a description of governmental \nstructure, applying the term ``democracy'' to the United States is a \nmisstatement.\n  What does all this have to do with campaign finance reform? In my \nview, it has a great deal to do with it. Campaign finance reform is \nabout the power of special interest groups--factions--and how to \ncontrol that power, the very subject of the 10th Federalist paper.\n  Let us take modern tools of communication and insert them into the \nmodel that Madison gave us. For instance, is it now possible for a \nmodern special interest or faction to create a conflagration \nsimultaneously in several States? Given the wide reach of television, \nnational publications, the Internet, the answer is clearly yes. A \nspecial interest group, be it a labor union, an environmentalist group, \na business alliance or a religious association, now possesses the \nmeans, if it can raise the money, to reach every citizen in the country \nvirtually simultaneously without regard to any political boundaries or \ngeographical boundaries that might exist. Examples of this are all \naround us.\n\n  First, various religious organizations calling themselves the \nChristian Coalition have banded together, and by using the outlets of \ncommunication available to them in both churches and the media, in 1994 \nput out a common message to all of those who are adherents to those \nparticular denominations. They greatly influenced the outcome of the \nelection that year, and\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nthey have promised to repeat the process in 1996.\n  Second, the National Rifle Association sent broad mailings and \npurchased advertising time on the electronic media to make sure that \neveryone who agreed with their views with respect to gun legislation \nwould be stimulated to go to the polls and support candidates of the \nsame mind.\n  Third, the AFL-CIO has publicly announced that by increasing the \ncompulsory dues levied on their members, they are going to raise at \nleast $35 million, which will be spent in an effort to guarantee that \ncandidates who support their political agenda will be elected to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1996.\n  And finally, on an issue perhaps closer to home for me as a Senator \nfrom Utah, recently groups of environmental supporters concerned about \na bill relating to land use in Utah, which was introduced by members of \nthe Utah delegation, purchased full-page ads in the major newspapers in \nmajor cities all across the country urging an outpouring of \ncommunication to Congress seeking defeat of this particular \nlegislation. They were successful in creating a filibuster in the \nSenate that saw the bill go down.\n  Madison's statement that ``the influence of factious leaders may \nkindle the flame within their particular States but will be unable to \nspread a general conflagration throughout the other States'' is clearly \nno longer true. That means we must return to the other ``great point of \ndifference between a democracy and a republic'' of which Madison \nspeaks, namely, ``the delegation of the government to a small number of \ncitizens elected by the rest.''\n  It is through this device primarily that we must now find hope for \nprotection against the tyranny of a pure democracy where a faction able \nto temporarily gain a majority position can then ride roughshod over \nthe interests and opinions of all the other citizens in society.\n  I realize that when he talks about the republican principle, Madison \nis talking about officials after they take office, but the same \nprinciple applies to campaigns. We do not vote in campaigns as a pure \ndemocracy, deciding every issue. Instead, we choose among Madison's \nphrase a ``small number of citizens'' who have offered themselves to \nserve in public office. Through a process of conventions or primaries \nor both we winnow this number down to the final choice. It is done \nthrough a democratic process, but it is an example of the republican \nrepresentative principle nonetheless.\n  The rhetoric we are hearing about campaign reform flies in the face \nof this preference for a republican principle. The more we limit the \namount of money that is available to candidates--those who will be \nrepresentative once they are in office--the more we weaken the \nrepublican principle and strengthen the hand of special interests. This \nis particularly ironic in view of the calls for this kind of reform in \nthe name of weakening the power of special interests.\n  Envision the following: Assume a congressional district with \ncandidate A and candidate B, under strict spending limitations. This \nmeans that each has a limit on the amount he or she can tell the voters \nabout his or her position on particular issues. The special interests, \non the other hand--the labor unions, the environmentalists, the \nChristian Coalition or the NRA--have no such limits, which means that \nthe voters can and presumably will be bombarded with information coming \nexclusively from those groups and aimed at influencing their vote.\n  Exercising their first amendment right of free speech, the special \ninterests will never have limitations placed upon them, nor should \nthey. The first amendment is too precious. But in the name of campaign \nfinance reform, we will create a situation where the voters will \nreceive proportionately less and less information from the candidates \nand more and more information from the special interests, so the voters \nwill ultimately make their choices on the basis of which special \ninterest message is the most persuasive. The candidate's intellect, \ntraining, character, and talent will all become secondary if not, in \nthe end, lost altogether in the elective process. The Republican \nprinciple of representative government will be weakened and washed \naway. Officeholders will become more and more insignificant.\n  We have a clear example of how this can happen in the current \nworkings of the electoral college. That is an institution that is so \narcane that very few of our citizens even know that it exists. But the \nFounding Fathers intended to have the electoral college work this way: \nVoters in the individual States would pick outstanding citizens in \ntheir States to represent them in the process of choosing a President. \nIf the electors were unable to produce a majority for any one \nindividual, the choice would then move to the House of Representatives. \nIt was anticipated in the time of the ratification of the Constitution \nthat the election of a President by Members of the House of \nRepresentatives would be a frequent occurrence if not, indeed, the \nnorm.\n  Today, even the names of the electors let alone their opinions or \nqualifications, are virtually unknown to the voters, most of whom think \nthey are casting a vote directly for one Presidential candidate or the \nother. The power of the Presidential candidate to reach over the heads \nof the electors and appeal directly to the voters is so strong that the \nelectoral college has become virtually a dead letter. Indeed, there are \nnow laws on the books in a number of States that prohibit the electors \nfrom exercising their own judgment as the Founding Fathers had intended \nthat they would. I am not here to call for reform of the electoral \ncollege. But I give this as an example of what can happen when the \nqualifications of the individuals become overwhelmed with advertising \ndollars that go to the point on which the individual is supposed to \nvote.\n  If, in the name of campaign reform, we set up a circumstance that \nlimits the ability of a candidate to raise and spend his or her own \nmoney, therefore limiting that candidate's ability to put forth his or \nher own positions, we weaken the ability of the candidate to stand up \nto a special interest. When we say to a candidate, ``If you disagree \nwith the position taken by the AFL-CIO, or the Sierra Club, or the \nChristian Coalition, or the trial lawyers, or the NRA, or whatever, you \nhave only a limited number of dollars available to make your case; \nwhile they, on the other hand, can say whatever they want, without \nlimitation, about you and your position.'' That is not a fair fight. \nThat puts the candidate who would be the constitutional representative \nat a serious disadvantage as opposed to the special interest. That is \nnot the position that Madison laid out for the American people as he \ndescribed the Constitution, and it is not the kind of fundamental \nchange in our political life that we should be pursuing here.\n\n  I can hear the question now. ``All right, Senator Bennett, thanks for \nthe civics lesson, the political science lecture. If you do not like \nthis bill, what proposals do you have to try to clean up the influence \nof special interest money in America?''\n  I have a proposal. It is not in the form of legislation, but can be \nreduced to legislation as soon as I feel I have stirred up enough \nsupport for it. I believe in the power of full disclosure. I would \nsupport measures that would eliminate all limitations on candidates to \nraise and spend money, as long as those candidates were open and candid \nin disclosing to the voters where that money came from. I would extend \nthose disclosure requirements to the special interests. At least with \nthe AFL-CIO, we know where the money comes from. It comes from their \nincreasing the levy on their members. That very fact has produced an \nissue in itself, as people have complained that their money is going to \nsupport candidates that they themselves do not support. That kind of \ndebate is healthy.\n  The more people know where the money comes from, the better off we \nare going to be in our political discourse. We do not know where all of \nthe money that supports Common Cause comes from. They are immune from \nthe kind of disclosure that candidates have to meet. We do not know the \nexact nature of the contributions that keep open the doors of the \nChristian Coalition. They, too, are immune from the kind of disclosure \nrequirements that candidates have to meet. We do not know the extent to \nwhich\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\npeople on the payrolls of these organizations show up in campaigns to \nperform services on behalf of the campaign, either for or against the \ncandidate involved. I do not condemn any of these activities. They are \nfree, proper expressions of one's rights under the Constitution. But I \nsay the way to limit the power of special interests in our political \nprocess is to open the door of disclosure upon those special interests, \nto maintain and increase, if necessary, the full disclosure \nrequirements on candidates, but leave the candidates free to raise and \nspend whatever money they need to defend themselves against the money \nthat is raised and spent against them, directly, by the special \ninterests.\n  If we are to preserve the principles laid down by Madison and his \ncontemporaries, we have the right to know more about the inner workings \nof factions than we do now. As long as modern communications have made \nthem major players in the political game, they should be treated as \nsuch and brought under the appropriate kinds of sunshine requirements \nthat we have decided as a Nation that we want our candidates to live \nunder. They should not be given a free ride while the candidates, who \nneed to protect themselves against the pressures from these special \ninterests, are held back with artificial and, in my view, tremendously \nunwise limitations.\n  For these reasons, then, I would support an elimination of all \nlimitations on candidates' fundraising and candidates' spending, with \nfull and solid disclosure requirements, making sure that voters knew \nwhere that money came from, and then applying the same principle, no \nlimitation on spending but full disclosure on those special interests \nthat seek now to gain unfair advantage by virtue of the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I am sure in the course of this debate I will have plenty of \nopportunity to expound further on this theme, so I will leave it at \nthat and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I paid close attention to Senator \nBennett's remarks. I must say I agree with him on several of the issues \nthat he raised concerning campaign finance reform. Really, what this \nissue is going to be all about, to start with, Mr. President, is not \nabout whether we can improve and make better proposals for campaign \nfinance reform; the question is, are we going to have it? That is going \nto be embodied in the cloture vote tomorrow. If we cannot cut off \ndebate, we know that this issue will be shelved for the near term.\n  If we do invoke cloture, then Senator Bennett will propose his \namendment, which he said he could quickly transform into legislation. I \nwill be glad to consider it; I will be glad to debate it, and I hope \nthat Senator Bennett, and others who think that this proposal is less \nthan perfect, which indeed it is less than perfect, will seize the \nopportunity to vote in favor of cloture, and then we would have \nunlimited amendments to the bill.\n  If we do not invoke cloture, then clearly the Senate has to move on \nto other business.\n  Mr. President, I am not despondent, but I am not optimistic about our \nchances of getting 60 votes. I am not sure whether we will or will not. \nI continue to hope so. I hope Members and, more important, the American \npublic will pay attention to this debate. I talked to several of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle who are very aware of the \npolitical ramifications of filibustering campaign finance reform. But I \nalso understand that the odds may be against it.\n  Let me point out that if the challengers were voting today instead of \nthe incumbents, I think the outcome might be very different. Let me \nshow you one of the reasons why. In 1995, this is what the FEC \nreported, and I am sure the numbers are the same for 1996: $59.2 \nmillion contributed by political action committees to incumbents; $3.9 \nmillion to challengers.\n  We can talk about the Federalist Papers, we can talk about Monroe and \nMadison, and, by the way, we will be talking about constitutional \nscholars, including the Congressional Research Service, who have stated \nunequivocally that this proposal is constitutional.\n  But, Mr. President, no one--no one, no one, no one--can allege that \nwe have a level playing field today when these kind of contributions \nhave been made in favor of incumbents. By the way, that is not for \nDemocrat incumbents, it is not for Republican incumbents; it is for \nincumbents, and it is wrong and we know it is wrong. It needs to be \nfixed, and the American people want it fixed, and it should be fixed.\n  After being in a 10-year battle on the line-item veto, I know it is \ngoing to be fixed. It may not be this year, it may not be next year, it \nmay not be the year after, but it is going to be fixed, because you \nhave to believe the American people will be heard.\n  Mr. President, according to two pollsters, most widely respected \npollsters in America:\n  When asked: ``Which of the following do you think really controls the \nFederal Government in Washington?'' registered voters responded:\n\n  The lobbyists and special interests, 49 percent; the Republicans in \nCongress, 25 percent; haven't thought much about this, 14 percent; the \nPresident, 6 percent; the Democrats in Congress, 6 percent.\n  When asked: ``Those who make large campaign contributions get special \nfavors from politicians * * *'' respondents said that this is:\n  One of the things that worries you most, 34 percent; worries you a \ngreat deal, 34 percent; worries you some, 20 percent; worries you not \ntoo much, 5 percent; worries you not at all, 3 percent.\n  Sixty-eight percent of the American people, according to this poll, \nsaid in response to the question, ``Those who make large campaign \ncontributions get special favors from politicians * * *.'' Sixty-eight \npercent of the American people said that it is one of the things that \nworries them most or worries them a great deal.\n\n  When asked: ``We need campaign finance reform to make politicians \naccountable to average voters rather than special interests . . .,'' \nvoters stated this was:\n\n  Very convincing, 59 percent; somewhat convincing, 31 percent; not \nvery convincing, 5 percent; not at all convincing, 4 percent; and don't \nknow, 2 percent.\n  Later in this debate, I am going to show other polling data which \nshows that the approval rating of Congress is at a very impressive 19 \npercent approval, 71 percent disapproval, and I will show other polling \ndata that show, despite what some of my colleagues may feel, that this \nis an important issue with the American people, it is something they \nbelieve needs to be changed, and they do believe that it is a \ncorrupting influence in the Congress.\n  I am not alleging that it is, Mr. President, but I am alleging that \nthe belief is out there and the lack of confidence in our political \nsystem over time can be devastating to democracy.\n  There are a lot of editorials that we will be submitting for the \nRecord, 261 editorials from 161 newspapers and publications, urging \nsupport for campaign finance reform. These editorials have been \npublished since January 1, 1995. Some of these are very good, and some \nof them not so good. Some of them, I think, are very illustrative.\n  Let me quote one from the East Oregonian. I do not want to talk too \nlong in this particular round, because Senator Feingold, Senator \nWellstone, and others want to talk. This is from the East Oregonian, \nSeptember 31, 1995:\n\n       They're still out there, these folks the press keeps \n     calling the Perot voters. This even though most PV's don't \n     have much use anymore for the eccentric, unpredictable \n     zillionaire who stabbed his followers in the back when he \n     withdrew from the 1992 Presidential campaign and goofily \n     reentered the race. Let's not call them Perot voters anymore, \n     let's call them disgusted voters, DV's.\n       Like some of the things Perot addressed, they are still \n     waiting for another politician to pick up the ball, and if \n     that means a third party movement, so be it. DV's are \n     Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, all \n     religious and ethnic groups. What is unique to them is not \n     their views on Federal spending, foreign policy or social and \n     environmental issues. What they all hate is the legal \n     corruption corroding American politics, the corruption that \n     comes from special interest money falling from corporations, \n     unions, associations and coalitions into political action \n     committees and then funneled into campaign coffers. The final \n     results are committee and floor votes that don't have much to \n     do with conscience or constituents' needs. That linkage of \n     votes with money is what disgusts voters more than any single \n     issue.\n\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to quote from a number of these editorials as \nthis discussion and debate goes on this evening and tomorrow.\n  I first want to take a moment to thank my colleague from Wisconsin, \nwhich I should have done at the beginning of my remarks. My colleague \nfrom Wisconsin has been dedicated, he has been zealous, and he has been \ntotally cooperative. I am proud to not only work with him on a \nprofessional basis but, as we have worked on other reform issues, I \nconsider him a good and dear friend. More important, I am pleased that \nwe have in the Senator from Wisconsin a person who is dedicated to true \nreform and one whose entire career has been hallmarked by a forthcoming \nand very honest attitude toward the people of his State and this \ncountry. I am pleased to be able to work with him on this and other \nissues as I have.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, if we had voting challengers today, if \nleading challengers who have won the primary would vote today, I know \nwhat the vote would be, because I hear too many of them, when they run \nfor Congress, say, ``As soon as I get there, we're going to clean this \nup, we're going to give the challengers a chance.''\n  I know of no objective observer of the political process today who \nbelieves that there is a level playing field between incumbent and \nchallenger, and this is ample evidence of it. As we go through the \ndebate I will provide much more evidence.\n\n  As I said, we can quote from the Federalist Papers. We can quote from \ndifferent ones of our Founding Fathers. I could quote from different \namendments of the Constitution. There is one part of all these \nimportant documents that I would cite to my friend from Utah; and that \nis ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal,'' equal, equal. There is no equality in the political system \ntoday for people who are challenging.\n  Everybody talks about the great turnover in 1994, how so many \nincumbents were thrown out, and there were so many new faces. Do you \nknow, Mr. President, 91 percent of the incumbents who sought reelection \nwere elected in 1994? There is a wonderful editorial here from the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer that talks about a tale of two incumbents and \nshows why the campaign finance system must be fixed and how it could \nbe. Mr. President, I will go into that later on.\n  I am going to go into details of our proposal also later on. We will \ntalk about the constitutionality of it. But I do not want us to lose \nfocus in this debate about what this debate is all about. It is not \nwhether several of the compromises that Senator Feingold and I made in \norder to make this a bipartisan issue are the best or not. It is not \nabout whether, frankly, we should limit the contributions to 60 percent \nof contributions or 60 percent of contributors in-State.\n  What this debate is all about--and we cannot lose the focus on it--is \nthat a lot is at stake here, Mr. President. And what is at stake is the \ncredibility, the credibility of the Congress of the United States that, \none, the best qualified people are elected to office, and, two, once \nthey are there, that they act in the interest of the American people. \nIf you accept this polling number and polls I have heard all over the \ncountry, that is not the case, and we have a significant problem.\n  I will repeat again, when asked if those who make large campaign \ncontributions get special favors from politicians, 34 percent of the \nrespondents thinks it worries them most, 34 percent thinks it worries \nthem a great deal. And 59 percent of the American people find it \nconvincing that we need campaign finance reform to make politicians \naccountable to average voters rather than special interests.\n  Mr. President, the average voter in America thinks they are not \nlistened to here in Washington, DC. I have to tell you, from my 14 \nyears experience here, in some cases they are right.\n  So, Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I know my friend from \nWisconsin, and others, including Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, want \nto talk. I appreciate the opportunity. I hope the American people will \ncall upon their elected representatives to bring about this much-needed \nand fundamental change so we can restore confidence in our most \nimportant institutions and perhaps remove the cloud of cynicism that \npervades America today. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  It is very good to be here on the floor with the Senator from Arizona \nand to finally have a chance to debate S. 1219, the campaign finance \nreform bill.\n  I first want to return the compliments from the Senator from Arizona. \nI appreciate the kind words. I think everyone in the Senate and \neveryone in the country knows this would not be happening today, \nwhether we win or not, this would not be happening today if there were \nnot an independent-minded Senator from Arizona who feels so \npassionately about campaign and other reforms in this country that he \nis willing to take both the compliments and the lumps that go with \nleading a bipartisan effort, which he has done.\n  It has been a pleasure and will continue to be a pleasure because we \nintend to win this, hopefully tomorrow, but if not, as the Senator from \nArizona said, the American people will win this issue when some control \nis finally exerted over the obscene amount of money that is now \ndominating the political process.\n\n  I also want to mention, Mr. President, the new Senator from \nTennessee, one of our main coauthors, Senator Thompson, whose \nperspective and help has been very helpful and very useful throughout \nthis process, and especially, of course, the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, who, in my mind, is the most focused reformer in \nthis entire body. You name the issue, I think he is most likely to be \nthe first person in line to say, let us reconnect the political process \nbetween elected representatives and the people back home, rather than \nthe special interests.\n  We also have had wonderful help from the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, and Senator Graham from Florida, Senator Murray from \nWashington, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, and others.\n  We cannot talk about this bipartisan effort without reminding \neverybody it has been a bicameral effort. Even more uncommon in the \nCongress than a bipartisan effort is having the two Houses have \ncooperation. And there the Representative from Washington, Linda Smith, \nand others, have been very helpful in making this an effort that the \nAmerican public has recognized. It did not hurt either that the \nPresident of the United States took the care in his State of the Union \naddress to specifically endorse this effort, this bipartisan effort, as \nthe way to go. And all of this has helped us move forward.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank the new majority leader for \nletting this bill come up. It is not the way I wanted it to come up. We \ndid not want to have to start off by having 60 votes just to get the \nball rolling. But it is sure better than not having the chance to \ndiscuss it at all. I do appreciate that and look forward to the process \nof hopefully ending up with a successful vote tomorrow at about 2 \no'clock.\n  But let us set the record straight, Mr. President, about what this \nbill is about. The first statement by the Senator from Utah certainly \nlaid out one view of what this is about. But let us clear one thing up \nnow. And I know we are going to have to clear it up over and over \nagain. This bill has no mandatory spending limits that requires every \ncandidate to only spend a certain amount. It has a voluntary incentive \nsystem.\n  You will hear this red herring over and over again because the \nopponents of this bill want you to think that this bill creates \nmandatory spending limits even though we all know that such limits \nwould be unconstitutional under the decision in Buckley versus Valeo. \nSo let us remember that. The bill does not have a mandatory limit on \nhow much a candidate can spend. No matter how many times you are led to \nbelieve that is what it does, it is just not true. It is not in the \nbill. It is not the McCain-Feingold bill that we have before us.\n  Rather, Mr. President, what we are offering today in hopes of \nrestoring the lost faith and confidence of the American people is \nsomething very different.\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\n We are hopeful the Democrats and Republicans can come together and \ndemonstrate to the American people our willingness to restore some \nelement of integrity to the political process. So the proposal we have \nhas different goals than that suggested by the Senator from Utah.\n  Our goals are as follows. We try to reduce the flow of money in the \nelectoral process that has become dominated by dollars and cents rather \nthan issues and ideas. We try to end the perpetual money chase on \nCapitol Hill by somehow allowing current office holders to spend less \ntime raising the requisite campaign funds and more time fulfilling \ntheir legislative duties and obligations.\n  Mr. President, those are important things but they are not the core \nof our proposal. The core of our proposal, the very heart of this \nlegislation, is, for the first time, to provide qualified candidates \nwho are not millionaires, and who are not able to amass colossal war \nchests and do not have access to the extensive net worth of well-heeled \ncontributors with an opportunity to run a fair and competitive campaign \nfor the U.S. Senate. That is what this bill tries to do. It tries to \ngive most Americans, which includes those who are not \nmultimillionaires, most Americans, a fighting chance to be a part of \nthis process, that they were born and taught to believe was their \nright. That is what this effort is about.\n  Our current campaign system is heavily tilted in favor of a \nprivileged few. If you have access to large amounts of campaign funds, \nthen our current system is great for you, it accommodates you. If you \nare a millionaire and are able to contribute your own personal wealth \nto your campaign without having to participate in the endless cycle of \nattending fund raisers and soliciting contributions, then our current \nsystem is good for you, too.\n  But, Mr. President, if you are not an incumbent and you are not worth \nseveral millions of dollars, and even if you have a wealth of \nexperience and ideas, and even a large base of grassroots support, the \nsad truth is that such candidates are automatically labeled long shots \nunder the standards set forth under the current election system.\n  Why is this, Mr. President? Why is someone who may have served as a \ncity council member, who may have been a police officer or a \nschoolteacher, who believes in public service and holds an ambition to \nrepresent their particular community, why is such a person in America \nautomatically labeled a ``long shot,'' making it so very difficult to \nget credibility?\n  The answer is very simple, Mr. President. The answer, Mr. President, \nis money. Money has become the defining attribute of congressional \ncandidates in this Nation. If you have money, you are considered a \nserious contender; if you do not have money, you get stamped on your \nhead the phrase ``automatic long shot.''\n  I tell you what happens when someone declares their candidacy for the \nSenate in this country. They are not asked about the issues very much. \nThey are not asked that much about what level of support they have in \ntheir home States. Maybe at some point they will be asked that. Those \nare not the questions that first greets either a real candidacy or a \nplanned candidacy. The question that they are greeted with has become \nthe determining question in American politics. The determining question \nin American politics, Mr. President, is, ``Hey, where are you going to \nget the money? How are you going to raise all the money? How much time \nwill it take? How much do you have to raise every week in order to be a \nviable candidate?'' Most of us have had these questions thrown at us \nwhen we first ran.\n  If you have the money, you are welcomed into our system with open \narms. You are considered a credible candidate, and your pursuit of \nelected office is considered, right away, to be a tenable goal. But if \nyou do not have the money, it is an entirely different reaction. Such \ncandidates are usually shunned by the political establishment, labeled \nlong shots, and entered into an electoral arena where chances of \nupsetting high finance candidates parallel their odds maybe of being \nstruck by a lightning bolt or winning the Powerball lottery.\n  Our campaign should be a discourse between candidates of differing \nperspectives. Instead, we have a system that is the equivalent of a \nhigh-stakes poker game, where only those players with the ability to \nante up are truly invited to sit at the table and join the game. It \ndoes not matter what sort of experience you have or what your positions \nare or what ideas you can bring with you. It is all about your ability \nto put up big money on the table and ante up. That is really what this \nbill is about, Mr. President. It is not an effort to prevent people \nfrom participating in the process. It is just the opposite. There are \nno mandatory spending limits, as is suggested by the opponents of the \nbill.\n  But we have another problem. That is, Mr. President, that a lot of \npeople think it just cannot happen. I had this experience in talking to \neditorial writers and constituents. They think this can never happen. \nWe have seen this before, whether it is partisan or bipartisan. It does \nnot matter whether it is after major electoral changes. It does not \nmatter that people think they have heard this song before and it just \ncannot happen, that Washington can never clean itself up in this \nregard. I admit this issue has been very difficult to alter. What is \ndifferent this time is that we have a bipartisan effort. Maybe the \npolls in the past have shown the people do not rank this real high on \ntheir list. However, as the Senator from Arizona says, that is \nchanging.\n  Maybe the reason it was not so high on the list before was this sense \nthat it could not happen. I remember the same attitude about the \ndeficit issue. When I first started talking about the deficit in 1990 \nand 1991, the consultants would say nobody cares about that. The public \ngets bored, they get glassy eyed on that issue. After a while, people \nrealized that was a central issue. The same thing happens here. Maybe \nit has been tough to get this issue going because it is not easy to \nunderstand. It is not as easy as the effort that Senator McCain, \nSenator Wellstone, and I all made on the gift ban. That was so easy. \nAll you had to show was that people could get free golf trips all over \nthe country and there was not much more to explain. It is awful hard to \nvote for that. But this is worse. This is even worse than the gift-\ngiving system that we finally cracked down. I think there is reason to \nbelieve that we can win tomorrow and reason to believe that we will \nwin, whether tomorrow or in the near future.\n\n  There are many reasons, but I thought the vote we had in 1995 on the \nfloor of the Senate was a little clue. That was when the former \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, came to the floor to move to table an \namendment I had brought up to simply say that campaign finance reform \nought to be considered. I would have thought we would have lost that \nvote. The majority leader usually won, almost always won on those kind \nof votes. We had 13 or 14 Members from the other side who came over and \njoined us to make sure it got on the agenda. Unfortunately, of course, \nit took us almost a year to actually get out here and have a bill come \nup, but it has finally happened.\n  How do I know this issue is stronger than it was in the past? When I \ngo to my counties around the State to town meetings for listening \nsessions, I usually make an introductory statement --keep it short, \nbecause people have been told I will listen to them; I only give myself \n5 minutes like I give everyone else. I found this year when I merely \nsaid the words to my constituents, I have signed on to a bipartisan \nbill concerning campaign finance reform, even before people knew who I \nsigned on with or what the bill did, there was tremendous applause in \nthe room. Many times I just get blank stares after I speak. This got \nmajor applause and response every time, because people are fed up. We \nhave reached the time when this bill and this issue will come to \nfruition.\n  I want to say--all of us have this same feeling who have cosponsored \nthis bill--this is not our perfect bill. It is not the perfect bill for \nthe Senator from Arizona or the Senator from Minnesota. I introduced S. \n46 in the first day of the 104th Congress. That was a lot closer to \nwhat I would prefer, the Feingold bill. It included public financing, \nwhich I think is the best way to go. That is my preference. I think it \nis the preference of the Senator from Minnesota, who has long been an \nadvocate of this issue.\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\n  One of our responsibilities here in this body is to know when it is \ntime to work with the other side and to give up some of the things we \nreally want so we can move forward. I remember that is exactly what the \nformer majority leader said in his farewell talk. If you cannot get 100 \npercent, get 90 percent today and get 10 percent later. I was delighted \nwhen the Senator from Arizona came to me and initiated this process. \nThe bill included some ideas the Democrats had proposed before, some \nthe Republicans proposed before. What struck me overall, it was a \ngenuine attempt to reach an accord between the parties. You have to do \nthat on an issue like this. This is an issue where if either side feels \nthe other side has somehow rigged the bill, it is all over. That is why \nI am so proud of the support we have received for this bill.\n  One of the problems with reaching a compromise is that you worry some \nhow those who have been real strong advocates, especially out among the \npublic, will say, ``Wait a minute. This is not good enough.'' That \ncould have happened. As the Senator from Arizona knows, just the \nopposite happened. We have received enormous support. We have 60 \nsponsors of the two bills in the House and the Senate. It is almost \nevenly divided on bipartisan lines in the House. The lead author of \nthis in the Senate is a Republican, although we do have more on the \nDemocratic side who have cosponsored it. It has been supported \nvigorously by Common Cause and Public Citizen, AARP, and the United We \nStand group that has helped on this issue all across the country. These \nare not necessarily political bedfellows, but on this issue they came \ntogether.\n  As the Senator from Arizona indicated, we have had enormous editorial \nsupport all across the country--east, west, north, south--from major \nnewspapers to minor newspapers. As I indicated, we have the support of \nboth the President of the United States and Mr. Ross Perot. What I have \nbeen impressed by with regard to this support, Mr. President, is that \neven though it came out about a year ago, and this bill has been \ndelayed and delayed, nonetheless, the support remains, and the people \nwho have advocated this bill have kept the heat up.\n  Mr. President, why does the public sense we absolutely have to move \non campaign finance reform at this point? I think it is because people \nhave finally realized that the No. 1 issue that we have to deal with in \nthis country is getting the big money out of policymaking that goes on \nin Washington.\n  For me, the No. 1 substantive issue is we have to balance the budget. \nIf I had to pick the one reform issue, the one issue that is underlying \nall of this, it is the issue of campaign finance reform. Mr. President, \nwhy is it that people are finally sensing what is going on? Just a few \nof the statistics that are very troubling: In a U.S. Senate race now, \nthe average winner spent in 1994, $4.5 million. That is what the \naverage winner needs. It is not good enough anymore just to be a \nmillionaire. You better have a lot more than that. You better have \nabout $10 million if you want to finance it yourself.\n  What about personal wealth contributions? They have gone up \ndramatically in the last few elections. In 1990, only 4 percent of the \nmoney that was spent on elections was from personal wealth, from \nindividuals putting in their own money. The same in 1992. Suddenly, in \n1994, 18 percent of all the money spent on U.S. Senate elections came \nfrom a dramatic increase in personal spending.\n  Mr. President, what about overall spending? In 1990, it was a lot of \nmoney--$494 million. In 1992, the spending in House and Senate races \ngrew to $702 million. Just 2 years later, it jumped again to $784 \nmillion. The same thing goes with the trend on out-of-State \ncontributions. After staying at 16 percent in 1990, in 1992, the \npercentage of money in Senate elections that comes from out of the \nState for a Senator is now 23 percent, and growing. So these are not \nstatic concerns. These are not trends that have always been there or \npractices that have always been there. These are rapidly increasing \ntrends in overall spending, out-of-State spending, and the huge \ninfusion of personal money into campaigns.\n  I know this from my own campaign. Everyone of us has our own story. \nFor me, all three of my opponents--both of the primary candidates and \nthe final election candidate, the incumbent--had all spent over what \nthis bill suggests as a limit by the time of the primary. That is about \na $14 million or $15 million Senate race in Wisconsin, which is \ncertainly not a small State, but it is not a real large State either. \nIt was a staggering sight for the people in my State. Fortunately, for \nme, my primary opponents felt so confident that I was not a factor in \nthe race, they decided to turn all that money on each other, causing \nthe people to look for an alternative. But we know that type of thing \nis an exception to the rule. That was just in a primary, not the \ngeneral election.\n  Mr. President, perhaps most disturbing, though, is not the issue of \nhow can somebody finance their campaign, or even the issue of what \nhappens when somebody is outgunned in a race, even though one person \nmay be more qualified than the other. I think what the American public \nrealizes more than anything else, and what really bothers them the \nmost, is they know that this story does not end when the votes are \ncounted. It is not just a question of who wins and who becomes a \nSenator. They know that the very policies enacted in this Congress are \naltered in some way or another by the presence of all of this money in \nthe process.\n  How does this happen? Well, one way it happens is that in this town \nthere are, apparently, 13,500 people who are lobbyists. They help with \nthis process. They are not inactive in connecting the campaign process \nto the policy process. Let me give you one example of what happens \naround here. I will omit the names of those involved, but it is just a \nsample so that nobody is confused or puzzled about how sometimes what \nwe decide to do out here is somehow connected to what happens during \nthe campaigns.\n  Here is an invitation:\n\n       During this year's congressional debate on dairy policy, \n     representative ``blank'' has led the charge for dairy farmers \n     and cooperatives by supporting efforts to maintain the milk \n     marketing order program and expand export markets abroad.\n       To honor his leadership, we are hosting a fundraising \n     breakfast for ``blank'' on Wednesday, December 6, 1995. To \n     show your appreciation to ``blank,'' please join us at Le \n     Mistral Restaurant for an enjoyable breakfast with your dairy \n     colleagues.\n       PAC's throughout the industry are asked to contribute \n     $1,000. ``Blank'' would prefer that the checks be made to his \n     leadership fund. If your PAC is unable to comply with this \n     request, please make your PAC check to ```blank' for \n     Congress.''\n       Thank you for your support of our industry's legislative \n     campaign this year and your recognition of ``blank's'' \n     important role toward achieving our objective.\n\n  Now, this is legal. I am not suggesting anyone here has done anything \nlegally wrong. It is just what goes on in this town. A vote is taken, \nand a fundraiser is held. I am not suggesting the opposite, which would \nbe wrong. But, boy, it is a tight connection. That is what is going on \nin this town, and that is what the American people have come to \nrealize.\n\n  Earlier this year, a report was issued by the Center for Responsive \nPolitics. It does show a relationship--at least an arguable \nrelationship--between campaign contributions and the congressional \nagenda. The list includes cattle and sheep interests contributing over \n$600,000 during the last election cycle, while fighting to protect \nFederal grazing policies to give them access to Federal lands at below-\nmarket prices. Mining interests spent over $1 million in 1993 and 1994 \non campaign contributions to Members of Congress while trying to \nprevent reform of the 1872 mining law. Oil and gas interests \ncontributed over $6.1 million in the last election cycle pushing for \nthe alternative minimum tax. That is a change that would cost the U.S. \nTreasury $15 billion.\n  So this problem affects everything, including our deficit problem. If \nspecial interest money can encourage us to spend more money, or create \nmore tax loopholes, then it is part of the reason we cannot balance our \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, there are many other issues that I wish to discuss, \njust as the Senator from Arizona does, and there will be time to do \nthat. At some point, we will lay out some of the specific provisions of \nthe bill. We will discuss in detail the constitutional issues that I \nknow the Senator from Kentucky will tenaciously raise, and we will \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\npoint out that, although they are interesting arguments, they are not \nthe arguments that the U.S. Supreme Court would ultimately follow. But \nI think it will be a spirited debate.\n  Finally, I hope to get a chance to stand again and talk about what \nthis means. Let me conclude by saying what it means to me from the \npoint of view of someone who grew up believing that everybody had a \nchance to run for Congress or the Senate if they really wanted to.\n  This summer, I will go to my 25th high school class reunion at \nJanesville Craig High School in Janesville. I am looking forward to it, \nand I am eager to see my former Democratic and Republican friends--\nthere were more Republicans than Democrats in that town, which taught \nme the value of bipartisan cooperation. Recently, I had a chance, here \nin the Halls of the Capitol, to meet with the political science \nstudents from the another high school, our crosstown rival, Janesville \nParker. They asked me what I was working on. As I looked at them, I \nrealized something had changed from 1971 when I told people that maybe \nI would go into politics someday. You know, in 1971, nobody said, \n``First, Russ, you have to go out and raise about $5 million, or you \nbetter become so connected to the political structure in Washington, or \nyou are never going to be a Senator or a Congressman.'' Nobody said \nthat to me, and I have had the good fortune to be an exception to the \nrule here. But I could not tell those kids 25 years later that anyone \nof them had any reasonable expectation to ever be elected to this body, \nunless they become very, very wealthy, or very, very well connected.\n  To me, that is a little bit of a denial of the American dream. It is \nnot the same thing as being able to buy a house. It is not the same \nthing as not having health care. I realize it has to be down the list \nas compared to basic necessities. But I still believe that the right of \nevery American to fairly participate in this process is part of the \nAmerican dream. That is all our bill is about, making sure, on a \nvoluntary basis, that every qualified American has a fair chance to \nparticipate in the process. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will not speak at length, having \nintroduced the debate. I want to provide a counterpoint to the \narguments that we have had now with two speakers in favor of the bill. \nI would like to make several comments, one with respect to the chart \noffered by my friend from Arizona.\n\n  I was in this town when Richard Nixon was President of the United \nStates and the loud outcry went up that money was destroying politics; \nthat we had to reform politics; that we had to find a way to take the \ncorrosive support of money away from politics in the wake of the \nWatergate scandal. The solution that was crafted and debated on this \nfloor and ultimately passed was the creation of the political action \ncommittees [PAC's]. PAC's were touted as the ultimate purifying \nprocess. What could be better than a PAC?\n  I remember the debate very well. It went this way. Instead of one \nindividual being able to give Richard Nixon $250,000--or, as Clement \nStone did at the time, $2.5 million--now you have a circumstance where \nordinary citizens can get together and pool their money in a political \naction committee, and for efficiency purposes, the managers of that \ncommittee will issue individual single checks of no more than $5,000.\n  What could be better in cleaning up politics than the creation of the \npolitical action committees? Indeed, Mr. President, I once worked for \nthe man who probably created the first political action committee. His \nname was Howard Hughes.\n  At the Hughes organizations in California, where people were \nconstantly coming to Mr. Hughes for political contributions, he said, \n``Let's get all of the employees together, let them contribute $5, $10, \nwhatever is their choice, into a single fund, and then let them \ndetermine how that money will be spent.''\n  The original Hughes political action committee had every politician \nin California coming before it to speak to the employees because the \ncandidate who did a great job in front of that PAC meeting would walk \naway with a check for $50,000, $60,000, or $100,000, depending upon how \nthe employees voted that their PAC money was to be spent. I believe \nthat was the model for the creation of the political action committee.\n  Now we see charts being given to us telling us of the corrosive \ndamaging influence of PAC's.\n  It all comes down to a statement that was made in an editorial in the \nWall Street Journal on the 4th of April. I quote:\n\n       The bigger point here is that money and politics is like \n     water running downhill. Dam up one avenue, and it will pool \n     and meander until it finds another way to break through. \n     Trying to regulate it is a fool's errand, as even some good \n     government reformers are beginning to understand.\n\n  If I could go back to the theme of my opening statement, we are not \ntalking about, in the words of the Senator from Wisconsin, reducing the \nflow of political action money. We are talking about redirecting the \nflow of political action money with the kind of legislation that is \nbeing offered here.\n  Back to the Wall Street Journal, another editorial. This one that \nappeared on the 2d of February 1996, which gives an example of the kind \nof thing I was talking about in my opening statement.\n\n       What the reformers will not advertise is that there is \n     nothing much they can do about the special interests who \n     decide to spend money on their own, as they did to great \n     effect in Oregon. The AFL-CIO says it devoted 35 full-time \n     professionals and sent out 350,000 pieces of partisan mail \n     for the cause. The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation \n     Voters spent $200,000 on 30,000 postcards, 100,000 telephone \n     calls, and very tough TV and radio spots accusing Republican \n     Gordon Smith of voting against ground-water protection, clean \n     air, pesticide limits, and recycling.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       The toughest was a Teamster radio spot run on seven \n     stations in five cities that in effect accused Mr. Smith of \n     being an accomplice to murder because a 14-year-old boy died \n     in an accident at one of his companies.\n\n  Quoting the spot:\n\n       Gordon Smith owns companies where workers get hurt and \n     killed. He has repeatedly violated the law. Those are the \n     facts.\n\n  The Journal goes on:\n\n       In fact, the young worker had died after a fall in a grain \n     elevator while being supervised by his father, who still \n     works for Mr. Smith and does not blame him. An analysis of \n     the ad in the liberal Oregonian newspaper essentially \n     concluded that the whole thing was false. The ad was the work \n     of consultant Henry Sheinkopf, who is part of Bill Clinton's \n     reelection team this year and likes to say he believes in the \n     politics of terror.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       Even Mr. Wyden felt compelled to criticize the rhetoric of \n     the ad, but since it was not run by his campaign he couldn't \n     be blamed for it even as it cut up his opponent. That is the \n     beauty of these independent expenditures. They work for a \n     candidate without showing his fingerprints. Mr. Wyden took \n     the high road earlier this month and announced that both \n     candidates should stop negative campaigning, while his allies \n     kept dumping garbage on Mr. Smith through the mail and on the \n     airwaves.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the point I made in my opening remark, and \nthat is the point I will keep coming back to again and again until we \nrecognize that special interest money is more damaging in the hands of \nspecial interests going directly to the voter than it is in the hands \nof a candidate who must be accountable to the voter. We will be missing \nthe point in this whole debate. Setting limitations? Oh, we are told \nthey are not mandatory, that they are only driven by a voluntary \nincentive system.\n  Ask Bob Dole about the voluntary incentive system he is laboring \nunder. He cannot spend any more money now under this voluntary \nincentive system, and President Clinton has $27 million to spend \nbecause Bob Dole had to run against Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan to \nwin his nomination, and Bill Clinton did not have to run against \nanybody. So Bill Clinton has his $27 million raised for the primary \nthat he can spend in any way he wants, and Bob Dole is forbidden by \nlaw. But, no, that is not mandatory. That is a voluntary incentive \nsystem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator surely knows that has nothing to do with the \nlegislation we are considering. That\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\nhas to do campaign financing within campaigns, which is not in this \nlegislation.\n  I sympathize with the frustration of the Senator from Utah. I was \ngoing to talk about it later on. I understand, according to some folks, \nthat now you can sleep in the Lincoln bedroom for $130,000, but that \nhas nothing to do with the legislation that is being proposed here, \nwhich those limitations impose because of candidates taking taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree completely that the Senator from Arizona is \ncorrect, that this bill does not include public financing. But may I \nget clarification? The voluntary incentive system does, in fact, if \nentered into by a candidate for local office, produce a limitation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is there, in fact, a limitation if someone enters into \nthe voluntary incentive system?\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is no limitation. What happens is that then the \nchallenger who is running, who is not in violation of the voluntary \nspending limits, then receives extra incentives.\n  That is all there is to it. There is no prohibition for anyone, and \nit allows them to spend however much money they want to spend. In the \ncase of a millionaire or a multimillionaire, say from a small State, \nwho wanted to spend millions of dollars of his or her own money, we \nwould not allow that person, as is the habit of these millionaires, to \nraise all that money back. We only allow them to raise $250,000 back, \nand the rest of it he or she would have to write off.\n  But there is no limit on the spending that a person can make. They \njust lose the incentives that are in the bill, and the opponent who may \nnot be nearly as well funded has some extra incentive to go along with \nit, the details of which I will be glad to explain to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Kentucky be allowed to enter the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not believe that that is according to \nthe rules of the Senate. I do not believe that three--I do not believe \nthat more than two can engage in a colloquy. I ask the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the Senate can engage in \nsuch colloquy, Senators may engage in such colloquy as they seek.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nWisconsin be included in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMinnesota be in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Very well, gentlemen. The \nChair will still ask that Senators seek recognition through the Chair \nif there is a dispute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand that my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota is supposed to be at an event. I will try to keep this short. \nBut I would say to my friend from Utah, I think the answer to the \nquestion that was raised, the whole issue of whether there is spending \nin this bill, of course, there is. It is referred to, Mr. President, as \n``voluntary'' when, in fact, it is voluntary such as the following \nsituation: You are being held up and a fellow puts a gun to your \ntemple, and he says, ``You don't have to give me your billfold, but if \nyou don't, I am going to shoot you.''\n  So what happens to you in this situation, I say to my friend from \nUtah, is that if you do not agree to the Government-imposed speech \nlimit on the campaign, the following things happen to you: You lose \nfree broadcast time, 30 minutes; you lose the 50 percent broadcast \ndiscount; you lose a discounted postage rate; your opponent gets a \nhigher contribution, individual contribution limit.\n  As you can see, this is not terribly voluntary. In fact, it is the \npart of the bill that makes it unconstitutional.\n  Now, I did not stand up here to make my major comments on this, but I \ndid want to just follow up on this PAC discussion because I know my \nfriend from Arizona had the PAC chart up. I used to advocate, as a part \nof an overall compromise back years ago when our side was trying to put \ntogether an alternative, going along with the PAC ban even though I \nknew it was unconstitutional. I think that it was a bad decision then \nand it would be a bad decision now to eliminate political action \ncommittees, because, in fact, the vast majority of them are organized \njust as my friend from Utah has suggested.\n  An awful lot of American citizens, Mr. President, are really offended \nby the likelihood that they would be pushed out of the political \nprocess altogether. Having been involved in this debate for some 10 \nyears now and having watched the flow of this issue, I would say what \nis different about the debate this year is that an awful lot of people \nwho are aggrieved by it are willing to say something.\n  For example, the National Education Association, with which I am very \nseldom allied, just wrote me a letter indicating they are opposed to \nthis bill. I know that EMILY's List is opposed to this bill. I know \nthat the National Taxpayers Union, the National Right to Life \nCommittee, the National Rifle Association, the Christian Coalition, the \nNational Association of Broadcasters, the National Association of \nBusiness PAC's are all against this bill.\n\n  Now, in the case of the broadcasters and the direct marketing people, \nyou could argue that one of the reasons they do not like this bill is \nbecause they are going to be called upon to pay for it. I guess you \ncould argue technically that there is not taxpayer funding in here, but \nspending limits are not free. So the question is, who picks up the tab? \nUnder this proposal, the broadcasting industry and the direct marketing \nindustry have the opportunity to pass these costs along to their \ncustomers. And that is, in effect, how it is paid for.\n  The NEA----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say, Mr. President, I am going to yield \nthe floor because I know my friend from Minnesota is anxious to get his \nremarks in and go to something else. But I mentioned the NEA in \nconnection with the PAC discussion because I would say to my friend \nfrom Utah, in the letter they sent just today indicating their \nopposition to this bill, they said that the average contribution to the \nNEA PAC is $6.\n  Now, Republicans know they are a very big PAC because we rarely get \nany contribution from it, but I would say that it is a step forward for \ndemocracy to have that many people involved participating together on \nbehalf of a cause in which they believe. So we should not be banning \nPAC's. I do not think the courts would let us do it, but we should not \nbe doing it. Something as unconstitutional, as the ACLU candidly says, \nshould not pass in the Senate.\n  But specifically in connection with the PAC discussion, most PAC's \ninclude an awful lot of Americans banding together to support the \ncandidates of their choice. It is very, very hard for me to see how \nthat is a bad thing for democracy.\n  Finally, before yielding the floor, let me say there is always a lot \nof discussion anytime we bring this issue up about leveling the playing \nfield. Well, in order to level the playing field in Kentucky, you would \nhave to get about half the Democrats to change their registration. You \nwould have to sell about half the newspapers to different owners so \nthey would occasionally support Republicans. And you would have to \nrewrite the political history of the State.\n  So if we are really going to be serious about leveling the playing \nfield here, money is not the only factor in these elections--voting \nbehavior, registration, newspaper endorsements, what kind of year it \nis. If the Government is really going to try to create a level playing \nfield, let us really get into this thing now and figure out how to \nreally do it.\n  In short, Mr. President, you cannot create a level playing field; it \nis impossible. It is impossible because every political year is \ndifferent, every State is different, the strength of the parties is \ndifferent. All you can do through this\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nkind of proposal is, as my friend from Utah pointed out, redirect money \nin a different direction. Spending limits are, in short, like putting a \nrock on Jello. It sort of oozes out to the side in a different \ndirection.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield the floor, and we will \ncontinue the debate later.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the past unanimous consent, the Members \nwho sought recognition as part of a colloquy may yield to one another \nuntil this colloquy is over.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD and Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded. The Chair will recognize \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Wisconsin want to respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like a very brief response.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very well. And I would like to get the floor. Could I \nask unanimous consent that after they respond I might have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is part of the colloquy by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will defer to my two colleagues, and then I would \nlike to follow.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is just going to issue an edict that \nwhen the three speakers have spoken, there be no action under this \ncolloquy; it is too hard to maintain.\n  The Senator has yielded. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, that was the reason why I raised the \nconcern to start with.\n  Mr. President, as far as PAC's are concerned, I just make two \nresponses. I have heard the comment that a lot of people have felt that \nif political action committees were not allowed, they would somehow be \ndeprived of their part in the political process. In fact, most \nconstituents of mine feel that making campaign contributions directly \nto the candidate is the most effective and beneficial way. In fact, I \ndo not know many of my constituents who come here to Washington to give \nme that PAC check. In fact, the person that gives out those $5,000 PAC \nchecks is the lobbyist here in Washington. So that is a strange \ndescription of the political process.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not want to get too harsh, but let us talk what \nthis is really all about. Let me give two examples of the Palm Beach \nPost editorial of last October:\n\n       In his diaries, Mr. Packwood describes his relationship \n     with a lobbyist. Shell Oil and many other clients hired him \n     because they knew he had access to Senator Packwood. In \n     return, this lobbyist raised money for the Senator so the \n     lobbyist collected fees, the Senator collected campaign \n     contributions and the company got legislative favors. As \n     Senator Packwood told his diary: ``That's a happy \n     relationship for all of us.''\n\n  I do not think that is exactly along the lines of the process that \nthe Senator from Kentucky just described.\n  Let me just quote again from this editorial.\n\n       The lawmaker's claim to be above board has collapsed \n     lately. Wyche Fowler, a former Senator and Representative \n     from Georgia, said, ``On many occasions--I am not proud of \n     it--I made the choice I needed this big corporate client, and \n     therefore I voted for or sponsored this provision even though \n     I did not think it was in the best interests of the country \n     or the economy.''\n\n  Mr. President, there are two examples from both sides of the aisle of \nwhat the problem is here. The problem is that this money exerts undue \ninfluence on the process.\n  Mr. President, there will be more. I yield.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota yielded.\n  Does the Senator now yield to the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I now yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota has \nbeen waiting for a long time. I will yield in a moment.\n  Mr. President, I thought this was a colloquy on the issue of whether \nthere were spending limits in this bill. The Senator from Kentucky and \nthe Senator from Utah have come out here today and said, time and \nagain, that there are mandatory spending limits or that there are \nspending limits that force you to lose something that you have now. We \nhave to clear this up. I am going to stay out here as long as this bill \nis up to clear it up.\n  The example the Senator from Kentucky used suggested that if somebody \nstarted to spend what they used to spend, they would lose something \nthey used to have. It is not true. Our bill does not cause a person who \nwants to spend money to lose anything. If they want to go over the \nlimit, they still get the lowest commercial rate. They never had the \nbenefits of the bill in the first place. So let us be very clear about \nthis, there is no gun to anyone's head. That is just false. In a State \nwhere the limit is $1 million, a person can spend $10 million, just as \nthey can today, and they lose nothing. There is no gun to anyone's head \nin this bill. It only provides benefits to those who are willing to \ncomply with it.\n  I challenge the Senator from Kentucky at any point in this process to \nsuggest where anyone is forced to give up what they have now. People \ncan spend themselves into oblivion on this bill still. But at least \nthose who are opposing them will have a chance.\n  I think it is very important that the record show what this bill \nactually provides, not the parade of horribles that have been suggested \nthat do not actually exist in the text of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just following up on what my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, has had to say, I think what this \nbill will do, however, is it will set a higher standard. You do not \nhave to comply with it. But once we, as a U.S. Senate, and then \nhopefully the House of Representatives, respond to what I think people \nare telling us in the country about what they yearn for in our \npolitical process, it sets a higher standard. I think the focus will be \non how to make this political process more accountable and more open \nand more credible and more believable for people.\n  I want to get to my more formal remarks. But I want first to respond \nto a little bit of what I have heard said. My colleague from Kentucky--\nwe have debated other issues on the floor of the Senate--talked about \nhow in Kentucky a whole lot of other things would have to be done in \norder to have a level playing field: You would have to change part of \nthe history, you would have to change who owns some of the newspapers, \net cetera.\n  This is a bit of a strawperson argument. We are not making the \nargument that this piece of legislation will create a political heaven \non Earth. We are just trying to talk about how to make this a little \nbetter, to improve people's confidence in it and in elected officials. \nWe are talking about how to try to make this system work better for \npeople.\n  I suppose the argument can be made that you can never have a 100 \npercent completely level playing field. But this piece of legislation \nis a significant step toward dealing with some of the disparity that \nnow exists and toward making this system less wired for people who are \nincumbents, less wired for people who are wealthy, less wired for \npeople who are connected to the well-connected.\n  Some of the arguments made by this bill's opponents this afternoon \nkind of miss the point. I do not want right now to get into a long \ndiscussion with my colleague from Utah. Maybe we will later on. I plan \non staying on the floor for the duration of this debate, or for a good, \nlong period of time. But if we want to go back to the Federalist \nPapers, let me also just suggest to my colleague that part of the \nintention of those who wrote Federalist Paper No. 10 was to figure out \nhow, in fact, you could check majority rule. There was a big concern \nabout the tempestuous masses.\n\n  I must say, I think part of what is going on here on the floor is \ntrying to figure out how to check majority rule, because this system \nright now does not meet the standard of real representative democracy, \nbecause the standard of a representative democracy in our country, or \nany other country, is that\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\neach person counts as one and no more than one. I dare any of my \ncolleagues to, in this debate, come out here on the floor and say, \ngiven the system we have right now and the reliance on huge \ncontributions--whether it be soft money, PAC money or individual \ncontributions--that, as a matter of fact, each and every citizen has \nthe same influence over our political process. It is simply not true. \nAnd it is certainly not the perception that many have of our system.\n  This current system does very severe damage to the very essence of \nwhat representative democracy is supposed to be all about. I think this \nvote is going to be the reform vote of the 104th Congress. That is what \nthis is all about. This is going to be the reform vote of the 104th \nCongress. I want people to understand exactly what is at stake here \nover the next day or so.\n  We will have a vote on this, to bring to a close the Senate \nfilibuster. We have been able to bring this bill to the floor but we've \nbeen blocked from amending it or otherwise moving forward on it by this \nfilibuster. We will have a vote to try to break the filibuster at 2:15 \np.m. tomorrow. In the meantime, we do not have the opportunity to amend \nthe bill. Senators do not have the opportunity to improve the bill. \nSenators should have that opportunity. And then we should have a chance \nto vote on it, up or down.\n  Last Congress we debated campaign finance reform--that is to say, \nways in which we could begin to get some of the big money out of \npolitics, ways in which we could bring the spending limits down, and \nmake the system work better for people--for several weeks. What is \ngoing on here is an effort to filibuster this bill, motivated by a hope \nthat tomorrow at 2:15 we will not get the required 60 votes to end the \nfilibuster and then it will all go away. Then I suppose the sort of \npolitical cover position will be: Let us appoint a commission. But \nthat's not going to fly, either here or with the American people. And \nif we are unable to break the filibuster tomorrow, we will be back \nagain on this issue until we get it done.\n  I want to remind my colleagues one more time: this is the reform vote \nof the 104th Congress, and people will hold us accountable. Our \nconstituents in our States, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents \nalike, will hold us accountable. Nobody should believe this is going to \nbe an easy vote: Vote against cloture, block this legislation, and then \nduck for political cover by saying you want to appoint some commission.\n  I want to talk about this piece of legislation, not in a technical \nway--though we can have that debate as well--but, rather, just in terms \nof some simple human realities. First of all, I will start with \nSenators and Representatives. I do not know, my colleague from \nWisconsin talked about this, but I think I am speaking for almost \neverybody here. I think most of us dislike the current system. Most of \nthe people in Congress, on both sides of the political aisle, with whom \nI talk in private say it is a rotten system. People spend too much time \nfundraising and they do not spend enough time legislating. People hate \nto have to call and ask for money. We all know that what my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin said is true, which is that the very definition of why \nyou are a viable candidate, unfortunately, has nothing to do with \ncontent of character, with leadership, with vision, with your sense of \nright or wrong for your country; it has to do with whether or not you \nare independently wealthy or you have raised or will raise millions of \ndollars.\n  I think all of us should want to change this system because I think, \nwhen we are involved in the fundraising, the perception--and I do not \naccuse one colleague here of any individual corruption--but the \nperception of people is often that we are out there raising money from \nthis person or that person or this PAC or that PAC, and people just \nsimply lose confidence in the political process. All of us who care \nfiercely about public service, all of us who care fiercely about good \npolitics, all of us who are proud to serve in the U.S. Senate ought to \nbe concerned about the fact that people have lost confidence in this \nprocess.\n  So I argue the human realities are this: We need to pass this reform \nbill to restore some trust in this political process. That is what this \nis all about. I would say there is an A and a B part to this. The A \npart is this. I am wearing a political science hat, I am wearing a \nU.S.-Senator-from-Minnesota hat, and I am also wearing a citizen hat. \nPeople are not going to believe in the outcomes of this process unless \nthey believe in the process itself. And as long as people believe that \ntoo few people, with so much wealth, power and say, dominate the \npolitical process and the vast majority of people feel left out, ripped \noff, underrepresented, not listened to, then I would say to everybody \nhere we are not going to do well with the public.\n  People want to believe in this political process. They do not like \nthe fact that big money dominates too much of politics in America. \nRegular people do not feel well-represented within the current system.\n  Mr. President, I have worked with Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold, I worked with Senator Simon on many, many, many issues. If it \ndoes not get him in trouble, I will say he is my best friend in the \nU.S. Senate. You can only have one best friend. I wish he would not \nleave. I think it is a huge loss for our country. We have worked on \nother things. We worked on the gift ban, and we worked on lobbying \ndisclosure. Senator Levin from Michigan played a major role as a leader \non lobbying disclosure.\n  In some ways, this has a sense of deja vu to me. For many months, \nmany of our colleagues said they were opposed to the gift ban and \nopposed to lobbying disclosure legislation. In fact, they were both \nfilibustered and stopped at the end of the last Congress. But we came \nback in this Congress, and we won.\n  What were we saying there? We were saying, ``Look, we're not bashing \npeople here, we're proud to serve. But if you want the bashing to stop, \nif you want the denigration of public service to stop, if you want \npeople in our country to be more engaged in public affairs, if you want \ncitizens to be more active, then, for gosh sake, give up this practice \nof having this interest or these folks or those folks pay for you to \ngo, take trips, wherever, give it up, let it go. We don't need it.'' \nAnd we passed that.\n  Then we came to the floor and we said, in the spirit of sunshine and \nfull disclosure, if somebody lobbies here, Americans should know what \nthey're up to. People lobby for different interests. That is not the \nproblem, but there are two problems.\n  One problem is we wanted to deal with an outdated bill passed in the \nlate 1940's and have full disclosure so we would have accountability, \nas to who was doing the lobbying, who was working for whom and what \nwere the scope of their efforts. And the other problem, by the way, is \nlobbyists, by and large, those people who march on Washington every \nday, tend to represent a very narrow segment of the American \npopulation. That is the problem. Many other people are not well \nrepresented.\n  Now we come to the ethical issue of politics, I think, of our time, \nwhich is the way in which money has come to dominate politics: Who gets \nto run for office? Who is likely to win the election? Who is the best \nconnected? Who are the heavy hitters? Which people have the most \ninfluence? What issues are on the agenda? What issues are off the \nagenda? How many people are out there in the anteroom, and whom do they \nrepresent? How do they secure access? what are their patterns of \npolitical giving? Political scientists and reformers have been asking \nthese questions for years, and they've come up with some very telling \nanswers.\n  And we see it here everyday. We don't need anybody to point out \nwhat's going on. When it is a telecommunications bill or it is a health \ninsurance reform bill, that anteroom is packed wall to wall with \npeople. They represent the most powerful in America.\n  But when it comes to children's issues--Head Start, title I, support \nfor kids with disadvantaged backgrounds--I never see it wall to wall \nlobbyists.\n  This is the ethical issue of politics in our time. And, Mr. \nPresident, we are talking about a systemic problem, but not about the \ncorruption of an individual officeholder. I do not believe that is the \ncase. We are talking about systemic corruption when what happens is too \nfew people have way too much power and say, and those are the people\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nwho can most affect our tenure in office and, unfortunately, in this \nsystem, those are the people who have the financial resources. We are \ntrying to, through this legislation, take a significant step toward \nbeginning to end that.\n  Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from Wisconsin, if I can \nget his attention for one moment, that when he was talking, I was very \nmoved by what he said when he was talking about meeting with students.\n  He said, ``I just feel like this isn't the American dream. Money is \nso important in terms of who can run, who can get elected.''\n\n  He said, ``Maybe this isn't exactly as important as health care, or \nmaybe it's not as important as whether people have a job, maybe it is \nnot quite up there.'' I think it is; I think it is. As a matter of \nfact, this is the core issue, the one that's in a way prior to other \npolitical issues. The first chapter in one of the many books my \ncolleague, the Senator from Illinois, has written dealt with the whole \nissue of campaign finance reform. That was not by mistake. This is the \ncore issue, I say to my colleague from Wisconsin and my colleague from \nIllinois. This is, in many ways, the most fundamental issue, because \nyou know what we are talking about? We are talking about something we \nall must hold dear that is fundamental: whether we are going to have a \nfunctioning democracy.\n  If you believe that each person should count as one and no more than \none, if you believe there should be some political equality, if you \nbelieve that citizens should have real input and real say and have the \nsame opportunities to participate and be listened to and to be involved \nin public affairs and to run for office and to be elected for office, \nit is simply true--I do not want it to be true--but most of the people \nin the country know it to be true, that this is not what is happening \nin our country today, and big money mixed with politics has severely \nundercut the very ideal of representative democracy.\n  That is why people are so disenchanted. That is why people are so \ndisengaged. That is why this has become a cafe issue. That is why \npeople are talking about this, I say to my colleague from Wisconsin, in \nthe same way they are talking about a lot of other issues.\n  This is no longer just Common Cause. I honor Common Cause. They have \ndone marvelous work as fierce advocates of political reform. But this \nis no longer being pushed just by good government, United We Stand, \nreform parties. More important, this is an issue people are talking \nabout in their own homes, and people want change.\n  I will just take a couple of more minutes, Mr. President. I have said \nthat this is a core issue, and that we must deal with it before we try \nto address other problems. I am going to get some colleagues angry at \nme when I say that, and we will have a good debate on it. I think many \npeople have decided that we will never do deficit reduction on the \nbasis of some standard of fairness. That is to say, yes, we will target \na whole lot of deficit reduction on those citizens on the bottom \neconomically who have the least political clout, but we do not do \ndeficit reduction when it comes to the big military contractors or all \nthose oil companies and coal companies, and tobacco companies and \npharmaceutical companies that get all of their tax breaks.\n  I do not think people believe we will do deficit reduction with any \nstandard of fairness. I do not think people believe that we are going \nto deal with the fundamental problem of making sure every child has a \ndecent educational opportunity in our country; that we are going to \nresolve inner-city poverty; that we are going to make sure we have a \nclean environment, within our current system.\n  I do not think people believe that we are going to deal with the \nbudget deficit or with the investment deficit, because I think people \nbelieve that this political process will not work, and the reason they \nthink it will not work is because they think it is dominated by big \nmoney, because the citizens of the United States of America do not \nbelieve they exercise real power.\n  And guess what? In a democracy, the people ought to have the right to \ndominate their political process. They have the right to believe that \nthe Capitol belongs to them. But it does not.\n  So we are at a critical juncture. Either we are going to go forward \nwithout a truly representative democracy, what some have called \ncheckbook politics, or we are going to have a democratic renewal, and I \nmean democratic renewal not with a large ``D,'' I mean with a small \n``d,'' where people have confidence in this process, where people feel \nlike they are being listened to, where people feel like they can \nparticipate. That is what this is all about.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Wisconsin already recited the \nstatistics. And he noted the work of the Center for Responsive \nPolitics. I ask unanimous consent that a letter and three short opinion \npieces written by the director of the center, Ellen Miller, which have \nappeared in newspapers throughout the country, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement, because they outline succinctly what I have \nbeen talking about in terms of the problems with our current system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has only gone from bad to worse \nduring the decade of the 1980's and the 1990's. It is just absolutely \nout of control, absolutely out of control, with the new twist being \nsoft money. Much of it is just shifting to soft money. I mean, you have \nthe individual contributions. And by the way, the people who make the \nlarge individual contributions represent a tiny slice of the American \npopulation. You have PAC money.\n  In addition, you have soft money that is supposed to be for party \nbuilding or for issue-oriented ads. I know all about those ads in \nMinnesota. The sky is the limit. The parties are awash in this money. \nThe attack ads do not add one bit of information to one citizen \nanywhere in the United States of America.\n  They do not contribute toward representative democracy. I have to \nsmile when I hear the argument made, well, we ought to actually be \nspending more money. There are some people here that want to do that. \nOn the House side they are talking about actually raising the limits. \nThat is an interesting argument.\n  The argument goes like this. ``Well, Senators and Representatives \nwouldn't have to make as many calls and do as much fund raising if you \ncould just raise it to larger chunks.'' That goes in exactly the \nopposite direction of having a representative democracy where there is \nsome political equality and where citizens really count.\n  Or I heard my colleague from Utah make the argument about expanding \ndisclosure. I'm all for more disclosure. But that's not enough. Even \nso, that could be an amendment. Give us the cloture vote and then let \nus have amendments. That is the way to deal with this. ``If we make no \nchanges, we will do better on disclosure.'' Every 2 years and every 4 \nyears people will see clearly that even more money is being spent by \nspecial interests or by people who are wealthy. And people will become \nmore disenchanted. And we will be stuck with all the problems we have \nright now. I do not see that as the answer.\n  So I will not summarize our bill. I think everybody here is aware of \nwhat we are doing. We are reducing the spending limits. We have some \nstrict disclosure on soft money. We banned bundling. We banned PAC \nmoney for Federal candidates. If that is declared unconstitutional, \nthen we have a fall-back smaller limit on PAC's which would apply. We \nask that people raise the majority of the money from within their \nStates. And we have some incentives which I believe really help when \npeople agree to these spending limits.\n  We set a standard. We do not have the public financing that I would \nlike to have. But this sets a standard for the country. It is a \nsignificant step forward. I believe it is good for each and every one \nof us here. I certainly think it is good for challengers. I think it \ndeals with some of the disparity. I think it gets us closer to a level \nplaying field. I think that it is probably the most important step we \ncan take in this Congress to pass this legislation.\n  So to my colleagues, if you want to debate this, let us debate it. \nBut do not block it. Do not think it is going to go away. Give us the \ncloture vote. Bring out your amendments. Try to improve it. Let us have \nthe debate that people in this country want us to have. And to each and \nevery one of you, this is the\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nreform vote of this Congress. The people back in our States will hold \nus accountable. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Center for Responsive Politics,\n\n                                                    June 14, 1996.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: I want to share with you the enclosed series of \n     five op-ed ads that the Center has placed in The New York \n     Times, The Washington Times, and the Atlanta Journal-\n     Constitution. A version of the first ad will also run in the \n     Boston Globe, The Advocate (Stamford, CT), the Seattle Post \n     Intelligencer, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Arizona \n     Republic, the Louisville Courier-Journal, The Nation, The New \n     Republic, The Weekly Standard, Roll Call, The Washington \n     Monthly, and Talkers Magazine. The op-ed ads will appear \n     during a two-week period starting Monday, June 17, preceding \n     the upcoming debate in Congress on various campaign finance \n     reform bills.\n       The purpose of these ads is not to support or oppose any \n     particular piece of legislation now before Congress, nor is \n     it to put forward a reform proposal of our own. It is simply \n     to help re-frame the debate. What are the real problems? What \n     must real reform accomplish? We see these ads as providing \n     ``guideposts'' for evaluating what is real reform and what is \n     not. In short, we want to use the ads to push the debate onto \n     higher ground by reminding people that democracy carries with \n     it certain fundamental principles--principles that are now \n     violated by our campaign finance system.\n       If you would like additional copies of the ads, or would \n     like to talk about the ad series, please give me a call. You \n     are welcome to insert them into the Congressional Record if \n     you so desire.\n           With warm regards,\n                                                  Ellen S. Miller,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n           Financing Elections . . . As If Democracy Mattered\n\n       Remember when democracy was something you believed in, not \n     something for sale?\n       Those days have come . . . and gone.\n       Big money from big campaign contributors has put a price \n     tag on our democracy. Our fundamental principles--like a \n     government accountable to the people--are undermined as \n     candidates collect millions of campaign dollars from rich \n     people and organizations with specific and special interests. \n     When the election's over, the donors collect. Fancy dinners. \n     Private briefings. Special favors. Subsidies. Tax breaks.\n       No wonder average Americans are angry. Democracy is \n     supposed to be about empowering all the people, not just the \n     people with money. Political equality and government \n     accountability are the values that inspire our faith in \n     democracy. America's history is the history of our progress \n     toward making these goals real for every citizen. These same \n     values should inspire efforts to reform campaign financing.\n       Americans want real reform--not empty promises. But not all \n     the proposed reforms in Congress and in state legislatures \n     across the country will solve the problem.\n       How will we recognize real campaign finance reform?\n       In this series of essays, the Center for Responsive \n     Politics presents four essential ``guideposts'' for reform. \n     Keep these in mind when you hear lawmakers talk about \n     campaign finance reform. Real campaign finance reform will:\n\n\n                          enhance competition\n\n       Allow qualified Americans of diverse backgrounds and \n     perspectives to seek public office regardless of their \n     personal wealth or their access to wealth.\n\n\n                       restore public confidence\n\n       Eliminate the inevitable conflicts of interest created when \n     big money buys elections and the special interest replaces \n     the public interest.\n\n\n                          ensure equal access\n\n       Provide all Americans access to their government and their \n     elected representatives regardless of their ability to make \n     campaign contributions.\n\n\n                          stop the money chase\n\n       Place the people's business first by freeing elected public \n     servants from the money chase that distracts them from the \n     responsibilities of governing.\n       Campaign finance reform . . . as if democracy mattered. \n     Because it does.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Get Adopted By Steve Forbes\n\n       Get adopted by Steve Forbes or his friends in the \n     multimillionaire club.\n       In today's ``cash-ocracy'', that's your only chance to get \n     the cash you need to compete in a major election. Unless \n     you're already a member of the club. Either you have deep \n     pockets to fund your own campaign or you reach into someone \n     else's deep pockets. No wonder Congress has the highest \n     concentration of millionaires outside of Wall Street.\n       Of course, money isn't everything in politics--Steve Forbes \n     proved that. But ask yourself; what kind of attention would \n     Forbes have gotten if he didn't have money?\n       Consider who isn't running for President: Jack Kemp. Dick \n     Cheney. Dan Quayle. All popular, potentially strong \n     candidates who decided not to run. Money was a major reason. \n     This year, you had to raise $20 million just to be \n     ``viable.'' And consider that in nine out of ten \n     Congressional races, the candidate with the most money wins--\n     even in the ``revolutionary'' elections of 1994.\n       Good people don't run for office because they can't raise \n     the money they need to be taken seriously. Anyone you know \n     able to quickly raise $5 million? $500,000? These are the \n     average prices of a U.S. Senate or House campaign.\n       Democracy is cheated and weakened when the first test of a \n     candidate's strength is the size of their bank account or the \n     wealth of their friends. Elections should be decided on the \n     power of ideas openly debated, the strength of character, a \n     record of accomplishments and a vision for the future. Our \n     elected representatives should be skilled listeners and \n     thinkers--not mere fundraisers.\n       How will we recognize real campaign reform?\n       In this series of essays, the Center for Responsive \n     Politics presents four essential ``guideposts'' every \n     American should use to evaluate proposals for campaign \n     finance reform.\n\n\n                   guidepost #1: ENHANCE COMPETITION\n\n       Real campaign finance reform should enhance fair \n     competition by allowing candidates of diverse backgrounds and \n     perspectives to seek public office regardless of their \n     personal wealth or access to wealth. You shouldn't need to be \n     a millionaire to be a candidate.\n       Campaign finance reform . . . as if democracy mattered. \n     Because it does.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  He Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune\n\n       This truism teaches us a lot about how we finance election \n     campaigns and how our government works--a lesson known even \n     to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and President Bill Clinton.\n       ``Congress is increasingly a system of corruption in which \n     money politics is defeating and driving out citizen \n     politics,'' said Gingrich in 1990.\n       ``Many special interests are trying to stop our every move. \n     They try to stop reform, delay change, deny progress, simply \n     because they profit from the status quo,'' said President \n     Clinton in 1993.\n       It's ironic that two of the biggest fundraisers in American \n     history confirm it--we have a checkbook democracy. He who \n     pays the piper calls the tune.\n       Most Americans can't afford to ``pay the piper.'' The \n     biggest funders of Congressional campaigns are those who have \n     a direct interest in the business of government. Decisions \n     are skewed in their favor. Those who cannot afford to pay are \n     left out.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Yet, all of us pick up the tab. Pork-barrel federal \n     programs, subsidies, and tax breaks for corporations and \n     industry groups are expensive: Hundreds of billions of \n     dollars every year, according to research by organizations as \n     diverse as the Progressive Policy Institute and the Cato \n     Institute. Then there's the cost to our democracy in \n     increased public cynicism, alienation and lower voter \n     participation. Confidence in government plummets.\n       How will we recognize real campaign finance reform?\n       In this series of essays, the Center for Responsive \n     Politics presents four essential ``guideposts'' every \n     American should use to evaluate proposals for campaign \n     finance reform.\n\n\n               guidepost no. 2: restore public confidence\n\n       Real campaign finance reform should restore public \n     confidence in government by eliminating the inevitable \n     conflicts of interest and skewed policymaking created when \n     big money buys elections and the special interest replaces \n     the public interest.\n       Campaign finance reform . . . as if democracy mattered. \n     Because it does.\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  [Disturbance in the gallery.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any more outbreaks and we will empty the \ngalleries.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the arguments of each of the three \nsponsors and proponents of this bill who have spoken here this \nafternoon almost take the form of what we were taught in college was a \nsyllogism.\n  Proposition No. 1. The people of the United States intensely dislike \nthe present system of financing election campaigns. We see that in \npolls. We hear that in town meetings. We certainly read that in the \neditorials in the great majority of our daily newspapers.\n  Proposition No. 2. The title of this bill is the Senate Campaign \nFinance Reform Act of 1996.\n  Conclusion. We should pass this bill. People want campaign finance \nreform. This is campaign finance reform, therefore, it should become \nlaw.\n  Only, incidentally, to this point in the debate has the actual \ncontent of the bill been discussed, and almost not at all have the \nproponents discussed the similar debate that took place more than 20 \nyears ago that resulted in our present campaign finance law, passed on \nthe basis of precisely the syllogism that is presented to us today. In \n1974 people did not like the way in which campaigns were being financed \nand run. A number of Members in both Houses proposed what they called \ncampaign finance reform, and the Congress passed it.\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n  Mr. President, one might ask Members of Congress to look at a little \nbit of history. I am convinced that if we were to open up the \nCongressional Record for those debates, somewhat more than 20 years \nago, every one of the same propositions you have heard here this \nafternoon were presented: There is too much money in politics. We do \nnot have enough people involved in it. We have to make a set of reforms \nin order to restore trust in the process.\n\n  Mr. President, is there more trust in the process today than there \nwas in 1974? I think not. Are there fewer complaints about the process \ntoday than there were in 1974? I think not. Are there more self-\nfinanced millionaire candidates today than there were in 1974? I \nbelieve there are. Are there more independent expenditures, attempts to \ninfluence voting behavior by those who are not directly connected with \nthe candidates themselves? The answer to that question, Mr. President, \nis there are infinitely more.\n  And so what is the proposal of the proponents of this bill? ``Let's \ndo more of what we did in 1974. Let's impose more restrictions on the \nprocess than we imposed then. Let's limit more significantly what can \ntake place in an open and disorderly political world than we did in \n1974.'' All we need is more of what has failed for more than 20 years.\n  I have looked through this proposal, and I do not think I am \nexaggerating to say that I believe that I find the heart of the \nphilosophy of the proponents in section 201. I think I can quote it in \nits entirety. It is on page 31 of the bill, Mr. President.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, no person \n     other than an individual or a political committee may make a \n     contribution to a candidate or candidate's authorized \n     committee.\n\n  No person, other than an individual or political committee may make a \ncontribution to the political process. And then, Mr. President, I get \nout my copy of the Constitution of the United States, and in amendment \nI, I read, ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of \nspeech.'' And I weigh those two propositions against one another.\n  I see a group of proponents who really, in the world of politics and \nthe expression of political opinion, do not like the first amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States. So they say that any political \ncampaign through a candidate, no person other than an individual or an \nauthorized committee--authorized by law, passed by this Congress--can \nmake any contribution to a candidate.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are all quite correctly frequently quoting or \nremembering the great French observer of more than a century and a half \nago, Alexis de Tocqueville, who found the genius of the United States \nof America to consist of free association. De Tocqueville talked about \nthis country as being a place in which people got together voluntarily \nin organizations to build a church or to found an antislavery society \nor to organize a group of immigrants to the new West or to do any of \n1,000 or 10,000 other activities. Our genius was voluntary association. \nIn fact, some of the most thoughtful and cogent criticisms of the \nSoviet Union in its heyday was that it prohibited voluntary \nassociation--prevented voluntary associations of people for charitable \npurposes, for religious purposes, but above all, Mr. President, for \npolitical purposes.\n  The heart of this bill makes it illegal for a group of persons to get \ntogether to make a contribution to a political campaign for the U.S. \nSenate. If the Senator from Kentucky and I want to get together and \nform an association to promote the election of a candidate for the U.S. \nSenate in his State or my State or any other State, we will be \nviolating the law if this bill becomes law. We could do it as \nindividuals, but only with this tiny amount of money that has, \neffectively, been cut by two-thirds since the 1974 law was passed. Of \ncourse, as much as the proponents of this legislation dislike the first \namendment, they cannot repeal it. They absolutely cannot prevent the \nSenator from Kentucky and me from getting together and forming this \norganization and going out quite independently to educate the people of \none of these States about the misdeeds of an incumbent, or the glories \nof some other candidate. Mr. President, if they could, they would. That \nis the philosophy of this bill. They think that any organization of \nindividuals is a great evil that should be prevented from engaging in \ncampaigns for the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Washington indicated it would be \nillegal under the bill for citizens to form together and form a \npolitical action committee and submit a candidate. But is it not true \nif an individual does it, they better do it early, because once the \nspeech limit has been achieved, even the individual is shut out of the \npolitical process, is he not?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. He and I, under \nthis hypothetical, would not be able in, say, the last 2 weeks before a \ngeneral election to make any such contribution if the candidate whom we \npropose to support had already reached the limits provided in this law \nand agreed to come under its provisions.\n  As I say, we could not be prevented from our own independent action \nin that connection. But even the elaborate superstructure, which might \nto a certain extent lift the restrictions on the other candidate, would \nlikely come too late if we ourselves were late.\n\n  I find it fascinating that this bill is being debated on this floor, \nconsidering the way in which we see politics has been practiced in the \nlast 6 or 8 months in the United States. We have had literally tens of \nmillions of dollars spent in the most thinly veiled attack on \nincumbents, mostly in the House of Representatives, who supported last \nyear's balanced budget--tens of millions of dollars. I am particularly \nsensitive to those attacks because so many of the victims are freshmen \nMembers of Congress from my own State.\n  Yet the definitions in this bill do not constitute those labor \nattacks on these incumbents as either contributions to their opponents \nor, for that matter, independent action, because they very carefully do \nnot advocate their defeat in so many words or the election of their \nopponent. These incumbents' hands, should this apply to the House, are \nabsolutely tied with respect to a response to those advertisements \nwhich they feel--I think even the newspapers feel--grossly misstate \ntheir positions on issues.\n  This leads me, of course, to the second point. When you have a \nproposal--and assume for the purposes of this action the proposal is \nentirely constitutional--that limits the ability of one individual, a \ncandidate, or a group of individuals, the candidate and that \ncandidate's supporters, from effectively communicating their ideas to a \nlarge group of potential constituents in a country of more than 250 \nmillion people, what is the impact? The impact is, if there is less \npolitical communication, the political communication that is still \nallowed has a greater impact.\n  Now, what kind of political communication is absolutely allowed and \nnot remotely touched by this bill? Why, of course, the communication \nthat comes from editorial writers of the newspapers who have endorsed \nthe bill. It is a bonanza for the editors of the Los Angeles Times or \nthe New York Times or the Milwaukee Journal or the Portland Oregonian. \nThere are far fewer people to counter whatever it is they tell their \nreaders they ought to do. Nothing is provided to the candidate \ndisfavored by those newspapers in the way of being able to communicate \ncountervailing ideas.\n  At least at the founding of our Republic we could be fairly sure that \na town of 5,000 people had four newspapers to engage in that \ncommunication. Do we have that today? How does the disfavored candidate \nin the State of Kentucky deal with a series of editorials every day of \nthe week, and columns every day of the week, in the Louisville Courier \nJournal in favor of his opponent, against him under this bill? How can \nthat disfavored candidate possibly communicate under this bill?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator, of course, is entirely correct. It is \ntotally impossible to level the playing field--the argument that we \nalways hear by the proponents of this bill. As the Senator indicated, \nthe expression of newspapers, of course, is not impacted at\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nall; as a matter of fact, specifically exempted from expenditure. I \nwill just read this from the current law, which has not changed under \nthe bill:\n\n       The term ``expenditure'' does not include any news story, \n     commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities \n     of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other \n     periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or \n     controlled by any political party, political committee, or \n     candidate.\n\n  In other words, that kind of speech, which is enormously significant \nin the political discourse that surrounds any particular campaign year \nis completely outside of the speech limits imposed by this bill. The \nSenator from Washington is entirely correct, to the extent that the \nspeech of candidates is suppressed, the speech of others is enhanced.\n  Mr. GORTON. That enhancement applies not only to the newspapers, of \ncourse. Just to take an example of one of the great proponents of the \nbill, Common Cause. Its ability to communicate its ideas is not in any \nway restricted by this bill, nor, of course, could it be. But the \nability of a candidate who disagrees with the views of Common Cause, or \nthe Sierra Club, or the National Rifle Association, or the AFL-CIO, is \nseverely restricted and, as a matter of fact, may be rendered totally \nand entirely ineffective.\n  Now, the proponents of this bill have said this is a very narrow \nbill. It only applies to the Senate, for example, and not even to the \nHouse of Representatives--as if we will ever end up getting a law of \nthat nature. It does not apply to the Presidency. That was a statement \nmade recently by, I think, the Senator from Arizona, which is entirely \ncorrect. It does not. But the philosophy behind the bill, that there is \njust too much free speech in politics today, is absolutely identical. \nSo I think it not at all unfair, Mr. President, to say that we are \nfaced today, right now, without any change in the present law at all, \nunder present laws that stem exactly from the philosophy behind this \nbill, with the absolutely absurd situation in which there is only one \nperson in the United States of America who may not raise money to \ncommunicate his ideas to the people of the United States, and that \nperson is Robert Dole.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Not at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will not yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, under this bill, Robert Dole, at this \npoint, is in exactly the position of one of the volunteer candidates \nfor the U.S. Senate. A year ago, or a year and a half ago, whenever the \nkey time was, he determined that he would operate under certain \ncampaign restrictions in return, in his case, for a direct subsidy from \nthe Federal Treasury. In the case of this bill, oh, no, not a direct \nsubsidy, no taxpayer money here. We just take it away from private \nenterprise, people who own television stations, or from the public and \npostal fees. He made that determination. He did not realize at that \ntime that he was going to end up with an opponent who would ignore \nthese limitations and spend $40 million of his own money attacking him \nso that in order to survive through a group of primaries, he had to \nspend money he had not intended to spend. So he finds himself in a \nsituation in which the other candidate for President of the United \nStates, with all of the advantages that incumbency has, with $18 \nmillion, I think, left to spend directly on his campaign, is spending \nat least some of it harassing the opposing candidate for overspending \non his allotment.\n\n  So we have campaign election reform. Boy, we have it coming out of \nour ears in the field of the Presidency of the United States, the net \nresult of which is that one of the two major candidates cannot campaign \neffectively between now and August.\n  This is a triumph of election law reform? This is a triumph for the \nfirst amendment of the Constitution of the United States? I do not \nthink so, Mr. President. But this is exactly what they want to do to \nthe U.S. Senate in this bill.\n  Presumably, the great evil is that there is too much in the way of \ncommunication of ideas and the people of America are too stupid to be \nable to figure out who to vote for if we have a free exercise of our \nfirst amendment rights and the ability to communicate those ideas \nthrough groups, including the groups we have voluntarily chosen to \njoin. Some of the most severe restrictions in this bill are on what \npolitical parties can do, Mr. President, for their own candidates.\n  Now, I do not think there is a single State in the United States of \nAmerica in which the political party of a candidate for the U.S. Senate \ndoes not appear beside his or her name on the ballot. For the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, it says Democrat, and for the Senator from Kentucky, it \nsays Republican right on the ballot when you go in to vote. Yet, \nsomehow or another, receiving more than a modest degree of financial \nsupport or direct expenditures from one's political party is deemed by \nthe sponsors of this bill to be corrupting in nature.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not understand that. I absolutely fail to \nunderstand the theory behind that limitation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from Washington knows, that very issue \nis currently before the Supreme Court, as to whether or not it is even \nconstitutional to restrict what parties can do on behalf of their \ncandidates, an absurd restriction on its face.\n  There has been much discussion out here on the floor about the \nadvantages of incumbency. We know that political parties will support \nchallengers. If we wanted to have the right kind of campaign finance \nreform, one of the first things we ought to do--and I am sure my friend \nfrom Washington would agree--is take the shackles off, if the Court \ndoes not do it for us, take the shackles off of the one institution of \nAmerican politics that will support a challenger every time.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is the party to which the challenger belongs and \nwhich can certainly make the determination, which was so eloquently \noutlined by the Senator from Wisconsin, as to whether or not that \nchallenger is a serious one and has a real opportunity for victory. So \nif we have no limits on the amount of money----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. In a few minutes, I will.\n  If we have no limits on the amount of money the political party could \ncontribute, we would certainly benefit the challengers. Of course, \nthere might be a degree of loyalty on the part of the elected candidate \nto his or her own political party, the party with whom he or she \nidentifies, from the beginning of his or her candidacy. No, Mr. \nPresident, I think it comes right back down to the way with which I \nbegan these remarks.\n  The heart of this bill--and of the other provisions that move in the \nsame direction--is that no person, other than an individual or \npolitical candidate, may make a contribution to a candidate. That is \nthe heart of this bill. You cannot make a contribution to a candidate \nunless you do it in strict accordance with this bill.\n  It is against the first amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates that says ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the \nfreedom of speech.''\n  If that law does not abridge the freedom of speech, it is impossible \nfor me to devise one that does.\n  If the Senator wishes to ask a question, I would be happy to answer.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This Senator is intrigued by the Senator's discussion \nof newspapers and the roles of the newspapers today in the context of \nthis bill passing and becoming law. All I hear around the country is \nthat the newspapers have lost their clout and that they do not compare \nwith television, cable TV, and the like.\n  My question is: If it is the case that newspapers somehow have this \npower, why do not campaigns spend a lot of money on newspaper \nadvertising to counteract?\n  I would suggest--and it would be an interesting response--that the \ninfluence of newspapers is absolutely minuscule. Regrettably the \ninfluence of these editorial writers is minuscule compared to the power \nof television. I would suggest that is the reason that 75 or 80 percent \nof almost every Senate campaign spends its money on television.\n  I would be interested in why suddenly newspapers have reached the\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\npower that they have lost over the years.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am convinced that the Senator from Wisconsin has made \nan excellent point, and I suspect that however we may disagree on some \nelements of campaigning that he probably did not spend an awful lot of \nmoney in his campaign on newspaper advertising. And I can assure him \nthat I did not either for exactly the reasons that he outlined.\n  I guess to take the least important part of my answer first, my \nanswer would be there is a difference between newspaper advertising and \nnewspaper editorial support. All of us, even when we were not spending \nmoney in a particular newspaper, sought the editorial support of the \nnewspapers in our States. The next level of my answer to his question \nis, of course, even though that influence has declined in recent year--\nI think clearly it has--this bill would clearly restore it.\n  The fundamental point that I was making is that, if you restrict the \namount of information that people have about elections, those elements \nof information that they get will be proportionately more important. If \nthe candidate is severely limited in the amount of communication that \nhe can effectively engage in through newspapers, or through television, \nor through any other mass media, the impact of what the media \nthemselves do either in their news columns or in their editorial \ncolumns will be increased.\n  But the most significant point that the Senator from Wisconsin causes \nme to make is that I really used newspapers as a shorthand for the way \nin which we communicate today. I suspect that the Senator from \nWisconsin might not even have asked me the question if I had \nsubstituted for newspapers the NBC television outlet in his city, or \nfor that matter NBC, or ABC, or a number of other television outlets in \nthe country as a whole. While they have certain rules on blatant \neditorialization, there is not one of them who has not experienced what \nhe or she considers to be an absolutely unfair or distorted news story \non television which can have a devastating, or for that matter a \ntremendously affirmative, impact on the attitudes of people toward a \ncampaign.\n\n  And what this bill does is to say that no matter how devastating that \ntelevision news story is on a particular campaign, the victim, the \ndisfavored candidate, is not going to be able to effectively respond to \nit. None of the benefits of this bill accrues under those \ncircumstances. And the limitations are such that the attack is almost \ncertain to go unanswered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I could ask one more question, is it \na fair characterization for the Senator to say that the loss of the \nlast 2 years or decades of relative influence of newspapers vis-a-vis \ntelevision may be changed by this bill? Is it fairly characterizing his \nremarks as suggesting that newspapers may gain a greater influence than \nthey have under the current system?\n  I believe that was the gist of the Senator's remarks.\n  Mr. GORTON. No. The gist of my remarks was that newspapers would gain \nvis-a-vis television. It will be that both will gain vis-a-vis the \nability of the candidate to project his or her own idea.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Have newspapers regained some of the ground they have \nlost in terms of influence?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am not sure television has ever lost ground.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. But newspapers will regain some of the ground they have \nlost in terms of the influence. I believe that was one of the Senator's \npoints.\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe that is the case simply because there will be \nless in the way of alternate communication under this bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will summarize. I know the Senator from \nIllinois has not had an opportunity to speak yet. He has waited almost \nas long as I did to get that opportunity. I will once again return to \nwhat I began with.\n  So far the arguments, as I have heard them on the floor here today, \nare that the polls, the newspapers, and the people do not like the \npresent system, and they want campaign election reform. This \nproposition 2--this bill is entitled ``Campaign Election Reform.'' \nConclusion: We should pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that to be the case. This bill will \nnot end up restoring confidence in the political system. It will force \nmoney into different channels, channels which neither this bill nor any \nother bill can control, one for which the candidates will be less \nresponsible, and not more I think responsible in any respect \nwhatsoever.\n  The Senator from Utah in beginning this debate said that the \nappropriate solution was not limitation but disclosure. I agree with \nhim. That is the thrust of an opinion based by Larry Sabato, a \npolitical scientist at the University of Virginia which is frequently \nquoted on these subjects.\n  Mr. President, we should be willing to trust the American people, as \nhe puts it, with sorting out their own ideas as long as they know the \nsource of those ideas and the source of the money to communicate those \nideas. That is appropriate election reform. The Senator from Arizona \nsaid, ``Well, why don't you put it up as an amendment after voting for \ncloture on this bill?'' Mr. President, I think I can announce to him \nthat it would be a nongermane amendment if cloture were granted on this \nbill and on this amendment. It goes way beyond the scope of the bill--\nthe bill and the amendment itself--because it goes to the current \nelection as a whole.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. He will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I assure the Senator right now that I will agree to a \nunanimous consent request, a motion, if cloture is invoked, that any \namendment that the Senator from Washington wanted to impose I would \nagree to.\n  Second of all, if I could just comment, the Senator knows what \nsection 324 means: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, no \nperson, other than an individual or political candidate, may make a \ncontribution. The Senator knows that unions cannot contribute directly \nright now. Corporations cannot contribute directly right now, and all \nit does is say political action committees cannot contribute right now, \nand the reason political action committees should not be allowed to \ncontribute is because the system in America is so skewed and so unfair \nthat no challenger has a chance.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, if the challengers were voting \ntoday, I say to the Senator from Washington that this bill would be \npassed in a New York minute.\n  So the fact is that what this does is it bans political action \ncommittees. It does not ban individuals. We have already placed \nrestrictions on free speech by limiting the amount that an individual \ncan contribute.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Washington that perhaps it is a \ngreat idea just to have total disclosure and complete freedom as far as \nany contribution is concerned. This bill does require disclosure. This \nbill does require soft money to become hard money, and it also places \nsome reasonable restraints, and they are voluntary. They are voluntary.\n  We have the Congressional Research Service and other constitutional \nopinions stating that this is constitutional. I respect the Senator's \nopinion, but I certainly cannot allow him to get by with saying we are \nrestricting anyone's freedom of speech when we ban political action \ncommittees where the common practice is that the Senator from \nWashington and I go to a lunch someplace, dinner here someplace in \nWashington, and are given a $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 \ncheck or groups of checks. That is not exactly what our Founding \nFathers had in mind.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are at the heart of the matter now. The \nSenator from Arizona does not like the way in which first amendment \nrights are conducted or exercised at the present time. He therefore \nwants to limit them. The genius of America in voluntary associations is \nto him somehow so repulsive that no voluntary association, no \nunincorporated, voluntary association in America, none whatsoever, is \ngoing to be allowed to contribute to a candidate--none. You cannot get \ntogether in America in a\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nvoluntary association and contribute to a candidate because he does not \nlike the distribution of money from political action committees.\n  Well, thank God for James Madison. Thank God for the prohibition on \nthe part of this Congress or any other Congress to abridge the right of \nfree speech just because this Senator does not like the way in which it \nis exercised at the present time.\n  The present law is bad, Mr. President. This law is worse.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for just a brief question?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington yields.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know the Senator from Washington is about to \ncomplete his remarks, and I missed part of the colloquy, but I gathered \nat the end, if I could ask the Senator from Washington, I guess his \nview of the bill is that certain kinds of speech are more worthy than \nothers. For example, would the Senator from Washington share my view \nthat this bill puts a premium on the following kinds of speech: going \ndown to a phone bank and volunteering your time or maybe putting yard \nsigns up or making a speech?\n  Mr. GORTON. As long as you do not pay for them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As long as you do not pay for them. So would the \nSenator from Washington agree that the bill attempts to set up certain \nkinds of preferred speech that would remain acceptable in the \npostlegislative environment but other kinds of speech are viewed as \nsomehow nefarious and therefore should fall under Government \nrestriction? Is that essentially the point?\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Well, it does, but in that case, in that situation, it \ndoes not differ from the general philosophy of the present law either \napplied to races for Congress or to the Presidency. The thrust of my \ncriticism was that 20 years ago, we went into this restriction of free \nspeech rights with all of the same criticisms of the then system that \nwe have now, that that law was going to restore confidence on the part \nof the American people in the system, and it is worse now and so their \ncure is more of the hair of the dog that bit you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Illinois yield to me for 30 seconds \nto respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from Kentucky and I can argue about constitutionality of \ncertain actions, and since we are in disagreement, then obviously at \nthat point we have to refer to people who have a dog in this fight, and \nI would like to submit for the Record at this time a Congressional \nResearch Service opinion from the Library of Congress, from Mr. L. \nPaige Whitaker, legislative attorney of the American Law Division, that \ndeclares our proposals, which the Senator from Washington was so \nroundly critical of and so astute in fashioning himself as a \nconstitutional scholar, are viewed to be constitutional.\n  Second, Mr. President, we do have also various opinions from people \nlike Archibald Cox, Mr. Daniel Lowenstein, professor of law at the \nUniversity of California, at Los Angeles, and others, all of which say \nthat the provisions of this bill are, indeed, constitutional. The \nSenator from Washington can certainly be offended by them if he does \nnot like them, but the view of most constitutional scholars on this \nissue is that it is constitutional.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to enter those into the \nRecord at this time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record the \nopinion from the Congressional Research Service. I will save the others \nas they are needed. I yield and thank my friend from Illinois.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 1996.\n     To: Senator Russell Feingold; Attention, Andy Kutler.\n     From: L. Paige Whitaker, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of Campaign Finance Reform \n         Proposals.\n\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for a constitutional analysis of three campaign finance \n     reform proposals:\n\n\n I. Constitutionality of a voluntary spending limit system linked with \npublic benefits in the form of free and discounted television time and \n                        discounted postage rates\n\n       In the 1976 landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo,\\1\\ the \n     Supreme Court held that spending limitations violate the \n     First Amendment because they impose direct, substantial \n     restraints on the quantity of political speech. The Court \n     found that expenditure limitations fail to serve any \n     substantial government interest in stemming the reality of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof and that they heavily \n     burden political expression.\\2\\ As a result of Buckley, \n     spending limits may only be imposed if they are voluntary.\n       It appears that the provision in question would pass \n     constitutional muster for the same reasons that the public \n     financing scheme for presidential elections was found to be \n     constitutional in Buckley. The Court in Buckley concluded \n     that presidential public financing was within the \n     constitutional powers of Congress to reform the electoral \n     process and that public financing provisions did not violate \n     any First Amendment rights by abridging, restricting, or \n     censoring speech, expression, and association, but rather \n     encouraged public discussion and participation in the \n     electoral process.\\3\\ Indeed, the Court succinctly stated:\n       ``Congress may engage in public financing of election \n     campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an \n     agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure \n     limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the \n     size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide \n     to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.'' \\4\\\n       Because the subject provision does not require a Senate \n     candidate to comply with spending limits, the proposal \n     appears to be voluntary. Although the incentives of public \n     benefits are provided, in the form of reduced and free \n     broadcast time and reduced postage rates to those candidates \n     who comply with the spending limits, such incentives do not \n     appear to jeopardize the voluntary nature of the limitation. \n     That is, a candidate could legally choose not to comply with \n     the limits by opting not to accept the public benefits. \n     Therefore, it appears that the proposal would be found to be \n     constitutional under Buckley.\n\n\n   II. Constitutionality of requiring candidates who are voluntarily \n     complying with spending limits to raise at least 60% of their \n   individual contributions from individuals within their home state\n\n       A voluntary restriction on Senate candidates to raise at \n     least 60% of their individual contributions from individuals \n     within their home state, with incentives for candidates to \n     comply with the ban, would also appear to be constitutional. \n     In exchange for voluntarily complying with the restriction on \n     instate contributions, a congressional candidate could \n     receive such public benefits as free and reduced television \n     time and reduced postage rates. This type of voluntary \n     restriction would most likely be upheld for the same reasons \n     that the Supreme Court in Buckley upheld a voluntary spending \n     limits system linked with public financing.\n       Here, in the subject proposal, as limitations on out-of-\n     state contributions are linked to public benefits as part of \n     the eligibility requirement, they would seem to be \n     constitutional for the same reasons that similar eligibility \n     requirements of the receipt of public funds were held to be \n     constitutional in Buckley v. Valeo.\\5\\ In exchange for public \n     benefits, participating Senate candidates would voluntarily \n     choose to limit the sources of their contributions. In \n     addition, an out-of-state contribution limit would not seen \n     to violate the First Amendment rights of out-of-state \n     contributors as they would have other outlets, such as \n     through independent expenditures, to engage in political \n     speech in support of such candidates who voluntarily restrict \n     receipt of out-of-state contributions.\n\n\n III. Constitutionality of prohibiting all political action committees \n       (PACs) from making contributions, soliciting or receiving \ncontributions, or making expenditures for the purpose of influencing a \n                            federal election\n\n       Generally, the term political action committee (PAC) is \n     used to refer to two different types of committees: connected \n     and nonconnected. A connected PAC, also known as a separate \n     segregated fund, is established and administered by an \n     organization such as corporation or labor union.\\6\\ A \n     nonconnected PAC, on the other hand, is one which is \n     unaffiliated with any federal office candidate, party \n     committee, labor organization, or corporation, although it \n     can be established and administered by persons who are labor \n     union members or corporate employees. Typically, nonconnected \n     PACs may be established by\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\n     individuals, persons, groups, including even labor union \n     members, corporate employees, officers, and stockholders, \n     their families, and by persons who collectively work to \n     promote a certain ideology; provided, however, that they keep \n     their political funds separate and apart from any corporate \n     or labor union funds and accounts. They are required to \n     register with the Federal Election Commission after receiving \n     or expending in excess of $1,000 within a calendar year, they \n     are subject to contribution limitations, and, unlike \n     connected PACs, they are limited to using only those funds \n     they solicit to cover establishment and administration costs. \n     \\7\\\n       A complete ban on contributions and expenditures by \n     connected and nonconnected PACs would appear to be \n     unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment. \n     Although the courts have not had occasion to address \n     specifically this issue, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court made it clear that the right to associate is a ``basic \n     constitutional freedom'' \\8\\ and that any action which may \n     have the effect of curtailing that freedom to associate would \n     be subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\\9\\ The Court \n     further asserted that while the right of political \n     association is not absolute,\\10\\ it can only be limited by \n     substantial governmental interests such as the prevention of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof. \\11\\\n       Employing this analysis, the Court in Buckley determined \n     that any limitations on expenditures of money in federal \n     elections were generally unconstitutional because they \n     substantially and directly restrict the ability of \n     candidates, individuals, and associations to engage in \n     political speech, expression, and association. \\12\\ ``A \n     restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached,'' the \n     Court noted. \\13\\ Therefore, in view of Buckley, it appears \n     that completely banning expenditures by nonconnected PACs \n     would be found to be unconstitutional.\n       In Buckley the Court found that limitations on \n     contributions can pass constitutional muster only if they are \n     reasonable and only marginally infringe on First Amendment \n     rights in order to stem actual or apparent corruption \n     resulting from quid pro quo relationships between \n     contributors and candidates. \\14\\ The Court noted that a \n     reasonable contribution limitation does ``not undermine to \n     any material degree the potential for robust and effective \n     discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual \n     citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, \n     and political parties.'' \\15\\ Hence, Buckley seems to \n     indicate that a complete ban on contributions by nonconnected \n     PACs would be unconstitutional. Such an outright prohibition \n     would arguably impose direct and substantial restraints on \n     the quantity of political speech and political communication \n     between nonconnected PACs and federal candidates.\n       In sum, it appears that prohibiting all expenditures by \n     PACs would not pass strict judicial scrutiny as it would \n     significantly restrict most PACs from effectively amplifying \n     the voices of their adherents or members. \\16\\ Moreover, an \n     outright ban on contributions, although they are less \n     protected by the First Amendment, would probably be found to \n     substantially infringe on the First Amendment rights of the \n     members of the PACs and therefore be found to be \n     unconstitutional as well.\n                                                L. Paige Whitaker,\n                                             Legislative Attorney.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ 424 U.S. 1 (1976).\n     \\2\\ Id. at 39.\n     \\3\\ Id. at 90-93.\n     \\4\\ Id. at 57, fn. 65.\n     \\5\\ Id. at 90-92, 94-96.\n     \\6\\ 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my friend from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am just a little puzzled by the round \ncondemnation of the PAC ban provision, especially given the fallback \nprovisions that we have included in the bill, because in 1993, Senator \nPressler offered an amendment 372, which is virtually identical to our \nprovision, and it was supported and voted for by the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Kentucky. They voted for this PAC ban \nwith the fallback provision. I am a little puzzled as to why this can \nbe such a central problem in this bill when it was worthy enough for \ntheir support just 2 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I think the comments of my friend and esteemed colleague \nfrom Washington underscore something I have learned in 22 years here. I \nam a slow learner. I have not learned much, but one of the things I \nhave learned is every reform ultimately needs a reform. That is one of \nthe laws you can put down and it almost always is the case.\n  I commend my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin, Senator McCain \nand Senator Feingold, for their foresight and their courage in offering \nthis legislation.\n  This is not an abridgement of free speech. The reality is we have \nrestrictions. If someone in the gallery right now decides they want to \nmake a speech here, the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Idaho, is \ngoing to say, ``No, you cannot.'' That is not unconstitutional. So we \nhave sensible restraints in our society.\n  The other day I saw a bumper sticker here in Washington that tells \nsomething of the public mood. It was a little bumper sticker that says, \n``Invest in America. Buy a Congressman.'' Kind of a sad commentary on \nwhere some people think we are.\n  I do not believe you can buy a Congressman, but I think we have a \nsystem that warps the results of this body.\n  I thought Senator Wellstone's speech was outstanding. I am sorry I \ndid not hear the others. I hope political science teachers around the \ncountry will read it and give it to their classes.\n  Frequently people who visit here, Mr. President, are astounded at the \nfew numbers of Senators who are on the floor. I think they would be \nmore astounded and more outraged if they knew this fact--and I cannot \nprove it right now, but I am reasonably sure it is true--right now, \nthis minute, there are more Senators raising money than are on the \nfloor of the Senate. I believe that to be the truth. It is a usurpation \nof the time that we ought to be devoting to issues, to be going out \nraising money. It affects all of us. I have never promised anyone a \nthing for a campaign contribution. But if I end up at midnight in a \nhotel and there are 20 phone calls waiting for me, 19 of them from \nnames I do not recognize, the 20th is someone who gave me a $1,000 \ncampaign contribution--at midnight I am not going to make 20 phone \ncalls. I might make one. Which one do you think I am going to make? The \nreality is you feel a sense of gratitude to people who are generous \nenough, and obviously wise enough, to contribute to your campaign. But \nit means that the financially articulate have inordinate access to \npolicymakers.\n\n  I can remember before I ran for reelection in 1990, just before we \nformed the new Congress, that two key members of my staff came to me \nand said, ``You ought to shift over to the Finance Committee.'' Why did \nthey want me to shift over to the Finance Committee from Labor and \nHuman Resources or the Judiciary Committee or the Foreign Relations \nCommittee? So I could raise more money.\n  That is a practical reality around here. Even beyond that reality, \nwhen people come into my office or they are on the phone and they ask \nme to vote for or against something and they have been generous to me, \nI sometimes wonder, ``Are they going away thinking I agree with them \nbecause of the contribution?'' That distorts things. This whole \ndistortion concerns me.\n  I can remember when I voted for NAFTA, a group of people who said \nthey had been major contributors to me almost implied I had been bought \nand how could I possibly vote for NAFTA? The process just distorts \neverything.\n  I spoke here about 2 hours ago on the west Capitol steps to the PTA. \nThey are here, interested in getting more money for education. My \nfriends, what if the PTA and the other groups like that had as much \nmoney to contribute as the defense industry? Would we have a different \nbudget today? You bet we would have a different budget today. We would \nhave appreciably more spent on education, which is in the national \ninterest.\n  This bill does not solve every problem. It does not go as far as I \nwould like to see us go. But it certainly is a\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nstep forward. Why is this Nation the only one of the Western \nindustrialized nations not to provide health care protection for all of \nour citizens? Mr. President, 41 million Americans do not have health \ncare coverage. Those 41 million Americans are not big contributors. The \ninsurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, the people who \nprofit from the present system are the big contributors, and we are \nletting this system just roll on.\n  Mr. President, 24 percent of our children are living in poverty. No \nother Western industrialized nation is anywhere close to that. This is \nnot an act of God. This is not some divine intervention that says \nchildren in America have to live in poverty more than children in Italy \nor Denmark or France or other countries. It is a result of flawed \npolicy. It is a result of policy that is disproportionately responsive \nto those who can finance campaigns. The 24 percent of our children who \nlive in poverty, their parents are not contributing to our campaigns. \nThat is the reality. So, we do not pay as much attention to them as we \nshould.\n  One of the arguments I have heard against this is the least valid of \nall the arguments against it, and that is if we change this, that would \nbe unfair to nonincumbents. Let me tell you, no system is better for \nincumbents than the system we have right now. We occasionally have \npeople who win who spend less. I am looking at two of them, Senator \nFeingold and Senator Wellstone. But they are the rare exception. I \nmanaged to do that in my first Senate campaign, too. But, generally, \nincumbents under the present system have a huge advantage, and \nincumbents tend to think whatever system got us elected has to be a \npretty good system.\n\n  Let me, finally, say I announced right after the last election I was \nnot going to run for reelection. I felt it was time for me to move on \nand do other things. Not the major consideration, but a consideration, \nwas that in my last election I had raised $8.4 million. I enjoy \npolicymaking. I even, unlike a lot of my colleagues, enjoy campaigning. \nI enjoy going down the streets of small towns as well as Chicago and \nelsewhere, campaigning. I do not enjoy fundraising because I think it \nis distasteful, and I think many, many people understand it is \ndistorting our system.\n  So I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I think it \nmoves us in a direction we ought to be going. It is a step in the right \ndirection. For my friend from Washington, who said the present bill, \nthe reform adopted in 1974, is not working as it should, I would not \nlike to see the present law repealed, weak as it is. My guess is my \nfriend from Washington would not want to see it repealed either. This \nis a step forward. It is a step the Nation needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1219, \nthe Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996. Let me first praise \nboth the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin for being \nable to reconcile what I know are substantial differences and produce a \npiece of legislation that both of them support. I believe the exercise \nthey went through is an exercise all of us need to go through if we are \ngoing to be able to change the law that underlies our campaign system. \nIt seems to me it is very, very important for us to do so.\n  First, as to why, I know there are very strong feelings. I caught a \npiece of the debate thus far between the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Washington and the Senator from Arizona. I know there are \nvery strong feelings about campaign finance reform. Very often, it is \ntrue, the facts do not bear up the conclusion people make about the \nsystem being corrupted and being bad and so forth. It is very often \ntrue the perceptions are far, far worse than the reality.\n  But as we all know, perceptions in politics can become reality in a \nbig hurry. We all, I suspect, are aware that last summer, on the 11th \nof June, the two most powerful political leaders in the country, the \nPresident of the United States and the Speaker of the House, stood in \nClaremont, NH, in the runup to the Presidential primary, took a \nquestion from the audience about campaign finance reform, and agreed, \nshook hands and agreed that they were going to cooperate in the \nappointment of a commission that would make recommendations. We all \nknow since that time nothing has happened.\n  Also last summer, I read--and I asked staff, and they dug it out for \nme--a poll that was presented to me that I had presented asking the \nAmerican people the following question: Who they thought really \ncontrolled the Federal Government in Washington, DC. That was last \nsummer, summer of 1995. Twenty-five percent said they thought the \nRepublicans in Congress, since they are in control of both the House \nand Senate, the Republicans control the Congress; 6 percent said the \nDemocrats controlled the Congress; interestingly, 6 percent thought the \nPresident controlled the Federal Government; and 49 percent, up from 38 \npercent in 1991, said special interests controlled Washington, DC.\n  Again, I appreciate that much of this is a perception, but it is a \nvery serious perception for us. People have lost trust and confidence, \nand they are asking for us to level the playing field, give \nnonincumbents a greater opportunity to clean up our campaign finance \nsystem.\n  I actually heard very few people come to the floor and say the system \ndoes not need to be changed. The problem is that we always find \nourselves coming up short, unable to finally reach agreement, which is \nwhy, again, I praise the hard work that the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin have done because they sat down and worked \nout their differences. I suspect they still have some things about the \nbill they are not wildly enthusiastic about, but they know it is long \npast the time that we are going to be excused by the American people \nfor giving them some excuses.\n  Mr. President, Nebraska has a connection between campaign finance \nreform and the history of campaign finance reform. We are connected \nbecause we had a son of the State, William Jennings Bryan, running for \nPresident in 1896. He was leading his opponent, William McKinley, until \na man by the name of Mark Hanna, the Cleveland industrialist who was \nthe top adviser to Republican nominee William McKinley and who also \nchaired the Republican National Committee, raised and spent money, at \nthat time, in unprecedented amounts.\n  He spent $100,000 of his own money, which would be well over a \nmillion dollars today, on preconvention expenses for McKinley.\n  He organized and funded the distribution of 100 million campaign \ndocuments to what was then a nation of 71 million Americans and 14 \nmillion voters.\n  He established for the first time a line of clear national authority \nover the State party committees, which carried out his orders.\n  More important, he augmented the old party fundraising system. The \nold system was to send your political appointees a note saying, ``Two \npercent of your salary is the amount. Please remit promptly.''\n  But Hanna also went to the wealthy industrialists who most feared the \nfree-silver policy of William Jennings Bryan. In August 1896, he met \nwith New York's financial barons and assessed them according to their \ncapital.\n  J.P. Morgan gave $250,000; Standard Oil $250,000; Chicago's giant \nmeatpackers gave $400,000.\n  In the end, Hanna raised almost $3.5 million for McKinley, although \nhe never did say how much he raised, but it was enough for him to crush \nBryan in the general election, outspending him nearly 20 to 1 and \nresulting in McKinley's victory.\n  Until the 1970's, Mr. President, our campaign finance laws were \nmostly futile efforts to stem the flood of money into politics.\n\n  Lest I be completely unbalanced and reference only Republicans doing \nit, it was a progressive Republican who followed McKinley into the \nWhite House, Theodore Roosevelt, who proposed the public funding of \nelections in his 1907 State of the Union Address, but his proposal went \nforgotten for 60 years.\n  Congress passed the Tillman Act of 1907, also backed by Theodore \nRoosevelt, which barred corporations and banks from contributing to \ncampaigns. In 1925, it passed the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. But \nthese laws did little to stem the tide of money in politics, which had \nbecome, at that time, very much a bipartisan problem.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\n  In 1932, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, John \nRaskob, the former finance chairman of General Motors, gave about \n$500,000 a year of his own money to fund the Democratic Party and gave \nnearly $150,000 alone to the campaign of Franklin Roosevelt.\n  The year 1940 saw the rise of a young Texas Congressman named Lyndon \nJohnson. He revitalized what at the time was a very moribund Democratic \nCongressional Campaign Committee, with money raised from the oil and \nconstruction barons who dominated the politics of his State.\n  Mr. President, I laid that down, and much more can be laid in this \ndebate, to indicate that there is generally a sort of history of \nlawlessness about campaign finance reform that should be noted when \nthis debate is going on.\n  The system of funding campaigns is dramatically different. The system \nitself is much, much cleaner than it was 100 years ago or even 30 years \nago. But, again, the perception still dominates in the land that \nspecial interests control our legislative process, and that seems to me \nto be the most important argument for changing our law.\n  Laws which currently govern our system of campaign finance were \npassed in the 1970's.\n  There was the Revenue Act of 1971, which introduced public funding of \nPresidential campaigns, as well as voluntary limits on campaign \nspending.\n  The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 set up our system of \ndisclosing contributors and of providing broadcast time to candidates \nat the lowest unit rate.\n  The scandal of Watergate later on caused Congress to pass the Federal \nElection Campaign Act Amendments of 1974. These amendments created the \nFederal Election Commission; they established individual and PAC \ncontribution limits; they established public funding of Presidential \nprimaries and political conventions; and they limited the amounts that \nindividuals could spend on their own campaigns, a provision which would \nlater be ruled unconstitutional as a violation of the first amendment \nby the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 1976 and again in 1979, Congress passed additional amendments to \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act. These amendments addressed the \nconstitutional problems of the 1971 and 1974 legislation and expanded \nthe role of the political parties under the law.\n  But since then, efforts by Congress to pass laws that would reform \nthe system failed.\n  Mr. President, I believe when more than 50 percent of the American \npeople believe that special interests control the Federal Government \nand when the two most powerful politicians in America meet in New \nHampshire before the first Presidential primary and promise with a \nhandshake to do something to change the law, that we would expect to \nsee some action. The lack of action reinforces the view that Americans \nhave of their Government.\n\n  The American people are frustrated by our delay. They are frustrated \nwith the political process that appears to respond to those with \neconomic power and which, all too often, ignores the needs of working \nmen and women.\n  They are frustrated with the rising cost of campaigns, with a \npolitical system which closes the door to people of average means who \nalso want to serve their country in the U.S. Congress.\n  They are frustrated with a Congress which, in their minds, has been \nbought and paid for. I serve in the Senate, Mr. President, and I know \nmy colleagues to be men and women of honor, but I can hardly blame the \nAmerican people for believing that we are not.\n  They see millions of dollars that go into our campaigns. They read \nthe newspapers and see pictures of lobbyists huddling outside our \nChamber with cellular phones, and the citizens wonder whose voice is \nbeing heard. They think the men with the cellular phones have first \npriority.\n  The American people are frustrated with our tendency to talk instead \nof act. Eliza Doolittle, in the musical ``My Fair Lady,'' sang a verse \nwhich captures how the American people feel about campaign finance \nreform. She sang:\n\n       Words, words, words. All I hear is words. If you love me, \n     show me.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to show the American people, not \nwith words but with action. With a single vote today or tomorrow, \nSenators can act to allow this issue to move front and center on the \npolitical stage. With this bipartisan bill, we can show the American \npeople that we mean what we say when we talk about political reform.\n  S. 1219 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and it also \namends the Communications Act of 1934. It has four simple titles, and I \nhave chosen to go through these titles and allow those who are \nlistening to make their own determination as to whether or not this \nwill improve the system.\n  Title I of the bill sets up a system of voluntary spending limits for \nprimary, general and runoff elections which are based upon State \npopulation. It also sets a voluntary limit on the amount of personal \nfunds which a candidate spends.\n  For example, let us say you have a woman citizen of this country who \nchallenges a male incumbent. The bill would provide benefits to this \ncandidate who would meet a threshold contribution requirement, and it \nworks within the bill's spending and fundraising limits. It would give \nher up to 30 minutes of free air time on television and allows her to \nbuy television time and send bulk mail at special low rates.\n\n  When she runs against someone who will not accept the bill's limits, \nwhether it is an incumbent or nonincumbent, it boosts her fundraising \nspending and maximum individual contribution limits so she can keep up \nwith her opponents. If her opponent pledges to obey the limits, and \nthen backs out, he is not only forced to pay back the benefits he \nreceived, but then has to start buying his television time at normal \ncommercial rates instead of the lowest unit rate that all candidates \nenjoy.\n  The bill requires candidates to raise 60 percent of their funds from \nresidents of their State, but allows candidates in our smaller States \nto meet that requirement by having 60 percent of their individual \ncontributors be in-State residents. This is a very sensible provision, \nMr. President, which prevents the small number of powerful economic \ninterests from dominating the Senate campaign politics of a given \nState.\n  Title II of the bill bans contributions from political action \ncommittees and provides that if the courts rule the ban \nunconstitutional, that the maximum contribution limit for PAC's will \ndrop from $5,000 to $1,000 per election. It bans national political \nparties from raising and spending soft money. It requires State and \nlocal parties to spend Federal money on activities that would affect \nFederal races. It prevents political parties from funding so-called \n501(c) organizations.\n  It allows State parties to raise funds under the control of the \nFederal Election Campaign Act for grassroots activities such as get-\nout-the-vote and generic ballot efforts. It requires corporations and \nunions that spend more than $10,000 for internal communications efforts \nto report their activity to the Federal Election Commission within 48 \nhours.\n  It restricts the bundling of contributions by counting those \ncontributions toward the bundler's individual contribution limit. It \nrequires those who make independent expenditures to report those \nexpenditures within a matter of hours.\n  Title III, Mr. President, codifies Federal Election Commission \nregulations which keep candidates from spending their campaign funds on \nthemselves. It requires the FEC to allow a candidate to file their \nreports electronically. It allows the FEC to conduct random audits upon \na vote of four of its members.\n  Further, it toughens the disclaimer requirements for television ads, \nsomething that almost every single Member has observed is very much in \nneed. It bans Members of Congress from using the franking privilege for \nmass mailing during the calendar year in which they are up for \nreelection.\n  Title IV, Mr. President, the bill's final title, provides for \nexpedited review of constitutional issues by the Supreme Court and \nauthorizes the Federal Election Commission to implement the bill's \nprovisions through regulations.\n  It is not a perfect bill, Mr. President. For example, my view is that \nPAC and bundling provisions do too much to limit the participation of \naverage men and women in America and too little to\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nrein in the big corporations which could stay beyond the reach of the \nlaw. But it is unquestionably a start, and a very important start. It \nshould not be the target of a filibuster. It should not be an occasion \nfor Senators to weep more crocodile tears and say, we support the \nconcept of reform, but we just cannot live with this or that particular \nproposal. The voters have heard that before, Mr. President. They know \nwhat it means.\n\n  It means we want to do nothing. It means we are worried about \nprotecting ourselves, when we ought to be worrying about protecting our \ndemocracy. The best test of this bill's success is whether it makes an \nincumbent Senator nervous. If it does, then it gets the job done.\n  We cannot afford to tell the voters one more time that we do not want \nto do anything. They are quickly losing their trust in us. They do not \ntrust us to reform our entitlement programs and allow our children to \nretire in dignity. They do not trust us to improve the way we teach our \nchildren. And they do not trust us to send our troops overseas, to keep \nour Nation strong, and to lead in the world.\n  Mr. President, last week 70 percent of Russian voters went to the \npolls to choose a President. They went because they thought they could \nmake a difference. Meanwhile, in this country it has been a long time \nsince 70 percent of our citizens, who fought and won the cold war, \nwould vote in the 70-percent range.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to prove to the American people that \nwe mean what we say when we talk about reforming our political system. \nLet us earn back their trust so we can go to work and build a better \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I again want to say, as I said at the start, I know \nthere are significant disagreements about what should be in any change \nin the 1971 Campaign Finance Act. I respect those differences of \nopinion and respect different points of view on this. But, for gosh \nsakes, let us allow the voters and the citizens of the United States of \nAmerica to hear a full and open debate. Let us rally the 60 votes \nnecessary to allow this proposal to be considered. I hope sincerely \nthat we will have enough votes tomorrow so that once and for all we can \nput some action behind our words. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I filed an amendment as a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment on last Friday, believing at the time that you could \nnot amend the Constitution by amending a simple bill, that it would not \nbe in order. I have since learned differently. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that that sense-of-the-Senate amendment be modified into the \nform of a regular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we see really where they all stand. Now \nI can give a good sense of history, 23 years ago, we passed the act \nthat gave rise to the problems we're dealing with today--the 1974 act \nwas passed. So if cloture is agreed upon tomorrow, we will be around \nwith that same amendment--a constitutional amendment, because I have \njust learned for the first time today--you learn something new every \nday--that you can amend a simple bill with a joint resolution to amend \nthe Constitution.\n  I have been told otherwise time and again for a good 10 years, ergo, \nback in the late 1980's, we were trying to get the joint resolution out \nof the Committee on the Judiciary for 2 or 3 years. We finally got it \nout. At that particular time we had the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma leading the charge for his particular campaign finance reform, \nSenator David Boren.\n  We were trying our best to have our amendment considered. I finally \nworked out with the then-majority leader, Senator George Mitchell, if I \ncould get it out of the committee, he would give me an up-or-down vote. \nSo after a 3-year struggle we did get it out of the committee.\n  Back in April 1988, we got 52 votes to amend the Constitution. We had \nfour Republicans. Again, in 1993, in the form of a sense of the Senate \nwe got 52 votes--a bipartisan effort including 6 Republican colleagues. \nAt that time, I was told that one could not amend the Constitution by \namending a bill.\n  I have been told time and time again that what we really needed to do \nwas to correct the fundamental flaw in Buckley versus Valeo. \nIronically, what happens is that Buckley versus Valeo amends the \nConstitution. That is what has occurred. By equating money in politics \nwith speech, the decision essentially amends free speech, because it \ndictates that those with money can talk and those without money can \nshut up.\n  You know, the mother's milk of politics, as it has been said many \ntimes on the floor of the Senate, is money. And television, of course, \nhas a great deal of control over elections. Anybody that has been \nelected--and I am proud to have been elected six times to this \nparticular body--will agree.\n  I remember when billboards were a sufficient form of advertising. \nToday, any consultant will tell you, do not waste your money on \nbillboards or on newspaper advertising or whatever else. You get a far \ngreater return on television advertising. And television advertising is \nvery, very costly. Therefore those with money, those that can bear the \ncost, have a better chance to prevail.\n  So I am not going to take a long time here because I am hoping we can \nget cloture, and then I will offer up my amendment, either as a simple \namendment to the bill itself or a second degree. And we will stay here \nas long as we can because it is a simple Senate bill that we would have \ncloture upon.\n  It seems the distinguished Senator from Kentucky will not allow me an \nhonest mistake, made because I have been instructed over the many years \nthat one could not submit a constitutional amendment. Well, I harken \nthe memory of everyone to when we voted last year on the flag burning \nlegislation. At that time I was asked if I had any amendments. I said, \n``Yes, I have two,'' because I had been waiting all year long to bring \nup the joint resolution to amend the Constitution for a balanced \nbudget. Senator Dole's amendment, S. 1 of this particular Congress \nprovided for a balanced budget using Social Security trust funds, \nthereby abolishing the law that protects the fund. I thought we ought \nto retain that protection and not decimate Social Security trying to \nbalance the budget. We never could get that up.\n  The leadership was very astute. They did not call any joint \nresolutions except to call up the flag burning amendment. When that \narose, I said, ``Oh, yes, I have two amendments: one to balance the \nbudget and the other one that pertains to campaign finance reform.'' \nSo, as everyone saw in the U.S. Senate, my amendments failed.\n  They talk about a New York minute: if there is a lesser time period \nto measure, it is political air. If my amendment passes, we will have \nthis adopted here in a few months, in November, by all the several \nStates. The States came to me, back some 10 years ago when I was \nworking on this and said, ``Please, please, put us in there, too.'' So \nthe legislation will not dictate that just the Congress of the United \nStates is hereby empowered to regulate or control expenditures in \nFederal elections, but that the States be permitted, also.\n  So that is my amendment, a very simple one. How it is implemented, \nwhat they do about bundling, what they do about separate committees and \nwhat they do about disclosure, it can be done constitutionally. That is \nthe fundamental flaw in not only the Buckley versus Valeo decision, but \nin the pending amendment by my distinguished colleagues, the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin. They are trying to face up \nto a real problem, but the solution they propose does not control \nspending in Federal elections. That is the evil that we confronted back \nin the early 1970's.\n  You go back to the 1968 Presidential race. You had institutionalized \ncampaign financing. The fundraisers came, for example, to the textile \nindustry. The textile industry, predominant in my State, is almost like \nthe United Fund or the Community Chest. They said, ``Your fair share is \n$350,000.'' Mr. President, they got 10 textile industries together and \nthey collected $35,000 apiece from each of them in order to comply. \nThis got a lot of people in legal trouble.\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n  I could go on, but that is not the point here. The distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Simon, spoke about buying a \nCongressman--he told of a bumper sticker he saw, ``Invest in America. \nBuy a Congressman.'' That was the problem 25 years ago. After the 1968 \nelection when President Nixon took office, John Connally, the Secretary \nof the Treasury, stated to President Nixon: ``There are a lot of people \nthat have given you millions and thousands and thousands of dollars, \nand they have not even had a chance to shake your hand. Some you \nhaven't met. I know you want to thank them.''\n  President Nixon said, ``Fine, I would love it. Give me the chance.'' \nConnally says, ``Well, come down here in a couple of weeks to my ranch \nin Texas, and we will have a barbecue. I will invite them there. We can \nhave a grand time. You could meet them and thank them.'' The famous \nprankster Dick Tuck, a Kennedy confidante, got himself a Brinks' truck, \nand he put the truck out there on the main road, by the Connally ranch. \nThe press took a picture of the truck and blew it up. They said, \n``There it is, Washington is up for sale.'' Republicans and Democrats \nwere hollering. They could not stand it. There was no complaining about \ndisclosure.\n  We just went ``ticker tape'' on all the things we wanted. No. 1, cash \nwas absolutely forbidden, against the law. Contributions were limited. \nTo an individual, $1,000; a race, $2,000, the primary and general \nelections; and PAC's were limited to $5,000.\n\n  With regard to PAC's, we said representative groups like the teachers \nassociation or the doctors in the group or whatever, like labor unions, \nthey ought to be able to band together. So we decided they should be \nlimited to $5,000. So we set the limit there. We said, now we will have \ncomplete disclosure. You will have to file every dollar in and every \ndollar out, not just with the secretary of the Senate, but with the \nsecretary of state in your own home State, so the people back home can \nsee it and know.\n  Then we said we are going to limit spending overall. Based on a \nformula: so much per registered voter in each one of the States. My \nlittle State of South Carolina, then, would have been limited--we \ncalculated it at around $670,000. This was back in the mid-1970's. Now, \ndouble it here from 20 years ago to a million and a half, which is, my \ngracious, plenty--not $3.5 million and $4 million that it costs for \nthat statewide race.\n  Look at the reports and the amounts and everything else, and the \nSenator from Illinois is right. More Senators this minute are out \ncollecting money than Senators that avail themselves of the opportunity \nto participate in this discussion on the floor of the Senate itself. \nThat is a crime.\n  According to the FEC reports, during the 6-year period, a Senator \nmust raise something like $12,000 or $14,000 a week, each week, in \norder to run for reelection. Then, if you get one of these high-fliers \ncoming in that spends $12 million of their own money, then the ox is in \nthe ditch. You are in real trouble there--people who have achieved \nfinancial success by way of family or otherwise, suddenly decide that \nrunning for the U.S. Senate would be a fun thing to do. Well, that has \nto stop.\n  First of all, we must eliminate the poisonous influence of large sums \nof money. Second, we must get rid of the poisonous influence of the \namount time it takes to raise these sums.\n  The flaw in Buckley versus Valeo, and the flaw in all of these \namendments, is that money is not controlled, which is ultimately what \neverybody wants to do.\n  Everybody wants that done: we who serve and have to collect the \nmoney, those who give it and participate--whether individual PAC's or \notherwise--and it is easily done. If you go back to the last five or \nsix constitutional amendments, they deal with elections. Do not give me \nthis acrimony. I have had this before the Judiciary Committee. Oh, they \nhave so many thousands of amendments, and everybody wants to change \nthem. I have to agree that this is a bad atmosphere up here because the \ncontract crowd wants to amend everything in the Constitution.\n  This is one amendment that has been dutifully considered and voted on \nby way of a majority at least twice in the last 10 years. I think we \ncan get an even larger majority now that Senator Dole ran into Steve \nForbes. He came in like a bolt out of the blue with $35 million and ran \naround hollering ``Flat tax, flat tax, flat tax.'' Of course, some \nvoters thought, ``They are going to lower my taxes so I will vote for \nthem.'' Come on, Senator Dole was the one calling on the President for \na balanced budget. I want to tell Senator Dole, ``Call your colleagues, \nget on Senator McConnell from Kentucky and tell him now is the time to \nlimit spending.''\n  The Senator from Kentucky has been frank and straightforward. He says \nwe spend more money on Kibbles and Bits and cat food and dog food than \nwe spend on political campaigns, and we ought to spend more. The \nSenator from Utah started out the debate. He said: ``If I had to solve \nit, I think it ought to be recorded, but collect all the money you want \nand spend it all the time, wherever you want.''\n  That is exactly the opposite of the intent of campaign finance law. \nThe way we passed that law--Republican and Democrat, overwhelmingly--\nwas to control spending in Federal elections. Our friend, Senator \nBuckley of New York at that time, took issue. He sued the Senate, in \nthe person of the Secretary Valeo. That is where we got the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision. I have the appropriate references here in the \nprepared remarks.\n  Mr. President, all I can say is here we go again with the same sing-\nsong--a half-hearted attempt to fix the chronic problems surrounding \ncampaign financing. Problems flowing from the Supreme Court's flawed \ndecision of Buckley versus Valeo. We all know the score--we're \nhamstrung by that decision and the ever increasing cost of a \ncompetitive campaign. With the total cost of congressional campaigns \nskyrocketing from $446 million in 1990 to over $724 million in 1994, \nthe need for limits on campaign expenditures is more urgent than ever. \nFor nearly a quarter of a century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway \ncampaign spending with bills aimed at getting around the disjointed \nBuckley decision. Again and again, Congress has failed.\n  Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance \nreform efforts, which have become bogged down in partisanship as \nDemocrats and Republicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. \nDuring the 103d Congress there was a sign that we could move beyond \nthis partisan bickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion \nexpressed its support for a constitutional amendment to limit campaign \nexpenditures. In May 1993, a non-binding sense-of-the-Senate-resolution \nwas agreed to which advocated the adoption of a constitutional \namendment empowering Congress and the States to limit campaign \nexpenditures. Now we must take the next step and adopt such a \nconstitutional amendment--a simple, straightforward, nonpartisan \nsolution.\n  As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, \namending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign \nexpenditures is ``the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-\nto-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in \nBuckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance \natmosphere.'' Adds Professor Ashdown: ``If Congress could \nconstitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, \ncandidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the \ntroubles * * * would be eliminated.''\n  Right to the point, in its landmark 1976 ruling in Buckley versus \nValeo, the Supreme Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to \nspend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the \nface of spirited dissents, the Court drew a bizarre distinction between \ncampaign contributions on the grounds that `` * * * the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption \noutweighs considerations of free speech.''\n  I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--\ndoes not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. However, \nit seems to me that the Court committed a far graver error by striking \ndown spending limits as a threat to free speech. The fact is, spending \nlimits in Federal campaigns would act to restore the free\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nspeech that has been eroded by the Buckley decision.\n  After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you \nhave personal wealth, then you have access to television, you have \nfreedom of speech. But if you do not have personal wealth, then you are \ndenied access to television. Instead of freedom of speech, you have \nonly the freedom to shut up.\n\n  So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are \nsomehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points \nout, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution limits and \nspending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not \nmotivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech in \ngeneral.\n  Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is \nthe name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you \ncontrol the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you \ncontrol the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign.\n  Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the \nmedium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear \nprice. In South Carolina, you're talking between $1000 and $2,000 for \n30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it's anywhere \nfrom $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds.\n  The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on TV, \nyou're not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as incumbents \nflushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those without personal \nwealth are sidetracked to the time-consuming pursuit of cash.\n  The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on \ncampaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much \ncandidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical \nreality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I \nhave $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of his speech. By \nfailing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear \nunwilling to speak up in his own defense.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent \nto Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, \nJustice Marshall said, ``It would appear to follow that the candidate \nwith a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \nsignificant head start.''\n  Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding \nthe limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall \nspending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal \nwealth.\n  Justice Marshall was dead right and Ross Perot and Steve Forbes have \nproved it. Massive spending of their personal fortunes immediately made \nthem contenders. Our urgent task is to right the injustice of Buckley \nversus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps on Federal campaign \nspending. We are all painfully aware of the uncontrolled escalation of \ncampaign spending. The average cost of a winning Senate race was $1.2 \nmillion in 1980, rising to $2.9 million in 1984, and skyrocketing to \n$3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, and up to $4.3 million this \npast year. To raise that kind of money, the average Senator must raise \nover $13,800 a week, every week of his or her 6-year term. Overall \nspending in congressional races increased from $446 million in 1990 to \nmore than $724 million in 1994--almost a 70 percent increase in 4 short \nyears.\n\n  This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. At \nworst, it corrupts and degrades the entire political process. \nFundraisers used to be arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate \nschedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to \naccommodate fundraisers.\n  I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You \nestablish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill \nshift in Greer, visiting a big country store outside of Belton, and so \non. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come around. \nBut in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the country \nstore have become a casualty of the system. There is very little time \nfor them. We're out chasing dollars.\n  During my 1986 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to \nget on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It's \na vicious cycle.\n  After the election, I held a series of town meetings across the \nState. Friends asked, ``Why are you doing these town meetings: You just \ngot elected. You've got 6 years.'' To which I answered, ``I'm doing it \nbecause it's my first chance to really get out and meet with the people \nwho elected me. I didn't get much of a chance during the campaign. I \nwas too busy chasing bucks.'' I had a similar experience in 1992.\n  I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: ``They give you a 6-year \nterm in this U.S. Senate: 2 years to be a statesman, the next 2 years \nto be a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagogue.'' \nRegrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We \nproceed straight to politics and demagoguery right after the election \nbecause of the imperatives of raising money.\n  My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. \nUnfortunately, Senate procedure prevents me from offering my amendment \nto this bill, but, hopefully tomorrow when we see yet another attempt \nto reform our campaign spending laws fail, we will realize a \nconstitutional amendment is the only viable solution. It would empower \nCongress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal campaigns. For \ninstance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per Senate \ncandidate in a small State like South Carolina--a far cry from the \nmillions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that \ndirect expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For \ninstance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent \norganizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you \ntotal up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly \nthe same amount in 1992.\n  And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that \nspending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already \nhave name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin \nwith a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to \nremind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper \nChamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents \nin the House, I would simply note that well over 50 percent of the \nHouse membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections.\n\n  I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are \nmore than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, \nspecifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial \nvotes in Congress.\n  I also agree with University of Virginia political scientist Larry \nSabato, who has suggested a doctrine of sufficiency with regard to \ncampaign spending. Professor Sabato puts it this way: ``While \nchallengers tend to be underfunded, they can compete effectively if \nthey are capable and have sufficient money to present themselves and \ntheir messages.''\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending \nlimits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from \nindustry groups, or from PAC's, or from individuals. It is still a \nreasonable--``sufficient,'' to use Professor Sabato's term--amount any \nway you cut it. Spending will be under control, and we will be able to \naccount for every dollar going out.\n  On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never \nbelieved that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the \ncontrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's \nhave brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, \nsmall business people, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They \npermit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band \ntogether with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and \nknown.\n  For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to \nparticipate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and \nsay, ``Oh, no, your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted.'' \nThis is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of \nparticipation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway \ncampaign spending.\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n  To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the \npolitical marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections \nare supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate \ninto megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of \ncorporations, and special interests.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under \ncontrol. The constitutional amendment I have proposed would permit \nCongress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal \ncampaign expenditures.\n  Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it would end \nthe mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it \nwould free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and \nallow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, \nwe wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep \nour seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And \nfourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal \ncampaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not \ngive candidates an insurmountable advantage.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-\nConstitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates \nthe practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, \nit is not coincidence that all five of the last six recent amendments \nto the Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In \nelections, the process drives and shapes the end result. Election laws \ncan skew election results, whether you're talking about a poll tax \ndepriving minorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign \nspending limits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These \nare profound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is \nentirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional \namendment.\n  And let's not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-\nConstitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been \ndithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we \nhaven't advanced the ball a single yard. It has been a quarter of a \ncentury, and no legislative solution has done the job.\n  Except for the 27th amendment, the last five constitutional \namendments took an average of 17 months to be adopted. There is no \nreason why we cannot pass this joint resolution, submit it to the \nStates for a vote, and ratify the amendment in time for it to govern \nthe 1998 election. Indeed, the amend-the-Constitution approach could \nprove more expeditious than the alternative legislative approach. Bear \nin mind that the various public financing bills that have been proposed \nwould all be vulnerable to a Presidential veto. In contrast, this joint \nresolution, once passed by the Congress, goes directly to the States \nfor ratification. Once ratified, it becomes the law of the land, and it \nis not subject to veto or Supreme Court challenge.\n  And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and \nratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to \nhammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure \nlimits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that \nin 1974, and we can certainly do it again.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will address the campaign finance mess \ndirectly, decisively, and with finality. The Supreme Court has chosen \nto ignore the overwhelming importance of media advertising in today's \ncampaigns. In the Buckley decision, it prescribed a bogus if-you-have-\nthe-money-you-can-talk version of free speech. In its place, I urge the \nCongress to move beyond these acrobatic attempts at legislating around \nthe Buckley decision. As we have all seen, no matter how sincere, these \nplans are doomed to fail. The solution rests in fixing the Buckley \ndecision. Unfortunately, today we are barred procedurally from getting \nto take such a vote. It is my hope that before this Congress is out, \nthe majority leader will provide us with an opportunity to vote on my \namendment--it is the only solution.\n  Mr. President, this is a significant reference, and it has been \nprepared for me with respect to the substituting, or actually amending, \na simple bill by a constitutional amendment. The Parliamentarian says:\n\n       The most significant question addressed here is whether the \n     form for proposing a constitutional amendment is prescribed. \n     Article V of the Constitution provides that Congress may, \n     upon a two-thirds vote in each House, propose amendments to \n     the Constitution, subject to ratification by three-fourths of \n     the States. In the alternative, Congress may, upon \n     application of two-thirds of the States, call a convention to \n     consider proposed amendments. Neither the Constitution nor \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate specify the form that the \n     proposal should take. The vast majority of measures proposing \n     amendments to the Constitution introduced in either House of \n     the Congress have been in the form of a joint resolution. A \n     report prepared by the Congressional Research Service, or \n     reference service of the Library of Congress, in 1985, which \n     built upon two earlier compilations of this material states \n     that 9,994 proposals to amend the Constitution had been \n     introduced since 1789 through the 98th Congress (report \n     number 8536, page 3). Of these, only the following 6 have \n     been determined to be in a form other than a joint \n     resolution: S. 2 (December 4, 1889); S. 3000 (January 5, \n     1916); S. Con. Res. 4 (January 9, 1924); H.R. 9468 (February \n     17, 1926); S. 199 (January 4, 1935); S. 1020 (April 20, \n     1981). This enormous weight of practice has, however, never \n     resulted in a Senate precedent. To the contrary, in the only \n     Senate precedent on this point, Vice President Barkley \n     stated, in response to a related point of order: ``On the \n     question of whether an amendment to the Constitution must be \n     submitted in the form of a joint resolution, or in the form \n     of a bill, the only requirement of the Constitution is that \n     the question shall be submitted by a two-thirds vote. It does \n     not require that it be done by joint resolution. It may be \n     done in the form of a bill (January 25, 1950, Congressional \n     Record, page 872, 8lst Congress, second session). On May 9, \n     1962, in response to an inquiry, the chair implied that a \n     constitutional amendment could be proposed as a substitute \n     for a House private relief bill. Therefore, no point of order \n     would lie against a bill which proposed to amend the \n     Constitution.''\n\n  I thank the distinguished Chair and my colleagues for their \nindulgence.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 1899 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthis campaign reform bill which is before us. It is with reluctance \nthat I come to the floor to make these statements because I, also, \nalong with Senator Hollings, was a member of the conference committee \nthat brought forth the Senate and the House bill, and sent to the \nPresident what I considered to be a real reform bill. We did that \ncoming out of the days of the disclosures of the Watergate era. I \nbelieve we have come through several reform eras, and unfortunately \nthose who have come in after the reform has taken place do not \nrecognize that what they see has been reformed, when compared to the \npast.\n  When I first came to the Senate there were campaign chairmen who went \nfrom State to State with suitcases full of cash. There was no \ndisclosure as to where it came from. We did a lot to reform politics in \nthe United States with the acts that have already been passed. If those \nacts had only been really followed perhaps we would not be here today \narguing over whether this is a reform bill. I come to the Senate \nbecause in recent weeks Alaskans who were worried about the impact of \nthis bill have contacted my office. They came to me from the Alaska \nBroadcasters Association, they came to me as members of various church \nrelated organizations, and they came just as individuals who are \nconcerned about the limits placed on their political freedom by this \nbill.\n  I agree with the statements earlier made by the Senator from \nWashington concerning the freedom of association. I view this bill as \nbeing directly contrary to one of the basic freedoms of our country. \nAnd it is not a bill that is a reform bill at all. It is a bill that \npeople want to call reform because they want to have some symbol in \nthis campaign to use against those of us who are candidates, and they \nthink we will not have the guts to stand up and oppose this bill. They \nare wrong.\n  This bill is not a reform bill. I believe we must clean up the system \neven more than we have in the past and make it fair. But we cannot do \nthat by limiting people's freedom, or by forcing upon the public the \ncost of financing campaigns.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  To me this bill places unfair restrictions on advocacy groups and \nassociations. People in this country ought to be free to associate \ntogether and pool their money as long as there is disclosure of where \nit has come from and there is a record of it. The bill restricts \norganizations that are the eyes and ears of people who are far distant \nfrom this place, and bans political action committees.\n  Mr. President, the political action committee itself was a reform. It \nrequired that people who band together disclose who contributes to \ntheir campaign fund, and it requires those to whom the funds are given \ndisclose the receipt of it as well as the committee disclosing the \ncontribution of it. This bill would discourage voter guides that are \ngiven to members of groups such as the Christian Coalition or \nindividual churches, or fishermen's organizations in my State. They are \nrecords to guide their membership as to the actual voting that takes \nplace here on the floor, and the positions taken by candidates.\n  I think that ought to be encouraged in a democracy, and not \ndiscouraged. This bill will discourage it.\n  This bill requires broadcasters--and in my view unconstitutionally--\nto provide free air time to participating candidates.\n  I happen to have in my State a series of very small broadcasters. I \nsometimes wonder how they survive. As a matter of fact, one of them, Al \nBramstedt of a network affiliate in Anchorage, flew in and testified at \nour Rules Committee and set forth their objections to this bill. Mr. \nPresident, at this point I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Bramstedt's \ntestimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Oral Testimony of Al Bramstedt on Campaign Reform\n\n       Thank you, Mr. chairman. My name is Al Bramstedt. I am \n     general manager of the NBC affiliate in Anchorage, Alaska. I \n     thank you and Senator Stevens for allowing me to speak to you \n     this morning on the impact broadcast provisions of campaign \n     reform proposals would have on small-market television. \n     During the new few minutes I want to discuss the effects of \n     the bill's free-time provisions. And you'll hear examples of \n     how these provisions, with reductions in the lowest unit rate \n     and revised classification of time, would bring about \n     financial harm for many smaller stations.\n       Changing technologies will present us new challenges in the \n     future, but with calm minds and stout hearts America's \n     television broadcasters, even most of the small-market \n     broadcasters, will meet these challenges and remain viable. \n     Today, and in the years ahead, that viability depends on \n     stable income.\n       A.C. Nielsen ranks Anchorage, Alaska number 156 in market \n     size. Although that's considered small, there are dozens of \n     other markets even smaller. In our market, with its low \n     television station profit margins, every dollar makes a \n     difference.\n       Political advertising revenue is no exception. In 1994, \n     Anchorage market television cash revenue totaled over $19 \n     million dollars. Political advertising represented more that \n     10 percent of that total--close to $2 million dollars.\n       In any business decision, I believe we must consider the \n     impact of Isaac Newton's third law of physics. Newton taught \n     us that for every action there is an equal and opposite \n     reaction.\n       The action of the free-time provisions of S. 1219 would be \n     to disrupt and reduce revenue from political advertising upon \n     which we, as small-market television broadcasters, are \n     dependent.\n       Our stations' regular advertisers in turn depend on \n     television to deliver the vital fourth-quarter revenue that \n     sustains them the other nine months of the year.\n       Local broadcasters also depend heavily on fourth quarter \n     revenues to meet their overall profitability. S. 1219 and \n     proposals like it would reduce television's effect as an \n     advertising medium for commercial advertisers each political \n     season and would directly impact our ability to operate \n     profitably.\n       These free political ads would not really be free. Newton \n     was right: there will also be a reaction.\n       To make up revenue lost by displacing regular advertisers, \n     broadcasters would have to increase already challenging \n     fourth-quarter rates for their year-round advertisers, or \n     simply eat those costs themselves.\n       There is no such thing as ``free'' time. The cost of \n     providing this time under S. 1219 would be paid by \n     advertisers and broadcasters.\n       Mandated free time proposals are unnecessary. Broadcasters \n     already are providing ever-increasing news and public affairs \n     coverage of federal candidates' campaigns, without the force \n     of federal law.\n       It is unfair that, while more coverage is taking place, \n     broadcasters are being singled out by this proposed \n     legislation--unlike our major advertising competitor, \n     newspapers.\n       The current lowest-unit-rate law contains remarkable \n     benefits for political candidates. Forty-five days prior to \n     the primary and 60 days before the general election, legally \n     qualified candidates receive the lowest unit rates the \n     station provides to its most favored advertisers.\n       Even in small markets, to receive these substantial \n     discounts--typically 25 percent or more--non-political \n     advertisers must spend at least $100,000 each year.\n       Under the current lowest-unit-rate provisions, during the \n     most important pre-election period candidates pay the lowest \n     rates possible without a commitment of any kind.\n       Any greater discount formula, much less any free-time \n     provisions, would be unfair not only to television \n     broadcasters, but also to every fourth-quarter advertiser.\n       In conclusion, I urge you to reject S. 1219. The free-time \n     provisions contained in this bill would harm television \n     broadcasters financially and disrupt advertisers \n     significantly. Further discounts and revising the \n     classification of time simply would make the fourth quarter \n     of every election year unmanageable for television \n     broadcasters. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these broadcasters are the people who \ndeliver over-the-air free television and free radio to people who live \nin rural America. And if there is any place that is rural it is my \nState, one-fifth the size of the United States.\n  To have a bill that says these people must provide the candidates \nfree time is a burden from which many of those broadcasters cannot \nsurvive. If they do survive, it will be by charging their advertisers, \ntheir customers, to pay higher rates to cover the cost of this free \ntime mandated by the Congress, if this bill is enacted. I think that \ntoo is unconstitutional.\n  It also burdens the Postal Service. Mr. President, I now have served \non the Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee of this Senate longer \nthan any Senator in history. I have really spent a lot of time trying \nto help the Postal Service survive. It is something I believe must \ncontinue. Today, there are many, many Members of Congress would like to \njust do away with it altogether. This bill would start the process \nbecause it would require that the Postal Service provide reduced postal \nrates to the participating candidates. It is other postal users, their \ncustomers again, that pay those costs, or else there will be a deficit \nfor the Postal Service.\n  This bill is simply public financing of political campaigns again. It \nis masked. It is in disguise. It is not a reform bill. The broadcasters \nwill pass along their costs to advertisers who try to support free \nover-the-air radio, or television, if they can. It will require the \nPostal Service to pass on their costs to the users of the Postal \nService, if they can. In effect this bill may be raising the rates for \neveryone else in the country who uses the Postal Service. The Postal \nService is not supported by the taxpayers. It is supported by the \nratepayers.\n  I believe that reform of the system is possible. But it must be \nconstitutional, and it must be fair. It cannot place the financial \nburden of reform on the public.\n  I support changing the system in many ways. I have discussed these \nbefore. All contributions and campaign expenditures I think should be \nheld to the strictest standards of disclosure. I do not believe in soft \nmoney whether it is given to political parties or to candidates, or in \nbundling of contributions from many sources. I think sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant for the political process, but there is no sunlight \nunder this bill at all.\n  I support the concept that political action committees should be held \nto the same disclosure standards and the same contribution limits as \nindividuals or as associations of individuals. In my judgment, business \npeople, fishing groups, and even Alaska whaling captains ought to have \nthe right to participate in the system as a group. But it is not a \nstronger right I think than individual citizens.\n  Cash contributions I think should be banned in any amount, whether it \nis called soft money, or whatever you want to call it. It ought to be \nbanned. Cash is too difficult to track, too difficult to monitor, and \nit is ripe for abuse. I do not want to go back to the days when \ncampaign chairmen traveled with suitcases full of cash.\n  They do not do it anymore, Mr. President. There has been reform. And \nnot too many people remember the reforms.\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n  Corporate contributions of any sort to candidates or to parties ought \nto be banned. We thought we had banned it before under the act that \npassed the Congress, and there have been ways found around it. But I do \nnot think we should allow corporate contributions of any sort to \ncandidates or parties. All contributions to parties or individuals who \nare candidates ought to be after-tax dollars. There should be no burden \non the taxpayers as a result of the political process.\n  I would support an additional constitutional amendment to get around \nthe problem of Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court case that held \nthat the bill we passed was unconstitutional as far as the spending of \nthe money that belonged to an individual candidate or his family. I \nsupport a constitutional amendment that would limit a candidate's \npersonal spending to a reasonable amount--a quarter of a million \ndollars, shall we say. That ought to be enough for anyone to spend of \ntheir own money to run for political office. Congress ought not to \nbecome a special preserve for the wealthy.\n  But it also ought not to be so structured that it denies an \nindividual or a group of individuals to freely associate and freely \nconduct themselves in a political process.\n  Again, I say I was in the chair when one Member kept repeating that \nthis is the reform bill of this Congress. If this is the reform bill of \nthis Congress, if this is the best that we can do, we ought to go home \nnow.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, perhaps this would be a good time to \nspend just a few minutes on distinguishing what is in this bill and \nwhat is not in the bill.\n  We have heard a number of concerns from the opponents that apparently \nrelate to other pieces of legislation. What I would like to do just \nbriefly is indicate what we do have in the bill, and then the Senator \nfrom Arizona, I think, will more plainly explain the basic structure of \nthe bill.\n  The Senator from Alaska just made a few comments about the bill \nwhich, unfortunately, simply do not reflect what the bill does now. A \nconcern was raised in the past about these voter guides that people \nwant to be able to send out. The concern was heard. The Senator from \nArizona and I specifically included a provision in this bill which \nreads as follows:\n\n       The term ``expressed advocacy'' does not include the \n     publication and distribution of a communication that is \n     limited to providing information about votes by elected \n     officials on legislative matters and that does not expressly \n     advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate.\n\n  We heard the concern. It has been taken care of. This is another red \nherring.\n  Second, speaker after speaker in the opposition today has said that \nthere are mandatory spending limits on this bill, that it is a return \nto the legislation in the early 1970's. That is just false. We read \nBuckley versus Valeo. We understand there is a concern in that \ndecision, and that is why we have a voluntary structure. You only have \nto limit your campaign spending voluntarily. If you do not want to, you \ndo not have to.\n  Third, the Senator from Alaska says that small TV stations in places \nlike Alaska will have a problem with the free television time. We were \naware of that problem from the beginning and specifically have included \na hardship provision where a station can easily demonstrate--a smaller \nstation, which is not very likely to be the station used for the free \ntime anyway, can get out from under those provisions. Again, a red \nherring.\n  And finally, the concern about the postal service. Senator McCain and \nI have included a sense-of-the-Senate provision suggesting that the \nmoney we save on not having franking done in an election year by people \nrunning for office be used to fund the postal reduction. So this is not \nsome kind of new public financing or new burden on the post office if \nit is done right.\n  Mr. President, let us talk a little bit about what the bill really \ndoes. The proposal does not advocate taking money completely out of the \nprocess. Consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley versus \nValeo, we do not limit any single candidate's ability to spend as much \nmoney on their campaign as they want.\n  No matter how many times the opposite is said to try to confuse the \nissue, all we try to do here is set up a fair fight. That is all, just \na fair fight. We want to ensure that all qualified candidates, not just \nthose with access to big money, have the ability to adequately \nparticipate in the political process. All this talk about a gag rule or \nautomatic limitations simply does not relate to our bill. What the \noverwhelming majority of Americans believe, Mr. President, and what I \nsuspect most Members of this body believe is that our current campaign \nsystem which has as its foundation unlimited campaign spending has \nbecome about as dysfunctional as it can possibly get.\n\n  So what does our bill actually do? None of the things that have been \nsaid in the Chamber today by the opposition. What it does do is create \na simple, voluntary system.\n  What are the things that one must volunteer to do in order to get the \nbenefits of the bill? Three major things. First, you have to agree, in \norder to get the incentives that the Senator from Arizona says, if you \nwant to get the incentives, you have to agree to limit how much you \nspend in total based on the size of your State--$1 million in a smaller \nState, something like $9 million in California and all the States in \nbetween. You do not have to. But if you want the benefits of the bill, \nthat is what you need to agree to.\n  Second, you need to get 60 percent of your campaign contributions \nfrom individuals from your own home State. That means all the PAC money \nand all the out-of-State contributions have to be less than 40 percent. \nIf you do not want to do it, you do not have to. If you want to spend \n$20 million in out-of-State money or PAC money, you can do it. But if \nyou want the goodies, if you want the benefits, if you want the \nfairness of this system and not spend all of your time raising money \nfrom out of State or from PAC's, then you have to agree to this 60 \npercent limitation.\n  Third, you cannot spend any amount of your own personal money in \norder to get the benefits of the bill. In the largest State, you cannot \nspend more than $250,000. In my State, you could not spend more than \n$150,000. This is irrelevant to me and some of us in the body, but \nassuming you have that, that is what you have to do. But again, you can \ndo whatever you want. Mr. Huffington could still spend $30 or $40 or \n$100 million in California. He just would not get the benefits of the \nbill. So it is all voluntary.\n  It is a major distortion to suggest that any of that is mandatory. It \nsimply is not. We crafted it that way because, of course, we intended \nfor this bill to be constitutional, and we strongly believe it is.\n  What does the person get if they abide by these rules? They sure do \nnot get equality. That is not what the Senator from Arizona and I \nbelieve is the result of this bill. They just get a fighting chance.\n  One of the things a person gets who obeys and abides by the rule is \nhalf price on their television time. They get half of the lowest \ncommercial rate--30 days before the primary and 60 days before the \nfinal. That is the biggest expenditure of most campaigns. That is what \nthey would get.\n  Second, they get 30 minutes of free television time if they make it \nto the final election.\n  And third, they get the equivalent of two statewide postal mailings \nat the third class rate given to nonprofits. That is all they get.\n  They do not get public financing. They do not get equality with their \nopponent, and the opponent can still spend $5, $10, $15, $20 million. \nAgain, the notion that these provisions are either unconstitutional or \nmandatory is simply false.\n\n  In addition--and this has not been brought out yet--this bill puts \nthe toughest restrictions on soft money ever in a piece of legislation \nin this body. In other words, we are going to shut down on this \npractice of pretending that there are hard money limits of $1,000 or \n$5,000 for PAC's and then somehow allowing individuals and political \naction committees to come through the back door and end up spending \nanything they want. Currently, individuals can only give $1,000 to \ncandidates per election, but, with\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\nsoft money, individuals can give unlimited contributions to a national \nparty's non-Federal account. PAC's are limited under the law today to \n$5,000 for hard money, but they may make unlimited contributions to a \nnational party's non-Federal account. Corporations and unions today are \nprohibited from making direct contributions to Federal candidates or \nnational parties, but they may make unlimited contributions to a \nnational party's non-Federal account. The McCain-Feingold bill shuts \nthis down.\n  So there is a voluntary scheme that candidates need to abide by to \nget the benefits, but, yes, there is a scheme of cracking down on soft \nmoney that would make the process much more fair and much more \naccountable.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize, because of the criticisms of the \nbill as being unconstitutional, the voluntary nature of the bill. If a \nparticular candidate wants to spend more than the system allows or if \nthe candidate is spending $1 million and wants to drop more money into \nthe campaign, they can go ahead and do it. All the candidates can \noperate as under the present system.\n  Mr. President, in the time remaining, let me indicate specifically \nthat the authors of this bill strongly reject the notion that this bill \nis not constitutional. Let me read from the opinion of L. Paige \nWhitaker, the legislative attorney for the Congressional Research \nService, who was specifically asked the question about the \nconstitutionality of our voluntary scheme. He said as follows:\n\n       In the 1976 landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court held that spending limitations violate the first \n     amendment because they impose direct substantial restraints \n     on the quantity of political speech. The Court found that \n     expenditure limitations failed to serve any substantial \n     Government interest in stemming the reality of corruption or \n     the appearance thereof and that they heavily burdened \n     political expression. As a result of Buckley, spending limits \n     may only be imposed if they are voluntary.\n\n  Mr. Whitaker continues:\n\n       It appears that the provision in question would pass \n     constitutional muster for the same reasons that the public \n     financing scheme for Presidential elections was found to be \n     constitutional in Buckley. The Court in Buckley concluded \n     that Presidential public financing was within the \n     constitutional powers of Congress to reform the electoral \n     process and that the public financing provisions did not \n     violate any first amendment rights by abridging, restricting \n     or censoring speech, expression and association but, rather, \n     encouraged public discussion and participation in the \n     electoral process.\n\n  Indeed, as Mr. Whitaker quotes the Court, he says:\n\n       The Court succinctly stated, ``Congress may engage in \n     public financing of election campaigns and may condition \n     acceptance of public funds on agreement of the candidate to \n     abide by specific expenditure limitations. Just as a \n     candidate may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions \n     he chooses to accept, he may decide to forego private \n     fundraising and accept public funding.\n\n  Finally, applying this principle to this bill, which does not involve \npublic financing, he says:\n\n       Because the subject provision does not require a Senate \n     candidate to comply with spending limits, the proposal \n     appears to be voluntary. Although the incentives of public \n     benefits are provided in the form of reduced and free \n     broadcast time and reduced postage rates to those candidates \n     who comply with the spending limits, such incentives do not \n     appear to jeopardize the voluntary nature of the limitation. \n     That is, a candidate could legally choose not to comply with \n     the limits by opting not to accept the public benefits. \n     Therefore [he concludes] it appears the proposal would be \n     found to be constitutional under Buckley.\n\n  The constitutional analysis that has been given to this closely reads \nBuckley versus Valeo and concludes what is inescapable, and that is, if \nit is a voluntary scheme, which this is, it will pass constitutional \nmuster. All the claims that have been made today that this bill that is \nbefore us today is somehow the bill that was passed 20 years ago are \nsimply false. This is a constitutional provision; we drafted it that \nway with that in mind, and this is, again, perhaps, the largest red \nherring that is being offered by the other side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as one of the original cosponsors of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill S. 1219, I rise in support of the bill and urge \nthat it not be set aside by a cloture vote. It is by no means a perfect \nbill, but it does move us several steps closer to a better campaign \nfinance system.\n  More than 35 years in the Senate I have joined in sponsoring and \nsupporting virtually all major campaign reform legislation before the \nSenate. In my view, many of these reforms have worked quite well, \nnotwithstanding the traditional laments about the evils of the system.\n  Just consider how far we have come in improving the system since the \nWatergate era. We have an effective reporting and disclosure system \nwhich works very well; it uses electronic technology and is light years \nbeyond the previous system. We have a system for public funding of \nPresidential elections, which while compromised by recent practice, is \nstill at core an effective counterforce to flagrant abuse. And we have \nthe Federal Election Commission which fulfills the indispensable role \nof a neutral--or at least bipartisan--referee, notwithstanding the \nstructural problems inherent in such a role.\n  To be sure, there are major flaws and problems crying out for \nresolution. They include the glaring problem of soft money, the \ndisproportionate influence of PAC's and the exorbitant cost of media \nadvertising. The McCain-Feingold bill addresses these problems in a \nstraightforward way.\n  Indeed, one of the main reasons I joined as an original cosponsor of \nthe bill is that it provides an entitlement of free broadcast time for \ncandidates who voluntarily comply with the spending limits proposed by \nthe bill.\n  The concept of free broadcast time for Federal candidates is an idea \nthat I have embraced for many years. I believe that the provision of \nfree media time to educate the electorate should be a basic condition \nof a grant of a license for commercial use of a segment of the \nbroadcast spectrum.\n  I have sponsored legislation providing various schemes for free time \ngrants for political campaigns for the past 10 years, and I remain \nhopeful that the concept will one day become law.\n  When I first introduced legislation providing for free media time in \n1986, the idea was viewed as being quite far out of the mainstream--so \nmuch so that the bill was not taken very seriously. But by 1993, the \nconcept had gained enough momentum to attract 32 votes in the Senate \nwhen I offered it as an amendment to Senator Boren's Election Reform \nAct. So while the amendment failed to carry the day, the idea had \nindeed come into its own. And now the McCain-Feingold bill takes it a \nstep further.\n  I would point out that my own proposals for free broadcast time \ndiffer from those in the bill in two respects. First, I believe free \nbroadcast time should be made available for all legitimate candidates, \nregardless of whether they agree to spending limits, because all should \nbe sharing in an equal claim on a public resource, namely the broadcast \nspectrum. And my plan would actually distribute the free time through \nthe political parties, to allow for the problem of overlapping claims \non broadcasters, which might result from direct distribution to \ncandidates.\n  Second, I would note that my 1993 amendment to the Boren bill \ncontained a contingency provision of tax deductibility for broadcasters \nof the value of free time made available for political campaigns. Some \nsuch consideration seems necessary to overcome the objections of the \nbroadcast industry.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have a basically different view of \npolitical action committees than is reflected in this bill. In my view, \nPAC's play a useful and legitimate role in conveying valid political \ninterests to the campaign process. I do fully agree that they have come \nto wield disproportionate influence and that their techniques have \nfrequently created the appearance and often the reality of undue and \nimproper influence.\n  But the solution, I believe, is not to ban PAC contributions \naltogether from the political process. Surely, there must be a middle \nground that would permit PAC's to make their legitimate contribution to \nthe political process without compromising the beneficiaries.\n  One approach that I find intriguing is the idea of an intermediary, \nor buffer, between the contribution PAC and the\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nbeneficiary candidate both for purpose of sanitizing the transaction \nand enforcing an overall limit of PAC expenditures per candidate.\n  This would entail the creation of a neutral entity which might be \ncalled the national political action fund, to be the central repository \nto which all PAC contributions must be sent, with a pubic listing of \nintended beneficiaries. The fund would be administered by a neutral \nauthority, possibly the Federal Election Commission.\n  Part and parcel of this concept would be the provision of statutory \nlimits on the aggregate amount of contributions a candidate could \nreceive from all PAC's in an election cycle. A model for such a \nprovision is the standby limitation proposed in S. 1219, which is 20 \npercent of the applicable spending limit per State.\n  Under the plan I am outlining, PAC's could designate intended \nrecipients for payments up to the existing $5,000 limit, and the \nneutral administrator of the fund would make the payments accordingly, \nup to the statutory aggregate limit for a given candidate. Any \nsurpluses remaining in the national political action fund at the end of \neach cycle could be transferred to the Presidential Election Campaign \nfund, or some similar appropriate source.\n  Mr. President, I offer the outline of this plan for further \ndevelopment. The process of political campaign reform is an \nevolutionary process, and I am pleased to have been part of it so far. \nIt remains for those who follow to take up the cause and carry it to \nnew levels of improvement. I urge them to be persistent and patient.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in \nsupporting S. 1219, the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act. First, I \nwish to commend my colleague, Senator Russ Feingold, for his tireless \nwork in bringing this issue to the floor. Senator Feingold has done a \ntremendous job in keeping this issue before the Senate and ensuring \nthat we have a full debate on this bill. I also wish to commend Senator \nJohn McCain, another stalwart advocate of campaign finance reform. \nWithout his bipartisan leadership, we would not be debating this bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, we all know our campaign finance system is broken. We \nall know that the American public is losing trust in our government \ninstitutions and electoral system more and more each year. It seems \nthat all members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, agree that \nreform is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, that is where the \nagreement ends. For a variety of reasons, it seems impossible for \nCongress to pass and for the President to sign meaningful campaign \nfinance reform. This issue is consistently mired in partisan politics, \ntinged with the self interest of some individuals and groups who have a \nvested interest in maintaining the status quo.\n  That is why today's proposal is so unique. The Senate Campaign \nFinance Reform Act is the first, real bipartisan reform plan to reach \nthe Senate floor in decades. In the House of Representatives, there is \na companion measure which also has garnered bipartisan support. These \ntwo bills have widespread grassroots backing through the United States, \nfrom groups as diverse as United We Stand to the Gray Panthers to the \nChildren's Defense Fund.\n  This legislation strikes at the heart at much of what is wrong with \nour campaign finance system: it eliminates PAC contributions; caps the \namounts that can be spent in campaigns; curtails the practice of \nbundling contributions; and closes the loopholes allowing so-called \nsoft money contributions. The legislation establishes many of these \nlimits through a voluntary system, thereby conforming with Supreme \nCourt rulings governing campaign financing.\n  Like many Senators, if I had drafted my own bill, I would have \nomitted some provisions of this legislation and included others. But \nany meaningful bipartisan reform must be a compromise between competing \nproposals. And campaign finance reform must be done in a bipartisan \nfashion--legislation crafted by one party and rammed through the \nCongress will not and should not get the support of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I recognize there are deep divisions among Members of \nCongress over the how to reform our campaign finance system. These \ndivisions have led to stalemate after stalemate over 20 years. Without \nserious reform, the American public will continue to mistrust not only \nthe way we elect candidates, but the very fundamental precipes of our \ngovernment. This must not go on.\n  S. 1219 is the best option currently moving through the Congress to \nbegin renewing America's faith in our elections and curtail the \ninfluence of special interest contributions. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this bill, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand we have a unanimous-consent \nagreement concerning tomorrow's activities on this particular measure, \nas well as the rest of today. In the meantime, I would like to make \nsome additional remarks.\n  I am pleased today we have begun debate on the issue of campaign \nfinance reform. It is a very important issue, one that affects every \nMember individually, perhaps more than any other issue that will come \nbefore this body. There are strong views on this subject. I appreciate \nthe sincerity of those views, but I think we must recognize the public \nis rightfully demanding reform, and we have an obligation to act on \nthat demand.\n  Today, as we begin debate on this legislation, the bipartisan Senate \nCampaign Reform Act of 1995, introduced by myself, Senators Feingold, \nThompson, Wellstone, Kassebaum, Simpson, Graham of Florida, and others, \nwe are taking a step in the right direction.\n  Tomorrow we will be faced with the next step. Tomorrow the Senate \nwill vote on cloture on this measure. Make no mistake, that vote is a \nvote for or against campaign finance reform. A vote for cloture is a \nvote to move forward, a vote to reform the system. A no vote on cloture \nis a vote against reform, a vote to preserve the status quo.\n  This Congress has taken positive steps in the area of institutional \nreform. The Senate has passed both lobbying reform and gift ban reform \nlegislation. The Senate deserves great praise for this action. The \npublic is justifiably now demanding we take action on the most \nimportant sweep of reforms, campaign finance reform. Failure to do so \nwill result in greater public disdain for the Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues recognize that the status quo has led to dismal \napproval ratings of the Congress. According to a recent poll conducted \nby CBS News and the New York Times, only 19 percent of the American \npeople approve of the job that Congress is doing, while a staggering 71 \npercent disapprove.\n  We must do something to restore the public's confidence in the \nCongress as an institution. Our bill is not perfect, but we should not \nlet ``perfect be the enemy of the good.'' After cloture is invoked, my \ncolleagues will have the opportunity to offer amendments and attempt to \nimprove the bill. I hope we can move forward.\n  Mr. President, this bill is about restoring the public's faith in the \nCongress and the electoral system. It is about elections being won and \nlost on ideology, not fundraising. It is about leveling the playing \nfield between challengers and incumbents, and it is a bipartisan effort \nto bring about a dramatic change to the status quo.\n  Again, I want to note, this bill is about placing ideas over dollars. \nLast year, the Republicans took control of the House and the Senate, \nnot due to fundraising but due to ideas that the American people \nunderstood and related to. Campaigns are not run for free. This bill \nrecognizes that fact. It does not end campaign spending, but it limits \nit in a manner that forces candidates to rely more on their message \nthan on their fundraising prowess.\n  Mr. President, poll after poll demonstrates that the public has lost \nfaith in the Congress. One of the reasons this has occurred is that the \npublic believes, rightly or wrongly, that special interests control the \npolitical and electoral system.\n  In order to limit the ability of special interests to control the \nprocess, we must enact campaign finance reform. A recent USA-CNN-Gallup \npoll revealed that 83 percent of the American people want to see \ncampaign finance reform passed.\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\n  According to the same poll, the only two issues that the public felt \nmore important were balancing the Federal budget and reforming welfare. \nOther polls show how badly campaign finance reform is needed.\n  I made reference earlier to a poll conducted by Mr. McInturff of \nPublic Opinion Strategies, which asks three questions: ``Which of the \nfollowing do you think really controls the Federal Government in \nWashington?''\n  Registered voters responded: the lobbyists and special interests, 49 \npercent; Republicans in Congress, 25 percent; have not thought much \nabout it, 14 percent; the President, 6 percent; the Democrats in \nCongress, 6 percent.\n\n  When asked ``those who make large campaign contributions get special \nfavors from politicians,'' respondents said: this is one of the things \nthat worries you most, 34 percent; worries you a great deal, 34 \npercent; worries you some, 20 percent; worries you not too much, 5 \npercent; and worries you not at all, 3 percent.\n  Finally, when asked ``we need campaign finance reform to make \npoliticians accountable to average voters rather than special \ninterests,'' the voters stated: this was very convincing, 59 percent; \nsomewhat convincing, 31 percent; not very convincing, 5 percent; not at \nall convincing, 4 percent; and don't know, 2 percent.\n  Mr. President, I think that pretty well describes the view of the \nAmerican people on this issue. I would like to outline, again, because \nof a lot of the statements that have been made already on the floor on \nthis issue, again, what the bill does, because there has been either a \nmisunderstanding or misconstruing of what this legislation does. It \ncontains voluntary spending limits and benefits. Spending limits would \nbe based on each State's voting-age population, ranging from a high of \nover $8 million in a large State like California to a low of $1.5 \nmillion in a smaller State like Wyoming.\n  Candidates who voluntarily comply with spending limits would receive \nfree broadcast time. Candidates would be entitled to 30 minutes of free \nbroadcast time, broadcast discounts. Broadcasters would be required to \nsell advertising to a complying candidate at 50 percent of the lowest \nunit rate, reduced postage rate. A candidate would be able to send up \nto two pieces of mail to each voting-age resident at the lowest third-\nclass nonprofit bulk rate.\n  As my colleague from Wisconsin pointed out earlier, by eliminating \nthe franked mail, the free mail that Senators make use of during this \ntime period, that would be the way that we would pay for the reduced \npostage rates.\n  I also point out this free broadcast time of up to 30 minutes in \nevery 6-year cycle in a State I do not believe would be a debilitating \nexperience for most broadcasters. However, if a small station can prove \nthat that would have harmful--in fact, damaging--financial effects on \nthem, then there is a way to get dispensation from this requirement.\n  There is a new variable contribution limit. If a candidate's opponent \ndoes not agree to the spending limits or exceeds the limits, the \ncomplying candidate's individual contribution limit is raised from \n$1,000 to $2,000 and the complying candidate's spending ceiling is \nraised by 20 percent.\n  The bill limits the use of personal funds. Complying candidates \ncannot spend more than $250,000 from their personal funds. Candidates \nwho spend more than that amount are considered in violation of this act \nand thereby qualify for none of this act's benefits.\n  The legislation requires candidates to raise 60 percent of campaign \nfunds from individuals residing in the candidate's home State. If a \ncandidate is running from a small State, a candidate may still qualify \nfor the benefits contained in this bill if 60 percent of the \nindividuals contributing to the candidate's campaign committee legally \nreside in the candidate's State, as compared to the larger States where \n60 percent of the dollars raised must come from within the candidate's \nState. All such individuals must be reported to the FEC.\n\n  There was a legitimate and, I think, sincere concern on the part of \nMembers from small States, and I think this modification that we have \nmade will be very helpful in that direction.\n  The legislation bans political action committee contributions. While \nthe bill bans PAC's, in case a PAC ban is ruled unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court, backup limits on PAC contributions are also included.\n  In such an instance, PAC contribution limits will be lowered from \n$5,000 to the individual contribution limit.\n  Additionally, candidates could receive no more than 20 percent of \ntheir contributions from political action committees.\n  Mr. President, I have heard the arguments today, and will hear them \nagain tomorrow, about how political action committees are simply \ncollections of individuals who want to see good Government. That is not \nthe problem. I believe that individuals can contribute significantly, \nbut the problem lies not in the political action committees being \nformed, the problem is that the political action committees cause a \ndramatic unlevel playing field.\n  I do not know how a challenger really thinks that they can compete \nwhen in 1995--and the numbers will be similar for 1996, Mr. President--\n$59.2 million went to incumbents and $3.9 million went to challengers.\n  That is what is wrong with the political action committee, Mr. \nPresident. It is where the money is going. You know, I said half \nfacetiously earlier in the debate, if challengers were voting on this \nbill, it would go through in a New York minute. I understand how many \nincumbents have come to rely on political action committee funding. But \nwhat we have to do here is try to give challengers an opportunity.\n  This frustration with challengers not having an equal opportunity in \nthe political playing field has been manifested in the term limits \nmovement. Why is it that we have seen in recent years this tremendous \nincrease in support for term limits? It is because incumbents stay too \nlong, in the view of the voters.\n  I suggest to you a better solution than term limits--although I have \nsupported term limits because that is the view of the majority of the \npeople in my State--but if you really want to keep the good and great \npeople, many of whom have graced this body and the other one, then you \nshould make sure that there is an equal opportunity for all in the \npolitical arena, and thereby you keep the best people and you get rid \nof the worst.\n  There were a lot of comments made in the last election that there was \nthis huge turnover in Congress, especially in the other body there was \nthis huge turnover. There were some very spectacular defeats of some \nlong-term incumbents.\n  Mr. President, I also remind you that 91 percent of the incumbents \noverall were reelected in the last election in this and the other body \nin the numbers of incumbents who sought reelection.\n  Mr. President, this is obviously a very, very emotional issue, this \nissue of political action committees. It is an emotional issue. There \nis a question about its constitutionality. That is why, if a complete \nban is declared unconstitutional, then the limits on spending will be \nreduced to that of an individual contribution. Yet at the same time, \nMr. President, this situation, in the view of the majority of the \nAmerican people, I think very correctly, is that political action \ncommittees distort the political process. Looking at those numbers, I \ndo not know how you reach any other conclusion except that they distort \nthe political process rather dramatically.\n  Mr. President, the bill also bans all franked mass mailings in the \ncalendar year of a campaign.\n  It increases disclosure and accountability for those who engage in \npolitical advertising. In order to discourage negative advertising and \nencourage accountability, any political ad must contain a disclosure \nwhere the individual running the ad states, ``(the name of the \nindividual) is responsible for the contents of this ad.''\n  For example, if I was running against the Senator from Colorado, who \nis in the chair, for the U.S. Senate and I had something negative to \nsay about him, then at the bottom of the television ad it would say--if \nmy committee paid for it, if contributions to my campaign paid for it, \ndown at the bottom of the television commercial it would say, ``John \nMcCain is responsible for this message.''\n  Mr. President, it would not say, ``Paid for by Joe Smith, treasurer,\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nMcCain for Senate.'' It would not say a lot of the other things that \nyou see which are a little confusing to voters. It would say, ``John \nMcCain is responsible for the contents of this ad,'' so that there \nwould be no doubt as to who was responsible for the message. I think it \nwould do two things. I think it would dramatically contribute to truth \nin advertising, and I think it would also be discouraging to those who \nwant to engage in negative advertising.\n\n  It limits bundling. The legislation also requires full disclosure of \nall soft money contributions. In other words, soft money is made hard \nso that it can be tracked.\n  The Scranton Times noted ``the soft money racket is a national \nscandal that perpetuates special interest dominance of the \ncongressional debates on innumerable issues. Both parties troll the \nsoft money waters for contributions.''\n  Finally, the bill bans the personal use of campaign funds. The bill \ncodifies a recent FEC ruling that prohibits candidates from using \ncampaign funds for personal purposes, such as mortgage maintenance or \nvacation trips.\n  Mr. President, I have been on the floor on this issue before. I have \nalways been amazed at the creativity of some Members of Congress as to \nhow they have been able to spend campaign funds. Clearly, it is an \nabuse that needs to be brought to a stop.\n  This bill will affect both parties equally. It does what other bills \nin the past did not. It does not benefit just one party. That is also \nwhy it has bipartisan support.\n  Is this a perfect bill? No. I do not know if it is even possible to \nwrite a perfect bill on this subject.

Mr. President, I would like to just note some of the many \npapers that have editorialized on this subject. I also want to point \nout that a couple of the editorials have made note of the fact that \nopposition to this legislation has made interesting bedfellows.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of a piece of legislation that is \nopposed by the American Trial Lawyers Association, the major business \norganizations in America, and the Christian Coalition. Let me quote \nfrom the Atlanta Journal editorial of this year:\n\n       Time was when lawyers in this country worked at making \n     democracy work. Some still do. So it's discouraging to learn \n     that among those creating a coalition against campaign \n     finance reform is the American Trial Lawyers Association. \n     Actually, it is discouraging that the nation's top business \n     lobbying organization, which includes physicians as well as \n     realtors and the AFL-CIO, which represents a whole lot of \n     average folks, are also not giving up the money game. Our \n     Washington reporter Andrew Mollison uncovered a plan for the \n     probusiness National Association of Business Political Action \n     Committees to form a coalition with the AFL-CIO and the trial \n     lawyers to block a bill that the Senate will be considering \n     next week cosponsored by Republican John McCain and Democrat \n     Russell Feingold. The bill marks the first time ever the \n     Republicans and Democrats have agreed on such reform and \n     includes some honest changes.\n\n  Mr. President, as I say, I have never known of a piece of legislation \nthat has been opposed by this conglomerate of individuals who have \ndifferent interests. I can assume only that they feel threatened by \nthis reform in order for them to join together in what must be and some \nwould view as an unholy alliance.\n  Mr. President, the editorial writers from around the country of 261 \nnewspapers support this bill because, first, it is the right thing to \ndo. It recognizes the system needs fixing, and they also recognize that \nif any bill is to pass, it must affect both parties equally and fairly. \nThis bill does that, and for that reason it has bipartisan support. My \nfriend from Kentucky will contend that it is not bipartisan on that \ncharge. I must disagree. This is a bipartisan, balanced bill. It favors \nneither party.\n  As the Philadelphia Inquirer stated:\n\n       To get the big money and its corrupting influence out of \n     campaigns for Congress, hundreds of incumbents must abandon \n     the system that coddles and protects them. [S. 1219] isn't \n     just another high-minded reform headed nowhere. It's a hard-\n     headed, achievable plan to cleanse a system that delivers \n     legislative influence to the bidders while stacking the deck \n     against challengers. Citizens should tell their lawmakers to \n     get with it.\n\n  Second, in a dramatic change from past campaign finance bills, it \ncontains no public financing. This is not a reincarnation of past \npartisan bills. Those bills may have contained spending limits, but the \ncomparison ends there.\n  Third, the bill is constitutional. The Senator from Kentucky and \nothers do not agree with me on this point. But many legal experts from \naround the country do.\n  Mr. President, I will submit for the Record several letters making a \ncompelling argument for the constitutionality of S. 1219. These letters \nare from the American Law Division of the Congressional Research \nService; Prof. Frederick Schauer, professor of the first amendment, \nHarvard University Law School; Prof. Daniel Lowenstein, professor of \nlaw, University of California, Los Angeles; Prof. Cass Sunstein, \ndistinguished service professor of jurisprudence, University of Chicago \nLaw School; Prof. Marlene Arnold Nicholson, professor of law, DePaul \nUniversity; and Prof. Jamin Raskin, associate dean, the American \nUniversity College of Law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 1996.\n     To: Senator Russell Feingold; Attention, Andy Kutler.\n     From: L. Paige Whitaker, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of Campaign Finance Reform \n         Proposals.\n\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for a constitutional analysis of three campaign finance \n     reform proposals:\n\n\n I. Constitutionality of a voluntary spending limit system linked with \npublic benefits in the form of free and discounted television time and \n                        discounted postage rates\n\n       In the 1976 landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo,\\1\\ the \n     Supreme Court held that spending limitations violate the \n     First Amendment because they impose direct, substantial \n     restraints on the quantity of political speech. The Court \n     found that expenditure limitations fail to serve any \n     substantial government interest in stemming the reality of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof and that they heavily \n     burden political expression.\\2\\ As a result of Buckley, \n     spending limits may only be imposed if they are voluntary.\n       It appears that the provision in question would pass \n     constitutional muster for the same reasons that the public \n     financing scheme for presidential elections was found to be \n     constitutional in Buckley. The Court in Buckley concluded \n     that presidential public financing was within the \n     constitutional powers of Congress to reform the electoral \n     process and that public financing provisions did not violate \n     any First Amendment rights by abridging, restricting, or \n     censoring speech, expression, and association, but rather \n     encouraged public discussion and participation in the \n     electoral process.\\3\\ Indeed, the Court succinctly stated:\n       ``Congress may engage in public financing of election \n     campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an \n     agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure \n     limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the \n     size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide \n     to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.'' \\4\\\n       Because the subject provision does not require a Senate \n     candidate to comply with spending limits, the proposal \n     appears to be voluntary. Although the incentives of public \n     benefits are provided, in the form of reduced and free \n     broadcast time and reduced postage rates to those candidates \n     who comply with the spending limits, such incentives do not \n     appear to jeopardize the voluntary nature of the limitation. \n     That is, a candidate could legally choose not to comply with \n     the limits by opting not to accept the public benefits. \n     Therefore, it appears that the proposal would be found to be \n     constitutional under Buckley.\n\n\n   II. Constitutionality of requiring candidates who are voluntarily \n     complying with spending limits to raise at least 60% of their \n   individual contributions from individuals within their home state\n\n       A voluntary restriction on Senate candidates to raise at \n     least 60% of their individual contributions from individuals \n     within their home state, with incentives for candidates to \n     comply with the ban, would also appear to be constitutional. \n     In exchange for voluntarily complying with the restriction on \n     instate contributions, a congressional candidate could \n     receive such public benefits as free and reduced television \n     time and reduced postage rates. This type of voluntary \n     restriction would most likely be upheld for the same reasons \n     that the Supreme Court in Buckley upheld a voluntary spending \n     limits system linked with public financing.\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n       Here, in the subject proposal, as limitations on out-of-\n     state contributions are linked to public benefits as part of \n     the eligibility requirement, they would seem to be \n     constitutional for the same reasons that similar eligibility \n     requirements of the receipt of public funds were held to be \n     constitutional in Buckley v. Valeo.\\5\\ In exchange for public \n     benefits, participating Senate candidates would voluntarily \n     choose to limit the sources of their contributions. In \n     addition, an out-of-state contribution limit would not seen \n     to violate the First Amendment rights of out-of-state \n     contributors as they would have other outlets, such as \n     through independent expenditures, to engage in political \n     speech in support of such candidates who voluntarily restrict \n     receipt of out-of-state contributions.\n\n\n III. Constitutionality of prohibiting all political action committees \n       (PACs) from making contributions, soliciting or receiving \ncontributions, or making expenditures for the purpose of influencing a \n                            federal election\n\n       Generally, the term political action committee (PAC) is \n     used to refer to two different types of committees: connected \n     and nonconnected. A connected PAC, also known as a separate \n     segregated fund, is established and administered by an \n     organization such as corporation or labor union.\\6\\ A \n     nonconnected PAC, on the other hand, is one which is \n     unaffiliated with any federal office candidate, party \n     committee, labor organization, or corporation, although it \n     can be established and administered by persons who are labor \n     union members or corporate employees. Typically, nonconnected \n     PACs may be established by individuals, persons, groups, \n     including even labor union members, corporate employees, \n     officers, and stockholders, their families, and by persons \n     who collectively work to promote a certain ideology; \n     provided, however, that they keep their political funds \n     separate and apart from any corporate or labor union funds \n     and accounts. They are required to register with the Federal \n     Election Commission after receiving or expending in excess of \n     $1,000 within a calendar year, they are subject to \n     contribution limitations, and, unlike connected PACs, they \n     are limited to using only those funds they solicit to cover \n     establishment and administration costs. \\7\\\n       A complete ban on contributions and expenditures by \n     connected and nonconnected PACs would appear to be \n     unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment. \n     Although the courts have not had occasion to address \n     specifically this issue, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court made it clear that the right to associate is a ``basic \n     constitutional freedom'' \\8\\ and that any action which may \n     have the effect of curtailing that freedom to associate would \n     be subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\\9\\ The Court \n     further asserted that while the right of political \n     association is not absolute,\\10\\ it can only be limited by \n     substantial governmental interests such as the prevention of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof. \\11\\\n       Employing this analysis, the Court in Buckley determined \n     that any limitations on expenditures of money in federal \n     elections were generally unconstitutional because they \n     substantially and directly restrict the ability of \n     candidates, individuals, and associations to engage in \n     political speech, expression, and association. \\12\\ ``A \n     restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached,'' the \n     Court noted. \\13\\ Therefore, in view of Buckley, it appears \n     that completely banning expenditures by nonconnected PACs \n     would be found to be unconstitutional.\n       In Buckley the Court found that limitations on \n     contributions can pass constitutional muster only if they are \n     reasonable and only marginally infringe on First Amendment \n     rights in order to stem actual or apparent corruption \n     resulting from quid pro quo relationships between \n     contributors and candidates. \\14\\ The Court noted that a \n     reasonable contribution limitation does ``not undermine to \n     any material degree the potential for robust and effective \n     discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual \n     citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, \n     and political parties.'' \\15\\ Hence, Buckley seems to \n     indicate that a complete ban on contributions by nonconnected \n     PACs would be unconstitutional. Such an outright prohibition \n     would arguably impose direct and substantial restraints on \n     the quantity of political speech and political communication \n     between nonconnected PACs and federal candidates.\n       In sum, it appears that prohibiting all expenditures by \n     PACs would not pass strict judicial scrutiny as it would \n     significantly restrict most PACs from effectively amplifying \n     the voices of their adherents or members. \\16\\ Moreover, an \n     outright ban on contributions, although they are less \n     protected by the First Amendment, would probably be found to \n     substantially infringe on the First Amendment rights of the \n     members of the PACs and therefore be found to be \n     unconstitutional as well.\n                                                L.

Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: You have asked me to provide to the \n     Senate my views about the constitutionality of the proposed \n     S. 1219, the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995. I am \n     pleased to respond to your request, and I hope that my \n     analysis is useful to you and your colleagues.\n       At the outset, I should note that my political affiliation \n     is independent, and I have not registered as a member of a \n     political party in over twenty years. Moreover, I have no \n     political, financial, or fiduciary connections with anyone \n     who might be helped or hurt were this legislation to be \n     enacted. Indeed, consistent with my longstanding practice, \n     and consistent with my views about academic independence, I \n     do not represent clients, directly or indirectly, and I do \n     not enter into consulting relationships. Finally, I should \n     note not only that I have had no prior dealings with you or \n     your office, but also that when Mr. Kutler called me to ask \n     if I might undertake this analysis, he did not inquire about \n     my views, tentative or otherwise, on the advisability or \n     constitutionality of this or related legislation.\n       For constitutional purposes, the central features of S. \n     1219 are Section 101, which provides various incentives to \n     Senate candidates who limit their total campaign \n     expenditures, and Section 201, which prohibits political \n     action committees from contributing to candidates for federal \n     office. I will consider them in turn.\n       Section 101 would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971, the Communications Act of 1934, and several other \n     laws by providing to Senate candidates who agree to limit \n     their total campaign expenditures a package of incentives \n     consisting primarily of discounted broadcast advertising \n     rates, thirty minutes of free broadcast air time, and \n     discounted postal rates for campaign mailings.\n       In evaluating the constitutionality of this proposal, two \n     potential constitutional problems are presented. One is the \n     indirect restriction, by way of incentives, on candidate \n     expenditures of their own resources, expenditures that since \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), have been considered to \n     be themselves protected by the First Amendment. Another is \n     the potential restriction on the First Amendment rights of \n     broadcasters to allocate their air time as they see fit. I \n     will address these concerns in that order.\n       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held \n     unconstitutional a restriction on the amount of a candidate's \n     own funds (the major corollary of permitting contribution \n     limitations) that he or she could spend in the context of an \n     election. 424 U.S. at 39-59. The Court held that the First \n     Amendment protected the right of a candidate to spend an \n     unlimited amount of his or her own funds in the service of \n     advocating his or her candidacy. The Court reasoned that \n     since spending one's money to make a political speech or \n     support a political cause was plainly protected by the First \n     Amendment, it would be anomalous to create an exception where \n     the political cause was the cause of one's own election to \n     office. And although this dimension of Buckley was criticized \n     then, and is still criticized today, there is little in \n     subsequent developments to indicate that it is not ``the \n     law.'' In no subsequent campaign financing case, and there \n     have been about a dozen, has the Court retreated in any way \n     from its 1976 conclusion that personal expenditure \n     limitations violate the First Amendment.\n       Although this bill does not directly restrict the right \n     recognized in Buckley, it does provide an incentive for \n     candidates to relinquish that right. In many other contexts, \n     this form of indirect restriction would create the \n     constitutional problems often discussed under the rubric of \n     ``unconstitutional conditions.'' See Speiser v. Randall, 357 \n     U.S. 513 (1958). To take an obvious example, it would be \n     plainly unconstitutional for the federal government to offer \n     a tax credit to anyone who agreed not to criticize the \n     President, and it would be equally unconstitutional to \n     provide discounted postal rates for pro-American but not \n     anti-American publications, or for Protestant but not \n     Catholic magazines. The idea of the doctrine of \n     unconstitutional conditions is that it is impermissible to \n     allow the government to do indirectly what it cannot do \n     directly, and that the potential for such indirect \n     restrictions are enormous given the number of governmental \n     programs on which people routinely depend. See also Arkansas \n     Writer's Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987).\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\n       Yet the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, even in \n     First Amendment context is much narrower than the First \n     Amendment itself. As the Supreme Court (controversially) held \n     in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the doctrine does \n     not require the government to be neutral in terms of the \n     programs it wishes to create or the activities it wishes to \n     subsidize. See also Regan  v. Taxation With Representation of \n     Washington, 461 U.S. 540 (1983). The government may \n     support a Fund for Democracy without having to offer equal \n     support for the Fund for Theocracy or the Fund for \n     Aristocracy. Similarly, there is no doubt that a high \n     level employee of the Department of Defense can be \n     required as a condition of employment to relinquish his or \n     her right to express public support for the present \n     government of Iraq, even though that right is one \n     protected by the First Amendment when exercised by \n     ordinary citizens. Although there is some force to the \n     doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, it is thus a \n     mistaken oversimplification to maintain that citizens may \n     not constitutionally be induced by government to give up \n     what would otherwise be their constitutional rights. \n     Especially when the restriction is not, as it is not here, \n     one based on the viewpoint of the speech, it is a \n     misstatement of the current law to say that it is \n     unconstitutional for the government to provide incentives \n     for citizens to forego their right under Buckley v. Valeo \n     to spend unlimited funds in support of their own political \n     candidacies.\n       Although reasonable minds might disagree with the foregoing \n     analysis, it is clear that the Supreme Court in Buckley did \n     not. In Buckley the Court explicitly concluded, even while it \n     was protecting the First Amendment rights of expenditure, \n     that Congress could, consistent with the First Amendment, \n     provide incentives to encourage political candidates to \n     accept voluntary limitations on their own campaign \n     expenditures. ``Congress may engage in public financing of \n     election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public \n     funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified \n     expenditure limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily \n     limit the size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he \n     may decide to forego private fundraising and accept public \n     funding.'' 424 U.S. at 57 n. 65. In Buckley the question \n     arose in the context of Presidential campaigns, but the \n     Court's just-quoted broad statement was not so limited, nor \n     is there any reason to suppose that there could be a \n     plausible distinction between the Senatorial campaigns that \n     are the subject of S. 1219 and the Presidential election \n     financing plan that prompted the Court's broad statement in \n     Buckley. Moreover, when a three judge United States District \n     Court in 1980 explicitly rejected an attack on voluntary \n     expenditure limitations in exchange for public financing, and \n     when the Supreme Court summarily affirmed that judgment, the \n     argument that the exchange was not truly voluntary was \n     rejected. Republican National Committee v. Federal Election \n     Commission, 487 F. Supp. 280 (three-judge court, S.D.N.Y. \n     1980), affirmed without opinion, 455 U.S. 955 (1980).\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In examining the incentives in S. 1219, I cannot see any \n     appreciable difference, on this issue, and from the \n     perspective of the candidate, between public funding, as in \n     Buckley, and the discounted advertising and postal rates that \n     are offered in S. 1219. First of all, both have the effect of \n     providing financial benefits for the candidate, and any \n     difference between the two would be a difference, from the \n     candidate's vantage point, of form and not of substance. In \n     addition, the discounts available under S. 1219 are, if there \n     is any difference at all, somewhat less direct. If a direct \n     cash subsidy is not, in the Supreme Court's eyes, an \n     unconstitutional inducement to relinquish a constitutional \n     right, then it is hard to see how the indirect inducements in \n     S. 1219 would be.\n       This is not to suggest that there is no merit in the \n     argument that the inducements offered make the seemingly \n     voluntary relinquishment not voluntary in fact. The line \n     between an inducement whose acceptance is truly voluntary and \n     one that begins to verge on the coercive is a wavering one, \n     and the special circumstances of a political campaign, in \n     which acceptance by a candidate's opponent would make the \n     rejection of the inducement even more costly, accentuate this \n     effect. Insofar as S. 1219, in section 105, offers increased \n     benefits to candidates whose opponents reject the \n     limitations, the coercive effect increases.\\2\\ Yet the \n     fundamentals of this phenomenon existed in Buckley itself, \n     since even without an amount keyed to acceptance or rejection \n     by a candidate's opponent, a candidate still is faced with a \n     choice under circumstances in which the candidate's opponent \n     will be subsidized by the government. Nor is there any \n     suggestion in Buckley that the constitutionality of the \n     conditional public funding should depend on case-specific \n     determinations of the circumstances under which a candidate \n     exercised the option. Thus, the grounds for current \n     objections existed in large part in Buckley and existed in \n     all of the subsequent court decisions,\\3\\ all but one \\4\\ of \n     which have accepted the exchange that provides the linchpin \n     of S. 1219. So although there are plausible objections to the \n     voluntariness of the arrangement in S. 1219, these objections \n     go back to Buckley itself, which concluded as a matter of law \n     that such exchanges were voluntary rather than suggesting \n     that a case-specific and factual voluntariness inquiry was a \n     condition for constitutional acceptability. This leads me to \n     conclude that the various objections now offered to S. 1219 \n     and related proposals are not so much to the \n     unconstitutionality of S. 1219 under current law, but rather \n     to the state of the current law itself. The essence of the \n     objection is far less that Buckley supports the objection \n     than that Buckley was mistakenly decided.\\5\\\n       Much the same characterization applies to S. 1219 as a \n     restriction on broadcasters. In giving candidates broadcast \n     time, S. 1219 does to broadcasters what it plainly could not \n     do to newspaper publishers were the time (or space) offered \n     to be in newspapers, magazines, or even, in most contexts, \n     cable television. Under Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. \n     Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), the First Amendment protects \n     total editorial control over the contents of a newspaper, \n     even in the face of a claim that granting space in a \n     newspaper would broaden rather than narrow the range of \n     public debate. There is no doubt, therefore, that the \n     First Amendment would not allow Congress to provide free \n     or discounted newspaper space (without the consent of the \n     newspaper, of course) as part of the inducement for \n     candidates to accept voluntary expenditure limitations.\n       Broadcasters are not newspapers, of course, not only as a \n     matter of fact, but also as a matter of law. The Supreme \n     Court rejected the broadcaster-newspaper analogy in Red Lion \n     Broadcasting Company v. Federal Communications Commission, \n     395 U.S. 367 (1969), agreeing with the congressional judgment \n     in 1934 that the airwaves were public property, to be \n     assigned in the public interest, and subject to limitations \n     designed to ensure that the public retained part of their \n     use. This has been embodied in the personal attack, equal \n     time, and (now obsolete) fairness doctrines, all of which has \n     the effect of ``giving'' some of the time encompassed by a \n     broadcast license to the public.\n       In rejecting the claim that broadcasters have an unlimited \n     First Amendment right to unfettered editorial control over \n     the time encompassed by their license, the Supreme Court in \n     Red Lion relied in part on the controversial notion that the \n     airwaves ``belonged'' to the government and could thus be \n     licensed subject to otherwise impermissible content-based \n     restrictions, and in part on the even more controversial, and \n     potentially technologically obsolete, argument that because \n     there were a limited number of broadcast bands (what is known \n     as the scarcity argument), those bands could be allocated \n     under content-based conditions that would never be permitted \n     for newspapers. Again, however, it is very important to \n     distinguish complaints about the existing law from the \n     argument that the existing law prohibits this legislation. As \n     long as Red Lion remains the law, Congress may within limits \n     consider broadcast time to belong to the public, and to be \n     subject to allocation in the public interest. In this \n     respect, therefore, price restrictions on advertising, and \n     direct grants of broadcast time, will not violate the First \n     Amendment as it is presently interpreted.\n       Finally, let me add a few words about the Political Action \n     Committee (PAC) contribution limitation in Section 201. As I \n     am sure you know, this restriction, in light of Federal \n     Election Commission v. National Conservative Political Action \n     Committee, 470 U.S. 480 (1985), is likely unconstitutional \n     under current law, although the narrow majority opinion in \n     Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990), \n     might provide some basis for suggesting reconsideration of \n     the earlier case. Given the state of the law, however, the \n     issues now are much different, involving questions about the \n     responsibility of Congress in the face of contrary Supreme \n     Court precedent. There is a line of academic and political \n     opinion that maintains that Congress should engage in its own \n     direct consideration of what the Constitution requires, \n     without regard for, or at least not subject to, the authority \n     of contrary Supreme Court options. I do not subscribe to this \n     view, and I do not urge it on you, although the reasons for \n     my belief encompass the full domain of constitutional \n     jurisprudence. Since this is not the place to engage that \n     issue, I will simply assume that you believe that Congress \n     should respect the role of the Supreme Court as authoritative \n     interpreter of the Constitution.\n       Yet even within this view, it is of course possible in good \n     faith to believe that times change, that Justices change, and \n     that constitutional law changes. And it is possible, \n     therefore, to believe that Congress can act responsibly in \n     giving the courts the opportunity to reconsider their earlier \n     views in light of changed circumstances or in light of the \n     possibility that their earlier views may have been mistaken. \n     The rapidly escalating cost of elections make this a \n     plausible circumstance to give the Supreme Court this \n     opportunity, and just as it is ``legitimate'' for opponents \n     of section 101 to believe in good faith that the Court should \n     reconsider its judgment in Buckley that public inducements \n     for voluntary expenditure limitations do not violate the \n     First Amendment, so too is it legitimate for proponents of \n     section 201 to believe in good faith that changing \n     circumstances, or the bipartisan nature of this initiative, \n     are sufficient to invite the Court to reconsider its judgment \n     in Federal Election Commission v. National Conservative \n     Political Action Committee. Still, as a matter of existing \n     case law, section 201 is far more problematic, as I am sure \n     you know, than section 101.\n       To conclude, I believe that existing caselaw strongly \n     supports the constitutionality of sections 101 and 241, and \n     casts considerable doubt on section 201.\\6\\ In both\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\n     cases, there are arguments that could be made against the \n     caselaw, but it remains important to distinguish arguments \n     against the caselaw from arguments from the caselaw.\n       I hope you find this useful.

Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter of \n     February 14, 1996, in which you asked for my assessment of \n     the constitutionality of three provisions in S. 1219, the \n     currently pending campaign finance bill authored by you, \n     Senator McCain, and others.\n       In summary, I believe the provision of discounted \n     television time and postage rates, conditional upon the \n     candidate's compliance with voluntary spending limits, is \n     constitutional.\n       It is more difficult to form a confident opinion with \n     respect to the other two provisions, because there is very \n     little from the Supreme Court on which to rely. The first of \n     these is a requirement that candidates who accept the \n     discounted television time and postage rates must agree that \n     at least sixty percent of contributions received come from \n     individuals residing in the candidate's state. I believe this \n     probably is constitutional, at least in part. The second is a \n     ban on PAC contributions to federal candidates. This may be \n     unconstitutional, but in light of the ``back-up'' provision \n     in S. 1219, the chance may be worth taking for those who wish \n     to eliminate PACs, since a declaration that the provision is \n     unconstitutional will not jeopardize the legislation as a \n     whole.\n       1. Voluntary spending limits. The Supreme Court held, in \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), that as a general rule, \n     limits on the amount that a candidate's campaign can spend \n     are unconstitutional. However, the Court also opened a \n     loophole in this general ban on campaign spending limits, in \n     footnote 65 of the Buckley opinion:\n       ``. . . Congress may engage in public financing of election \n     campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an \n     agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure \n     limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the \n     size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide \n     to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.''\n       Although footnote 65 may raise many more questions that it \n     answers, it does seem to answer the question whether it is \n     constitutional to condition discounted television time and \n     postage rates on the acceptance of spending limits. The only \n     difference between this case and the case considered in \n     footnote 65 is that in the former, the government is offering \n     in-kind benefits to the candidate, while in the latter it is \n     offering money. The money gives the candidate more \n     flexibility in the management of his or her campaign, and \n     therefore is presumably of greater value than an equivalent \n     amount of in-kind benefits. But there is no apparent reasons \n     why this should make a difference for constitutional \n     purposes. In each case, the government is providing a real \n     benefit. If the in-kind benefit is less valuable to \n     candidates than cash, then it may be less likely that \n     candidates will accept the in-kind benefits than that they \n     will accept the cash. But candidates who do accept the \n     benefits/spending limits packages do so equally voluntarily \n     in each case. Therefore, I conclude that these provisions of \n     S. 1219 are constitutional.\n       2. Limit on organizational and out-of-state contributions. \n     Part of the benefits/spending limits package that is offered \n     to candidates under S. 1219 is that at least 60 percent of \n     the contributions accepted by the candidate must be from \n     individuals who reside within the candidate's state.\n       I have argued above that for purposes of footnote 65 of \n     Buckley v. Valeo, the fact that in-kind benefits are being \n     offered to candidates instead of cash should make no \n     difference. In footnote 65, the provision of benefits was \n     conditioned on the candidate's acceptance of spending limits. \n     Here, the benefits are conditioned on accepting two combined \n     aggregate contribution limits--on contributions from non-\n     individuals, and on contributions from out-of-state \n     individuals. Does this make a constitutional difference?\n       There is an obvious basis for answering this question in \n     the negative. Buckley and subsequent decisions of the Supreme \n     Court have generally treated restrictions on contributions as \n     less constitutionally offensive than restrictions on \n     expenditures. If voluntary expenditure restrictions tied to \n     benefits to the candidate are permissible, why not voluntary \n     contribution restrictions?\n       Insofar as the restriction is on the amount that can be \n     accepted in contributions from non-individuals, the voluntary \n     restriction should be constitutional. The government may \n     prefer contributions from individuals on at least two grounds \n     that seem plausible. First, organizations typically are \n     formed for a limited set of purposes. A contribution by an \n     organization is likely to be made in furtherance of the \n     limited purposes of the organization. Accordingly, it may be \n     more likely than a contribution from an individual to create \n     the sort of conflict of interest that the Court refers to as \n     ``corruption or the appearance of corruption.'' Of course, \n     contributions from individuals may create the same \n     conflict of interest, but because the purposes of \n     individuals are not artificially limited, individuals are \n     more likely to contribute for a variety of reasons \n     unrelated to influencing legislation on particular issues. \n     Second, it is widely accepted that the principle of \n     freedom of speech protects both instrumental interests \n     such as the airing of public issues, and individual \n     interests such as the need of humans to express \n     themselves. The second category of First Amendment \n     interests applies to individuals, and this may provide \n     some basis for the government preferring contributions \n     from individuals over contributions from organizations.\n       It is much more difficult to justify the restriction on \n     contributions from out-of-state individuals. I have \n     occasionally made small contributions to Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, because he was a college classmate of mine. Under \n     S. 1219, if Senator Lieberman had already received forty \n     percent of his contributions from non-individuals or out-of-\n     state residents, he would be required to reject my \n     contribution. Yet, I can see no danger whatever to the public \n     interest from my contribution, arising from the fact that I \n     live in California rather than Connecticut. If anything, this \n     restriction would enhance the likelihood of conflict of \n     interest, by heightening the pressure on Senator Lieberman to \n     raise money from individuals who reside in Connecticut. There \n     is no apparent reason for assuming that in-state \n     contributions are more or less corrupting than out-of-state \n     contributions, but anything that reduces the flow of money \n     from one source heightens the candidate's need for money from \n     the remaining sources and thus may increase the likelihood of \n     pressure.\n       Campaign spending limits can reduce conflict of interest by \n     reducing the pressure on candidates to raise funds. Limits on \n     contributions from organizations can be justified for the \n     reasons stated above. Limits on contributions from out-of-\n     state individuals serve no good purpose. Nevertheless, the \n     emphasis in Buckley's footnote 65 is on the voluntariness of \n     the candidate's acceptance of a restriction, not on the \n     utility of the restriction. It is difficult to say whether \n     the lack of utility of a restriction would enter into the \n     Court's constitutional equation.\n       For the reasons, I conclude that the restriction on the \n     proportion of contributions a candidate may accept from \n     organizations is constitutional. The restriction on the \n     proportion of contributions a candidate may accept from out-\n     of-state contributions presents a close question, but there \n     is a substantial possibility that it would be upheld.\n       3. Ban on PAC contributions. S. 1219 prohibits all \n     contributions and expenditures in federal elections except \n     from individuals and from committees controlled by candidates \n     and political parties. The practical consequence is that PACs \n     are banned from making contributions and expenditures in \n     federal elections.\n       In Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 \n     (1990), the Supreme Court upheld a state ban on independent \n     expenditures by corporations. In Austin, the Court pointed \n     out that there was no absolute ban on corporate political \n     spending because corporations were permitted ``to make \n     independent political expenditures through separate \n     segregated funds'' (i.e., through PACs). Although Austin does \n     not hold that a ban on corporate independent spending that \n     extended to PACs would be unconstitutional, it suggests that \n     a ban on independent spending by PACs would be highly suspect \n     under the First Amendment.\n       Thus, the S. 1219 ban on expenditures by PACs is probably, \n     though not certainly, unconstitutional. Whether the ban on \n     PAC contributions is constitutional is much harder to say. As \n     was stated above, the Supreme Court has been more tolerant of \n     restrictions on contributions than on expenditures. In \n     Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. \n     290 (1981), the Court devoted some rhetoric to the value of \n     ``the practice of persons sharing common views banding \n     together to achieve a common end,'' and the ``tradition of \n     volunteer committees for collective action.'' But that was in \n     the context of a limit on contributions to a campaign \n     committee, not to a PAC that would be making contributions in \n     turn to other committees. A ban on PACs is a more severe \n     restriction on association for campaign fundraising purposes \n     than anything the Court has upheld, and it would have a \n     severe practical effect on the ability of many small \n     contributors to participate in the campaign finance\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\n     system. Union members and contributors to ideological PACs \n     are examples of people who traditionally have depended on \n     such organizations to pool their individually insignificant \n     contributions. I know of nothing in the Supreme Court's \n     precedents that gives much guidance as to how this question \n     would be resolved.\n       I conclude that the ban on PAC expenditures is probably \n     unconstitutional. The constitutionality of the ban on PAC \n     contributions is uncertain.\n       S. 1219 has a ``fallback'' provision that, in the event \n     that the PAC ban is struck down, candidates must limit the \n     aggregate amount they receive from PACs to an amount equal to \n     20 percent of the spending limit. The constitutionality of \n     such aggregate contribution limits has not been considered by \n     the Supreme Court. I believe they are not unconstitutional in \n     general, though they may be if they are overly restrictive. \n     The S. 1219 fallback provisions are certainly restrictive, \n     but whether they are so restrictive that the Supreme Court \n     would declare them unconstitutional is a matter for \n     speculation.\n       I have given extensive attention to the constitutionality \n     of aggregate contribution limits in a law review article, and \n     rather than report the analysis here, I simply refer you to \n     Daniel Hays Lowenstein, ``A Patternless Mosaic: Campaign \n     Finance and the First Amendment After Austin,'' 21 Capital \n     University Law Review 381, 413-424 (1992). More generally, \n     the remainder of that article and the articles in the same \n     symposium by Professors Roy A. Schotland and Marlene \n     Arnold Nicholson may be of interest to you, your \n     colleagues and your staff on this difficult issue.\n       The foregoing is my response to your questions. Let me add \n     the obvious point that I have confined this letter to the \n     questions of constitutionality that you posed, and have not \n     attempted to state my policy views on S. 1219 or the subjects \n     with which it deals.\n       Thank you for extending me the opportunity to participate \n     in the Senate's deliberations. If I can be of any further \n     assistance, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Daniel H. Lowenstein,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             University of Chicago Law School,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, April 4, 1996.\n     Senator Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This will respond to your request for my \n     views on the constitutional issues raised by S. 1219. I am \n     writing under unusual time pressure, and I hope you will \n     forgive me for offering a brief and somewhat preliminary \n     analysis.\n       S. 1219 raises many difficult and complex questions, and my \n     most general thought is that to sort out those questions, it \n     would be best to hold hearings with some extended discussion \n     of the underlying factual issues and the caselaw law. For the \n     moment, I will devote my attention to three provisions about \n     which you express most concern. The first of these provisions \n     is probably constitutional; the second raises new issues and \n     any judgment must be tentative; the third is probably \n     unconstitutional.\n       1. Section 101 provides certain financial incentives to \n     candidates to limit their spending. In exchange for agreeing \n     to limit overall spending, a candidate will receive free and \n     discounted television time, and also discounted postal rates.\n       I believe that this provision should and would be upheld. \n     With respect to candidates, it is not direct coercion. It \n     does not discriminate on the basis of point of view. It is \n     also supported by the legitimate interests in promoting \n     attention to electoral issues and in using public money to \n     enlarge public discussion and participation. The best \n     authority here is Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), where \n     the Supreme Court upheld a provision making major party \n     candidates eligible for public financing if and only if they \n     agreed to forego private contributions and to limit their \n     expenditures to the amount of the major party subsidy. This \n     basic principle strongly supports section 101.\n       Some complex questions might be raised by requirements of \n     free television time for specified candidates. Such \n     requirements have no clear precedent. But a general \n     requirement of free television time violates no one's first \n     amendment rights so long as it is viewpoint-neutral, cf. \n     Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994), \n     and the forms of selectivity in section 101 are consistent \n     with Buckley. Most generally, a system that promotes more \n     coverage of candidates through free media could enhance free \n     speech purposes by counteracting the ``soundbite'' phenomenon \n     and enhancing democratic processes. See Sunstein, Democracy \n     and the Problem of Free Speech 85 (1993). The legal issues \n     are not entirely settled, but my preliminary judgment is that \n     section 101 should and probably would be upheld.\n       2. Section 241 would require candidates voluntarily \n     complying with section 101 to raise at least 60% of their \n     individual contributions from people within their own state. \n     This provision is a bit more problematic and it raises novel \n     issues. The major question is: What is Congress' legitimate \n     justification here, and what factual evidence supports that \n     justification? Apparently the proposal is a response to the \n     perceived problem of out-of-state money affecting state \n     elections, so that candidates receive support not because the \n     real voters want them, but because out-of-state financial \n     interests have allowed for a great deal of advertising. \n     Perhaps Congress could find that the interest in in-state \n     control of state elections justifies a measure of this kind, \n     at least when the relevant law is tied to a voluntary \n     restriction.\n       It is possible that this justification can be made \n     legitimate and sufficiently weighty. But under existing law, \n     the answer is not clear. The Court has not dealt with this \n     particular justification. Moreover, it is possible that in a \n     national system, out-of-state money legitimately affects \n     state elections, and it is possible that the Court would find \n     it unacceptably paternalistic to ban out-of-state money to \n     ``protect'' in-state voters. See First National Bank v. \n     Bellotti, 434 US 765 (1978) (questioning efforts to protect \n     voters from ``excessive'' speech). Distinctive issues \n     involving federalism are obviously raised by section 241. A \n     set of hearings would be helpful in sorting out this \n     important issue.\n       3. Section 201 would prohibit political action committees \n     (PACs) from contributing to federal candidates. This \n     provision appears to be unconstitutional under FEC v. NCPAC, \n     470 US 480 (1985), where the Court invalidated a provision \n     prohibited any PAC from spending more than $1,000 to further \n     the election of a presidential candidate receiving federal \n     funding. Any regulation of PACs will have the best chance of \n     success if it builds on CMA v. FEC, 453 US 182 (1981), where \n     the Court upheld a system banning any individual from \n     contributing more than $5,000 per year to PACs.\n       If Congress wants to put the Court's decision in the NCPAC \n     case in question, it would do best to hold extensive hearings \n     uncovering problems that the Court did not see in 1985, or \n     proposing alternative mechanisms to allow organizations to \n     give financial aid to candidates, or perhaps attaching \n     ``strings'' to the receipt of money by PACs. This is a matter \n     that could require a high degree of creativity.\n       My basic conclusions, then, are that section 101 is \n     probably constitutional; that section 201 is almost certainly \n     unconstitutional; and that under existing law, the \n     constitutionality of section 241 is unsettled, and that is \n     validity would turn on the underlying evidence and on a \n     careful identification of a legitimate legislative interest. \n     My more general suggestion is that because of the difficulty \n     of these issues, and associated issues in these and other \n     provisions on which I have not touched, it would be highly \n     desirable to hold hearings to get a range of views about the \n     underlying issues of fact, policy, and law.\n       I hope that these brief comments are helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cass R. Sunstein,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                DePaul University,\n\n\n                                               College of Law,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, April 30, 1996.\n     Senator Russel D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter of April \n     12, 1996, asking for my assessment of the constitutionality \n     of provisions of S. 1219. I believe that the prospects for a \n     finding of constitutionality are mixed. There is a high \n     likelihood that the aspect of the bill which seems to be the \n     central focus--voluntary expenditure limitations in return \n     for in-kind benefits--would be found constitutional. \n     Conversely, I believe the PAC ban would almost certainly be \n     found unconstitutional. Predictions with respect to other \n     aspects of the bill are less clear. I will discuss these \n     conclusions below. I should note that some of the provisions \n     present novel constitutional issues and that the analyses \n     necessary to resolve some of the issues would be quite \n     intricate and lengthy. Therefore my remarks below will be \n     rather general and I will not attempt to explore the issues \n     in depth in this letter. However, if you would like a more \n     complex analysis in the future I would be happy to assist you \n     further.\n       1. The spending limit condition attached to receipt of in-\n     kind benefits.\n       In the well known Buckley footnote 65 the Supreme Court \n     clearly stated that despite the fact that expenditure \n     limitations are otherwise unconstitutional, when made a \n     condition to the voluntary acceptance of public subsidies \n     they are valid. Although this footnote must be considered \n     dicta, as the constitutionality of the provision was not \n     being challenged, it should be noted that the Supreme Court \n     later summarily affirmed a case which rejected a direct \n     constitutional challenge to the condition. Republican \n     National Committee v. Federal Election Commission (RNC) 487 \n     F. Supp. 280 (S.D.N.Y.) aff'd, 445 U.S. 955 (1980). A summary \n     affirmance is a decision on the merits, and is therefore \n     binding precedent; however, the Supreme court may feel less \n     compunction about overturning such a decision that one \n     supported by a written opinion.\n       In RNC the district court asserted that there was no real \n     burden on First Amendment expression because a candidate \n     would only choose the public subsidy if it would enhance his \n     or her expression. Alternatively, the court determined \n     that even if there was a burden on expression the \n     restrictions would satisfy strict scrutiny because they \n     were necessary to compelling government interests in \n     preventing undue influence and saving time and energy for \n     expression other than fundraising. (See my enclosed \n     article from the Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly for \n     a more thorough discussion of this\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\n     case and the unconstitutional condition doctrine \n     generally.)\n       The reasoning of the district court in RNC has been \n     reinforced by practical experience in the years since it was \n     decided. The public's growing perception that campaign \n     contributions cause undue influence cannot be controverted. \n     The degree of validity of that perception can probably never \n     be definitively determined. But regardless whether that \n     perception is correct, it has added to the rampant \n     disillusion with our political system which we are currently \n     experiencing. In Buckley the Court made clear that preventing \n     the appearance of impropriety as well as the reality is a \n     compelling government interest. Furthermore, the \n     extraordinary amount of time spent by candidates on \n     fundraising--time taken away from other kinds of campaigning \n     that reaches more people--from attending to official duties. \n     The latter concern alone might today be considered a \n     compelling government interest. The in-kind benefits combined \n     with expenditure limitations will advance the interests \n     asserted in RNC  and Buckley because they will substitute for \n     a substantial number of contributions which would otherwise \n     be raised by those candidates who choose to comply. To the \n     extent that candidates fail to comply the interests will not \n     be forwarded; however, this will merely maintain the status \n     quo with respect to the campaign activities of noncomplying \n     candidates without burdens to their first amendment \n     expression. It is very clear that without expenditure \n     limitations subsidies or in-kind benefits would merely be \n     used to augment rather than substitute for fundraising and \n     would therefore not serve the aims of S. 1219.\n       Expenditure limitations will no doubt be challenged as \n     aiding incumbents to the disadvantage of challengers. \n     However, the fact that the limitations are voluntary greatly \n     weakens that argument. In addition, if one looks at the \n     combined effect of the various provisions of S. 1219 the \n     extent to which they would cut into major funding sources of \n     incumbents is quite remarkable. I am referring to the \n     restrictions on PACs, bundling, soft money, out-of-state \n     contributions and leadership committees. The restrictions on \n     the use of the frank further diminishes the advantages of \n     incumbency.\n       2. The condition of limitations on contributions from \n     organizations and out-of-state individuals.\n       I presume that the rationale for this condition on in-\n     kind benefits is that in-state individuals are likely to \n     contribute for reasons having to do with a generalized \n     interest in representation, while organizations, and to a \n     lesser extent, out-of-state individuals are likely to \n     contribute to pursue a limited purpose that would be more \n     likely to involve undue influence. It is difficult to \n     reach a conclusion as to whether the Court would consider \n     this distinction strong enough to uphold the restriction. \n     The fact that the Court has generally been more accepting \n     of contribution limitations than expenditure limitations \n     will be a help, as will the fact that it is a voluntary \n     restriction applicable only to candidates who accept the \n     in-kind benefits. Although the aggregate limitation may be \n     viewed as rather severe because it in effect bans \n     contributions from some sources after the threshold has \n     been reached, it is a particularly effective means of \n     preventing undue influence. As Professor Daniel Lowenstein \n     has persuasively argued, such restrictions vitiate the \n     undue influence producing effects of even those \n     contributions that are accepted below the threshold \n     amount. This is because the supply of such contributions \n     will ordinarily be greater than the legal demand, thereby \n     lessening the importance of any one contribution.\n       3. The requirement that the media time be used in intervals \n     of 30 seconds or more or less than 5 minutes.\n       I assume that the purpose for this limitation is two-fold. \n     The 5 minute provision probably is an attempt to avoid \n     onerous burdens on the media which will be required to cede \n     time to candidates. This interest is certainly permissible \n     and should not pose First Amendment problems. The minimum of \n     30 seconds does create what I consider to be a technical \n     First Amendment problem. I use the term ``technical'' because \n     it arises as the logical consequence of holdings in some \n     Supreme Court opinions. I would argue that were the Court to \n     invalidate this requirement it would be an example of \n     carrying logic to an absurd conclusion.\n       The constitutional issue arises because the provision seems \n     to be an attempt to cause candidates to formulate their \n     message in a particular way. This runs into case law that has \n     held that individuals can express themselves using whatever \n     words or symbols they choose, with the possible exception of \n     certain speech which is imposed on a captive audience. \n     Compare Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), and Texas v. \n     Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), with FCC v. Pacifica \n     Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). Also, somewhat relevant are \n     cases holding that the government cannot force individuals to \n     speak. See Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977). The \n     minimum 30 second commercial requirement in the bill, unlike \n     the cases cited, does not directly target content. No one is \n     forced to use particular words or avoid others, or to convey \n     a particular message. The issue of content regulation comes \n     into play because it appears that the purpose of the \n     regulation is to cause candidates to express themselves using \n     a format that is more likely to have serious content than the \n     typical 10 second spot, thus encouraging a thoughtful \n     exploration of real issues. The Supreme Court has never \n     dealt with a case involving a simple time regulation of \n     speech which is aimed at affecting content. Therefore, the \n     cases presenting constitutional obstacles would not be \n     directly on point--rather, general statements taken out of \n     context would be used to challenge the regulation.\n       I believe that a credible response to such challenges would \n     stress the following arguments: Even if the aim is to affect \n     the content of the speech, the concern with content is quite \n     general. There does not appear to be an intent to regulate \n     viewpoint, which is the most serious of content regulation \n     problems. Indeed, the concern is not even with the somewhat \n     less serious matter of regulation of subject matter, as the \n     candidate can use the time to discuss any subject he or she \n     wishes. Rather the regulation is an attempt to encourage the \n     candidate to actually say something meaningful. But the \n     candidate can thwart the government and still use his or her \n     time for totally vacuous expression without suffering any \n     detriment other than the possibility that the vacuousness \n     will be more obvious to the audience than it might be if the \n     commercial was shorter. Such a detriment hardly seems to rise \n     to the level of a serious First Amendment concern.\n       The fact that the restrictions only apply to candidates who \n     voluntarily accept the in-kind benefits should be an \n     important factor in favor of a finding of constitutionality. \n     Although a more definitive content regulation attached as a \n     condition of a benefit would be unconstitutional, the \n     regulation in question should not meet the same fate because, \n     for the reasons discussed above, it has little in common with \n     the kind of content regulations which the Court has shown \n     serious concern for in past cases. Furthermore, I find it \n     hard to believe that the fact that the purpose of the \n     regulation is to encourage an intelligent discussion of \n     election issues will not influence the Court positively, even \n     though that concern can be described as generally content \n     based.\n       4. The increased spending limit in Section 502 and the \n     increased contribution limit in Section 105 applicable to \n     complying candidates opposed by non-complying candidates.\n       These two sections of S. 1219 present potentially serious \n     constitutional problems, and it is very difficult to predict \n     how they would be resolved by the Supreme Court. There is no \n     Supreme Court case law dealing with an analogous provision. \n     Although there are two federal circuit court cases addressing \n     somewhat similar statutes--one upholding and one invalidating \n     the provisions--the cases involved statutes that are \n     distinguishable from S. 1219 and from each other.\n       In Vote Choice v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1993) the \n     federal circuit court upheld a Rhode Island law which \n     provided subsidies conditioned on spending limits and also \n     increased the $1,000 contribution limit to $2,000 for \n     candidates agreeing to the expenditure limitation. \n     However, in Day v. Holahan, 34 F.3d 1356 (8th Cir. 1994), \n     cert. denied 115 S. Ct. 936 (1995), the court invalidated \n     a Minnesota statute which provided that when independent \n     expenditures where made opposing a candidate complying \n     with the spending limits (which were conditions of state \n     subsidies), or supporting his or her opponent, the state \n     subsidy would be increased in an amount equal to one half \n     the independent expenditure. In addition, the overall \n     campaign expenditure limitation of the complying candidate \n     would be increased in an amount equal to the independent \n     expenditure.\n       A third case, relied upon by Professor Joel Gora in his \n     testimony, is somewhat analogous, but easily distinguishable. \n     Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin, 71 F.3d 1422 (8th \n     Cir. 1995) involved a statute which banned contributions from \n     organizations to candidates not complying with expenditure \n     limitations. The court stressed that this statute was not \n     analogous to Buckley because the restrictions were not a \n     condition of the receipt of any return benefit and because \n     the ban on organization contributions could not have been \n     constitutionally imposed independently of an agreement to the \n     expenditure limitation. The Court concluded that ``No \n     candidate would voluntarily agree to comply with the \n     expenditure limits in exchange for access to sources of \n     funding to which he or she already has a constitutional right \n     of access.'' Id. at 1425.\n       Rather than engage in the very intricate and lengthy \n     constitutional analysis which would be required to attempt to \n     determine the significance of DiStefano and Day to the \n     somewhat similar provisions in S. 1219, I will make a few \n     general comments. In my view the provisions in S. 1219 fall \n     somewhere between the provisions reviewed in the two cases, \n     both with respect to the burdens on expression and the \n     importance and legitimacy of the government interests being \n     pursued. For this reason it is particularly difficult to \n     determine whether either of the two circuit courts would have \n     upheld the provisions in S. 1219. My guess is that the \n     results in the two cases reflect an approach sufficiently \n     different from each other that one circuit would uphold the \n     provisions in S. 1219, while the other would find them \n     unconstitutional. However, the two cases could be \n     distinguished from each other in manner which would reflect \n     negatively on the provisions in S. 1219. This is because a \n     somewhat stronger case can be made for a chill on expression \n     when a complying candidate obtains a comparative benefit \n     based on the expressive actions of the other candidate or his \n     supporters than when it is the action of the\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\n     complying candidate which results in his or her comparative \n     benefit.\n       5. the PAC BANS and the ``fallback'' provision\n       I consider the PAC bans to clearly unconstitutional. \n     Although there is a weak argument in favor of the \n     constitutionality of the bans on contributions, there is no \n     argument consistent with the Supreme Court's campaign finance \n     jurisprudence which would lead to affirmance of a ban on \n     expenditures. The ``fallback'' provision, however, is \n     consistent with the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on campaign \n     finance regulation. I am generally in agreement with the \n     analysis submitted by Professor Lowenstein on these \n     provisions, so I will not repeat that discussion here.\n       Thank you inviting me to comment upon the proposed \n     legislation. If I can be of any further assistance, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Marlene Arnold Nicholson,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              American University,\n\n\n                                           Office of the Dean,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1996.\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for inviting me to provide \n     comments on the constitutionality of S. 1219. It is an honor \n     to give you my thoughts on this important legislation. It \n     would probably be most useful for you to have a \n     constitutional analysis based on existing case law, and so I \n     have given you my best interpretive efforts based on the \n     state of constitutional doctrine as it exists today.\n       Section 101: There is no general problem with conditioning \n     the receipt of public funding or benefits by candidates on an \n     agreement to abide by limits on overall campaign spending. \n     This exact regime for financing presidential campaigns was \n     upheld in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). The Court \n     stated in no uncertain terms: ``Congress may engage in public \n     financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance \n     of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by \n     specific expenditure limitations. Just as a candidate may \n     voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to \n     accept, he may decide to forgo private fundraising and accept \n     public funding.'' Id. at 58, n.65. The Supreme Court has \n     maintained this general posture towards the conditioning of \n     public benefits since Buckley was decided. See, e.g., Rust v. \n     Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991) (holding that the government \n     could restrict speech within a publicly funded family-\n     planning program so long as it was on a viewpoint-neutral \n     basis).\n       It makes no difference to the analysis here that the \n     campaign benefits awarded to participating candidates will be \n     in the form of free and discounted television time and \n     discounted postage rates. These goods have an easily \n     ascertained monetary value and have no more coercive effect \n     than money. Nor does it make any difference that \n     participating candidates must abide by limits on what they \n     spend of their own personal funds (Section 502) since the \n     element of voluntary choice to participate in the public \n     benefits regime remains effective and meaningful.\n       One problem that I see potentially arising with Section 101 \n     relates to Section 502, which increases an eligible \n     candidate's spending limit by 20% if a non-participating \n     candidate collects contributions or spends personal funds \n     over the spending limit by 10% or more. It may be argued--\n     although I think with little force--that such a rule in \n     effect punishes the non-complying candidate spending \n     beyond the desired ceiling by giving the complying \n     candidate for an extra benefit beyond the original \n     bargain. There is actually an Eighth Circuit Court \n     decision that stands for something like this proposition. \n     See Day v. Hollohan, 34 F.3d 1356 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. \n     denied, 115 S. Ct. 936 (1995). (striking down a provision \n     that increased a complying candidate's spending ceiling by \n     the amount of money he or she is overspent by a non-\n     complying opponent and providing half of the difference in \n     public money).\n       Whatever the merits of this strange decision, however, it \n     does not apply here because of a key difference in the way \n     the Minnesota plan and this one work. S. 1219 would not \n     directly provide additional public funds to compensate for \n     the difference in what complying and non-complying candidates \n     spend. Rather, this provision simply increases the ceiling on \n     what the complying candidate is authorized to raise on his or \n     her own. Even if the Day v. Hollohan decision is right that \n     we cannot directly, albeit partially, subsidize political \n     speech to meet political speech--a shocking and novel concept \n     if true--nothing like that is going on here. Congress is \n     simply allowing for eligible candidates to achieve a rougher \n     parity of resources and quantity of expression without \n     altering the necessity for them to raise their own money. It \n     should also be noted that under this regime it would still be \n     perfectly possible for a candidate running outside of the \n     public regime to outspend his or her opponent by huge amounts \n     of money and margins of 2 or 3 or 4-to-1 or indeed more.\n       A similar conceptual problem is raised by Section 105, \n     which would raise the limit on individual contributions to an \n     eligible candidate if he or she is running against a non-\n     participating opponent who has either received contributions \n     or spent personal funds in excess of 10% of the general \n     election limit. According to this provision, individuals \n     contributing to eligible candidates could give $2,000 as \n     opposed to the $1,000 limit that individuals giving to their \n     opponents would have to observe. There may be a strong \n     argument that this provision does not conform to the logic of \n     Buckley. Recall that the $1,000 individual contribution limit \n     was upheld as a narrowly tailored means of implementing the \n     compelling interest in combatting the reality and appearance \n     of corruption. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 30. As soon as you \n     raise--indeed double--the $1,000 limit in some cases, you may \n     have undermined the argument for the necessity of the basic \n     limit itself, especially when you have doubled it for \n     contributors to those candidates who will, almost by \n     definition, end up with a smaller overall pool of \n     contributors than their rivals. If it is not inherently \n     corrupting for candidate X to receive a $2,000 contribution \n     from one of 500 contributors, why is it inherently corrupting \n     for candidate Y to receive a $2,000 contribution from one of \n     1,000 contributors? This provision is potentially vulnerable \n     to the objection that it is not narrowly tailored to \n     advance Buckley's anti-corruption rationale and creates \n     major disparities in the legal rights of third parties--\n     citizen contributors--based simply on decisions that \n     candidates make.\n       However, a strong argument can also be made in favor of the \n     disparate contribution limits. In Vote Choice, Inc. v. \n     DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26 (1993), the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a very similar state \n     campaign financing provision which provided different \n     contribution limits for publicly-financed and privately-\n     financed candidates. In that case, the court considered Rhode \n     Island Gen. Law sec. 17-25-10.1 and 17-25-30(3). These \n     provisions generally capped contributions for political \n     candidates at $1,000. However, if a candidate qualified for \n     and accepted public financing, then his or her contribution \n     limit from individual citizens was raised to $2,000.\n       The First Circuit held that this disparity was a \n     permissible and narrowly tailored incentive encouraging \n     candidates to accept public regulation and financing. The \n     court dismissed the argument that a disparate cap was \n     unconstitutional punishment for not accepting public-funding. \n     Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 37. Contrary to the analysis I \n     suggested above, the court held that this provision was \n     narrowly tailored to the ultimate goal of preventing \n     corruption and the appearance of corruption. Id. at 41. Thus, \n     there is some strong support for the proposition that even a \n     special $2,000 limit for participating candidates could be \n     seen as narrowly tailored to the anti-corruption goals \n     promulgated in Buckley.\n       Section 241: This Section requires participating candidates \n     to raise at least 60% of their total sum of individual \n     contributions from individuals residing within their states. \n     It is, in my estimation, perfectly constitutional. Indeed, it \n     is my conclusion that the provision would be equally \n     constitutional if it required that 100% of the complying \n     candidate's contributions come from within state. The \n     decisive point, of course, is that no candidate is forced to \n     accept public financing, and so those who accept it can be \n     asked to abide by the government's reasonable and viewpoint-\n     neutral regulations. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, supra. But \n     even if it were an outright rule applying uniformly to all \n     candidates--participating and non-participating alike--\n     Section 241 would be lawful since it is safely rooted in \n     three different constitutional principles: the Seventeenth \n     Amendment guarantee of popular election of Senators, the \n     equal protection principle of one person-one vote, and \n     constitutional federalism, including Article V's command that \n     ``no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of it's \n     equal Suffrage in the Senate.''\n       The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, passed \n     in 1913, replaced the system of election of United States \n     Senators by the state legislatures with election ``by the \n     people [of] each State.'' This language, on its face, \n     establishes a presumption in favor of the constitutional \n     validity of federal and state laws that confine political \n     participation in a state to the ``people'' or citizens of \n     the state itself. Moreover, the legislative history of the \n     Seventeenth Amendment reflects that it was added to the \n     Constitution in order to break the political stranglehold \n     that out-of-state money interests had over Congress. New \n     York Senator Joseph Bristow, the author of the amendment, \n     declared that the ``great financial and industrial \n     institutions'' were using their power ``in almost \n     reprehensible and scandalous manner,'' spending ``enormous \n     amounts of money in corrupting legislatures to elect to \n     the Senate men of their own choosing.'' Standing on the \n     Senate floor in 1911, he asked: ``Shall the people of this \n     country be given an opportunity to elect their own \n     senators, or have them chosen by legislatures that are \n     controlled by influences that do not many times reside \n     within the State that those senators are to represent?''\n       Thus, if we take seriously the language, history, structure \n     and spirit of the Seventeenth Amendment, it seems clear that \n     Congress has the authority under Article I, Section 4, to \n     enforce the boundaries of popular election of United States \n     Senators.\n       The second Constitutional principle reinforcing the \n     Seventeenth Amendment basis for Section 241 is that of one \n     person-one vote under the Equal Protection clause. In \n     Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), the case which \n     constitutionalized the principle of one person-one vote, the \n     Supreme Court connected\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\n     resident citizenship in a state to participation in its \n     political processes:\n       ``. . . representative government is in essence self-\n     government through the medium of elected representatives of \n     the people, and each and every citizen has an inalienable \n     right to full and effective participation in the political \n     processes of his State. . . .'' Id. at 565.\n       If one person-one vote guarantees every citizen's right to \n     participate in the ``political processes'' of his or her own \n     state and political community, it is equally clear that non-\n     citizens of a state have no such right. If non-residents were \n     allowed to participate, their votes would, in both a \n     mathematical and constitutional sense, ``dilute'' the equal \n     representation of members of the community. Thus, we might \n     usefully think of Reynold's one person-one vote principle as \n     establishing a rule of one resident-one vote.\n       The Supreme Court has accepted as a premise of American \n     federalism that states may confine formal political rights \n     to their own citizens and prevent citizens of other states \n     from participating in their political processes. The Court \n     has continually ruled that states have the power to \n     categorically exclude both from the franchise and from \n     political candidacy American citizens who are not citizens \n     of the state or residents of the given election district. \n     See Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621 (1904); Kramer v. \n     Union-Free School District, 395 U.S. 621, 626-28 (1969); \n     Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419, 422 (1970); Dunn v. \n     Blumstein 405 U.S. 330, 344 (1972); Holt Civic Club v. \n     Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 68 (1978).\n       By linking a person's membership in a state or local \n     political community to the person's physical residence within \n     the state or community's legal borders, the Supreme Court has \n     tapped the deepest roots of American constitutional and \n     political philosophy. The Declaration of Independence began \n     with the principle that governments ``deriv[e] their just \n     powers from the consent of the governed.'' The Declaration of \n     Independence para. 2 (U.S. 1776). This principle means not \n     only that all those who are governed have a presumptive right \n     to participate in politics but that all those who are not \n     governed have no such right. This principle is closely \n     related to the founding American maxim of ``no taxation \n     without representation,'' whose obverse corollary is ``no \n     representation without taxation''--that is, no right of \n     political participation for those not subject to the \n     government's taxing power.\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the power of states \n     to confine political process rights to their own citizens and \n     to the members of specific sub-state political jurisdictions. \n     In Holt Civic Club,  the Court rejected the voting rights \n     claims of Alabama citizens who were partially governed by a \n     municipality but not permitted to vote in it. Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist stated: ``No decision of this Court has extended \n     the `one man, one vote' principle to individuals residing \n     beyond the geographic confines of the governmental entity \n     concerned, be it the State or its political subdivisions. On \n     the contrary, our cases have uniformly recognized that a \n     government unit may legitimately restrict the right to \n     participate in its political processes to those who reside \n     within its borders.'' Id at 68. (emphasis supplied)\n       In Dunn v. Blumstein, the Supreme Court struck down an \n     illegitimate one-year durational residence voting requirement \n     in Tennessee but carefully distinguished it from a legitimate \n     bona fide residence requirement. See 405 U.S. at 343. The \n     Court found that, unlike an arbitrary requirement that \n     residents spend a year in-state before gaining the right to \n     vote, a basic threshold requirement that all voters be bona \n     fide state residents is presumptively legitimate. For, as the \n     Court put it, an ``appropriately defined and uniformly \n     applied requirement of bona fide residence'' may be \n     ``necessary to preserve the basic conception of a political \n     community, and therefore could withstand close \n     constitutional scrutiny.'' Id. (emphasis supplied)\n       In Evans v. Corman, 398 U.S. 419 (1970), the Court stated \n     that it assumed that any state had a compelling interest in \n     ``insurin[ing' that only those citizens who are primarily or \n     substantially interested in or affected by electoral \n     decisions have a voice in making them.'' 398 U.S. at 422.\n       All of the Court's relevant decisions thus establish the \n     government's compelling interest in confining participation \n     in a state's formal ``political process'' to the state's own \n     citizens. This interest can be defined as a political \n     sovereignty interest, and may be vindicated also by Congress \n     using its powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n     See Katzenback v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966) (holding that \n     Congress has power under the Fourteenth Amendment to \n     elaborate and define the meaning of equal protection beyond \n     minimal constitutional requirements, especially in the voting \n     field).\n       The remaining question is whether making campaign \n     contributions can be treated by Congress as part of the \n     formal political process. The teaching of Buckley, of course, \n     is that political contributions are a formal and irreducible \n     part of the political process. But, because we have no \n     precedent directly on-point governing Section 241, we can \n     shed light on this question by examining federal and state, \n     statutory and judicial treatment of campaign contributions, \n     and specifically contributions offered by outsiders to \n     candidates in a political community.\n       Like voting and candidacy, the process of making campaign \n     contributions is closely regulated by federal and state \n     statute. This regulatory structuring is radically opposed to \n     the laissez faire treatment of informal political activities \n     like volunteering to help a campaign, endorsing a candidate, \n     or speaking to the press or the public, all of which are not \n     regulated by state or federal legislatures. The Federal \n     Election Campaign Act, which was mostly upheld in Buckley, \n     closely regulates federal campaign contributions, and similar \n     statutes exist in every state. This vast and expansive \n     regulatory treatment reflects the fact that campaign \n     contributions have become a formal and integral part of the \n     political process.\n       It is instructive to consider how federal law treats the \n     desire of foreign nationals to participate in political \n     campaigns by making money contributions. The United States \n     Congress has categorically banned all campaign contributions \n     in federal, state and local elections by foreign nationals--\n     that is, persons who are not members of any of the relevant \n     political communities. 2 U.S.C. sect. 441e(a) (1995) (``It \n     shall be unlawful for a foreign national directly or through \n     any person to make any contribution of money or other \n     thing of value, or to promise expressly or impliedly to \n     make any such contribution, in connection with an election \n     to any political office or in connection with any primary \n     election, convention, or caucus held to select candidates \n     for any political office; or for any person to solicit, \n     accept, or receive any such contribution from a foreign \n     national.'') When Senator Lloyd Bentsen introduced the \n     original 1974 legislation banning campaign contributions \n     by non-citizens, he made the following apposite statement: \n     ``I do not think foreign nationals have any business in \n     our political campaigns. They cannot vote in our elections \n     so why should we allow them to finance our elections? \n     Their loyalties lie elsewhere . . . '' 120 CONG. REC. 8783 \n     (1974).\n       The categorical prohibition adopted by Congress on ``money \n     speech'' by non-U.S. citizens in American campaigns reflects \n     the American political system's understanding that the right \n     to finance campaigns belongs to members of the electoral \n     community itself. From a constitutional perspective, a \n     citizen of Florida or Puerto Rico or Vermont or the District \n     of Columbia has no more of a cognizable interest in making \n     campaign contributions in Wisconsin than he or she does \n     voting there. Viewed through the proper lens of American \n     federalism, all persons who are not legal residents of \n     Wisconsin are not citizens of Wisconsin and should have no \n     formal political rights to participate in state or federal \n     elections there. Put in the starkest of terms, if a resident \n     of New York has no constitutional right or interest in voting \n     or running for office in Wisconsin's elections, he or she \n     should have no such right or interest in making campaign \n     contributions there that could have a far more decisive or \n     sweeping effect on the outcome of an election.\n       In another closely analogous case from a statutory context, \n     the United States Supreme Court upheld a blanket union rule \n     forbidding candidates for union office to accept campaign \n     contributions from persons who are not members of the union. \n     United Steelworkers of America v. Sadlowski, 457 U.S. 102 \n     (1982). The Court found that the Steelworkers' rule banning \n     ``outsider'' contributions did not violate the Labor-\n     Management Relations Act or the First Amendment. The Court \n     emphasized the legitimacy of the Steelworkers' desire to see \n     that ``nonmembers do not unduly influence union affairs.'' \n     Id. at 115. The union justly ``feared that officers who \n     received campaign contributions from nonmembers might be \n     beholden to those individuals and might allow their decisions \n     to be influenced by considerations other than the best \n     interests of the union. The union wanted to ensure that union \n     leadership remained responsive to the membership.'' Id.\n       Thus, it seems inescapable that Congress has a compelling \n     political equality interest in preventing a situation to \n     develop in which a majority of the money raised by U.S. \n     Senate candidates comes from non-citizens.\n       Third, Congress has a compelling constitutional interest in \n     protecting federalism and the states' ``basic conception'' of \n     their political communities. Intervention in Senate races by \n     non-citizen contributors changes the definition of the \n     state's political community, distorts the character of the \n     campaign process and the nature of campaign appeals, \n     potentially changes the outcome of elections and damages the \n     relationship of loyalty that ought to exist between residents \n     and their officials. In sum, out-of-state and out-of-district \n     money contributions are as distorting a political \n     intervention by non-citizens as would be out-of-state and \n     out-of-district votes and candidacies. If, as the Supreme \n     Court has held, the principal constitutional protections for \n     federalism lie in the political structure of state \n     representation in Congress, then there is clearly a \n     compelling governmental interest in preserving the integrity \n     of each state's political autonomy. Congress has \n     constitutional authority to preserve the ``equal Suffrage'' \n     of each state's representation in the Senate as provided for \n     in Article V.\n       Beyond the Seventeenth Amendment, one person-one vote and \n     federalism justifications for Section 241, Congress can spell \n     out compelling anti-corruption interests in enacting this \n     provision. Thus, even if one were to apply First Amendment \n     strict scrutiny to Section 241, I believe that the compelling \n     state interests and correspondingly narrowly tailored means \n     exist here.\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n       There are two anti-corruption interests that the Supreme \n     Court has found sufficiently compelling to uphold public \n     regulations of campaign contributions and expenditures. \n     First, in Buckley, the Court found sufficient justification \n     for Federal Election Campaign Act caps on campaign \n     contributions in Congress' ``primary purpose'' of \n     ``limit[ing] the actuality and appearance of corruption . . \n     .''\n       This interest is present here as well, but in an even more \n     striking way. There is a great risk of corruption when non-\n     citizens participate in the financing of a state's federal \n     candidates' campaigns since non-citizens are far more likely \n     to be motivated by a material or economic interest. The \n     Center for Responsive Politics has consistently found that \n     special interests and PACs give overwhelmingly to members who \n     sit on the congressional committees that legislate over them \n     regardless of their state affiliations. Open Secrets, the \n     Center's ``Encyclopedia of Congressional Money and \n     Politics,'' reveals further that a majority of Senate and \n     House committee chairs receive a majority of their money from \n     out-of-state contributors. Out-of-state and out-of-district \n     contributors are more likely to have a narrow material \n     interest in legislation, to exercise a corrupting effect on \n     legislation and legislators, and to promote the appearance of \n     quid pro quo corruption and trades.\n       The second anti-corruption interest upheld by the Supreme \n     Court is in guaranteeing that the levels of money spent on \n     behalf of a candidate authentically reflect popular support \n     rather than extrinsic and antidemocratic factors. This \n     interest was identified in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990). In Austin, the Court upheld a \n     Michigan law preventing corporations from using corporate \n     treasury funds to support or oppose candidates for state \n     office. The Court reasoned that a corporation amassed profits \n     on the basis of its economic prowess and the state's valuable \n     conferral of benefits to all corporations--not on the basis \n     of the public's support for the political ideology of the \n     corporate directors or management. Thus, Michigan was \n     perfectly justified in refusing to allow corporations to \n     convert their profits into political advocacy for particular \n     candidates. In allowing regulation of political money beyond \n     quid pro quo arrangements, the Court validated regulation of \n     ``a different type of corruption in the political arena: the \n     corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of \n     wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate \n     form and that have little or no correlation to the public's \n     support for the corporation's political ideas.'' Id. at 660.\n       Austin established that money contributions from sources \n     other than the individual citizens who make up the community \n     are inherently corrupting of democratic norms. The Court \n     stated that ``the political advantage of corporations is \n     unfair because `[t]he resources in the treasury of a business \n     corporation are not an indication of popular support for the \n     corporation's political ideas. They reflect instead the \n     economically motivated decisions of investors and customers.' \n     '' Id. at 660 (quoting FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for \n     Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 257 (1986).\n       Just as contributions drawn from a corporate treasury have \n     ``little or no correlation'' to the public's support for the \n     corporation's political ideas, contributions sent from non-\n     citizens who live out-of-state and out-of-district have \n     ``little or no correlation'' to the public's support for the \n     political ideas of such outsiders. These contributions \n     instead mostly reflect the economically motivated \n     contributions of outside interests and political investors. \n     Thus, corporate treasury funds and funds from out-of-state \n     sources inhabit the same vulnerable constitutional position \n     of antidemocratic political money that does not reflect the \n     popular preferences of the actual voting public.\n       If it advances compelling interests, Section 241's partial \n     ban on out-of-state contributions is also narrowly tailored. \n     First of all, it allows non-citizens to give campaign \n     contributions up until the point that they would become \n     almost half of the candidate's total receipts. Moreover, like \n     the contributions caps upheld in Buckely, this provision \n     leaves in place the unhampered ability of the regulated \n     parties--here, the out-of-state contributors--to spend \n     unlimited amounts of money on direct campaign expenditures \n     expressing their own political views in support of, or \n     against, a particular candidate. Thus, while a ban on \n     expenditures by non-citizens would presumably violate the \n     Court's Buckley ruling, ``a limitation upon the amount \n     that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate \n     or political committee entails only a marginal restriction \n     upon the contributor's ability to engage in free \n     communication . . .'' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20. Such a ban \n     ``does not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom \n     to discuss candidates and issues.'' Id. at 21.\n       Section 241 mirrors the regulation upheld in Buckley. It \n     works effectively to ban the political dominance created by \n     an overwhelming cash nexus between out-of-state contributors \n     and U.S. Senators. If non-citizens seek to promote a \n     meaningful political or ideological point as opposed to a \n     relationship of political debt with public officials, they \n     can still spend untold millions of dollars speaking and \n     making their views known. What they cannot do under this \n     provision is threaten the systemic corruption of Congress. \n     Although I would prefer to see it ban all out-of-state \n     contributions categorically, Section 241 is still shaped to \n     isolate the corrupting and antidemocratic effects of \n     involvement by out-of-state interests while allowing them \n     every opportunity to get a valid, non-corrupting message \n     across.\n       To conclude, voting and running for office are fundamental \n     rights of U.S. citizenship protected by the Constitution, but \n     the Constitution allows states to deny the right to vote and \n     run for office to persons who are not citizens of the \n     relevant state. The confinement of formal political rights to \n     voting citizens is always presumptively based on compelling \n     state interests in sovereignty, loyalty and honest \n     government. The making of campaign contributions to \n     candidates for public office constitutes just such an \n     exercise of a formal political right. Congress may declare \n     the existence of compelling interests in preserving the \n     constitutional sovereignty of the people and in combatting \n     the corruption of their political and governmental processes \n     by non-citizens. Section 241 advances these interests with \n     considerable effect while still leaving unlimited room for \n     campaign expenditures by outside interests.\n       Section 201: This Section prevents political action \n     committees (PACs) from making independent expenditures or \n     giving to federal candidates. It seems clear that the ban on \n     expenditures runs counter to the Court's holding in FEC v. \n     NCPAC, 470 U.S. 480 (1985), that independent PAC expenditures \n     have the full measure of First Amendment protection since \n     they do not threaten quid pro quo corruption. However, I read \n     that case as relating only to independent expenditures and \n     not direct contributions to candidates, which pose a far more \n     serious risk of the kinds of corruption identified in \n     Buckley. Indeed, Congress can fairly invoke the last 20-odd \n     years of experience with disproportionate and systematically \n     corrupting PAC influence on federal campaigns and national \n     public policy to demonstrate a compelling interest in passing \n     a ban on direct PAC contributions to federal candidates.\n       It is important to remember that a ban on PAC contributions \n     to candidates still leaves in place the right of every voter \n     to give directly to a candidate and the right of every PAC, \n     or group of voters, to spend whatever it wants independently \n     advocating or disparaging a particular candidate. Thus, all \n     of the voters' legitimate constitutional interests--the right \n     to associate with a candidate's campaign with a direct \n     contribution and the right to associate with other voters and \n     promote a particular candidate--are still vindicated by a ban \n     on PAC contributions.\n       I hope that these thoughts are useful to you and that you \n     will feel free to call on me for assistance in the days \n     ahead.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                              Jamin B. Raskin,\n\n                                                 Professor of Law,\n                                                   Associate Dean.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For those who question the constitutionality of this \nbill, I hope they will take the time to read the opinions of these \nlegal experts.\n  Fourth, and the most important, this bill makes message, and not \nmoney, the most important part of any election. And as such, \nchallengers will have a more fair and equal footing when running \nagainst an incumbent.\n  Spending limits will do more to level the playing field in an \nelection than any other contemplated reform. Analysis of past races \nshows incumbents raised and spent considerably more money than the \nchallengers and that the candidates who spent the most money usually \nwon the election--this is especially the case in races where \nmultimillionaires outspent their rivals. It is especially interesting \nto note that in competitive open seats, the candidate who raises the \nmost money tends to win the election. Spending limits would change that \ndynamic.\n  This perverse system under which the richest takes all has resulted \nin entrenched incumbents. The nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService has compiled an analysis of congressional races in recent years \nand the conclusion of that study is that the candidate who raises and \nspends the most money, even if that money is his or her own, usually \nwins the election. Elections should be about message, not money.\n  The flow of PAC money is especially enlightening about how the system \nfavors incumbents. I pointed out earlier how much that disparity is. \nChallengers basically receive $1 in PAC contributions for every $20 \ngiven to an incumbent. Which is why entrenched incumbency is such a \nproblem, and why we must do something to fix this situation.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court has ruled we cannot stop someone who \nis willing to spend an unlimited amount of money for a Federal office \nfrom doing so. That is the law of the land. Our bill conforms to it. \nBut the bill does provide strong incentives for candidates to \nvoluntarily comply with spending limits, regardless of personal wealth. \nCandidates who choose to spend unlimited amounts of their own\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nmoney receive none of the bill's benefits. Further, the bill raises the \nindividual contribution limit for candidates who comply with the bill's \nprovisions when they run against someone who either refuses to comply \nwith the spending limits or exceeds the personal contribution limit.\n  Some have said that the simple solution of raising the individual \ncontributor limit is the answer to the problem. That solution just is \nnot true. Raising the individual contribution limit does nothing to \ncontrol or limit the amount of money spent in a race. It may actually \nhave the perverse effect of discouraging candidates of modest means \nfrom seeking office when confronted with an incumbent with unlimited \nresources. Under the current system, an incumbent's access to PAC \ncontributions and an incumbent's appeal to well represented interests \nin Washington who like to bet safely on election favorites will almost \nalways allow the incumbent to outspend his or her challenger.\n  Increasing contribution limits would do nothing to level the playing \nfield and may, in fact, only further entrench incumbents who will \nalways have superior advantages when it comes to attracting big money. \nIt has been said several times that the public spends more on yogurt \nthan is spent on campaigns. That is almost a catchphrase around here. \nMy friends use the example to demonstrate that spending limits are not \nneeded. Mr. President, I must respectfully disagree. This comparison is \namusing but completely irrelevant. There is not a crisis of confidence \nin the yogurt industry. Confidence, trust, and faith in the yogurt \nindustry is not important for the well-being of future generations. \nThis country is not the great Nation it is today due to the yogurt \nindustry.\n\n  We live in the greatest democracy in the history of the world because \nof the foresight of our Founding Fathers to create a government that \nrepresented and had the trust of the people. It is that trust that we \nmust seek to restore.\n  Poll after poll reveals the public's urgent demands for genuine \nfinance campaign reform. These polls mark the progress of public \nsentiment on this question. The people's cynicism over the way we seek \noffice has grown into contempt for the way we retain office. The \nfoundations of self-government rest on the public's faith in the basic \nintegrity of our legal system. That faith is shaken today.\n  This bill will not cure public cynicism for politics. But we believe \nit will prevent cynicism from becoming contempt, and contempt from \nbecoming utter alienation.\n  Our bill represents substantial, necessary change to the status quo--\na status quo that has generated a reelection rate of over 90 percent \nfor Members of the House and Senate. We know the current system has \nserved incumbents well, and we know what a daunting task it will be to \nconvince the Congress to reform this system.\n  Our appreciation for the political realities and institutional \nimpediments arrayed against reform will not extinguish our \ndetermination for reform because we know the consequences of failing to \nact are far more frightening than the personal prospect of involuntary \nretirement.\n  We must move forward. We must pass meaningful campaign finance \nreform. The American people expect us to do at least that much.\n  Today's Washington Post stated: ``Give them a vote, and perhaps for \nanother Congress the issue will go away: That's the leadership \nposition. It's the way both parties deal with the issue; they spend \nhalf their time endorsing reform and the other half making sure it \nwon't occur.''\n  Mr. President, I challenge my colleagues to prove the Washington Post \nwrong. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and make reform more \nthan an unkept promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6680-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

A bill to protect the genetic privacy of individuals, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n     The Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to return a momentous issue \nto the forefront. This issue is genetics confidentiality and \nnondiscrimination. I am pleased to report that the human\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\ngenome project is proceeding rapidly to map and sequence the entire \ncomplement of human genes. These genes are coded in over 3 billion \nmolecular building blocks of DNA.\n  Now, most people--and I must say most Members of the Congress--are \nnot necessarily aware of the fact that since 1986, our Government has \nbeen involved in an annual program which has reached the size of about \n$138 to $140 million a year, which is divided one-third in the \nDepartment of Energy and two-thirds in the National Institutes of \nHealth. That program spends that money by permitting various major \nAmerican institutions to proceed to map certain chromosomes which are \nyielding fantastic information regarding diseases of the human species.\n  One might quickly recognize that if that is going on, it probably is \nalso going on in the area of animals and in the area of agricultural \nproducts. And, yes, although the genome project is human, because of \nits tremendous success it is going on in the other areas also. So, in a \nvery real sense, believe it or not, while all the discussion of late is \nabout conventional health care proposals, it is entirely possible, in \nfact I believe probable, that within 25 to 40 years the entire delivery \nof health care will be built around genetics rather than what we are \ndoing today. In fact, at certain conferences we have sat around and \nthought about what a hospital will probably look like when we have \nfinally mapped and sequenced the entire chromosome system. It will not \nbe anything like we have today.\n  So, in these 3 million molecular building blocks, we are busy \nlocating the situs within that molecular system of most of the diseases \nthat impede human progress and have this enormous impact on our well-\nbeing, our health, and thus our prosperity and the joy of living. \nDetermining this entire code is going to provide scientists and doctors \nwith a road map. This map will lead them to great discoveries and \nbreakthroughs, as I have indicated, to prevent suffering and pain of \ndiseases.\n  The human genome project stands to be one of humanity's greatest \nscientific achievements. Nonetheless, when the human genome was first \nbrought to my attention in 1986, I recognized that it could catalyze \nrevolutions, not just in science and medicine, but also in ethics and \nin law and society. That is why one will find, as part of the human \ngenome funding, that there is money set aside specifically to address \nthe ethical, legal, and social implications of this project.\n\n  There is literally a revolution occurring in genomic information, \nspecial information, information about our species, about our bodies, \nand, most important, about ourselves. Who should know this information? \nShould it be public? Should our doctors, our friends and our families, \nour insurers, our employers or even our very selves know every detail \nof our genetic blueprint? These are penetrating and provocative \nquestions, and they are proactive, and they deeply concern many who \nknow about them. I guarantee the Senate that there will be, with the \npassage of each year, more and more people concerned about them as the \nramifications begin to unfold.\n  I am not one who says that, because of these serious ramifications, \nwe should stop the progress of knowledge about human disease. But, \nobviously, if we do not do this carefully, the abuse could stop this \nprogress. About that, there can be no doubt, for, if this kind of \ninformation is abused in a country like ours, there may be an enormous \nbacklash. Frankly, I think that would be a pathetic response to one of \nthe approaches to wellness with most potential that humankind has ever \nseen.\n  So, this genetic confidentiality and nondiscrimination is a monstrous \nissue, and I raise it today not as the first to raise it, for it is \naround. Certain Senators--led over time by Senator Hatfield and, of \nlate, a few others--are rising to the occasion and worrying about it.\n  The right for each individual to have some control over his or her \nmost personal and most identifying information is what we are talking \nabout. Indeed, I could change my name again and again and maybe some \npeople would no longer be able to identify me, maybe some would, maybe \nsome wish they could not. However, I can never, never change my genetic \ninformation. It will always be me, and yours will be you. People will \nalways be able to identify this genetic information that is peculiar to \neach of us. Whether it comes from a drop of blood, the back of a \npostage stamp where saliva remains, or a pathology specimen, it is the \nperson from whence the blood, the saliva, or whatever other piece of \nour anatomy is put to the pathology test.\n  So, along with my colleague, Senator Simon, I am today introducing \nthe Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996. This is \na comprehensive and defining legislative vehicle. It is, indeed, needed \nto bolster the efforts of 19 States that have enacted some kind of \ninformation privacy statutes, as well as five of my colleagues who have \nintroduced similar legislation, although substantially different. This \nbill in no way infringes on those efforts. Genetics privacy is a big \nissue, and many groups will have concern about specific provisions. \nThere is much work to be done. There needs to be much more debate. I am \ncertain the Chair is aware of that from this discussion thus far. My \nstaff, as well as others, have worked very hard to craft the very best \nbill that we could.\n  I think from this point on we should not let time lapse. We should \nwork together and get something done to make sure we do not punish and \npenalize the progress of this rather fantastic health research. Again, \nthis bill is a comprehensive legislative vehicle that will be subject \nto exhaustive legislative review processes, with hearings and input \nfrom all sources and all points of view.\n  So let me briefly describe our bill. First, I send forward a summary \nto the desk and ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The act itself will be known as the Genetic \nConfidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996. First, the bill \ndefines genetic information as uniquely private and distinct from other \npersonal information such as medical records. As I mentioned before, it \nis impossible to separate one's identity from one's genes. One's DNA \nalso provides information about one's family. Genetic information \ncarries significance and has great potential for misuse. Let me repeat. \nThis information is of special significance and has great potential for \nmisuse. Genetics transcends medicine and can penetrate many aspects of \nlife, including employment, insurance, education, forensics, finance, \nand even one's self-perception.\n  Let me also make it perfectly clear that this bill does not make it \nillegal for a third party to collect, store, analyze, or even disclose \nan individual's genetic information. This bill requires that third \nparties obtain the individual's informed and written consent.\n  This legislation puts individuals in control of his or her genetic \ninformation. Some will object to that, but ultimately the question is \ngoing to be asked: If not the individual, who? Exceptions are provided \nin the bill for legitimate medical research, law enforcement \nactivities, court-ordered analysis and purposes of identification of \ndead bodies or active duty military remains and, on the latter, we have \nalready been hearing something about that.\n  Specifically, the purposes of this legislation are:\n  First, to define the circumstances under which genetic information \nmay be created, stored, analyzed, or disclosed;\n  Second, to define the rights of individuals with respect to genetic \ninformation;\n  Third, to identify the responsibilities of third parties with respect \nto genetic information;\n  Fourth, to protect individuals from genetic discrimination with \nrespect to insurance and employment. Just think of that one, the \nopportunity to discriminate because of genetic information if randomly \ndelivered to people such as insurance carriers, employers, and many \nother institutions and individuals that could act based on it.\n  Fifth, to establish uniform rules to protect genetic privacy and \nallow the advancement of research.\n  Today, there is clear and pressing need for Federal legislation on \nthis issue. This Senator, along with Senator Simon--and I am sure there \nwill be others who will join us, but I have just not had enough time to \nget this circulated and get it out to other Senators; that will start \ntoday--but we are introducing this bill to motivate, consolidate,\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nand strengthen the process of getting something done in this very, very \nimportant area. I look forward to working with my House and Senate \ncolleagues in bringing this issue, with broad bipartisan support, to an \nanxiously awaiting American public.\n\n  Mr. President, the call is now. Once again, the human genome project \nstands to be one of the greatest scientific and medical achievements of \nall time. And incidentally, I think one might wonder why we did not do \nthis a long time ago. We constantly talk about the computer and what it \npermits us to do that we could not have done. It is patent and obvious \nthat we could never ever have begun the process of mapping the 3 \nbillion human genomes within the chromosome system of a human being \nwithout the computer system that has evolved in our country.\n  Without that, we would still be having researchers take on and study \nfor their whole lifetime where the gene for multiple sclerosis might \nbe. This is not to say many of those great research teams struggled \nmightily, and they did, and they found the situs for many of them and \ncures and drugs have resulted that ameliorate and sometimes cures.\n  But this offers science ultimately a map of all of the chromosomes, \nand then they will begin to sequence them in some kind of order. They \nwill have a road map and then start to sequence them.\n  What they will have done, once they have finished, is give the great \nscientists an opportunity to focus in on the work to find where the \nmutation is that is causing breast cancer. Work is being done with \nfamilies on just that subject, and the mutation is being isolated and \npeople are being, in some instances, told whether they are going to get \nthis cancer or not. It is rather amazing.\n  Where will all this end up? Let us hope, with an appropriate \nreservation of rights on disclosure, that it will end up in the right \nhands doing the right kind of things, making the right kind of progress \nthat our great society is taking the lead in. I will say, though, so \nnobody thinks this is totally and singularly an American project. It is \nnot. The French are doing great work. In some cases, they have a lead \non America. Japan is doing some, and almost all of the industrialized \nnations are doing some. But our great genome project has moved ahead in \na dramatic manner. It is ahead of schedule, it has cost much less than \nwe expected and, consequently, it is time for us to do something now \nabout this aspect of it.\n  Its wonderful promise may never be fully realized if the public is \nafraid of what someone else will do with their information. That is the \nreason that this becomes very important.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the matter for which I asked unanimous \nconsent earlier, I ask unanimous consent that a number of news articles \nbe printed in the Record, and I send the bill to the desk and ask for \nits appropriate referral.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Genetic Prophecy and Genetic Privacy--Can We Present the Dream From \n                         Becoming a Nightmare?\n\n                          (By George J. Annas)\n\n       Would you want to know if you're likely to develop \n     Alzheimer's disease later in life? Would you want your \n     employer, your health insurer, your colleagues, or your \n     family to know? Who should decide who should know, and how \n     can public health practitioners use genetic information on \n     predisposition to diseases like dementias and cancer for the \n     public good without stigmatizing individuals?\n       In this issue's Health Law and Ethics, Mayeux and Schupf \n     pose all of these questions and more in the context of \n     apolipoprotein-E screening for Alzheimer's disease. Although \n     the presence of the 4-type apolipoprotein E allele is not a \n     test for Alzheimer's disease, Mayeux and Schupf's analysis \n     suggests many of the issues we will face when tests for the \n     genes that cause various types of Alzheimer's disease, such \n     as early onset Alzheimer's, become available. They argue, \n     persuasively I think, that population screening now ``would \n     not only be impractical, but would be of no obvious benefit'' \n     and ``without a clear-cut therapeutic option, early detection \n     (by testing) at this point does not seem beneficial.'' They \n     also properly stress the dangers of creating disease in the \n     absence of symptoms, and the necessity for pre- and post-test \n     counseling for any such probabilistic, presymptomatic genetic \n     testing.\n       The central question presented by genetic screening and \n     testing is whether genetic information is different in kind \n     from other medical information (such as family history and \n     cholesterol levels), and if so, whether this means that it \n     should receive special legal protection. Stated another way, \n     are Mayeux and Schupf correct in concluding that ``the \n     genetic code of an individual should be protected and \n     considered confidential information in all circumstances''? I \n     think they are, but their conclusion with respect to genetic \n     privacy deserves more analysis.\n       Genetic information can be considered uniquely private or \n     personal information, even more personal than other medical \n     information such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status \n     or mental health, for at least three reasons: it can predict \n     an individual's likely medical future; it divulges personal \n     information about one's parents, siblings, and children; and \n     it has a history of being used to stigmatize and victimize \n     individuals.\n       The highly personal nature of the information contained in \n     one's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can be illustrated by \n     thinking of DNA as containing an individual's coded ``future \n     diary.'' A diary is perhaps the most personal and private \n     document a person can create. It contains a person's \n     innermost thoughts and perceptions and is usually hidden and \n     locked to assure its secrecy. Diaries describe the past. The \n     information in one's genetic code can be thought of as a \n     coded probabilistic future diary because it describes an \n     important part of a person's unique future and, as such, can \n     affect and undermine one's view of himself or herself and his \n     or her life's possibilities. Unlike ordinary diaries that are \n     created by the writer, the information contained in one's \n     DNA, which is stable and can be stored for long periods of \n     time, is largely unknown to the person. Most of the \n     code cannot now be broken, but parts are being deciphered \n     almost daily. As decoding techniques get better, and if \n     one's DNA is deciphered without permission, another person \n     could learn intimate details of the individuals likely \n     future life that even the individual does not know.\n       Deciphering an individual's genetic code also provides the \n     reader of that code with probabilistic health information \n     about that individual's family, especially parents, siblings, \n     and children. Finally, genetic information (and \n     misinformation) has been used by governments (US) immigration \n     and sterilization policies and Nazi racial hygiene policies, \n     for example) to discriminate viciously against those \n     perceived as genetically unfit and to restrict their \n     reproductive decisions.\n       Mayeux and Schupf note my prior recommendations regarding \n     regulating DNA banks. Although regulating such ``gene banks'' \n     is necessary to protect genetic privacy, it is not \n     sufficient. My colleagues Leonard Glantz and Patricia Roche \n     and I now believe that we need federal legislation to protect \n     individual privacy by protecting not only DNA samples, but \n     also the genetic information obtained from analyzing DNA \n     samples. To be effective, such legislation must govern \n     activities at at least four points: collection of DNA, \n     analysis of DNA, storage of DNA and information derived from \n     it, and distribution of DNA samples and information derived \n     from DNA samples. As a general rule, no collection or \n     analysis of an individual's DNA should be permitted without \n     an informed and voluntary authorization by the individual or \n     his or her legal representative. Research on nonindentifiable \n     DNA samples need not be inhibited; but research on DNA from \n     identifiable individuals should proceed only with informed \n     consent.\n       To codify these rules and make them uniform throughout the \n     United States, we have drafted the ``Genetic Privacy Act of \n     1995,'' the core of which prohibits individuals from \n     analyzing DNA samples unless they have verified that written \n     authorization for the analysis has been given by the \n     individual or his or her representative. The individual \n     has the right to do the following:\n       Determine who may collect and analyze DNA;\n       Determine the purpose for which a DNA sample can be \n     analyzed;\n       Know what information can reasonably be expected to be \n     derived from the genetic analysis;\n       Order the destruction of DNA samples;\n       Delegate authority to another party to order the \n     destruction of the DNA sample after death;\n       Refuse to permit the use of the DNA sample for research or \n     commercial activities; and\n       Inspect and obtain copies of records containing information \n     derived from genetic analysis of the DNA sample.\n       A written summary of these principles (and other \n     requirements under the act) must be supplied to the \n     individual by the person who collects the DNA sample. The act \n     requires that the person who holds private genetic \n     information in the ordinary course of business keep such \n     information confidential and prohibits the disclosure of \n     private genetic information unless the individual has \n     authorized the disclosure in writing, or unless the \n     disclosure is limited to access by specified researchers for \n     compiling data. Although the act itself does not prohibit the \n     use of genetic information by employers and insurance \n     companies (because this is a separate problem from privacy), \n     it would be reasonable public policy to prohibit both \n     employers and health insurance companies from using genetic \n     information in making hiring and coverage decisions. Congress \n     should act now to protect genetic privacy. While we\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\n     wait for congressional action, states can act, and private \n     companies and practitioners can voluntarily adopt these \n     privacy rules as their own.\n       The new genetics raises virtually every major health care \n     policy question, as well as unique legal and ethical \n     problems. How should screening for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 (two \n     ``breast cancer genes'') be introduced into medical and \n     public health practice? Should we prohibit parents from \n     authorizing the testing of minors or fetuses for breast \n     cancer genes, or any other gene predisposing to a \n     nonpreventable, late-onset disease? The Human Genome Project \n     has devoted approximately $3 million a year for the past 5 \n     years to exploring the legal, ethical, and social policy \n     issues raised by the project. The Genetic Privacy Act is one \n     of the products of this funding. In addition, the Institute \n     of Medicine's Committee on Assessing Genetic Risks has made \n     more than 225 specific recommendations dealing with genetic \n     screening and testing, virtually all of which are reasonable. \n     We know the privacy and policy issues that come with the new \n     genetics. The challenge is to act now to try to maximize the \n     good and minimize the harm that will come to all of us from \n     our new genetic knowledge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1996]\n\n                     This Map Won't Show Us the Way\n\n                          (By Jessica Mathews)\n\n       The job of deciphering the 60,000 to 100,000 genes the \n     human genome will be finished in less than 10 years. That may \n     sound like a long time, but it isn't. Long before then, but \n     it isn't. Long before then, at an accelerating pace, we will \n     begin to be flooded with genetic information that can be as \n     treacherous and unwelcome as it sometimes is lifesaving. We \n     will need every minute to prepare for a revolution in \n     medicine that will invade our privacy in unprecedented ways \n     and challenge legal protections, social values, personal \n     ethics and religious beliefs.\n       If the past is any measure, we won't be ready. With no \n     societal consensus about how to approach the issues, most of \n     the decisions will get bumped, as a last resort, to the \n     courts where judges with no particular qualification nor \n     preparation will have to decide, struggling to find some \n     constitutional basis for resolving novel, moral dilemmas.\n       Think for a moment about a world in which genetic screening \n     of people and fetuses is routine.\n       Suppose you knew you had a high risk of dying in 10 years? \n     Should it be legal to keep that information to yourself when \n     buying life insurance?\n       How would a managed-care provider treat a couple who \n     refused preventive treatment. (an abortion) for a fetus that \n     would require lifetime medical care?\n       What if screening revealed children's individual endowments \n     of traits were now call intelligence. Would society demand \n     educational tracking beginning in preschool?\n       How will prospective parents deal with the information in a \n     fetal screen? Suppose it reveals a high risk of heart \n     disease, or mental disorders, or obesity or undesirable \n     temperament? Will pregnancy in this brave new world \n     necessarily be a time of achingly difficult decisions? What \n     will it mean for society when every child enters the world \n     with hundreds of ``preexisting conditions''? What will it \n     mean for religion when innate characteristics become a matter \n     of choice?\n       Will the rich, who can afford repeated fetal screening and \n     genetic interventions, begin to produce children who differ \n     more and more from those of the poor?\n       Should prospective employers and insurers have access to an \n     individual's genetic profile? What about prospective spouses? \n     What about us--would we have a ``right'' not to know about \n     ourselves?\n       Will we want all this information we can do very little \n     about? Will we ever be able to meaningfully apply statistical \n     risks to our own, individual cases? How will we cope with \n     decades of enormous uncertainty as scientists sort out the \n     interactions of tens of thousands of genes and the \n     interactions of the resulting genetic propensities with the \n     environment?\n       Where will we find enough genetic counselors who combine \n     scientific knowledge, therapeutic insight, clerical \n     compassion and the wisdom of Solomon? Should they just give \n     the facts? If they do more, whose values will they be \n     transmitting?\n       What about genetic alteration of germ cells, those that \n     pass on traits to future generations? So have said that a \n     line can be clearly drawn making these cells off limits. But \n     suppose it becomes possible to alter the genes that give rise \n     to familial predispositions to cancer and other diseases. \n     Wouldn't we want to do that? Then aren't we facing an era of \n     human eugenics?\n       The widespread unhappiness with having judges rule on the \n     moral question of physician-assisted suicide offers a faint \n     preview of what it would be like to leave such questions to \n     the courts. In one of those cases, Andrew Kleinfeld, a \n     dissenting judge on the 9th Circuit, made his own discomfort \n     plain. ``The Founding Fathers did not establish the U.S. as a \n     democratic republic,'' he wrote, ``so that elected officials \n     could decide trivia, while all great questions would be \n     decided by the judiciary.''\n       The alternative is to develop sufficient public \n     understanding to address these choices through referendums \n     and legislatively and, if possible, to do so in a way that \n     avoids making genetic ethics into a political football like \n     abortion. A small beginning has been made. The government-\n     funded Human Genome Project wisely set aside a small fraction \n     of its budget to study moral and ethical questions, so there \n     are expert groups and advisory committees and a stream of \n     scholarly papers. But that is not enough.\n       Nor is it enough to vaguely call--as I have in the past--\n     for a ``broad public conversation'' on the subject. Without \n     some sort of crisis it just won't happen. What is needed is a \n     national commission of a new and different kind.\n       The usual mission for such a body is to serve either \n     government or interested groups through fact-finding, \n     research and expert advice. This one's client would be the \n     public. Its job would be to find innovative ways to inform \n     and stimulate public debate; to frame choices, to offer \n     balanced pros and cons; to confront as many Americans as it \n     can with the facts and the uncertainties and scientists' best \n     guesses about where their work is leading. It should be \n     nonpartisan and operate for as long as we need it.\n       The mapping of the human genome will be an enormous \n     scientific achievement, at least on a par with nuclear \n     fission, but much more personal. If it is, on balance, to \n     improve our lives in the next few decades, we'll have to \n     collectively think it through--in advance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   [From the Washington Post National Weekly Edition, June 3-9, 1996]\n\n   All in the Genes--The New Availability of Tests Raises a Host of \n                           Ethical Questions\n\n                            (By Rick Weiss)\n\n       When Ebenezer Scrooge got a sneak preview of his own \n     demise, including views of his funeral that no one cared to \n     attend, he had only to change his evil ways to revise the \n     future. If only genetic testing offered such simple \n     solutions.\n       New genetic tests are moving rapidly from research \n     laboratories into doctors' offices, where they are being \n     marketed as a way to predict people's chances of getting \n     common diseases such as colon cancer, breast cancer and \n     Alzheimer's disease.\n       But instead of offering clear views of the future and \n     strategies for altering it, genetic tests have raised the \n     specters of DNA-based discrimination and loss of health \n     insurance, and the prospect of people learning just enough to \n     scare them but not enough to cure them.\n       Now, as companies begin to market their new tests, \n     scientists, patients' groups, health insurers and legislators \n     are rushing to stake out positions on what restrictions, if \n     any, should be placed on the commercialization and use of \n     genetic tests. The strained positions some are taking reveal \n     the extent to which science today is intermingled with \n     politics and business.\n       Congress, for example, is preparing legislation that would \n     prohibit genetic discrimination against some people--but not \n     against others. The Food and Drug Administration, already on \n     the defensive amid corporate claims of over-regulation, has \n     declared it has the authority to regulate genetic tests but \n     hastens to add that it has no plans to do so. And in perhaps \n     the most unusual twist, many advocates of patients' rights \n     who usually clamor for access to the latest cancer \n     breakthroughs are asking that some genetic tests be kept from \n     patients.\n       The National Breast Cancer Coalition, for example, a \n     patients' rights group, opposes open marketing of a test for \n     the so-called breast cancer gene, BRCA1. At the risk of \n     sounding as paternalistic as the doctors they often fight \n     against, members say the test's generally ambiguous results \n     may trigger unnecessary panic in many women while reassuring \n     others who should remain vigliant.\n       ``There's a real dilemma among feminist scholars on this,'' \n     says June Peters, a genetic counselor at the National \n     Institutes of Health. ``You need to build in safeguards,'' \n     she says, since profit-driven companies do not necessarily \n     share the same interests as patients. ``At the same time, \n     there is the feeling, `I am an adult and I can take care of \n     these decisions myself.' ''\n       Genetic tests differ from many medical tests because they \n     often provide very vague answers, such as, ``You have a gene \n     that gives you a 70 percent chance of getting breast cancer \n     in the next 20 years.'' That uncertainty can be all the more \n     frsutrating because in most cases there is nothing a person \n     can do to prevent the predicted disease from occurring.\n       Moreover, people can reduce their risk of getting heart \n     disease or cancer by changing unhealthful habits such as \n     overeating or smoking, but they are stuck with their genes. \n     And with legal protections still not fully established, the \n     information gleaned from genetic tests today is as easily \n     used against people as for them.\n       ``You can't choose your genes,'' says Francis Collins, \n     director of the National Center for Human Genome Research. \n     ``So you shouldn't be discriminated against on the basis of \n     those genes.''\n       The stakes are high on both sides of the issue. The \n     fledging genetic testing industry, which foresees soaring \n     profits in the next few years, is pushing hard to get its \n     tests to market, arguing that patients have the right to \n     learn about their own genes even if the information is \n     incomplete or inconclusive. Similarly, health insurers \n     desperately want the right to peek at their clients' genes to \n     help predict their medical fates--and to set their insurance \n     rates accordingly--in part because they are afraid that \n     people who discover they have faulty genes may try to take \n     out large policies.\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\n       On the other hand, many scientists, doctors and patients' \n     groups argue that, at least for now, most gene testing should \n     be limited to research studies designed to gather more \n     information about how to make the most of this new resource. \n     Studies could keep track of how people with various \n     ``bad'' genes fare over the years, settling the question \n     of which genetic glitches really matter and which are less \n     important.\n       Studies also could compare different preventive treatments \n     to see whether it is worthwhile, for example, to remove a \n     person's colon just because a genetic test reveals a very \n     high risk of colon cancer, or whether that individual can \n     safely put off surgery until a cancer is actually found. \n     Extra time also would allow Congress and other institutions \n     to devise safeguards against the misuse of genetic \n     information.\n       With these concerns in mind, several prestigious scientific \n     organizations--including the American Society for Human \n     Genetics, the National Advisory Council for Human Genome \n     Research and the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, which \n     is coordinated by the U.S. Public Health Service--have come \n     out against commercialization of the BRCA1 test, the first \n     crude predictor of cancer risk to come on the market.\n       Scores of genetic tests have been developed for dozens of \n     diseases. Some are used to diagnose existing conditions and \n     others are used in healthy people to predict the odds that a \n     disease will occur. The tests, usually done with a drop of \n     blood, look for ``misspellings'' in a person's DNA--the \n     strands of genetic material that spell out in biological code \n     the instructions for making products the body needs.\n       Many genetic tests--especially those for rare diseases--can \n     predict with certainty a person's fate. Everyone who tests \n     positive for the genetic defect associated with Huntingdon's \n     disease, for example, will get the fatal neurodegenerative \n     disease, probably in midlife.\n       But many other genetic tests--especially those for more \n     common diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease--offer \n     far less definite predictions. The breast cancer test, which \n     looks for a spelling error in the BRCA1 gene, is one such \n     test. It is now making its way onto the market in three \n     different formats, ranging from ``research only'' to open \n     marketing.\n       Increasing numbers of women are asking for the test because \n     they are under the impression that those who have a mutation \n     in the BRCA1 gene have an 85 percent chance of getting breast \n     cancer, as well as an elevated risk of ovarian cancer.\n       But what should a woman do if she tests positive? No \n     preventive strategies have been shown to help--not even \n     preemptive removal of both breasts, since tumors may still \n     develop in nearby chest tissues. More frequent mammograms to \n     watch for the first sign of cancer may be useless or even \n     dangerous, since there is evidence that some women with this \n     mutation may be especially prone to DNA damage and cancer \n     from X-rays.\n       To further complicate the issue, more than 130 mutations \n     have been found in the breast cancer gene. Some are probably \n     meaningless, and others deadly, but most have not been \n     studied yet. Standard gene tests available today detect only \n     one or a few of the more common mutations, so a negative test \n     doesn't guarantee safety.\n       Most important, many women seem not to realize that it is \n     only if a woman has a clear family history of breast cancer--\n     usually defined as two or more close relatives with the \n     disease--that the BRCA1 mutation confers 85 percent odds of \n     getting breast cancer.\n       The vast majority of women do not come from cancer-prone \n     families, and for them the risk of having a BRCA1 mutation \n     remains completely unknown.\n       That is not to say the test is useless. For some carefully \n     selected women already diagnosed with breast cancer, a \n     positive test can indicate the need for more aggressive \n     therapy.\n       And for a woman whose mother or sister had breast cancer \n     from a BRCA1 mutation, a negative test can provide some \n     reassurance. What remains unproved, however, is that the test \n     has any value for the more than 95 percent of women who do \n     not fit into those categories.\n       A federally funded study of thousands of women, ongoing in \n     the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore area, will begin to answer the \n     question of what a positive BRCA1 test really means. But \n     because it is research, and the results of the study will \n     take time to interpret, the women will not be told whether \n     they have the mutation.\n       Meanwhile, the Genetics & IVF Institute, of Fairfax, Va., \n     recently started offering the BRCA1 test to women willing to \n     pay about $300. The clinic has been criticized by some \n     doctors and ethicists for making the test available to women \n     who might have little or nothing to gain from it. Its medical \n     director, Joseph Schulman, declined to be interviewed for \n     this story.\n       A third option, praised by several doctors as a good \n     compromise, is underway at OncorMed, of Gaithersburg, Md. The \n     company offers BRCA1 testing and results to women who are \n     willing to follow certain rules prepared by an independent \n     research review board. Women must be referred for \n     counseling before and after the test is performed. Results \n     must be given by the doctor in person, and the doctor must \n     follow up with patient about three months later. The \n     company also must compile data from its experience to \n     determine which aspects of the gene-testing process need \n     improvement.\n       At a recent meeting in Baltimore of a federal task force on \n     gene testing, some participants questioned whether the \n     companies marketing genetic tests should be the ones to \n     decide who gets tested and what information they receive or \n     whether some sort of regulatory oversight should be imposed.\n       The question of oversight is made more difficult because \n     laboratory testing already is regulated in a patchwork \n     manner, and none of the patches quite applies to genetic \n     tests.\n       Medical testing is regulated in part by an act of Congress, \n     the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. But \n     CLIA stipulates only that laboratory tests must be \n     scientifically accurate--that is, a test for a BRCA1 mutation \n     must be good at finding BRCA1 mutations. It does not require \n     that a test have any proven usefulness for patients. The FDA \n     reviews and approves the relatively simple test ``kits'' that \n     are sold for use in commercial laboratories or at home. At \n     times it has even required that counseling be given with test \n     results, as it did with the approval of a home AIDS test \n     early last month.\n       But genetic tests are too new and complicated to be sold as \n     kits. Most genetic tests are ``home brew'' tests, developed \n     inhouse by the companies that do the testing. The FDA has the \n     authority to regulate such tests, says Deputy Commissioner \n     Mary K. Pendergast, but it has never done so. ``We would not \n     be able to take it on,'' she says, ``without stopping other \n     things we are doing now.''\n       Congress could help protect test recipients by making it \n     illegal for insurers and employers to discriminate on the \n     basis of genetic information. Both the House and Senate \n     versions of the health care bill that is soon to be \n     considered by a conference committee contain language that \n     would prohibit some forms of genetic discrimination.\n       The bills would preclude companies from using genetic \n     information to deny an insured person continued insurance \n     when that person changes health plans. But they offer little \n     or no protection to people who do not yet have insurance and \n     are trying to get it. And other safeguards are far from \n     complete.\n       ``These bills would require that insurers offer a policy, \n     but they don't cover pricing, so we can expect to see \n     discriminatory pricing,'' says Wendy McGoodwin, executive \n     director of the Council for Responsible Genetics, an advocacy \n     group in Cambridge, Mass. ``And it has no impact whatsoever \n     on life insurance or disability insurance.''\n       According to many experts, the last hope for intelligent \n     guidance on the gene-testing issue may be a federal task \n     force convened last year by the National Institutes of Health \n     and the Department of Energy.\n       The task force, with representatives from the medical \n     profession, the testing and insurance industries and \n     patients' rights groups, is preparing a wide-ranging report \n     on the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic \n     testing, due to be completed by the end of the year. But \n     consensus has been difficult to achieve.\n       At a task force meeting in April, representatives of the \n     biotechnology industry said it is the doctor's job to make \n     sure that patients understand the risks and benefits of being \n     tested. Doctors said they were still getting up to speed in \n     genetics and would be unable to stem the tide of patient \n     demand if testing were not subject to regulatory \n     restrictions. And insurers said they would go out of business \n     if they were restricted from having access to genetic \n     information.\n       Given the lack of agreement, some suspect the field will \n     simply grow like any other ``buyer beware'' market as more \n     and more tests become available.\n       ``Physicians are soon likely to confront extremely awkward \n     situations,'' Harvard scientists Ruth Hubbard and Richard \n     Lewontin wrote recently in the New England Journal of \n     Medicine. ``Physicians need to recognize the limitations of \n     the new information * * * and the commercial pressures behind \n     the speed with which preliminary scientific data are being \n     turned into tests.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    The Genetics Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act--Summary\n\n       Sec. 1.--Short title: The ``Genetics Confidentiality and \n     Nondiscrimination Act of 1996''\n       Sec. 2.--Findings: The DNA molecule contains an \n     individual's genetic information that is uniquely private and \n     inseparable from one's identity. Genetic information is being \n     rapidly sequenced and understood. Genetic information carries \n     special significance. It provides information about one's \n     family, and, more importantly, provides information about \n     one's self and one's self perception. Genetic information has \n     been misused, harming individuals through stigmatization and \n     discrimination. The potential for misuse is tremendous as \n     genetics transcends medicine and has the potential to \n     penetrate many aspects of life including employment, \n     insurance, finance, and education. Genetic information should \n     not be collected. stored, analyzed, nor disclosed without the \n     individual's authorization. Current legal protections for \n     genetic information are inadequate. Uniform rules for \n     collection, storage and use of DNA samples and genetic \n     information are needed to protect individual privacy and \n     prevent discrimination, such as in employment and insurance, \n     while permitting legitimate medical research.\n       Purposes: This legislation will: (1) define circumstances \n     under which genetic information may be created, stored, \n     analyzed, or disclosed: (2) define rights of individuals and\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n     persons with respect to genetic information; (3) define \n     responsibilities of others with respect to genetic \n     information; (4) protect individuals from genetic \n     discrimination; (5) establish uniform rules that protect \n     individual genetic privacy and allow the advancement of \n     genetic research; and (6) establish effective mechanisms to \n     enforce the rights and responsibilities defined in this Act.\n       Sec. 3.--Definitions: Genetic information--means any the \n     information that may derive from an individual or a family \n     member about genes, gene products, inherited characteristics. \n     Such term includes DNA sequence information including that \n     which is derived from the alteration, mutation, or \n     polymorphism of DNA or the presence or absence of a specific \n     DNA marker or markers. Individual--means the source of the \n     DNA sample including body, body parts, or bodily fluids from \n     whom the DNA sample originated. Research--means systematic \n     scientific (including social science) investigation that \n     includes development, testing, and evaluation, designed or \n     developed to contribute to original generalizable knowledge.\n\n\n       title I.--Collection, storage, and analysis of dna samples\n\n       Secs. 101-105 prohibit collection, storage, or analysis of \n     genetic information, unless written, informed consent has \n     been obtained from the individual (exceptions in the bill are \n     provided for identification of dead bodies or active-duty \n     remains, law enforcement purposes, purposes pursuant to \n     court-ordered analysis, and some research purposes).\n\n\n              title II--disclosure of genetic information\n\n       Secs. 201-205 describe the written authorization necessary \n     to disclose genetic information. It also describes the \n     protection, inspection, amendment, and disclosure of records \n     containing genetic information. This part also provides \n     exceptions for compulsory disclosure in any judicial, \n     legislative, administrative proceeding, as well as court-\n     order purposes. (The bill also provides some exceptions \n     for research purposes under Title V.)\n\n\n                 title III.--Discrimination Prohibited\n\n       Secs. 301-302 prohibit genetic discrimination by employers \n     and insurers.\n\n\n  Title IV.--Exceptions for Identification and Court-Ordered Analysis\n\n       Secs. 401-404 provide exceptions for identification of dead \n     bodies and active-duty military remains, law enforcement \n     purposes, and activities pursuant to court-ordered analysis.\n\n\n                     Title V.--Research Activities\n\n       Secs. 501-503 restate the need for researchers to obtain \n     informed consent from individuals who participate in \n     research. It provides exceptions for obtaining, storing, and \n     analyzing genetic information for research purposes. It \n     specifies: conditions for genetic analysis, safeguards \n     against disclosures, limitations on minors (requires parental \n     consent), destruction of DNA samples upon completion of the \n     project (unless permission is given to maintain them), \n     protections regarding pedigree analysis and family linkage \n     studies, and the research subjects' right to obtain \n     information. This part also specifies conditions for \n     disclosure of genetic information for research purposes, \n     allows limited access to genetic information for \n     epidemiologic uses, and provides exceptions for DNA samples \n     collected from individuals prior to the effective date of \n     this Act.\n\n\n                           Title VI.--Minors\n\n       Sec. 601 provides conditions for collection and analysis of \n     genetic information from minors. Essentially, the bill \n     requires a parent, guardian to consent to the individual's \n     participation in research and that the analysis benefits the \n     individual.\n\n\n                       Title VII.--Miscellaneous\n\n       Secs. 701-702 require employers to annually notify \n     employees who maintain DNA samples or genetic information of \n     their responsibilities under this Act. It also provides for \n     continuity of privacy of genetic information upon transfer of \n     ownership or discontinuation of services.\n\n\n                        Title VIII.--Enforcement\n\n       Secs. 801-802 provide civil penalties of $50,000 for \n     negligent violation or $100,000 for willful violation; both \n     per incident. No criminal penalties are specified. Injunctive \n     relief and private right of action are also provided. There \n     is a six year statute of limitations.\n\n\n Title IX.--Effective Dates, Applicability and Relationships to Other \n                                  Laws\n\n       Proposed effective date is January 1, 1997. Nineteen States \n     have enacted genetics privacy or nondiscrimination \n     legislation; this Act would only serve to strengthen existing \n     State laws.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 1899. A bill entitled the ``Mollie Beattie Alaska Wilderness Area \nAct''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             The Mollie Beattie Alaska Wilderness Area Act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am here today with a heavy heart to \nintroduce a bill that I would like to have called the Mollie Beattie \nAlaska Wilderness Area Act. My colleague from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski \njoins me in my remarks and as an original sponsor of this legislation.\n  I want to make a few remarks about Mollie, who has served well as the \nDirector of Fish and Wildlife Service for this administration. I \nbelieve my colleague in the House, Don Young, will introduce similar \nlegislation. As the Senate knows, Mollie Beattie is gravely ill--so ill \nthat she decided to step down from her position as Director of the Fish \nand Wildlife Service. We are now informed that Mollie's situation is \nworsening.\n  It may seem strange for me to be here talking about Mollie Beattie. \nShe opposed many of the things that I believe in, as far as Alaska \npublic lands are concerned. But I am introducing this bill to designate \nthe 8 million acres of wilderness within the 19 million acre Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge as the ``Mollie Beattie Alaska Wilderness \nArea.''\n  Under my legislation, the Secretary of the Interior would be directed \nto place a monument on a portion of the wilderness, so that people \nentering the wilderness might remember and honor Mollie Beattie's \ncontribution to the conservation of fish and wildlife.\n  Now, Mollie Beattie opposed us on some things, and she worked with us \non some things. But the reason I like her is she was always honest with \nus. We knew where she stood. And she listened. As a matter of fact, as \ndays went on, we thought maybe she was listening to us more and we \nmight be able to find some middle ground between the position she had \ntaken and our own.\n  And so I was saddened, and I came to the floor and said so, when \nMollie stepped down from her position as the Director of the Fish and \nWildlife Service. In Mollie's departure from the Service, the American \npeople are losing a leader of depth of knowledge and life experience.\n  Mollie, by the way, was the first woman to serve as the Director of \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service. During the Eisenhower administration, I \nserved in the Interior Department for almost 5 years, and I know of the \nmission of that service and its continuing benefit to the American \npublic.\n  Mollie was and is a champion of resource conservation. I do not think \nwe really had any disagreement as to the end result that we sought, but \nperhaps some of the means to get there.\n  She came to the Fish and Wildlife Service from the Richard A. \nSnelling Center for Government in Vermont, where she was the executive \ndirector. Prior to that, she served in several Vermont State land \nmanagement agencies. I am happy that the senior Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Leahy, and the junior Senator, Mr. Jeffords, have asked to \ncosponsor the bill that I will send to the desk in a few moments.\n  In her last major speech as Director of the Fish and Wildlife \nService, Mollie recalled releasing Hope, a rehabilitated bald eagle, as \na highlight of her career. Her career has had many high moments. She \nhas focussed on reconnecting the American people to the wildlife around \nthem. Those of us who have worked with Mollie really are saddened to \nlearn about her condition. We send her and her husband, Rick, our \nsincerest sentiments and really want him to know that, from a \nprofessional point of view, his wife has enjoyed the greatest of \nfriendships in the Congress regardless of party.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Sec. 1.

Mr. President, today we dedicate a beautiful area of \nAlaska as the Mollie Beattie Fish and Wildlife Refuge. More than any \nperson this century, Mollie has led the fight to protect our Nation's \nnatural heritage. Her dedication to preserving wildlife and wildlife \nhabitat and her spirit and enthusiasm in accomplishing this important \ngoal will be appreciated by generations to come.\n  Mollie and I share much in common. We both love the wild, appreciate \nits complexity and beauty and value that it contributes to our lives. \nWe also recognize the importance of protecting fragile ecosystems, from \nwetlands to forests. Finally, we both love Vermont and have worked \ntogether to preserve its distinctive character.\n  I have followed Mollie's career throughout her time in Vermont and \nhere in Washington. A resident of Vermont since 1968, Mollie used her \ncalm and determined manner and her knowledge of animals, plants, and \nnatural resources to institute policies which today are a model of \nenvironmental protection. As a reporter, a University of Vermont \nprofessor and the developer of an experimental game bird habitat, \nMollie strove to integrate her values into each position and left \nbehind a legacy of success.\n  As Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and \nRecreation in the late 1980's, Mollie oversaw all of Vermont's public \nlands, including wildlife habitat areas and 48 State parks. In 1989, \nshe became Deputy Secretary for Vermont's Agency of Natural Resources, \ncaring for forests, public lands, water quality, air quality, and \nwildlife. After a stop over as Executive Director of the Richard A. \nSnelling Center for Government in Burlington, Mollie was nominated by \nPresident Clinton to serve as Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService. I have never known, in my 22 years representing Vermont, a \nperson with greater dedication to preserving our Nation's wildlife.\n  I remember soon after her appointment, Mollie came to visit me here \nin the Senate. We spent time discussing the future of the refuge system \nand prospects for Endangered Species Act reform. We also reviewed our \nNation's ability to curb the unnecessary slaughter of tigers, rhinos, \nelephants, and species rapidly disappearing from other countries. Her \ncommitment to ending the rapid loss of species was remarkable. Since \nher arrival here in Washington, she recognized the importance of our \nNation's wildlife refuge system and has been successful in protecting \nthese vital resources. She did so effectively and I assure you that our \nchildren and their children will forever cherish this determined \nwoman's work.\n  During her tenure at the Fish and Wildlife Service, Mollie visited \nAlaska several times and shared with me some of her special memories of \nthe State. These visits made a remarkable impression on Mollie, \nespecially her trip to the Arctic Refuge two summers ago. I can think \nof no better tribute than to name the 8 million acres of wilderness in \nthe Arctic Refuge after Mollie. This area captures the ideals and \nbeauty that Mollie strove to protect while at the Fish and Wildlife \nService.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Mollie Beattie on behalf of all my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate and all Americans for all that she has \ndone to make America a more beautiful Nation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 1900. A bill to amend title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to permit a waiver of the prohibition of offering nurse aide \ntraining and competency evaluation programs in certain nursing \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1901. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the requirement for annual resident review for nursing \nfacilities under the Medicaid program and to require resident reviews \nfor mentally ill or mentally retarded residents when there is a \nsignificant change in physical or mental condition; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                       long-term-care legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill relieve nursing homes of unnecessary regulation without \njeopardizing the high quality of care nursing home residents receive. \nThese two bills, which enjoy bipartisan support, will improve long-term \ncare in this country by giving nursing homes the flexibility they need \nto focus scarce resources on providing quality care.\n  I have long believed that the Federal Government has an important \nrole to play in ensuring against the kinds of abuses that occurred in \nsome areas of the country prior to enactment of Federal nursing home \nstandards. I do not believe that those abuses were the norm in nursing \nhomes. In fact, nursing homes in my State of North Dakota have a strong \nrecord of providing quality care, and I believe that this was the case \nin most nursing homes.\n  But it is clear that some nursing homes did not meet that high \nstandard, and many States were far too slow to respond. To address that \ncritical problem, I supported and continue to support minimum Federal \nquality standards. Our first priority in nursing home legislation must \nbe the quality of care provided to residents, and we should not pass \nany laws that would compromise that goal.\n  However, I believe that some of our efforts to regulate nursing homes \nhave not resulted in greater quality of care for residents. In some \ncases, by imposing unnecessary burdens and diverting scarce resources \nin nursing facilities, these laws and regulations can hinder the \ndelivery of quality care. The legislation I am offering today will \naddress two such instances.\n\n\n                      nurse-aide training program\n\n  The first bill I am introducing has enjoyed broad bipartisan support \nduring the 104th Congress. I am joined in offering this bill by Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin. This bill would exempt rural nursing \nfacilities from the possibility of termination of their nurse-aide \ntraining programs for reasons unrelated to the quality of the training \nprogram\n  Simply put, this is a commonsense amendment. In rural areas all over \nthe country, nursing facilities offer people an opportunity to learn \nthe basic nursing and personal care skills needed to become a certified \nnurse aide. In return, those who participate in a nurse-aide training \nprogram help nursing facilities meet their staffing needs and allow the \nnursing staff to focus more on administering quality nursing care.\n  Nurse-aide training programs are especially important in rural areas \nlike my State of North Dakota, where potential nurse aides might have \nto travel hundreds of miles for training if it is not available at the \nnursing facility in their community. These nurse-aide training programs \ncomply with strict guidelines related to the amount of training \nnecessary and determination of competency for certification.\n  Despite these safeguards, current law allows programs to be \nterminated for up to 2 years if a facility has been cited for a \ndeficiency or assessed a civil money penalty for reasons completely \nunrelated to the quality of the nurse-aide training program. In North \nDakota, this could result in real hardship not just for the nursing \nfacility and potential nurse aides, but for the nursing home residents \nwho rely on nurse aides for their day-to-day care.\n  Under my bill, rural areas would be exempt from termination of nurse-\naide training programs in these specific instances only if: first, no \nother program is offered within a reasonable distance of the facility; \nsecond, the State assures that an adequate environment exists for \noperating the program; and third, the State provides notice of the \ndetermination and assurances to the State long-term care ombudsman.\n  Congress included this exception for rural nurse-aide training \nprograms in the Balanced Budget Act passed last December, and the \nPresident included it in his 1997 budget proposal.\n\n\n                        annual resident reviews\n\n  The second bill I am introducing today relates to the pre-admission \nscreening and annual resident review [PASARR] requirements enacted as \npart of OBRA '87. Senator Grassley joins me in introducing this bill, \nwhich also has bipartisan support and was included in the President's \nbalanced budget proposal.\n  PASARR was enacted to prevent inappropriate placements of residents \nwith mental health or developmental disabilities. The need for \nassessments to determine whether a mental health\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\nor developmental disability exists is critical, and we still have some \nway to go in ensuring that residents with these problems receive \nappropriate placement and treatment in all cases.\n  However, the annual resident review process duplicates other \nmandatory assessments and has not resulted in identifying inappropriate \nplacements or improving the quality of care for nursing home residents. \nThe current law adds an average of $700,000 to State costs for long-\nterm care and diverts valuable nursing facility resources. We must \ncontinue to work to ensure that nursing home residents receive the \nquality care they need, but we should not do so by placing unnecessary \nor ineffective burdens on nursing facilities and their staffs.\n  My bill would retain the pre-admission screening for each resident, \nbut would repeal the annual resident review requirement for each \npatient. This would go a long way toward streamlining the regulatory \nprocess and allowing nursing homes to focus more time on providing \nquality care.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these sound policy \nproposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6719-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 814\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 814, a bill to provide for the \nreorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1607\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1607, a bill to \ncontrol access to precursor chemicals used to manufacture \nmethamphetamine and other illicit narcotics, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1799\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Jeffords] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1799, a bill to promote \ngreater equity in the delivery of health care services to American \nwomen through expanded research on women's health issues and through \nimproved access to health care services, including preventive health \nservices.\n\n\n                                S. 1806\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1806, a bill to amend the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify that any dietary \nsupplement that claims to produce euphoria, heightened awareness or \nsimilar mental or psychological effects shall be treated as a drug \nunder the act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 270\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lieberman, the names of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Hatch], and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 270, a resolution urging continued and \nincreased United States support for the efforts of the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to bring to justice the \nperpetrators of gross violations of international law in the former \nYugoslavia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6726-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6726-S6750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE SENATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      HOLLINGS AMENDMENT NO. 4093\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1219) to reform the financing of Federal elections, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Necessity for Spending Limits.--The Senate finds and \n     declares that--\n       (1) the current system of campaign finance has led to \n     public perceptions that political contributions and their \n     solicitation have unduly influenced the official conduct of \n     elected officials;\n       (2) permitting candidates for Federal office to raise and \n     spend unlimited amounts of money constitutes a fundamental \n     flaw in the current system of campaign finance, and has \n     undermined public respect for the Senate as an institution;\n       (3) the failure to limit campaign expenditures has caused \n     individuals elected to the Senate to spend an increasing \n     proportion of their time in office as elected officials \n     raising funds, interfering with the ability of the Senate to \n     carry out its constitutional responsibilities;\n       (4) the failure to limit campaign expenditures has damaged \n     the Senate as an institution, due to the time lost to raising \n     funds for campaigns; and\n       (5) to prevent the appearance of undue influence and to \n     restore public trust in the Senate as an institution, it is \n     necessary to limit campaign expenditures, through a system \n     which provides public benefits to candidates who agree to \n     limit campaign expenditures.\n       (b) Necessity for Ban on Political Action Committees.--The \n     Senate finds and declares that--\n       (1) contributions by political action committees to \n     individual candidates have created the perception that \n     candidates are beholden to special interests, and leave \n     candidates open to charges of undue influence;\n       (2) contributions by political action committees to \n     individual candidates have undermined public confidence in \n     the Senate as an institution; and\n       (3) to restore public trust in the Senate as an \n     institution, responsive to individuals residing within the \n     respective States, it is necessary to encourage candidates to \n     raise most of their campaign funds from individuals residing \n     within those States.\n       (c) Necessity for Attributing Cooperative Expenditures to \n     Candidates.--The Senate finds and declares that--\n       (1) public confidence and trust in the system of campaign \n     finance would be undermined should any candidate be able to \n     circumvent a system of caps on expenditures through \n     cooperative expenditures with outside individuals, groups, or \n     organizations;\n       (2) cooperative expenditures by candidates with outside \n     individuals, groups, or organizations would severely \n     undermine the effectiveness of caps on campaign expenditures, \n     unless they are included within such caps; and\n       (3) to maintain the integrity of the system of campaign \n     finance, expenditures by any individual, group, or \n     organization that have been made in cooperation with any \n     candidate, authorized committee, or agent of any candidate \n     must be attributed to that candidate's cap on campaign \n     expenditures.\n          TITLE I--CONTROL OF CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN SPENDING\n   Subtitle A--Senate Election Campaign Spending Limits and Benefits\n\n     SEC. 101.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING TAX CREDIT FOR LOCAL \n                   CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed an existing tax \n     provision providing for a $50 credit ($100 for joint returns) \n     for individual contributions to political campaigns and \n     certain political campaign organizations;\n       (2) in the intervening ten years, public confidence in the \n     integrity of funding congressional campaigns in the United \n     States has eroded;\n       (3) the American public perceives that there is a \n     substantial reliance on political action committees (PACs) in \n     Federal campaigns and that special interest funding of \n     campaigns is undermining the democratic process;\n       (4) the American public is concerned that fundraising \n     pressures may lead candidates to tailor their appeals to the \n     most affluent and narrowly interested sectors of society, \n     raising questions about the resulting quality of \n     representation of other elements of society;\n       (5) the growth in PAC importance relative to other funding \n     sources--including individuals giving directly to \n     candidates--is clear, given that 27 percent of House and \n     Senate candidates' receipts came from PACs in 1994 (up from \n     15.7 percent in 1974) and that in 1994, House candidates got \n     35 percent of their funds from PACs, and House incumbents \n     received 46 percent;\n       (6) while citizens with common interests should be able to \n     pool their resources in exercising their rights of free \n     speech and association, and interest groups have an \n     appropriate role to play, they should not be allowed to \n     play a greater role relative to other sectors, \n     particularly small individual contributors to local \n     candidates, and therefore, the role of PACs should be \n     reduced, and the role of small individual contributors to \n     local candidates should be increased; and\n       (7) faith in our electoral system must be restored, and all \n     individuals must feel that they have a voice in the process, \n     and this can best be accomplished by encouraging small, \n     individual contributors to become a more important part of \n     the process through support of candidates seeking to \n     represent them in Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Congress and the President should include, as part \n     of any campaign finance reform legislation, provisions which \n     would allow individuals a credit against Federal taxes for \n     contributions during the taxable year to Senate and House of \n     Representatives candidates within the political jurisdiction \n     in which the individual's principal residence is located; and\n       (2) the maximum credit should not exceed $100 for an \n     individual for a taxable year ($200 in the case of a joint \n     return).\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  WELLSTONE AMENDMENTS NOS. 4100-4101\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 1219, supra;

Mr. President, I ask that the letter submitted to me \nby June E. O'Neill, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nregarding CBO's estimate of H.R. 3286, the Adoption Promoting and \nStability Act of 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1996.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     has estimated the budgetary effects of Titles, I, II, and IV \n     of H.R. 3286, the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of \n     1996, as reported by the Committee on Finance on June 13, \n     1996. Because H.R. 3286 would affect revenues, the bill would \n     be subject to the pay-as-you go procedures under section 252 \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985.\n       The attached table displays the estimated federal budgetary \n     effects of Titles I, II, and IV of H.R. 3286. Title I would \n     establish a new tax credit for adoption expenses that would \n     reduce tax payments beginning in 1997. Title IV would repeal \n     the deduction for bad debt reserves of thrift institutions \n     and reform the income forecast method of determining \n     depreciation deductions, effective beginning with the 1996 \n     tax year. The revenue estimates for Titles I and IV of the \n     bill have been provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. \n     The bill would result in net revenue increases of $79 million \n     in 1996, $147 million in 1997, and $171 million in 2002, \n     which would be partially offset by net revenue losses in the \n     intervening years. Over the 1996-2002 period, the net revenue \n     increase would total $117 million.\n       CBO estimates that the provisions of Title II that would \n     remove barriers to interethnic adoptions would have a \n     negligible effect on federal outlays in the foster care and \n     adoption assistance programs. Although state governments or \n     other entities that receive federal funds for adoption or \n     foster care placement could pay penalties for failing to \n     follow the provisions of Title II, the penalties are \n     sufficiently large that states would comply with the new \n     provisions, and the penalties collected would be negligible.\n       Titles I and IV contain no intergovernmental mandates, as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4, and would impose no direct costs \n     on state, local, or tribal governments. These titles do, \n     however, contain private-sector mandates, as described in the \n     attached private sector mandate statement. Section 4 of the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 excludes from the \n     application of that act legislative provisions that establish \n     or enforce statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on \n     the basis of race, color, or national origin. CBO has \n     determined that the provisions in Title II fit within that \n     exclusion.\n       Should you require additional information on this estimate, \n     we will be pleased to provide it. The staff contacts for H.R. \n     3286 are Justin Latus (for federal costs), Stephanie Weiner \n     (for federal revenues), and Karen McVey (for state, local, \n     and tribal issues).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L.

Bill number: H.R. 3286.\n       2. Bill title: Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of \n     1996.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Finance, on June 13, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The purpose of the bill is to defray \n     adoption costs and promote the adoption of minority children. \n     In addition, the bill would repeal the deduction for bad debt \n     reserves of thrift institutions and reform the income \n     forecast method of accounting.\n       5. Private sector mandates contained in the bill: H.R. 3286 \n     contains mandates as defined in Public Law 104-4 that would \n     affect taxes paid by private sector entities. In particular, \n     the bill would repeal the deduction for bad debt reserves of \n     thrift institutions and reform the income forecast method of \n     accounting. In addition to these mandates, the bill includes \n     a new credit for adoption expenses that would reduce tax \n     payments.\n       6. Estimated direct cost to the private sector: The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the direct private \n     sector costs of the tax increases in H.R. 3286 would be no \n     less than the amounts that appear in the following table.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRepeal the deduction for bad                                            \n debt reserves for thrift                                               \n institutions...................      47     111     216     280     277\nReform income forecast method of                                        \n accounting.....................      32      69      29      13      14\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In addition to these mandates, the bill also provides for a \n     reduction in taxes. At this point, it is unclear to CBO \n     whether under Public Law 104-4 this tax reduction should be \n     viewed as an offset to the direct costs of the mandates in \n     the bill. JCT estimates that the savings associated with the \n     tax reduction in H.R. 3286 would be as displayed in the \n     following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       1996     1997     1998     1999     2000 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCredit for adoption expenses.......................................  .......      -33     -329     -351     -375\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       7. Appropriations or other Federal financial assistance: \n     None.\n       8. Previous CBO estimates: On May 2, 1996, CBO estimates \n     the private sector impact of H.R. 3286 as ordered reported by \n     the House Committee on Ways and Means on May 1, 1996. The \n     estimates differ because both the revenue increases and the \n     specific parameters of the credit for adoption expenses in \n     the Finance Committee's bill are different from those in the \n     Ways and Means Committee's bill.\n       9. Estimate prepared by: Daniel Mont (non-tax items) and \n     Stephanie Weiner.\n       10. Estimate approved by: Joseph R. Antos, Assistant \n     Director for Health and Human Resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6751-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6751-S6752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RENOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I supported Alan Greenspan's \nrenomination\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nto Chair the Federal Reserve Board for a third term.\n  Any decision of such importance to the American people deserves \ncareful consideration. But now that we have had a constructive debate, \nI am pleased that the Senate moved forward with this long-delayed \nprocess.\n  As some of you know, Dr. Greenspan's impressive career includes three \ndecades of work with a private sector economic consulting firm, during \nwhich time he held the positions of both chairman and president of the \ncompany. Other distinguished achievements include chairmanship of \nPresident Ford's Council of Economic Advisers, membership on President \nReagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board and consulting work for the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  And as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for the past 8 years, \nDr. Greenspan has won the respect and confidence of Republican and \nDemocrats alike and consistently steered American monetary policy on a \nprudent and responsible course.\n  Mr. President, the economy is strong and growing. Inflation is under \ncontrol, and mortgage rates have averaged 7.8 percent, the lowest since \nLyndon Johnson was in the White House. Much of this success is due to \nthe constancy and apolitical management of our country's monetary \npolicy. And while I will support reforms of Fed management to ensure \nthat taxpayer funds are used responsibly, I will not support efforts to \nsubject the Federal Reserve to political influence.\n  Considering his past record and looking to the future, Alan Greenspan \ndeserves reappointment. He is the best candidate for the job, and I am \nconfident that he will continue providing vital leadership toward our \ncommon goal of keeping the economy robust.\n  I supported his renomination and am pleased that the majority of my \ncolleagues opted to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6751-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a very special advisor brought \nto my attention an article that I ask to place in the Record. My \ncounsellor on matters of foreign policy is not only the highly \ndistinguished former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand Senator from Illinois, Senator Charles Percy, he also is my one and \nonly father-in-law. I continue to be indebted to him for both his sage \nadvice and the familial bond we share.\n  Recently, former Senator Percy shared the following article that \nappeared on June 14, 1996 in The Christian Science Monitor. Authored by \nformer Vice-President Walter Mondale, who serves as the current U.S. \nAmbassador to Japan, it commemorates the 50th anniversary of the \nFulbright Program.\n  I want to draw the attention of my colleagues and other readers to \nthis fine essay on the value of this unique international exchange \nprogram. With the Fulbright Program's emphasis on excellence in \nscholarship and studies, this effort creates and nurtures relations \nbetween America's bright, curious, and energetic citizens and their \ncounterparts in other countries. It breaks through the barriers that \notherwise cause ignorance, prejudice, misunderstandings, and the \ndangers of war and other violence. There is simply no substitute for \nthe opportunity of individuals around the world to learn from one \nanother.\n  The Fulbright Program is not a luxury for America. It is a necessary \npart of an effective foreign policy for the world's economic leader and \nsuperpower. As we celebrate its anniversary, this article reminds us \nthat its future will be the course for Americans to continue promoting \npeace and the ties that benefit our own country along with the rest of \nthe world.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the Christian Science Monitor]\n\n               The Grand Vision of the Fulbright Program\n\n                          (By Walter Mondale)\n\n       Since becoming ambassador to Japan three years ago, I have \n     directly experienced the enormous benefits of people-to-\n     people exchange. It is a process I now consider one of the \n     vital tools of American international policy. My experience \n     in Japan has elevated me from just a believer in \n     international exchange to a true believer.\n       The Fulbright Program, which turns 50 this year, is the \n     flagship of scholarly exchange programs. Its universal renown \n     attests to its extraordinary long-term impact on \n     international relations.\n       Congress established the program in 1946 ``to increase \n     mutual understanding between the people of the United States \n     and the people of other countries.'' My friend J. William \n     Fulbright (D) of Arkansas, a strong-willed senator of rare \n     vision, introduced the legislation two weeks after the \n     nuclear age blasted its imprint on history at Hiroshima. At \n     the time he called it ``a modest program with an immodest \n     aim.''\n       Over the past several years, we have taken special note of \n     many 50th anniversaries, often in a spirit of somber \n     commemoration: the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Iwo \n     Jima, the Battle of Okinawa, and the atomic bombings of \n     Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first half of the 20th century \n     was battered by two world wars, and as the curtain rose on \n     the second half, a war-weary US went to battle once again in \n     Asia while the world drew itself into two armed camps.\n       Appalled by war's tragic human cost, Bill Fulbright's \n     ``immodest aim'' was no less than ``the humanizing of \n     international relations . . . to the point that men can learn \n     to live in peace--eventually even to cooperate in \n     constructive activities rather than compete in a mindless \n     contest of mutual destruction. . . .'' During this 50th-\n     anniversary year of Fulbright's program, as we celebrate the \n     global reach of his vision, we properly hail his ``immodest'' \n     achievement.\n       In its early years in Japan, the program focuses on \n     bringing outstanding students of the postwar generation of \n     young Japanese to experience US social institutions and \n     democracy. The results are found everywhere: United Nations \n     Undersecretary-General Yasushi Akashi was a Fulbrighter. So \n     were seven current members of the Diet, the presidents of two \n     of Japan's largest banks, and more than 5,000 others who have \n     carried their experience of American life back to Japanese \n     colleges, government offices, businesses, and civic \n     organizations.\n       The US and Japan reap great benefits from our harmonious \n     bilateral relations, and we share a common stake in global \n     security and stability. Our relationship is solid. But our \n     societies are so profoundly different in so many basic areas \n     that it requires great effort for us to understand each \n     other.\n       As in so many endeavors, those who acquire the tools early \n     achieve the most success. The history professor from Kysuhu \n     University who as a young scholar spent a year in Columbus, \n     Ohio, teaches his students with deeper insights than one who \n     has not had that experience. The recent New York University \n     graduate living for a year with a family near Osaka will \n     return to New York to pursue a law career that will take a \n     much different direction than had she never experienced \n     Japan. Such seemingly commonplace events, multiplied many \n     times over, bring extraordinary benefits to our relations.\n       The Fulbright Program is enormously popular in Japan. When \n     Senator Fulbright died last year, hundreds of former \n     Fulbrighters gathered for an elegant memorial service, and \n     virtually every newspaper ran an appreciative story lauding \n     the educational and cultural benefits bestowed on so many \n     Japanese.\n       In recent years, the proportion of American Fulbrighters \n     relative to that of Japanese has grown considerably; so has \n     the Japanese financial contribution. The Japanese government \n     now funds the bi-national program at approximately twice the \n     level of the US. And Japanese alumni continue to make a \n     generous annual donation, which is devoted to bringing recent \n     US college graduates to Japan.\n       There are many ways to study abroad but the Fulbright \n     Program stands alone. Practically everyone in Japan knows \n     about it, and what it has meant to this country. Its \n     marvelous reputation has been earned not simply by the \n     scholastic achievements of its outstanding participants, but \n     also because Fulbrighters see themselves as students, \n     lecturers, or researchers abroad who are part of a noble, \n     larger purpose.\n       Fulbright once said, ``Man's struggle to be rational about \n     himself, about his relationship to his own society and the \n     other peoples and nations involves a constant search for \n     understanding among all peoples and cultures--a search that \n     can only be effective when learning is pursued on a worldwide \n     basis.''\n       Some say that the cold war's end has drained the urgency \n     from international exchanges. It's simply not so. The need to \n     educate citizens who have international experience and who \n     can communicate and establish relationships across borders is \n     more compelling than ever.\n       In the US, we have entered what US Information Agency \n     director Joseph Duffey calls ``an era of frugal diplomacy.'' \n     Our government must consider with care the cost-effectiveness \n     of what it does. Judged by that standard, there are few \n     programs that serve our long-term international-relations \n     goals as fully and effectively--yet as inexpensively--as the \n     Fulbright Program.\n       As Americans with a stake in our relations with the rest of \n     the world, and particularly with Japan, we will be well \n     served if our political leaders continue their support of \n     Bill Fulbright's vision.\n       (Former Vice President Walter Mondale is the US ambassador \n     to Japan.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6752-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6752-S6753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLYDE M. DANGERFIELD, A TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nman from my home State who, in his work and his life, set an example \nfor us all. Clyde M. Dangerfield died on June 19 at the age of 81. He \nserved 35 years in the South Carolina House of Representatives, and was \nresponsible for improving the lives of citizens all over Charleston \nCounty. His concern, persistence, and integrity made him one of the \nfinest public servants South Carolina has known. He was a good friend, \na credit to his county, and I can say, without exaggeration, that the \nState is a better place because of him. Mr. President, I ask to have \nprinted in the Record two articles from Clyde Dangerfield's local \npaper, the Post and Courier.\n  The articles follow:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, June 22, 1996]\n\n                          Clyde M. Dangerfield\n\n       When Clyde M. Dangerfield retired from the House of \n     Representatives in 1988, he was number one in seniority. It \n     had been 35 years since he first was appointed to fill a \n     vacancy in the Charleston County Legislative Delegation and \n     had gone on to win election 17 times. While his 24-year \n     chairmanship of the House Labor, Commerce and Industry \n     Committee set a longevity record, his chief interest was the \n     area's transportation system. Before his death this week, he \n     lived to see his major dreams realized.\n       Relatively early in his public career, he was named \n     chairman of the Charleston County Legislative Delegation's \n     Roads and Bridges Committee. It became his prime focus and \n     highway improvements his chief cause. The scope of his work \n     was expanded when highway funding became keyed to long-range \n     regional transportation planning. Mr. Dangerfield was named \n     chairman of the Charleston Area Transportation Study (CHATS) \n     Policy Committee from its inception in the late 1960s until \n     he retired.\n       His career spanned major changes in the South Carolina \n     political landscape, from the days when lawmakers were \n     elected countywide and Democrats were the only elected \n     officials, to the advent of the two-party system and single-\n     member election districts. A long-time resident of the Isle \n     of Palms, his East Cooper area had become a Republican \n     stronghold before he stepped aside. Unlike many of his \n     colleagues who switched parties, he remained a Democrat and \n     withstood a strong Republican Challenge before he retired.\n       Herbert U. Fielding credits Mr. Dangerfield with being part \n     of a coalition that helped him become, in 1970, the first \n     black legislator from Charleston since Reconstruction. After \n     that victory he remembers learning the legislative ropes from \n     Mr. Dangerfield in the rides back and forth to Columbia. ``He \n     taught most of us--all of us--me in particular.''\n       Mr. Fielding also noted that Mr. Dangerfield never sought \n     the political center stage. In fact, Mr. Fielding remembered \n     that Mr. Dangerfield ``very seldom took the podium in the \n     House--he'd push me up.'' But few knew better than Mr. \n     Dangerfield how to get things done.\n       Every member of the delegation who served with Mr. \n     Dangerfield can tell stories of being taken from one end of \n     the county to the other to check on requests for road \n     repavings, particularly in the days when county lawmakers had \n     the last word on such local requests. But he never lost sight \n     of the larger projects, particularly the James Island Bridge \n     and the Isle of Palms Connector, which were the source of \n     much delay and frustration. The ribbons were cut on both, and \n     the latter named in his honor several years before his death.\n       It was Clyde Dangerfield's ability to work behind the \n     scenes and his persistence that were key to his success, \n     according to Robert B. Scarborough, the former highway \n     commissioner and legislator who was his closest ally. He can \n     recall more than one project now in place because Clyde \n     Dangerfield refused to give up.\n       None is more notable than the $38 million, state-of-the-\n     art, fixed-span bridge that bears his name and links the East \n     Cooper island communities to the mainland. It took Hurricane \n     Hugo to convince some island residents of the danger of \n     relying solely on one means of exit off the islands. When the \n     Clyde M. Dangerfield Bridge was dedicated, Isle of Palms \n     Mayor Carmen Bunch was quoted as saying, ``This opens a new \n     avenue to us all. We will never be kept from our homes \n     again.'' That is only one of many debts of gratitude this \n     community owes to Clyde M. Dangerfield's determined \n     leadership.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, June 23, 1996]\n\n                 Dangerfield: A Life of Quiet Integrity\n\n                           (By Elsa McDowell)\n\n       Somewhere on the bridge that bears his name, Clyde \n     Dangerfield's heart beat its last on Wednesday.\n       The connector that he had envisioned as a lifeline to the \n     mainland for the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island wasn't \n     short enough to get his 81-year-old heart to the hospital \n     before full cardiac arrest.\n       Minutes before, he had finished his daily swim in the pool \n     behind his Isle of Palms house. He was climbing out of the \n     shallow end when he called to his wife Betty.\n       He couldn't breathe.\n       It was a scene Rep. Clyde Dangerfield might have described \n     in his years campaigning for the connector.\n       He'd have said it plainly, an honest reflection of his \n     concern: Without a connector, someone on the Isle of Palms \n     suffering from severe heart failure wouldn't stand a chance. \n     With it, he might.\n       Clyde Dangerfield Jr.'s voice catches at the image. His \n     father worked hard for the connector--much the same way he \n     worked for poor people in rural Charleston County.\n       ``I remember when I was 8 or 9. On Sundays, he would say, \n     `Come on, son, Let's go check on some roads.' ''\n\n\n                            roads and roads\n\n       Clyde Jr., pad and pen in hand, would climb on a pillow in \n     the front seat of the big green 1954 Chrysler and they would \n     head to the boonies. In 1953, Dangerfield was first elected \n     to serve the whole county and that's what he did.\n       ``Daddy would give me odometer readings and I'd write them \n     down. Each county was given so many miles of roads and Daddy \n     wanted to make sure it was divided fairly.''\n       When he came upon roads that needed paving, they made their \n     first stop: A country store.\n       ``He'd walk in not knowing one of the 10 people sitting \n     there. He'd leave knowing all 10,'' Clyde says.\n       He'd also leave with the name and address of the street's \n     unofficial ringleader--their next stop.\n       ``Would you like this road paved?'' ``Of course.''\n       Then he'd pull out some forms. Get signatures from everyone \n     on the street. He'd take care of it.\n       Oh, one more thing. Include voter registration numbers.\n       Clyde smiles. They didn't have to be registered; but \n     Dangerfield knew politics. He'd have new supporters and \n     citizens would have a voice in their government.\n       Sure enough, rural voters helped send Dangerfield to the \n     House for 35 years. And since his death Wednesday, the stream \n     of mourners has included simple people who sign with an ``x'' \n     and government leaders who live in the headlines.\n       Clyde Dangerfield Jr.'s immense pride in his father isn't \n     because of politics. It's not because he established and ran \n     Suburban Gas and Appliance Co.\n\n\n                                the man\n\n       Clyde says his father ``provided the definition for the \n     word `integrity.' Every night, his six children saw him get \n     on his knees and pray. I never heard him say a cuss word and \n     I never heard him raise his voice to my mother.''\n       His son can't think of anyone who didn't like his father.\n       It wouldn't be someone who was jealous. Clyde Dangerfield \n     didn't enjoy the limelight. He didn't seek headlines.\n       It wouldn't be a political enemy. Clyde Dangerfield was a \n     Democrat, but embraced issues Republicans appreciate as well.\n       ``He believed in negotiating,'' Clyde says. To him, there \n     was no such thing as a win-lose situation. It had to be win-\n     win.\n       It wouldn't be constituents. They'd have to know he was \n     trying to serve them.\n       Dangerfield grew up hard. One of 10 children of a dirt \n     farmer in Oakley, he finished Berkeley County schools when he \n     was 21. He needed time off to tend crops.\n       He was blind in his left eye because of a childhood \n     baseball accident. The horse-and-buggy ride to Charleston \n     took a day and a half. Too late.\n       Dangerfield was moving slowly through Clemson--hog farming \n     for money--when the war started and he joined the Army.\n       Afterward he moved to the Isle of Palms and got involved \n     right away. He was a founder of the First United Methodist \n     Church there.\n       When his house caught fire, he had to rely on Sullivan's \n     Island firefighters for help. So in the 1950s, Dangerfield \n     helped establish a department for the Isle of Palms.\n       And then there's his family. A wife, six children and 10 \n     grandchildren who don't just think--they know--that Clyde \n     Dangerfield was all they love and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6752-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6753-S6754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 25, 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, 58 years ago today, on the eve of his \nsigning into law the first Federal minimum wage, President Franklin \nRoosevelt gave a fireside chat. He warned the American people that they \nwould hear ``Calamity howling business executives with incomes of \n$1,000 a day, claim that the new minimum wage of $11 a week will have a \ndisastrous effect on all American industry.'' It was not true then and \nit is not true today.\n  The minimum wage will not hurt business, cause job loss, or cause \ninflation. It will, however, provide a pay raise for 112 million hard-\nworking Americans who deserve a living wage. Tomorrow, Senator Daschle, \nI, and others will seek to add the minimum wage as an amendment to the \nDOD authorization bill. This is not the course we would prefer to take, \nbut the Republican leadership of the Senate leaves us no choice.\n  More than a year ago, I joined Senator Daschle in introducing S. 413, \na bill that would have raised the minimum wage by 45 cents in July 1995 \nand again this July for a total raise of 90 cents, bringing the minimum \nwage up to $5.15 an hour. We could not get a hearing on S. 413 in the \nLabor Committee, so on July 31, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution calling on the Senate to consider the minimum wage increase \nbefore the end of the year. The resolution was defeated 48 to 49.\n\n  In October, unable to have so much as a hearing on the minimum wage, \nwe tried again. Senator Kerry, my colleague, offered a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution again, which was blocked by a Republican procedural \nmaneuver. But we got a majority in favor, 51 to 48. We finally got a \nhearing in December, but no markup was scheduled. Finally, with the \nreal value of the minimum wage continuing to fall and no relief for \nlow-wage workers in sight, we offered an amendment to raise the minimum \nwage on the parks bill this past April and filed cloture; 55 Senators \nvoted for cloture and 45 against.\n  It is clear from that vote, and the one last October, that a majority \nof Senators want to see the minimum wage increased, but they have been \nfrustrated by the Republican leadership. Time after time, we have tried \nto bring up this critical legislation, but the Republican leadership \nhas been willing to tie up the Senate for 10 days at a time to prevent \nit. Then on May 23, the House passed a minimum wage increase by a huge \nmargin, 266 to 162. That bill came over from the House, and the \nmajority leader--then Bob Dole, and now Senator Lott--has refused to \nallow its consideration as a clean bill.\n  This is now our last opportunity to have the minimum wage increase \nconsidered before the day it is supposed to take effect, July 4. If the \nSenate does not act now, it will be turning its back on 12 million \nAmericans, who are counting on the Congress to do the right thing for \nthem and their families.\n  Tomorrow, June 25, marks the 58th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt's \nsigning of the first minimum wage bill. The minimum wage in the bill \nPresident Roosevelt signed established the wage at 25 cents an hour. In \n1938, as today, Republicans were opposed to the minimum wage. But, \nultimately, the good sense of the Congress prevailed.\n  It is entirely fitting that, tomorrow, Senator Daschle, our \nDemocratic leader, will seek, once again, to bring the minimum wage \nincrease to the floor, and I hope the Republican leadership will not \nblock that effort. If it does, we will not give up. We will seek to \noffer the minimum wage to every bill on the Senate floor and, \nultimately, I believe we will prevail, as Franklin Roosevelt did 58 \nyears ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6754-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6754-S6760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will address the Senate for a few \nmoments this evening on an issue that is before the Senate, and really \nbefore the country, and that is a question of where we are in our \nhealth care debate and discussion.\n  I thought this evening I would just make some brief comments to \nfollow those of last Friday about what some of the dangers are with \nmedical savings accounts and, in particular, what has been the record \nof the Golden Rule Insurance Co., which is the principal insurance \ncompany that sells medical savings accounts at the present time. I will \nreview, briefly, what the record of that company has been over the \nperiod of the last couple of years because there have been those who \nhave questioned whether we have been giving a fair and accurate \nreflection of this insurance company.\n  I will include in the Record, Mr. President, the Indianapolis Star \narticle of June 22, just a few days ago. This is the Indianapolis Star, \nthe home newspaper for the Golden Rule Insurance Co. I think for those \nthat are familiar with the Indianapolis Star, there is no one here that \nwould suggest that that was considered to be a liberal newspaper, or \neven a moderate newspaper. It has been one of the newspapers that have \nbeen part of the Pullian family and has prided itself in supporting \nvery conservative candidates, with a very conservative editorial \npolicy. This is the hometown newspaper. This is not the Democrats, who \nare opposed, or Republicans who are opposed to medical savings \naccounts. This is their hometown newspaper, blowing the whistle, so to \nspeak, on the Golden Rule Insurance Co.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Indianapolis Star, June 22, 1996]\n\n           Golden Rule Has a Keen Interest in Insurance Bill\n\n\n inclusion of tax-free medical savings accounts would be a significant \n                    aid to the firm's profitability\n\n                          (By Larry MacIntyre)\n\n       If you ran an insurance business and discovered that fewer \n     and fewer people were\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\n     buying your policies, you'd probably welcome a federal law \n     that would have the effect of paying some families a $2,000 \n     or more bonus to buy them.\n       A law like that could turn sinking sales into skyrocketing \n     sales almost overnight.\n       In a sense, that is what's at stake for the Indianapolis-\n     based Golden Rule Insurance Co. as it watches the White House \n     and Congressional Republicans haggle over putting tax-free \n     medical savings accounts--known as MSAs--into a health-\n     insurance reform bill jointly sponsored by Sens. Ted Kennedy, \n     D-Mass., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.\n       The bill is aimed at making it easier for employees to keep \n     health insurance when they change jobs. Until this month, \n     President Clinton had vowed to veto it if it included MSAs, a \n     concept that Golden Rule's former chairman, Pat Rooney, has \n     been lobbying for tirelessly for years.\n       Congressional Republicans, who received more than $1 \n     million in campaign contributions from Golden Rule and its \n     executives before the last election, are touting MSAs as a \n     way to bring free-market forces to bear on rising health-care \n     costs.\n       Opponents of MSAs predict the device will shrink the amount \n     of money needed for health insurance pools by instead giving \n     it to people who stay healthy--or at least don't visit the \n     doctor. Kennedy says MSAs will drive insurance premiums \n     ``through the roof,'' and he singled out Golden Rule as being \n     the ``worst abuser'' of the current system.\n       The prospect of MSAs appeared to be at a stalemate until \n     two weeks ago, when the White House signaled it would be \n     willing to include a trial program for small businesses. Now, \n     Clinton's aides and Congressional staffers are trying to \n     agree on how big a population would be served by the trial \n     program.\n\n\n                           future in question\n\n       The answers they come up with will determine the future of \n     Golden Rule, which is seeing steadily declining sales of \n     individual health-insurance policies in the face of mounting \n     competition from managed-care plans.\n       The company's profitability is also being squeezed as it \n     shifts into the highly competitive group health-insurance \n     market, which is now dominated by managed-care plans.\n       In its required annual report to the state, Golden Rule \n     cited reduced revenue from health policies as the reason its \n     net gain after taxes fell to $25.8 million in 1995--down 29 \n     percent from the previous year.\n       Company officials did not return phone calls from The \n     Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News seeking comment.\n       One reason managed-care plans are growing in popularity is \n     that, unlike holders of Golden Rule's traditional fee-for-\n     service policies, users of managed-care plans don't have to \n     pay a $500 or $1,000 deductible out of pocket before the \n     policy kicks in. Most managed-care policies provide what is \n     known as first-dollar coverage.\n       The attraction of medical savings accounts is that they go \n     one step better. People who stay healthy would get money \n     back.\n       The plan pushed by Congressional Republicans calls for a \n     three-year test. It would allow self-employed individuals and \n     employers with 100 or fewer workers to establish tax-exempt \n     MSAs of up to $2,000 per individual or $4,000 per family.\n       The catch is that money in the MSA would be tax exempt only \n     if a companion health-insurance policy for catastrophic \n     illness is also purchased. Deductibles for these policies \n     could be as high as $5,000 for individuals and $7,500 for \n     families. Choose own doctors\n       MSA holders could choose their own doctors and spend as \n     much or as little as necessary from the account. At the end \n     of the year, any money left in the MSA could be either rolled \n     over or paid to the employee as taxable income.\n       At the end of the three-year test, Congress would vote on \n     whether to expand MSAs to the rest of the nation's workers.\n       A RAND Corp. study published in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association last month estimated that 57 percent of \n     the nation's families would choose MSAs over traditional fee-\n     for-service policies or managed care.\n       If that estimate were to hold true, it would translate into \n     a potential market of more than 50 million new customers for \n     Golden Rule and other insurers offering catastrophic-care \n     policies.\n       Last year, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ohio analyzed a \n     year's worth of health claims for 38,729 family policyholders \n     and determined that 68 percent would have qualified for money \n     back if they had MSAs.\n       Assuming they had all started with $3,000 in their MSAs, \n     their average payback would have been $2,039.\n       But the Ohio insurer isn't a supporter of MSAs. In fact, \n     John Burry Jr., its chairman and chief executive officer, is \n     one of the most outspoken and active opponents of MSAs.\n       Burry says the Ohio study--which he presented to the House \n     Ways and Means Committee last year--show that MSAs have the \n     potential to bankrupt the nation's health-care system.\n       ``They are tailor-made for identifying healthy persons who \n     may be profitably insured. It makes no sense for a sick \n     person to utilize an MSA,'' Burry said in testimony to the \n     committee.\n       The reason is that all the money that healthy people would \n     get back from their MSAs--more than $50 million in the Ohio \n     group--represents money that under current health plans is \n     being paid into the insurance pool for their group coverage.\n\n\n                         $50 million shortfall\n\n       If that money were taken out of their pool, it would create \n     a shortfall of $50 million needed to cover the health \n     expenses of the 32 percent of families that didn't stay \n     healthy.\n       Some of those families spent in excess of $300,000 each for \n     treatment of cancer, pre-term infants or coronary problems.\n       While the unhealthy families represented less than a third \n     of the study group, they accounted for 84 percent of the \n     $159.3 million health-care costs. But under an MSA plan, the \n     study calculated there would have been only $109 million \n     available to cover those health costs.\n       Thus, the study concluded, employers would ultimately have \n     to pay higher premiums, or sick people would have to pay more \n     of their own costs to make up that $50 million shortfall.\n       Extend that economic model across the entire nation, says \n     Burris, and the shortfall could reach $80 billion a year.\n       Burris' arguments have not dampened the enthusiasm among \n     Congressional Republicans.\n       ``MSAs deserve to become the law of the land because they \n     represent a common-sensical, sound policy for health care,'' \n     says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Coats is a Republican conferee \n     pushing to keep MSAs in the health-care bill.\n       Supporters of MSAs range from the American Medical \n     Association to Rush Limbaugh.\n       The most ardent opponent of MSAs in the Senate has been Ted \n     Kennedy, who recently singled out Golden Rule for criticism \n     in his written response explaining why he would not support \n     the MSA amendment to his bill.\n       ``It is no accident that the leading proponents of medical \n     savings accounts are insurance companies like Golden Rule, \n     which have been the worst abusers of the current system,`` he \n     wrote, ``They have given millions of dollars to political \n     candidates to try to get this business opportunity into \n     law.''\n       Last fall, the nonpartisan American Academy of Actuaries, \n     which studies insurance policy issues, also chimed in with a \n     call for caution on MSAs.\n       Its report concluded: ``The greatest savings will be for \n     the employees who have little or no health care expenditures. \n     The greatest losses will be for the employees with \n     substantial health care expenses. Those with high \n     expenditures are primarily older employees and pregnant \n     women.''\n\n  Mr. President, in the last Congress, health care reform became a \nhighly partisan issue--and no progress was made. In this Congress, we \nhave an opportunity to avoid the failures of the past by moving to \naddress some of these problems on a bipartisan basis, even in this \nelection year. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill passed the Senate by a vote \nof 100 to 0. It had 66 cosponsors--with almost equal numbers from both \nparties. If we could send it to the President today, it would be signed \nby him tomorrow.\n  But the House Republican leadership is insisting that any health \nreform must be their way or no way. This non-negotiable approach is an \ninsult to millions of Americans who want insurance reform. It is time \nfor the Republican leadership to stopped trying to turn a bipartisan \nbill that the American people need into a partisan proposal that will \nnever be signed into law.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy insurance reform bill eliminates many of the \nworst abuses of the current system. It will benefit an estimated 25 \nmillion Americans a year. Today, millions of Americans are forced to \npass up jobs that would improve their standard of living or offer them \ngreater opportunities, because they are afraid they will lose their \nhealth insurance or face unacceptable exclusions for preexisting \nconditions. Many other Americans abandon the goal of starting their own \nbusiness, because health insurance would be unavailable to them or \nmembers of their families. Still other Americans lose their health \ninsurance because they become sick or lose their job or change their \njob, even when they have paid their insurance premiums for many years.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill addresses each of these problems. \nInsurance companies are limited in their power to impose exclusions for \npreexisting conditions. No exclusion can last for more than 12 months. \nOnce persons have been covered for 12 months, no new exclusion can be \nimposed as long as there is no gap in coverage, even if they change \ntheir job, lose their job, or change insurance companies.\n  No workers wishing to participate in an insurance plan offered by \ntheir employer can be turned down or made to pay higher premiums \nbecause they are in poor health. If someone no longer has access to on-\nthe-job insurance because they have lost their job or gone to work for \nan employer who does not\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\noffer coverage, they cannot be denied individual insurance coverage or \nface exclusions for preexisting conditions when they buy a policy. The \nsame protection is provided for children who exceed the maximum age \nwhen they can still be covered under their parents' plan.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will not solve all the problems of the \ncurrent system. But it will make a significant difference in increased \nhealth security for millions of Americans.\n  The only opposition to the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill came from those who \nprofit from the abuses in the current system. That is why it passed the \nSenate unanimously. An amendment by Senators Dole and Roth that added \nassistance for small business, strengthened antifraud provisions--and \nincluded other useful proposals was also adopted with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  But now the bill is stalled, because some Republicans insist on \nadding a partisan poison bill--medical savings accounts. Such accounts \nare a bad idea that will make our insurance system worse instead of \nbetter. They are too controversial to be included in any consensus \nbill.\n  A compromise is possible if our Republican friends are willing to \nhave a legitimate test of the idea first, without imposing it full-\nblown on the country. But the so-called compromise now being offered on \nmedical savings accounts is nothing of this kind. It is a capitulation \nto House Republicans, who are more interested in creating an issue and \nserving a special interest constituency than in passing a needed health \nreform bill.\n  Discussions are ongoing to see whether a genuine compromise can be \nreached. If not, we should simply pass the bipartisan bill already \nunanimously approved by the Senate, and consider medical savings \naccounts on separate legislation.\n  Most people do not understand what a medical savings account is, or \nwhy special interest groups are so anxious to see them included in this \nbill. Medical savings accounts have two parts. The first is a \ncatastrophic, high-deductible insurance policy that requires people to \nincur substantial medical costs out of their own pocket before \ninsurance kicks in. Supporters of medical savings accounts usually mean \npolicies with deductibles of about $1,500 to $2,000 per person. There \nis nothing that keeps businesses and individuals from buying such \npolicies today.\n\n  The second part of a medical savings account is a tax-free savings \naccount that is established by an individual or an employer to pay for \npart of the costs that the insurance does not cover. In theory, the \nlower premium cost for such a policy will make savings available to put \nin these accounts. Proponents of medical savings accounts often present \nthis part of the plan as if the premium savings will cover almost the \nwhole cost of the deductible. But that's not necessarily the case.\n  Medical savings accounts sound too good to be true--and they are. The \nAmerican Academy of Actuaries and the Urban Institute estimate that the \nsavings will be only a fraction of the deductible--leaving families \nexposed to high costs they simply cannot pay.\n  Last week, I challenged the supporters of medical savings accounts to \nanswer some simple questions, so that the American people can \nunderstand what the flawed Republican proposal really means. Those \nquestions have still not been answered, because the Republicans know \nthat their medical savings account plan cannot stand the truth in \nadvertising test. Here's what their plan provides.\n  First, the Republican plan allows deductibles as high as $5,000 per \nindividual and $7,500 per family. A family needing medical care must \nspend $7,500 out of their own pocket before their insurance pays a \ndime. I ask my Republican friends how many families can afford to pay \nthis much for medical care, and why in the world would you give a \nspecial tax break for a policy providing such minimal protection?\n  Medical savings accounts are described by the advocates as providing \ncatastrophic protection. Once you hit the cap, they say you have \ncomplete protection. Actually, almost all conventional insurance \npolicies already have a feature like this, called a stop-loss, which \ncaps the policyholder's out-of-pocket spending for covered services. \nEven among policies offered by small businesses, which are typically \nless generous than those provided by large companies, 90 percent have a \nstop-loss. And for virtually all of these plans, the stop-loss is less \nthan $2,000.\n  Contrast that to the Republican plan. Protection does not even start \nuntil you have spent $5,000, and there is no stop-loss. None \nwhatsoever. The plan allows the insurer to charge a 30-percent \ncopayment for charges in excess of the deductible. A $40,000 doctor and \nhospital bill is not unusual for a significant illness or surgery. A \nperson needing such care would owe $15,500 for bills the policy would \nnot pay. Under the conventional plan, their costs would be limited to \n$2,000 or less.\n  Can the Republicans explain to the American people why their plan has \nno stop-loss provision? Can they describe the logic that says it is all \nright to make a family pay $7,500 before their insurance covers them at \nall--and then leave them exposed to unlimited additional expenses even \nafter they have paid the first $7,500? When you ask these questions, \nthe Republicans have no answer.\n  The Republicans claim that people can cover these huge gaps in their \ninsurance protection out of their medical savings accounts. Perhaps the \nwealthy, who get the bulk of the tax breaks under this plan, will be \nable to afford high medical costs--but how are working families to set \naside the $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, or more that they would need for \nprotection in the event of a serious illness?\n  There is nothing in the Republican plan that requires employers to \ncontribute even one thin dime to a medical savings account for their \nemployees. I've asked the Republican sponsors of this provision if \ntheir plan requires employers to make any contribution to the medical \nsavings accounts of their employees, but there has been no answer--\nbecause a truthful answer is too embarrassing.\n\n  The Republican plan has other basic flaws. Today, most insurance \ncompanies have fee schedules limiting the amount that doctors and \nhospitals can charge for covered services. These fee schedules \ngenerally pay less--sometimes only half as much--as the actual charges. \nBut providers generally accept these reduced fees as payment in full.\n  Under a medical savings account there is no such protection. In fact, \npatients could find themselves in the situation of having spent $9,000 \non physician and hospital care and still not have met their $5,000 \ndeductible, because the charges the patient has to pay are higher than \nthe insurance company's fee schedule. No wonder some doctors and \nhospitals love the idea of medical savings accounts.\n  The driving force behind medical savings accounts is the Golden Rule \nInsurance Co. It made more than $1 million in campaign contributions \nbefore the last election alone. In October 1994, Golden Rule delivered \n$416,000 in soft money to the GOP. Only two other companies gave more \nto Republicans during the last election cycle. Golden Rule has \ncontributed lavishly to Newt Gingrich's GOPAC political action fund. No \none should be under any illusions. If it were not for Golden Rule, its \nchairman, Patrick Rooney, and its lavish contributions, medical savings \naccounts would not be an issue before this Congress--and it would not \nbe the poison pill that threatens to sink health reform legislation \nagain.\n  Why does the Golden Rule Insurance Co. want this legislation? The \nanswer is simple. Golden Rule profits by abusing the current system. \nThey make their money by insuring the healthy and avoiding those who \nneed coverage the most. The company is notorious for offering policies \nwith inadequate coverage, for dropping people when they get sick, for \nexcluding parts of the body most likely to result in an illness, and \nfor invoking exclusions for preexisting conditions when costly claims \nare filed.\n  Insurance reform that forces companies like Golden Rule to compete \nfairly by providing good services at a reasonable price would put them \nout of business. As the Indianapolis Star said on Saturday, ``[MSAs] \nwill determine the future of Golden Rule, which is seeing steadily \ndeclining sales of individual health insurance policies * * * In its \nrequired annual report to the State, Golden Rule cited reduced revenue\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\nfrom health policies as the reason its net gain after taxes fell to \n$25.8 million in 1995--down 29% from the previous year.''\n  Golden Rule knows that its future depends on a multibillion dollar \ntax giveaway in the form of medical savings accounts. That is why their \nRepublican friends in Congress are trying to force this partisan \nspecial interest proposal into the health reform bill--even at the risk \nof sinking the bill.\n  Let's look at the dishonor roll of Golden Rule policies. Like the \nRepublican plan, MSA policies sound good until you read the fine print. \nHere is a policy offered by Golden Rule in Massachusetts through \nAmericans for Tax Reform. It has no coverage for prenatal care or \npostnatal care. It has no coverage for most preventive services. It \ndoes not cover an emergency room visit unless you are admitted to the \nhospital. It does not even cover outpatient physician services, except \nfor outpatient surgery. It does not cover outpatient prescription \ndrugs. It does not even cover diagnostic tests unless the patient is \nhospitalized within 3 days.\n  Here is another Golden Rule policy, from Virginia. It has all the \nexclusions in the Massachusetts policy and adds even more gaps. There \nis no coverage for mental health. There is no coverage for substance \nabuse. There is no coverage for pregnancy and delivery--none at all. \nAll routine and preventive care is excluded.\n  But even worse than the things Golden Rule explicitly does not cover \nis the things that it will not cover for you if they think you might \nget sick--or if you actually do. Here is what the policy says on page 6 \nof the Massachusetts policy under the heading ``pre-existing \nconditions.'' It says ``Pre-existing conditions will not be covered \nduring the first 12 months after an individual becomes a covered \nperson.'' This sounds reasonable. But listen to the fine print. ``This \nexclusion will not apply to conditions which are both: (a) fully \ndisclosed to Golden Rule in the individual's application; and (b) not \nexcluded or limited by our underwriters.''\n\n  What does this mean? It means that if, in the judgment of Golden \nRule, you have not disclosed a pre-existing condition, they are not \nobligated to cover it after 12 months, and they reserve the option to \nexclude a condition from coverage forever--not just for 12 months. What \ndoes that mean in practice? It means that the protection Golden Rule \npromises is often a sham.\n  Let me read some of the cases of consumers who bought Golden Rule \npolicies, faithfully paid their premiums, and then were told their \ninsurance did not cover them, just when they needed it the most.\n  Daniel Brokaw of Roanoke, VA, was covered under a Golden Rule policy, \nalthough the policy excluded any coverage for care related to Mr. \nBrokaw's Tourette's disorder. Golden Rule also refused to cover Mr. \nBrokaw's 4-year-old son, even with a similar exclusion, because he \noccasionally shook his fist. Golden Rule canceled even this limited \ncoverage when Mr. Brokaw submitted a claim for a broken arm.\n  Louise Mampe of suburban Chicago was diagnosed with breast cancer \nafter having been covered by Golden Rule for 11 months. Golden Rule \ndenied payment for $60,000 of bills and canceled her policy, saying \nthat the breast cancer was a pre-existing condition. Mrs. Mampe had \nfelt a ``bump'' but did not get treatment for years because she did not \nthink it was anything serious--she had been getting similar bumps for \nyears. Golden Rule wrote to Mrs. Mampe's widowed husband, Howard, that \n``Obviously, Mrs. Mampe was the author of her own misfortune.'' Pat \nRooney, head of Golden Rule, himself stated that, ``If my sister \napplied for her own insurance and she knew that she had felt a lump in \nher breast, she is not an insurable risk.''\n  Gwendolyn Hughes of Utah had claims relating to injuries suffered in \nan automobile accident denied because she had failed to list a \ndigestive problem on her Golden Rule insurance application.\n  James Clark of Keithville, LA, was forced to pay for his heart by-\npass surgery after Golden Rule denied his claim, saying he had not \ndisclosed cholesterol and triglyceride levels on his insurance \napplication.\n  Linda Shafer of Ramsey, IN, had her Golden Rule policy canceled after \nshe was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The Golden Rule underwriter said \nMs. Shafer failed to disclose on her application that her hands \nsometimes shook. Ms. Shafer said she thought this was due to the stress \nof going through a divorce, not ``a disorder of the nervous system such \nas epilepsy, convulsion, frequent headaches or mental or nervous \ndisorders'' as listed on the application. ``Since I am not in the \nmedical profession and could not diagnose my symptoms, I didn't even \nconsider that I had any type of nervous disorder,'' she wrote.\n  Sharon Tate of Kansas City, MO, had her claim for removal of a sinus \ncyst denied because Golden Rule said she had to have known about the \nproblem before taking out her policy. A court ruled against Golden Rule \nwhen it found that the company's doctor had not even looked at Ms. \nTate's x-ray, although that was supposedly the justification for the \nclaim denial.\n  Ana Painter of Chesterfield, IL, had her hospital bill relating to \nstem-cell infusion treatment for malignant ovarian cancer rejected on \ngrounds that the treatment was ``experimental.'' Golden Rule filed a \nsuit against Ms. Painter 5 days later--without even waiting for her to \nappeal the decision--asking for a legal ruling that the company did not \nhave to pay the bill. Ms. Painter had to retain a lawyer.\n  James Anderle of Milwaukee, WI, had his claim for medical bills \nresulting from a stroke denied by Golden Rule. Golden Rule claimed Mr. \nAnderle had a pre-existing condition--the flu.\n  Carol Schreul of Aurora, IL, suffered a brain tumor, resulting in \nmedical bills of $39,000. Golden Rule refused to pay, claiming that Ms. \nSchreul misrepresented her health status by listing her weight as 190 \npounds when it was actually 210.\n  Harry Baglayan had his claim for the $49,000 in costs for heart by-\npass rejected. Golden Rule argued that Mr. Baglayan had failed to \ndisclose that he had nausea four months earlier, a pre-existing \ncondition.\n  Golden Rule has adamantly opposed insurance reforms, because they \nknow they cannot compete on a level playing field where these abusive \npractices are outlawed. In Vermont, they vigorously and tenaciously \nopposed insurance reform--and then pulled out of the State when reform \nwas finally enacted. Golden Rule refuses to give information on their \nexperience with MSA's that they currently offer--and it's no wonder, \ngiven what turned up in Vermont.\n  Here is how the State insurance commissioner described what they \nfound when Golden Rule turned over its policies to the Blue Cross plan, \nwhich assumed responsibility for Golden Rule policyholders when it \npulled out of the State.\n       What are the tools of an aggressive underwriter [like \n     Golden Rule]? The first is the initial application form \n     filled out by the consumer. Let me briefly review its scope. \n     Item 15 of the application asks for information about health \n     status over a 10 year period. The questions asked are very \n     broad and refer to any disorder that the applicant may have \n     had. How many of us have not had a headache or diarrhea or a \n     bad stomach ache over the past ten years?\n       Another tool used more aggressively by Golden Rule than by \n     other insurers is the exclusion. This is a limitation placed \n     on the policy to exclude coverage for a particular \n     individual, condition, disease, etc. When Golden Rule \n     withdrew from Vermont, most of its insured elected to become \n     members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont under the \n     safety net program I discussed earlier. As a result, the \n     safety-net program allows unique access to information about \n     the Golden Rule Policies.\n       Of the approximately 5,000 Vermont Golden Rule \n     policyholders who joined the safety-net, approximately 25 \n     percent had some type of exclusion under their Golden Rule \n     policies. In the initial study done by Blue Cross and Blue \n     Shield, 1,024 Golden Rule policies have 1,245 separate \n     exclusions added to their policies.\n       Blue Cross and Blue Shield also compiled a list of more \n     than 81 exclusions used by Golden Rule. These include the \n     exclusion of whole body parts, such as arms, backs, breasts, \n     knees, legs, hands, skin.\n       A particularly disturbing practice of Golden Rule was to \n     selectively underwrite newborn children of individuals \n     holding individual rather than family policies. After \n     providing the 30 day coverage of newborn children mandated by \n     Vermont law, Golden Rule would only extend coverage if the \n     newborn was healthy.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of this letter be entered in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\n\n                                                 State of Vermont,\n\n\n                                        Department of Banking,\n\n                                         Insurance and Securities.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: John D. Dingell, Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight and \n         Investigations.\n     From: Thomas R. Van Cooper, Director of Insurance Regulation.\n     Date: June 27, 1994.\n     Subject: Vermont Health Care Reform Initiatives.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Good morning. My name is Thomas Van Cooper. I am the \n     Director of Insurance Regulation for the state of Vermont. I \n     want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the \n     subcommittee, for the opportunity to discuss Vermont's health \n     insurance reforms. In particular, the requirements that \n     health insurers use community rating and that they guarantee \n     acceptance of all applicants, in the small group (1-49 \n     employees) market as of July 1, 1992, and in the individual \n     market as of July 1, 1993. I understand that the committee is \n     interested in Golden Rule Insurance Company. Many of the \n     issues surrounding Golden Rule, regarding both its conduct \n     and its positions on health insurance, can probably be best \n     addressed by reviewing more generally the issues Vermont \n     faced in its individual and small group markets.\n       An important finance issue that Vermont confronted in its \n     effort to obtain health care reform involved the impact of \n     insurers employing aggressive underwriting techniques that \n     either explicitly excluded some Vermonters from the \n     marketplace or effectively did so by pricing such individuals \n     out of the marketplace. The cost of care for individuals \n     forced out of the marketplace is borne by other taxpayers and \n     insureds, whether through tax based social programs or by \n     less easily identified shifts of uninsured and underinsured \n     costs to the private insurance marketplace. Since Vermont had \n     a social contract to provide health care to all citizens \n     regardless of their ability to pay, it needed a fair \n     insurance mechanism for financing health care.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Did insurers leave the state as a result of the reforms? \n     Sure, some chose to leave, including Golden Rule. However, \n     other insurers took their place, recognizing the opportunity \n     to do business and make a fair profit in Vermont. Today \n     Vermont has 17 carriers competing in the small group market \n     and 9 carriers in the individual market. Now that may not \n     sound like a lot, but Vermont only has 560,000 citizens and \n     in fact, we now have more carriers actively competing for \n     business than before the reform measures. More significantly, \n     we now have much more capacity, since every one of these \n     carriers will take all comers. I have attached a list of the \n     companies doing business and some of the prices for products \n     they are selling. See Attachment D.\n       In sum, the reforms in Vermont have been a success. The \n     consumer can have confidence in a stable and rationale \n     marketplace in which coverage is guaranteed and available at \n     a fair price. In fact, prices are low, and competition among \n     insurers for business is high. During the legislative debate, \n     the HIAA and Golden Rule rolled out their actuaries and \n     experts to explain why the reforms would not work. But rather \n     than fall prey to the numbers game in which one actuary \n     battles another, we relied on common sense and looked to the \n     definition of insurance for guidance. Insurance is not about \n     risk avoidance. It is about the pooling of risk.\n\n\n                              golden rule\n\n       Before discussing Golden Rule and its behavior in Vermont, \n     I want to state that the company did not violate any Vermont \n     laws by its conduct. I believe that its underwriting \n     practices, however, were instrumental in creating the support \n     that led to the passage of reform legislation in Vermont that \n     rendered its type of underwriting illegal.\n       What are the tools of an aggressive underwriter? The first \n     is the initial application form filled out by a consumer. I \n     have attached a copy of a Golden Rule form. See Attachment E. \n     Let me briefly review its scope. Item 15 of the application \n     asks for information about health status over a ten-year \n     period. The questions asked are very broad and refer to any \n     disorder that the applicant may have had. How many of us have \n     not had a headache or diarrhea or a bad stomach ache over the \n     past ten years?\n       Another tool used more extensively by Golden Rule than by \n     other insurers is the exclusion. This is a limitation placed \n     on the policy to exclude coverage for a particular \n     individual, condition, disease, etc. When Golden Rule \n     withdrew from Vermont, most of its insureds elected to become \n     members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont under the \n     safety-net program I discussed earlier. As a result, the \n     safety-net program allows unique access to information about \n     Golden Rule policies.\n       Of the approximately 5,000 Vermont Golden Rule coverage \n     policyholders who joined the safety-net, approximately 25 \n     percent of them had some type of exclusion under their Golden \n     Rule policies. In an initial study done by Blue Cross and \n     Blue Shield, 1,024 Golden Rule policyholders had 1,245 \n     separate exclusions added to their policies. I have attached \n     some examples of these policy exclusions. See Attachment F. I \n     will review a few of them.\n       Subscriber B applied for health insurance from Golden Rule \n     on September 18, 1991. The subscriber had been treated by a \n     physician in June of 1991 for bumps on the skin that were \n     determined to be fatty deposits of no concern. Golden Rule \n     excluded any loss incurred resulting from any form of tumor \n     or tumorous growth, including complications therefrom or \n     operation therefor. The exclusion was in force at the time \n     Golden Rule terminated coverage on November 1, 1992.\n       Subscriber C also treated with aspiration of fluid in \n     benign cysts located in breasts. Golden Rule excluded any \n     loss incurred resulting from any disease or disorder of the \n     breasts, including complications therefor. This included any \n     reconstructive surgery or complications of reconstruction \n     surgery. The exclusion was in force at the time Golden Rule \n     terminated coverage on July 19, 1993.\n       Subscriber F applied for health insurance from Golden Rule \n     on January 15, 1992. The subscriber, a self-employed \n     commercial painting contractor, indicated no experience with \n     back problems. Golden Rule excluded any loss incurred \n     resulting from any injury to, disease or disorder of the \n     spinal column, including vertebrae, intervertebral discs, \n     spinal cord, nerves, surrounding ligaments and muscles, \n     including complications therefrom or operation therefor. The \n     exclusion was in force at the time Golden Rule terminated \n     coverage on March 1, 1993.\n       Blue Cross and Blue Shield also compiled a list of more \n     than 81 exclusions used by Golden Rule. These include the \n     exclusion of whole body parts, such as arms, backs, breasts, \n     hips, knees, legs, hands, skin, testes and so on. I think the \n     list speaks for itself. See Attachment G.\n       A particularly disturbing practice of Golden Rule was to \n     selectively underwrite newborn children of individuals \n     holding individual rather than family policies. After \n     providing the 30 day coverage of newborn children mandated by \n     Vermont law, Golden Rule would only extend coverage if the \n     newborn was healthy.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Community rating and guarantee issuance represent good \n     social policy, good insurance policy and good business \n     policy. The Vermont legislature quickly saw through the self-\n     interested doomsday prophesies of the commercial industry \n     about radical price increases and the destruction of \n     Vermont's insurance market, and instead recognized that there \n     was no reason insurers could not make a fair profit playing \n     on a level playing field, where they could compete on the \n     quality of service they provided and the management of costs \n     rather than the avoidance of risk. Vermont consumers need no \n     longer worry about whether they will be able to have access \n     to this essential product.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, these shameful practices are not unique \nto Vermont. In Kentucky, consumer complaints against Golden Rule were \ntwice as high as against other companies. In New Hampshire, where no \nsystematic survey was done, a State legislator reported his son had a \nfoot injury as a small child and Golden Rule's coverage of him as a \nyoung adult excludes everything on the right leg before the knee. In \nFlorida, the insurance department reported that Golden Rule's rate \nincreases exceeded those of other carriers by a wide margin. People \nwere insured at a low rate when they were healthy, and then their \npremiums were raised through the roof when they became sick. And \nConsumer Reports ranked Golden Rule near the bottom in a nationwide \nsurvey of insurance companies.\n  No wonder Golden Rule wants medical savings accounts. They can only \ncompete when the rules of the game are rigged against consumers. They \ncan only profit by perverting insurance into a method of taking premium \ndollars from the healthy and avoiding paying benefits to the sick. The \nAmerican public is coming to understand why a company like Golden Rule \nfavors medical savings accounts, and why they have no place in \nlegislation that is designed to make health insurance work better for \nconsumers, not worse.\n  I have placed into the Record editorials from a number of leading \nnewspapers around the country pointing out the dangers of medical \nsavings accounts and urging the passage of a bipartisan insurance \nreform bill without this poison pill. The editorials included the \nWashington Post, May 8, 1996, ``Dubious Crusade for Medical Savings \nAccounts''; the Los Angeles Times, June 6, 1996, ``U.S. Deserves This \nHealth Reform''; the New York Times, May 30, 1996, ``Mr. Dole's Health-\nCare Task''; the Dallas Morning News, April 21, 1996, ``No Cure-All, \nMedical savings accounts present a flawed solution''; the Baltimore \nSun, April 25, 1996, ``Another Chance for health care reform''; the \nWashington Post, June 3, 1996, ``Senator Dole's Final Business''; the \nNews Tribune (Tacoma, WA), June 13, 1996, Stick to Basics in New Health \nBill''; the San Francisco Chronicle, June 10, 1996, ``Health Care \nReform/Key Test for Dole''; the Harrisburg Patriot, April 3, 1996, \n``Too Much Reform''; the Columbus Dispatch, June 12, 1996, `` `Clean'\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nHealth Bill; Get Rid of Those Two Killer Amendments''.\n  Today, I would like to place additional editorials in the Record \ndemonstrating the broad public opposition to MSA's and the desire for \npeople across the country for passage of a clean, bipartisan insurance \nreform bill.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, June 17, 1996]\n\n           Pointless Stalemate Halts Health-Insurance Reform\n\n       The near demise of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health-insurance \n     bill shows how little Congress now cares about solving the \n     real-life problems of millions of working Americans.\n       The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, a modest piece of legislation, \n     would allow people moving from one job to another the right \n     to transfer their insurance coverage and provide more \n     protection for individuals with pre-existing medical \n     conditions. It is an incremental step toward broadening and \n     stabilizing health care access.\n       At one time, the bill's enactment was cheered on by both \n     Democrats and Republicans. President Clinton endorsed the \n     bill in his State of the Union address. The Senate passed it \n     unanimously; the House's version sailed through too.\n       Now, this plan is about to be sacrificed to politics of the \n     crassest sort. Both Sens. Edward Kennedy and Nancy Kassebaum \n     were adamant from the beginning that their bill would win \n     passage only if it were limited to the noncontroversial \n     portability and pre-existing provisions. And yet, both Senate \n     and House versions were eventually loaded with dubious \n     amendments.\n       After weeks of negotiations, most of those add-ons have \n     been stripped off. Now, medical savings accounts (MSAs) \n     allowed in the House version but not in the Senate bill \n     remain the heart of the controversy.\n       Kennedy, a strong opponent of the MSA concept, will agree \n     only to a pilot program to test the impact of MSAs on health-\n     insurance rates. The Republicans, however, insist on making \n     MSAs available immediately to roughly 30 million Americans \n     working in small businesses, with all others becoming \n     eligible in 2000 unless Congress votes to stop the expansion. \n     The Clinton administration opposes immediate, broad MSA \n     implementation.\n       The MSA issue is highly controversial and has nothing to do \n     with insurance reform. Some claim these tax-free savings \n     accounts will help control overall health-care spending. \n     Others argue MSAs would siphon healthy people out of the \n     traditional insurance market, thereby leaving sicker people \n     with higher insurance premiums.\n       Congress will have every opportunity to wrestle with MSAs \n     in coming months; the issue could even pop up in the \n     presidential campaign. If MSAs are good innovations, Congress \n     can pass them on a separate track.\n       There is absolutely no reason to hold the Kennedy-Kassebaum \n     bill hostage to MSAs. Let a good, widely supported insurance-\n     reform measure pass standing alone.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 1, 1996]\n\n                   Revive the Health Insurance Debate\n\n       President Bill Clinton's promise to put health insurance \n     issues back on the national agenda, perhaps during his re-\n     election campaign, is welcome. Since Congress killed his \n     initial health-care proposal, the president has shied away \n     from the issue even though the ranks of uninsured Americans \n     have eclipsed the 40-million mark.\n       Voter concern about health costs is high, judging from \n     findings of a Louis Harris survey commissioned by the Robert \n     Wood Johnson Foundation. The survey included separate polls \n     in 15 cities, including St. Louis, as well as a national \n     poll.\n       Though giving managed care high marks for containing \n     medical costs, 90 percent of St. Louisians predict \n     nevertheless that their own out-of-pocket costs for medical \n     expenses will continue to rise. Moreover, they expect \n     taxpayers to pay more than they do now to cover medical costs \n     for the elderly and the indigent. Another 44 percent express \n     worry about being hit with expensive medical bills that their \n     health insurance won't cover.\n       Overall, the views of the 300 St. Louis households in the \n     survey mirrored those of the 605 households in the national \n     sample. St. Louisians did have more misgivings about health \n     care in some key areas. Only 40 percent, compared to 48 \n     percent in the national sample, felt that managed care would \n     improve the quality of health care. Another 45 percent \n     reported worrying that they won't be able to pay for nursing-\n     home care when they or a family member needed it, compared \n     with 38 percent in the national sample.\n       Some of these numbers suggest that Congress is tackling the \n     wrong health-insurance issues. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to \n     protect health benefits of workers who change jobs or face a \n     serious illness is a good one. A House bill also includes \n     these provisions, along with the misguided plan to give \n     Americans the choice of opening so-called medical savings \n     accounts to cover some of their health expenses.\n       In fact, these accounts generally would give tax breaks to \n     wealthy Americans, who need them least; moreover, the \n     accounts would do nothing to help the uninsured, \n     notwithstanding claims by GOP leaders. If many working \n     Americans are too poor to buy health insurance, what makes \n     the party think these workers would be able to put aside \n     money for a medical savings account?\n       The Harris poll results show that voters deserve some \n     plausible answers to this question. They also deserve to know \n     what each party intends to do not only to protect the health \n     benefits of the insured but to extend benefits to those who \n     are not.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 7, 1996]\n\n Modest or Revolutionary? The Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Legislation May \n                                Be Both\n\n       Depending on who is doing the talking, the Kennedy-\n     Kassebaum health reform proposal is either so minimalist it \n     is meaningless, or so enormous it's revolutionary.\n       Both assertions may be true.\n       On the face of it, the bill makes it legally possible for \n     people to change jobs or lose their job and still maintain \n     health coverage. The bill, separate versions of which have \n     passed the House and Senate, ensures that workers who change \n     jobs will not have to wait around for years before being \n     covered under their new employers' insurer.\n       Gone would be exclusions based on pre-existing medical \n     conditions. Also, workers who lose their jobs or move to new \n     jobs without health benefits would be guaranteed the \n     opportunity to purchase an individual policy through their \n     previous insurer.\n       The bill does not cap premiums, however, so it is possible \n     that the individual coverage that is legally available may be \n     financially out of reach, particularly for people with a pre-\n     existing condition.\n       The Kennedy-Kassebaum tinkering could free millions of \n     people who are currently in job-lock because of their \n     dependence on health coverage. And it opens up the insurance \n     pool to millions more who are now closed out due to some \n     illness. But because of the costs involved, it seems unlikely \n     that it would have much of an impact on the 40 million \n     Americans without coverage.\n       That's why many analysts consider it all but insignificant.\n       Those who believe the contrary, that this proposal is \n     revolutionary, do not think the bill itself will turn the \n     world upside down. Rather, they believe that it will lead \n     inexorably to massive government involvement in writing the \n     rules for health care.\n       In their scenario, throwing coverage open to sick people \n     will learn to sharply higher premiums and result in a public \n     backlash. Voters will turn up the heat on Congress to further \n     regulate the insurance market. What started out as a \n     piecemeal reform will, in the long-run, lead to systemic \n     change.\n       We do not imagine that the 100 senators who voted in favor \n     of the bill foresee revolution as a consequence. But even if \n     that analysis is on target, it does not argue against the \n     proposal.\n       Everyone agrees that being sick should not preclude an \n     individual from obtaining health coverage. Indeed, sick \n     people have the most immediate need for insurance. If it is \n     impossible for the nation's health-care system to extend \n     coverage to that group, then there is something deeply wrong \n     with the system.\n       If the bill sponsored by Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum \n     and Massachusetts Democrat Edward M. Kennedy plugs the hole, \n     great. If it exposes a more widespread problem. Congress \n     should be grateful for the knowledge and then move to fix it.\n       All that said, and despite the massive bipartisan support \n     for the bill, it is not a sure thing. The conference \n     committee must first deal with three potential deal-breakers.\n       The House version includes tax-exemption for Medical \n     Savings Accounts, which are sort of a health-care IRA, and \n     for a cap on medical malpractice awards. If these measures \n     find their way into the final bill, President Clinton has \n     threatened a veto. The Senate version includes a requirement \n     to raise the caps on mental health treatment to provide the \n     same lifetime limits as other forms of treatment. Many in the \n     business community fear the cost ramifications of this \n     proposal.\n       We have mixed feelings about the three proposals--thumbs \n     down on Medical Savings Accounts, proceed cautiously with \n     malpractice reform, thumbs up for treatment parity--but we \n     don't believe any of them should be allowed to block passage \n     of the more modest first step originally promised by Kennedy-\n     Kassebaum.\n       Whether it's a revolution or a tentative first step, it's \n     the most Congress has been able to manage and the least the \n     American public deserves.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 22, 1996]\n\n                     White House Waffling on Health\n\n       The White House and Congressional Republicans are \n     negotiating over the G.O.P.'s demand to include medical \n     savings accounts as part of healthcare reform. The White \n     House once threatened to veto a bill that included these \n     accounts. But now it is merely quibbling over details. The \n     Administration needs to regain its sense of principle. The \n     fight over medical savings accounts goes to the heart of the \n     health-care debate. No one can say for sure what damage the \n     accounts would cause. But they threaten to divide rich from \n     poor, healthy from sick, young from old.\n       The Republicans propose to permit families who buy \n     catastrophic coverage--policies with high deductibles--to \n     make tax-free deposits to a savings account. The account\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\n     would be used to pay routine bills. Savings could be \n     withdrawn after age 59\\1/2\\ and taxed as ordinary income.\n       Proponents say the accounts would discourage waste because \n     initial outlays would come from personal savings. The \n     accounts would also provide coverage without herding people \n     into managed care or government coverage. But critics point \n     out that the accounts will appeal mostly to wealthy people \n     because they can afford steep deductibles, and healthy people \n     because they can expect to save money on a tax-free basis. \n     The accounts would encourage healthy people to split off from \n     traditional coverage, leaving the chronically ill to buy \n     coverage at sky-high rates.\n       Yet good health can be transitory, giving holders of \n     medical savings accounts a false security. Once they become \n     ill, they may regret having given up traditional coverage. \n     Indeed, they may try to manipulate the system by hopping back \n     into traditional coverage when they expect large bills. The \n     better alternative is for all Americans to buy coverage \n     together, creating a vast pool of customers that will \n     guarantee affordable premiums for everyone regardless of \n     medical condition.\n       The Administration understands the problem, but wants to \n     walk into November having signed a health-care bill. It is \n     covering its tracks by saying that all it is negotiating is a \n     pilot program. But the Republicans plan to offer the accounts \n     to tens of millions of employees at small businesses. After \n     three years, Congress will be asked to make the accounts \n     permanent and universal.\n       It is thus highly likely that today's experiment will \n     become tomorrow's permanent program. The vast majority of \n     Americans are healthy. Because they will profit from a \n     medical savings account, at least in the short term, they \n     will resist any effort by Congress to strip them of their \n     tax-free benefit. A true test of the savings accounts would \n     be limited in size and require at least six years--enough \n     time to observe what happens when sizable numbers of account-\n     holders become chronically ill. A valid test would also \n     experiment with different formulations in order to test what \n     plan works best.\n       In 1993, the White House stood for the principle of \n     covering every American through common insurance pools. That \n     was a fine principle, even if the legislation it proposed \n     proved to be a medical monstrosity and a political albatross. \n     Now the Administration seems to be heading in the opposite \n     direction, where fortunate individuals take care of \n     themselves and leave others to do as best they can.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Seattle Times stated on June 17,\n\n       There is absolutely no reason to hold the Kennedy-Kassebaum \n     bill hostage to MSAs. Let a good widely supported insurance \n     reform measure pass standing alone.\n\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said on June 1,\n\n       The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to protect health benefits of \n     workers who change jobs or face a serious illness is a good \n     one. A House bill also includes these provisions, along with \n     the misguided plan to give Americans the choice of opening \n     so-called medical savings accounts to cover some of their \n     health expenses. In fact, these accounts would give tax \n     breaks to wealthy Americans, who need them least; moreover, \n     the accounts would do nothing to help the uninsured, \n     notwithstanding claims by GOP leaders. If many working \n     Americans are too poor to buy health insurance, what makes \n     the party think these workers would be able to put aside \n     money for a medical savings account?\n\n  The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said on May 7,\n\n       Thumbs down on Medical Savings accounts . . . [They] should \n     not be allowed to block passage of . . . Kennedy-Kassebaum.''\n  The Star-Ledger of Newark, NJ, said on May 29,\n\n       Kennedy-Kassebaum was supposed to guarantee that workers \n     can take their employee health benefits with them when they \n     are downsized, out-sourced, or otherwise put out of a job. \n     Since then, a horde of amendments have been added . . . Some \n     are bad, such as the proposal for medical savings accounts, a \n     new tax shelter for the wealthy. None of them . . . should \n     have been tagged on to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, and you \n     have to wonder whether some of those supporting these add-ons \n     might not be out to sink the measure under the weight of the \n     amendments.\n\n  The St. Petersburg Times said on June 11,\n\n       Dole claims to support the major provisions of the \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation . . . However, Dole and other \n     Republicans have insisted on weighing the bill down with a \n     provision that would create tax-deductible Medical Savings \n     Accounts--a radical plan to subsidize wealthy taxpayers that \n     could threaten the solvency of insurance plans for less \n     affluent Americans.\n\n  And just last Saturday, the New York Times wrote,\n\n       The fight over medical savings accounts goes to the heart \n     of the health care debate. No one can say for sure what \n     damage the accounts would cause. But they are threatening to \n     divide rich from poor, healthy from sick, young from old.\n\n  These editorials are just a sampling of commentary around the Nation. \nThere is no clamor for medical savings accounts, except from the \nspecial interests who see yet another opportunity to profit at the \nexpense of people who need medical care. Indeed, responsible voices \nthroughout the country urge rejection of this dangerous and untested \nidea. It is time for Republicans to stop playing special interest \npolitics with health insurance reform. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \npassed by a bipartisan vote of 100 to 0. It should not be blocked \nbecause some Republicans want to line the pockets of their campaign \ncontributors. Health insurance reform is too important to become just \nanother election year casualty of extremist Republican political \ntactics.\n  Mr. President, the MSA's are a golden lifeboat for Golden Rule's \nsinking ship. If we have ever had a classic bailout for private special \ninterests, this is it. This is not what I am saying here tonight. It is \nwhat the hometown newspaper of Golden Rule, a conservative newspaper, \nhas described it as, and in the meantime, the Republican leadership is \nrefusing to let us get what has been agreed on, a bipartisan program \nsigned by the President of the United States into law, because we are \nbeing held hostage to Golden Rule Insurance Co. That is the fact of the \nmatter. Of course, they want their hand in the Federal Treasury. Of \ncourse, they want the American taxpayers to bail them out. Who would \nnot, with declining sales in this market, and you can understand why \nthey have declining sales.\n  It is time for Republicans to stop playing special interest politics \nwith health insurance reform. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill passed by a \nbipartisan vote of 100 to nothing. It should not be blocked because \nsome Republicans want to line their pockets with campaign \ncontributions. Health insurance reform is too important to become just \nanother election year issue.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we are going to be able to see that this \nlegislation is passed. We welcome the opportunity, as we did last \nFriday and this evening, to point out the flaws both of the companies \nthat have been receiving and would receive the benefits from this \neffective tax giveaway.\n  The Joint Economic Committee estimated that if there was going to be \na million Americans who were going to participate in this program, the \ncosts to the Federal Treasury in 10 years is $3 billion--for 1 million \npeople. And you have 120 million Americans who are working and you have \ntheir family members. The Republican proposals would include all the \ncompanies with employees of less than 100, some 47 million working, a \nthird of all Americans, in a program that is untested, untried. You can \nimagine what that would mean in terms of opening up the Federal \nTreasury.\n  There is no justification, there is no rationale, there is no reason, \nthere is no meaning to deny 25 million Americans who have these \npreexisting conditions the protection that they need and their families \ndeserve. We have a responsibility to do it. We have developed \nbipartisan legislation. Release the hold that these insurance companies \nhave on the Republican leadership and let us do something decent for \nthe American people and for hard-working families across this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/24/senate-section/article/S6754-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
