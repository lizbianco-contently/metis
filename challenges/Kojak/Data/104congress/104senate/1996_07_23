Mr. President, I hope that the Chair at this time will \nadvise the Senate of the procedures agreed to. As I understand the \nprocedures, we will have a series of 24 or more rollcall\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nvotes. The first rollcall will be 15 minutes and then 10 minutes on all \nthereafter, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has stated that correctly.\n  The able Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 1 minute.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4905\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment's purpose is to send a \nsimple, clear message, which is that the taxpayers' money should not be \nspent to increase the number of people on welfare.\n  Six years ago, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration \nto increase participation in the SSI Program. Since then, the cost has \nsoared and the number of enrollees has more than tripled. Now it is \ntime to send a message that this effort should stop. Nothing is more \nindicative of an out-of-control welfare system than this practice of \nusing taxpayers' dollars to increase the number of people on welfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the point of order and pass \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina. What this amendment simply does is to say \nthat people who are on SSI, or who might qualify under SSI, under the \nlaw, do not have the right to be informed about their options.\n  Certainly, we do not encourage soliciting people to join the SSI \nProgram. But the Faircloth amendment goes further than that, in our \nopinion. Therefore, we think the basic right of information, the \npeople's right to know, a legitimate service to answer proper inquiries \nshould be kept in place. We think that the amendment offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina goes far beyond what his supposed intent \nis.\n  Therefore, we have raised a point of order and we hope the point of \norder will be sustained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 5 seconds?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for just 30 seconds?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did we use on the first amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute over.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. According to the unanimous-consent agreement, we are on \n10 minutes now for the amendments, and let me just name the next four, \nso Senators involved will know kind of where they are. Senator Harkin \nis next on child nutrition, Senator D'Amato on work requirements, \nSenator Simon on education work exemptions, and then Senator Feinstein \non immigration.\n  I thank you for yielding. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a 10-second \nunanimous-consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Laureen Lazarovici, a \nfellow in my office, have the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4916\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment would simply continue a \nsmall program that provides assistance to help start and expand school \nbreakfast and summer food programs for low-income kids. This is \ndirectly related to education. When these kids come in to school, they \ncan have breakfast in the morning; they can receive meals in the summer \nwhen school is out--but only if there is a school breakfast or summer \nfood program locally. That is why the start-up and expansion grants are \nso important.\n  Also, I want to say that this amendment does not prevent the \nnutrition portion of this bill from meeting the 6-year budget \ninstruction. The Ag Committee's portion of the bill reduces spending by \n$570 million more than its instruction. This program will spend only \n$39 million for grants over 6 years, but it is a vitally important \nprogram.\n  This amendment is supported by the American School Food Service \nAssociation, the Food Research and Action Center, and the Children's \nDefense Fund. I ask you not to cut a program that gets kids into school \nand gets them learning. It is directly related to education, and we do \nnot have to cut other programs to continue this one because the Ag \nCommittee has more than enough money to pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I rise in opposition to this amendment. It has been almost \nuniversally opposed, first of all. The issue the Senator from Iowa \nwishes to strike appears in President Clinton's most recent welfare \nreform proposal. Likewise, the reform which we try to bring about in \nthis bill was in the minority leader's reconciliation bill. The reason \nis that four out of every five low-income children attend school with a \nbreakfast program. The program has expanded very rapidly. It is not \nclear that expansion funds would have a marginal effect. The amendment \nthat we are considering reduces savings by $112 million. This means, if \nSenator Harkin's amendment is adopted, we will have to find the savings \nprobably in some other nutrition programs. I find that unacceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second on the motion to table.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 213 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kassebaum\n       \n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 4916) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4927\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork, Senator D'Amato, is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment will really strengthen the \nwork requirements in this bill. It says very clearly if we want to \nchange welfare as we know it, this is the way to do it, because it will \nrequire that those able-bodied recipients be required to report for a \njob. If there is no job in the private sector available, if they are \nnot into job training, then community service. There are parks to be \ncleaned and roads to be repaired and there is work in hospitals.\n  It was no less than Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said it best. He \nsaid if people stay on welfare for prolonged periods of time, it \nadministers a narcotic to their spirit. This dependence on welfare \nundermines their humanity, makes them wards of the State.\n  That is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He cared about people, working \npeople. He wanted to see to it that people had help when they truly \nneeded it, but he understood welfare could become entrapping and a \nnarcotic. Community service is something that will give pride to people \nwho need assistance.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have no one on this side who has sought \ntime to speak against the amendment. Therefore, I yield our time to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska. We need \nthis amendment because the bill provides that even able-bodied people \ncould not work for up to 2 years, and there is no reason that if a \nprivate sector job is not available and if someone is not in job \ntraining or in school that an able-bodied person should not be offered \nand should not be required to accept a community service position.\n  So this is a very needed amendment. It is the same amendment which I \noffered along with Senator Dole last September, and I hope it gets not \nonly a strong vote in the Senate, but I hope that this time it is \nretained in conference and is not dropped in conference the way it was \nlast time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4928), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 233, strike line 15, and all that follows \n     through line 13 on page 235, and insert the following:\n       ``Limitation on education activities counted as work.--For \n     purposes of determining monthly participation rates under \n     paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(B)(i) of subsection (b), not \n     more than 30 percent of adults in all families and in 2-\n     parent families determined to be engaged in work in the State \n     for a month may meet the work activity requirement through \n     participation in educational training.\n       ``(5) Single parent with child under age 6 deemed to be \n     meeting work participation requirements if parent is engaged \n     in work for 20 hours per week.--For purposes of determining \n     monthly participation rates under subsection (b)(1)(B)(i), a \n     recipient in a 1-parent family who is the parent of a child \n     who has not attained 6 years of age is deemed to be engaged \n     in work for a month if the recipient is engaged in work for \n     an average of at least 20 hours per week during the month.\n       ``(6) Teen head of household who maintains satisfactory \n     school attendance deemed to be meeting work participation \n     requirements.--For purposes of determining monthly \n     participation rates under subsection (b)(1)(B)(i), a \n     recipient who is a single head of household and has not \n     attained 20 years of age is deemed to be engaged in work for \n     a month in a fiscal year if the recipient--\n       ``(A) maintains satisfactory attendance at secondary school \n     or the equivalent during the month; or\n       ``(B) participates in education directly related to \n     employment for at least the minimum average number of hours \n     per week specified in the table set forth in paragraph (1).\n       ``(d) Work Activities Defined.--As used in this section, \n     the term `work activities' means--\n       ``(1) unsubsidized employment;\n       ``(2) subsidized private sector employment;\n       ``(3) subsidized public sector employment;\n       ``(4) work experience (including work associated with the \n     refurbishing of publicly assisted housing) if sufficient \n     private sector employment is not available;\n       ``(5) on-the-job training;\n       ``(6) job search and job readiness assistance;\n       ``(7) community service programs;\n       ``(8) educational training (not to exceed 24 months with \n     respect to any individual);''.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I believe this may be adopted by voice \nvote. It is cosponsored by Senators Murray, Specter, Jeffords, and Bob \nKerrey. The bill without this amendment says States can get credit \nabove the age of 50 only for vocational education. The reality is for \nmany people learning how to read and write, getting that high school \nequivalency is at least equally important. This permits that \npossibility.\n  I know of no objection to the amendment. I hope it can be adopted by \nvoice vote.\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. EXON. There is no objection on this side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we agree to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4928), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4929\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the next amendment is the Feinstein \namendment. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, will be \nresponding on our side. It is an important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized to \nspeak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill as drafted would remove from \nSSI, from AFDC, and from Medicaid, everyone legally in this country \nthat happens to be a newcomer. It is retroactive in that respect.\n  The amendment that Senator Boxer and I put forward would make this \nprospective. Every newcomer coming into the country after September 1 \nwould not be able to count on any welfare benefits until they became a \ncitizen, which generally takes about 5 years.\n  This is a huge item. In my State alone, it would affect more than 1 \nmillion people. Thousands of them are refugees. They have no sponsors. \nThey are aged, they are blind, they are disabled, they are children. \nThis would immediately throw them off of whatever assistance they have, \nwith no other recourse. Los Angeles County alone estimates the cost is \n$500 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 minute has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first off, this amendment would cost \nabout a quarter of the savings in the bill. It is about a $15 billion \nadditional cost added to this bill. But on substantive ground, this is \nsimilar to the vote we took last week on the Graham amendment. What \nthis underlying bill did, what the Democratic substitute did, what the \nbill that passed here in the Senate last time did was say that sponsors \nhave to live up to their contractual obligations. They signed a \ndocument saying they would provide for people that come to this \ncountry. People come to this country and sign a document saying they \nwould not become wards of the State. What is happening is that millions \nof people are coming to this country, bringing moms and dads over. They \nare coming into this country and going down to the SSI office and \nqualifying for SSI benefits and you and the taxpayers of this country \nare picking up and being the retirement home for the rest of the world. \nThat is not what this program should be about. What we do is take care \nof refugees. If they come, they have a 5-year period where they qualify \nfor all of the benefits. That is more than fair. Sponsors should pay \nwhat they say they are going to pay.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for 5 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is a waiver of the Budget Act. You are waiving 15 \nbillion dollars' worth of savings. I do not believe you ought to waive \nthe Budget Act for $15 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected and the amendment \nfalls.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4933 to Amendment No. 4931\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this legislation is welfare reform. We \ndropped out the changes in Medicaid, and we are told that this is not a \nMedicaid bill. Yet, this bill permits the States not only to drop \neligibility levels for cash assistance--AFDC--but also for Medicaid. \nThe States can throw a woman and small children off cash assistance and \nat the same time take away their Medicaid, their only chance for any \nmedical services.\n  My amendment says, go ahead, if you wish, reduce eligibility levels \nfor welfare, but Medicaid eligibility levels should remain as they are \ntoday.\n  Furthermore, what constitutes income in calculating Medicaid \neligibility remains as it is now. In other words, if my amendment is \nnot adopted, States will be able to count school lunches and even \ndisaster relief toward what makes a person eligible for Medicaid.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I just say to our colleagues that if you \nwant to continue mothers and children further to be eligible for \nMedicaid, you have to support this amendment. By opposing this \namendment, you are saying to mothers and children in the future that \nyou are going to be taken off, or could be taken off, Medicaid and \nhealth benefits without any further insurance. I think that is wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Rhode Island has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I point out that what we have before us is \nthe Chafee perfecting amendment. This perfecting amendment only makes a \ntechnical change in the basic Chafee amendment. I have no objection to \nthat technical amendment. In fact, I would have been willing to accept \nthe perfecting amendment on a voice vote. But, since he has gotten the \nyeas and nays, I urge everybody to vote aye on the technical change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

The question now occurs on the Roth amendment \nNo. 4932, with 2 minutes being equally divided. The Senator from \nDelaware [Mr. Roth] is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to ensure \ncontinued Medicaid coverage to all individuals currently receiving \nMedicaid benefits because of their eligibility through the current AFDC \nbenefits. This will ensure that no child or adult currently receiving \nMedicaid benefits would lose coverage because of welfare reform.\n  My amendment also provides for 1 year of transitional Medicaid \nbenefits. This guarantees that families leaving welfare will continue \nto receive Medicaid coverage for a full year to help in the critical \ntransition from welfare to work. The problem with the Chafee-Breaux \namendment is that it would force the States to maintain current \neligibility standards indefinitely into the future. That means that \nsomeone, 5 or 10 years from now, may not qualify under a State's new \nwelfare program but nevertheless would claim eligibility under the old \nprogram. This creates serious issues of equity.\n  The Governors are deeply concerned about the Chafee-Breaux approach, \nas it would be burdensome to administer.\n  I urge the adoption of the Roth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we should oppose the Roth amendment because \nit negates the Chafee-Breaux amendment that was just agreed to. I yield \nthe remainder of the time to Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if you voted yes on the Chafee amendment \nwe just agreed to, then you should vote no on the Roth amendment. The \nRoth amendment allows States to drastically reduce Medicaid coverage \nfor all groups of women and children. If the Roth amendment prevails \nand we strike the protections that we just adopted in my amendment, the \nRoth amendment grandfathers only those AFDC-eligible individuals who \nare enrolled in Medicaid at the time of enactment. There are no \nprotections for those who meet the same standards after the enactment.\n  Second, it strikes the provisions in my amendment that reinstate the \nstandard for calculating income. Thus, a pregnant woman or 6-year-old \nchild with a family income below the current poverty standards will not \nqualify for Medicaid coverage if the State adopts a more restrictive \nincome test, such as school lunches or food stamps.\n  Finally, I would say the United States has the highest percentage of \nchildren in poverty of any industrial nation in the world. I certainly \nhope we will not make it worse by denying these children their Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The yeas and nays have \nnot been ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, point of order. The Senate is not in order. \nThis is an important amendment. Senator Conrad should be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I make a point of order again, the Senate \nis still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators having conversations will take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan \namendment about feeding hungry people. This has always been a \nbipartisan priority in this Chamber. The father of the Food Assistance \nProgram is Senator Dole, the former Republican leader, and former \nSenator George McGovern.\n  Our amendment, a bipartisan amendment, preserves the most important\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\nfeature of our Food Assistance Program. It maintains the automatic \nadjustment in funding to respond to economic downturns or natural \ndisasters. A pure block grant would leave States with a fixed amount of \nmoney no matter what happens.\n  If we look at the example of Florida, we see very clearly what can \nhappen. They had a flat demand for food assistance. Then we had a \nnational recession, and demand for food assistance increased \ndramatically. Then there was a natural disaster, Hurricane Andrew, and \nthe demand for food assistance exploded. Under the pure block grant, \nthat State would have had no ability to respond to the demand for food \nassistance.\n  No block grant could have responded to this increase in need. The \nblock grant would destroy the Food Stamp Program.\n  Mr. President, America is better than that. This Senate is better \nthan that. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], \nis recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we oppose this amendment for a couple of \nreasons. First, the Conrad amendment requires a $1 billion cut in food \nstamps. This is a $1 billion reduction in food stamps to pay for this \nprovision.\n  Second, we set very high standards for States to qualify to get into \nthese block grants. They have to have a low error rate of 6 percent. \nThere are only seven States that can qualify with that error rate.\n  Third, they have to have electronic benefits. Only four States \nqualify.\n  The Senator from North Dakota would lead Members to believe all these \nGovernors and State legislatures do not know what they are getting into \nby opting for a block grant, that they do not see economic recessions \nand disasters. In fact, they understand the risks they are taking when \nthey offer a block grant.\n  We want to give them the option to do it, but set a very high \nstandard for them to get in in the first place. They have to have a \ngood program to get in. They have an option, if things are bad, to get \nout--it is a one-time option--but an option to get out if things get \nbad. There are adequate safeguards, and if there are problems, people \nare able to use a one-time option to get out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The rollcall vote has not been called for.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4935\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the motion to waive the Budget Act for the consideration of \namendment No. 4935 offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania on behalf \nof the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe my amendment is the pending \namendment. I think the regular order is for 1 minute of debate on each \nside. I had hoped this amendment might be accepted by a voice vote. But \nI will go ahead and take my minute now.\n  What my amendment does is denies means-tested benefits to people who \nare convicted of possessing, using, or selling drugs.\n  In minor cases, they lose welfare for 5 years. In major cases, they \nlose it for life. What an individual does does not affect the \neligibility of that individual's children or other family members. We \nhave an exemption in the bill for emergency medical services, emergency \ndisaster relief, and assistance necessary to protect public health from \ncommunicable diseases.\n  None of these provisions applies until date of enactment. These \nprovisions will apply only on convictions after that date. But the \nbottom line is, if we are serious about our drug laws, we ought not to \ngive people welfare benefits who are violating the Nation's drug laws. \nI hope my colleagues will adopt this provision and do so with a \nresounding vote.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, while I appreciate the thrust of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Texas, we strongly oppose it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I can have the attention of the Senate \nfor a moment. This amendment says that anyone convicted of drug \npossession, distribution, or use may not obtain any Federal means-\ntested public benefit. It includes even misdemeanor convictions.\n  The Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities are \nstrongly opposed to the amendment. This is what they say:\n\n       It would undermine the whole notion of providing drug \n     treatment as an alternative sentence to a first-time drug \n     offender if the individual requires Federal assistance to \n     obtain the treatment.\n\n  This would make drug addicts ineligible for any of the effective drug \ntreatment programs that are being developed by the States and the \nFederal Government. It would eliminate any prenatal care for mothers \nthat get convicted of drug crimes. We have seen those programs \ndeveloped in community health centers all across this country; they try \nto get those mothers back to work and reunited with their families. \nThose programs will be off limits to the people who need them most.\n  Under this amendment, if you are a murderer, a rapist, or a robber, \nyou can get Federal funds; but if you are convicted even for possession \nof marijuana, you cannot. It is overly broad and is strongly opposed by \nthe mayors and the National League of Cities. I hope the Senator will \nnot get the 60 votes.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment No. \n4935 offered by Senator Gramm. This amendment would deny Federal means-\ntested benefits to individuals convicted of illegal drug possession, \nuse, or distribution. Personally, I agree with the idea of not giving \nGovernment benefits to drug dealers, however, I do not think the \nFederal Government should continue to tell the States how to run their \nwelfare programs.\n  There are provisions in the bill to ensure that criminals are not \nmilking the system. We keep saying that we want the States to decide \nwhat is best for their States. I believe we have already\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nput enough mandates on the block grants, and the denial of benefits in \nthe Gramm amendment would just increase mandates. Let the States make \nthose decisions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 4935.\n  The amendment (No. 4935) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici].\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 4936, known as the Graham-Bumpers amendment, be temporarily set \naside and that it be the pending business when the Democrats and \nRepublicans return after their lunch break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the sponsor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4930\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 4930 offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], by the yeas and nays, to be \npreceded by 2 minutes of time divided in equal manner.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I hope the time will not begin running on \nme until we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on Friday afternoon, I got wind of a little effort to \ntry to block Senators having to take a public stand----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not order. Could we please \nhave order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will take their conversations to the \nCloakroom.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I believe I will wait until we have order.\n  This time I thank the Chair.\n  In order to protect myself against a little legerdemain here between \nFriday afternoon and the final unanimous consent, I moved to table my \nown amendment and asked for the yeas and nays. I did that because I \nwant Senators to take a stand on this amendment which requires able-\nbodied food stamp recipients to go to work for at least 20 hours a week \nif they expect to continue to receive food stamps free of charge at the \nexpense, of course, of taxpayers who have to work 40 hours a week or \nmore to support their families.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that this amendment will cause a \nlot of people to flake off the food stamp rolls because they do not \nwant to work and they will go to work otherwise. It will save the \ntaxpayers $2.8 billion over the next 6 years.\n  I repeat, this amendment requires able-bodied food stamp recipients \nto go to work for at least 20 hours a week if they expect to continue \nto receive food stamps free of charge.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the description sounds good but for the \nsame reason that the Senate last year by a vote of 66 to 32 voted down \na similar amendment, we ought to do it again.\n  What it does, it denies food stamps to unemployed workers when they \nare looking for work. You have a recession, you have a disaster such as \na hurricane, or somebody has just been laid off from the factory that \nthey worked in for 10 years, as they are looking for a new job, they \ncannot get food stamps. That is a time that they need it the most. We \ncould actually have such a situation as we had in the earthquakes in \nCalifornia. People's businesses were destroyed, their homes were \ndestroyed, somebody has been working for 10 or 15 years, and they would \nbe told: Sorry, you are not working 20 hours a week; you do not get \nfood stamps.\n  We defeated this by a 2-to-1 margin in the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, last year. We should do it again this year. If Senator \nHelms' motion is to table his own amendment, this is one time I agree \nwith him--we ought to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question occurs on \nagreeing to the motion to table amendment 4930. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President we have agreed to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this amendment simply adds the Public \nHealth Service Act in terms of the exemption, so not only people who \nplan to become lawyers and engineers, but people who become nurses and \nphysicians can be exempt. It is acceptable, as far as I know, by \neveryone. I am willing to take a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does anyone wish to speak in opposition?

The question now occurs on Shelby amendment \nNo. 4939. There will be 2 minutes equally divided between sides.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Abraham be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this is the same amendment which was \nadopted by the Senate on a vote of 93 to 5 on the welfare reform bill \nlast year. It provides a $5,000 tax break for adoption expenses, and it \nwill allow thousands of children to find a home in America.\n  The amendment is offset with savings in the underlying bill. There is \nno guarantee that the adoption legislation reported by the Finance \nCommittee will be considered at all this year. This may be our last \nchance to pass this legislation which has overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Again, Mr. President, 93 Senators in this Chamber voted for this \nexact amendment last fall under almost identical circumstances. If we \ndo not adopt this adoption tax credit now, we might lose our chance \nthis year. I ask we waive the Budget Act and adopt this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator D'Amato be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Roth speaks in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I, like Mr. Shelby, strongly support the use \nof tax incentives to promote adoption, and that is why the Finance \nCommittee unanimously reported out of committee an adoption tax credit \nbill.\n  The distinguished majority leader has assured me that he will \nschedule action on the Finance Committee bill before the end of this \nyear. Unlike the Finance Committee-passed adoption tax credit bill, Mr. \nShelby's adoption tax credit is refundable, provides no extra credit \nfor special needs adoption, and is not paid for. I remind my colleagues \nthat we have had tremendous problems with fraud with refundable \ncredits. Take, for example, the earned income credit.\n  Furthermore, if Mr. Shelby's amendment is adopted, we will be \nrequired to find an additional $1.5 billion over 6 years in savings \nfrom the welfare legislation.\n  In addition to these issues, Mr. Shelby's amendment is not germane to \nthe welfare bill. I believe we need incentives to promote adoption, \nhowever, now is not the time to consider such legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against Mr. Shelby's motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I concur with our chairman. The \nCommittee on Finance reported H.R. 3286, the Adoption Promotion and \nStability Act of 1996, unanimously on June 12, 1996. It is on the \ncalendar, and the majority leader has promised prompt action on it.\n  As the chairman has indicated, the Finance Committee bill provides an \nadditional credit for special needs children. This was a subject of \nbipartisan concern during the Finance Committee's consideration of the \nbill. The pending amendment fails to take special needs cases into \naccount, and in any event the amendment is not germane to the \nreconciliation legislation before us.\n  I join Chairman Roth in raising a point of order that the amendment \nof the Senator from Alabama is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act for \nconsideration of amendment No. 4939 offered by the Senator from \nAlabama, [Mr. Shelby]. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may make \nan announcement. It will take me 7 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the last vote before lunch. We \nwill return at 2 o'clock. At 2 o'clock, the pending business will be \nthe Graham-Bumpers formula change amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n     mandatory appropriation for the social security administration\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 2211(e)(5) of this bill provides \na $300 million mandatory appropriation to the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  The bill requires SSA to review the eligibility of hundreds of \nthousands of beneficiaries who may no longer be eligible for \nsupplemental security income [SSI] benefits.\n  This mandatory appropriation is important because it is intended to \ngive SSA the resources it needs to do this job right.\n  But I am concerned about the precedent of creating new entitlement \nspending for Federal agencies, and I understand that the House has \ndropped this provision from its bill because of this concern.\n  Last year, in the Social Security earnings test bill, we created a \nspecial process to allow the Appropriations Committee to provide \nadditional funding for SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews--or \nCDR's--without forcing cuts in other discretionary spending.\n  For the years 1996 through 2002, this process will accommodate an \nadditional $2.7 billion for CFR's, and all signs indicate that it is \nworking.\n  Although I do not plan to strike this mandatory appropriation here on \nthe floor, I hope that, in conference, instead of creating a new \nentitlement for SSA, we can build upon the CDR funding process--and \ngive the Appropriations Committee an additional allowance to fund the \nwork SSA must do under this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8493-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8501-S8532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 4936 offered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. \nGraham]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. However, the vote will be \npreceded by 2 minutes of debate evenly divided in the usual manner.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment speaks to fundamental \nfairness by providing that a poor child will be treated the same by \ntheir Federal Government wherever they happen to live and that each \nState will receive the same amount of money based on the number of poor \nchildren within that State. That is not only fairness; it also, in my \nopinion, is fundamentally required if this bill is to achieve its \nobjective of providing States a reasonable amount of resources in which \nto provide for the transition from welfare to work.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida is actually the \narchitect of this amendment, and he has done an outstanding job. \nThirty-eight States are going to be penalized under this bill because \nwhat we are using is the 1991 and 1994 figures. If your State made a \nmonumental effort during those years, you may be rewarded under this \nbill. If you did not because you could not, you would be punished for \nthe next 6 years. West Virginia has a $13.34 per case administrative \ncost, New York has $106. So because West Virginia has been provident, \nthey are going to get punished. Because New York has been improvident, \nthey get rewarded. That is not equitable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to ask our Members to come \ntogether and do what is right for America and welfare reform. Right now \nwe have a fair funding formula. A nongrowth State never loses from its \n1994 base or its 1995 base, whichever base it chooses. The growth \nStates are able to grow because that is essential, and we know it is \nfair. There are no losers in the underlying bill. The Graham-Bumpers \namendment creates winners and losers. It says to California, Michigan, \nMinnesota, and New York, ``You are going to have to go below and \nactually cut the welfare in your State below the 1994 and 1995 \nlimits.'' Mr. President, that is wrong. We came together and we made a \nvery, very fair proposal, and it was accepted because there are no \nlosers.\n  Now, Mr. President, we must keep that fairness. If we really want \nwelfare reform, we must have fairness for all States. That is what the \nunderlying bill is.\n  Please vote against the Graham-Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Personal Responsibility, Work \nOpportunity, and Medicaid Restructuring Act of 1996 (S. 1956) replaces \nthe current AFDC Program with a new temporary assistance for needy \nfamilies [TANF] block grant. The TANF block grant will distribute \nFederal funds to the States according to a formula which is based on \nrecent Federal expenditures under the programs which are to be \nconsolidated into the TANF, with supplemental funds based on population \ngrowth and low Federal expenditures per poor person in the States. By \nemphasizing historical funding for welfare benefits, this formula \nrecognizes that the cost of living differs from State to State, and \nthat certain States have historically supported generous welfare \nbenefits through the expenditure of their own funds.\n  My colleagues, Senators Graham and Bumpers, have offered an amendment \nto S. 1956 which would significantly change the formula for the TANF \nblock grants. Because the Graham-Bumpers formula would dramatically \ndecrease TANF allotments in certain States and would arbitrarily and \nunfairly force the elimination or reduction of existing welfare \nbenefits, I am unable to support this amendment. This vote does, \nhowever, raise the important issue of the disparities in TANF block \ngrant allotments which the formula will create. While I recognize that \ndifferences in the cost of living and other factors necessitate some \ndisparity in allotments, I encourage the conference committee to \nexplore appropriate alternatives which address these disparities, \nfurther assisting States which have low Federal expenditures per poor \nperson under the formula and which experience population growth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 4936 offered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. On \nthis question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment gives States the option of \nproviding noncash assistance to children once their adult parents have \nreached the 5-year limit. It does not affect the ban on cash assistance \nafter 5 years. It would allow States to use their block grants to \nprovide clothing, school supplies, medicine, and other things for the \npoorest children.\n  This amendment makes this bill identical to H.R. 4, the welfare bill \npassed last December. It provides State flexibility. It adds no new \ncosts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator will \nsuspend. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this bill adds no new costs or no new \nbureaucracy. It is supported by the National Governors' Association. I \nremind my colleagues on the other side, there are 31 Republican \nGovernors. It is supported by the U.S. Catholic Conference, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the American Public Welfare \nAssociation.\n  To say we can use funds from title XX, title XX is money for \nhomebound elderly. It has not been increased since 1991. This makes the \nGovernors make a choice between homebound elderly and the poorest of \nour children. It is just bad policy.\n  Mr. President, let us give the Governors the flexibility they have \nasked for, they worked hard for. We give them responsibility. Let us \nnot tell them how to operate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Ford amendment as it \nwould seriously undermine the real 5-year time limit on welfare \nassistance. One of the most important features of welfare reform is \nthat recipients must understand that public assistance is temporary, \nnot a way of life. Let us be straight about this. These benefits would \ngo to the entire family under the Ford amendment. If you are going to \ngive vouchers for housing, the whole family benefits. If you are giving \nany type of assistance, it benefits the whole family. There is no \ndistinction between the child and the rest of the family.\n  Under the bill, even after the 5-year time limit, families and \nchildren would still be eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, housing \nassistance, WIC, and dozens more means-tested programs.\n  Over 5 years, a typical welfare family receives more than $50,000 in \ntax-free benefits. Five years is enough time to finish a high school \ndegree or learn a skill through vocational training. It is enough for a \nwelfare family to change course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order so the Chair can \nhear the comments of the Senator. Senators will please take their \nconversations out of Senate and to the cloakroom.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We cannot reduce it 4 minutes. We tried it before. The \nclosest they can come is somewhere between 7 and 8. The Senator is \nentitled to his votes. They have asked him to reduce them in number. If \nhe does not care to, let us proceed with his amendments. He is \nabsolutely entitled to do that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be happy to reduce the time.

Mr. President, this amendment highlights the value \nwhich is at the very heart of our culture and our nature--the \nimportance of education and learning.

The Senate will be \nin order so the Senate may hear the Senator from Missouri on his \namendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is the thrust of this amendment that \nif you are on welfare and you have not completed your high school \ndiploma the best way to get a job and keep a job is to achieve a level \nof education that our society expects of all adults, and that is a high \nschool education.\n  So this amendment would allow States to require individuals to get a \nhigh school education or its equivalent. This amendment is permissive, \nand it states that if you are a 20- to 50-year-old welfare recipient \nwho does not have a high school diploma, you must begin working toward \nattaining a high school diploma or a GED as a condition of receiving \nbenefits. An exception is made for people who are not capable.\n  Job training will not equip welfare recipients to work if they have \nnot achieved the basic and fundamental proficiency in education skills. \nHow can we expect to train someone to work as a cashier if they cannot \nadd, subtract, multiply, or divide?\n  The facts are indisputable. A person over 18 without a high school \ndiploma averages $12,800 in earnings; with a high school diploma, \naverages $18,700 in earnings. Mr. President, $6,000 is the difference \nbetween dependence and independence; between welfare and work.\n  This is permissive to the States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there is no opposition to this amendment \nthat I know of. I recommend that all Senators vote in favor of the \namendment.\n\n  I would simply point out that the amendment does nothing more than \nwhat the States can already do.\n  I will vote for this amendment, and the one that follows. I will \nstrongly oppose the third amendment by the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in that event I would be pleased to \naccept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Missouri.\n  The amendment (No. 4944) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4943 to Amendment No. 4941\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on amendment No. 4943 to \namendment No. 4941 offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As I mentioned earlier, education is the key to breaking the \nintergenerational cycle of welfare dependency. This amendment would \nallow States to require that parents on welfare be responsible for \nensuring that their minor children are in school.\n  It would be this simple. If you are on welfare, your children should \nbe in school. If we care about breaking the vicious intergenerational \ncycle of welfare we should care about making sure that individuals who \nare on welfare accept the responsibility of sending their children to \nschool. We must look to the long-term in reforming welfare. We must \nlook at what we can do to save the future of our children. Every child \nin America can attend school. Every child can earn a high school \ndiploma. It costs nothing but commitment. Too often education is \nignored and trashed because it is devalued by our welfare culture. Teen \ndropout rates soar. They skip classes. We should not pay parents to \nencourage lifestyles of dependency on and off welfare and in and out of \nminimum-wage jobs. States should be able to give children on welfare a \nfighting chance.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I know of no one on this side of the aisle \nor on the other side of the aisle that opposes this amendment by the \nSenator from Missouri. I would simply state what I said on the last \namendment. If the Senator insists on a rollcall vote, I recommend that \nall Senators vote in favor of the amendment as, like the preceding \namendment, it does nothing more than what the States can already do. I \nhope that we could move things along, and I would point out that I will \nstrongly oppose the next amendment offered by the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Missouri.\n  The amendment (No. 4943) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4942 to Amendment No. 4941\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 4942 offered by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. \nAshcroft], to his amendment No. 4941.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we need to change welfare from a \ncondition in which people live to a transition from which people go; a \ntransition from dependency to independence.\n  Under this bill we allow most people to spend 5 straight years on the \nwelfare rolls. Without really going to work in 5 years, think what can \nhappen in terms of building habits, self-esteem, skills, and \nmotivation. If you do not use a muscle for 5 weeks, it gets weak. If \nyou do not use it for 5 months, it atrophies. If you do not use it for \n5 years, it disappears. It is forever useless.\n\n  This amendment says that 2 years in a row--24 months--is long along \nenough for able-bodied recipients without infants or children to be \nable to receive welfare without starting down a path of work. We need \nto change the character of welfare from the condition of welfare to a \ntransition toward independence and work. Mr. President, 5 straight \nyears on welfare only reinforces a dependent lifestyle that we are \ntrying to change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri \nprovides that a family may not receive welfare assistance for more than \n24 months consecutively, unless the adult is working, or the State has \nan exemption of the adult for hardship. I would support this amendment \nif the Senator would require States to offer work to parents. There may \nbe many parents who are willing to work and who want\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nto work but cannot find a job, or perhaps they cannot find child care \nfor their children so that they can be at work.\n  The underlying bill says that a mother should not be penalized if she \nhas a child under 11, or if she cannot afford to find child care. This \namendment would be inconsistent with the underlying bill. It aims right \nat the mother. But it hits the child.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. It goes too far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4941, As Amended\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, because the substitute has failed, what \nremains is--and I believe the Senator from Missouri agrees--what \nremains is the underlying amendment, as amended by the amendments that \nwe adopted by voice vote.\n  Consequently, I suggest we now simply adopt the underlying amendment \nas amended by voice vote as well.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, that is consistent with my understanding \nof where we are. I am pleased to agree with the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4941), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4950\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Murray is now scheduled for \nrecognition, I believe. Is that correct? The Senator from Washington \nshould be recognized, I suggest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 4950. \nThe Senator from Washington is recognized for up to 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment before us strikes the \nprovision in the bill that cuts the reimbursement rate on the Summer \nFood Program dramatically. The bill proposes to cut 23 cents from every \nschool lunch provided in this critical summer program. This will have a \ndramatic effect, especially in our rural areas.\n  I think we have had the debate on this floor. Everyone understands \nthe need to have good, strong nutrition for our children in order for \nthem to learn. The Summer Food Program is especially critical. Children \nare not bears. They do not hibernate. They need to eat in the summer as \nmuch as they do in the school year.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and put back in \neffect the important Summer Food Program. I understand the majority is \nwilling, perhaps, to accept this on a voice vote. If that is the case, \nI am more than happy to oblige.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order so we may \nproceed.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senate may not have heard the closing \nremarks by the Senator from Washington. I believe she suggested the \namendment has been cleared on both sides and she will accept a voice \nvote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is our understanding. The amendment has been \ncleared on this side. We are willing to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4950) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4952\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 4952, \noffered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham].\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment I offer strikes an amendment \nwhich was adopted in the Senate Finance Committee. The current bill as \nit was submitted to the committee contains a sanction against the \nStates in the hands of the Secretary of HHS.\n  The Secretary, at the Secretary's discretion, can levy up to a 5-\npercent withholding of a State's welfare funds if the State fails to \nmeet the work requirements. The amendment offered in the committee \nprovides that if a State fails to meet that standard for 2 straight \nyears, then it shall be penalized, without discretion in the hands of \nthe Secretary, by a mandatory 5 percent. And although there is some \nconfusion, it is assumed that this is a cumulative 5 percent, up to a \ntotal of 25 percent of the State's welfare payments.\n\n  This is strongly opposed by the State and local organizations, from \nthe National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislators, the National Association of Counties, all of whom feel it \ndenies to the Secretary the necessary discretion.\n  This also will severely penalize those low-benefit States which are \nthe most likely to be unable to meet the work requirements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if there is a hallmark of this bill, it is \nwork. If there is one thing that every Democrat and every Republican \nboasts about in this bill, it is that it requires able-bodied men and \nwomen to work.\n  Last year's bill simply had a one-time penalty for not meeting the \nwork requirements. Members of the Finance Committee were concerned that \na State, or the District of Columbia, would simply take the 5-percent \npenalty each year rather than make a good-faith effort to meet the work \nrequirements in this bill--even with the ability to exempt 20 percent \nof welfare recipients. Without this compounding provision, we have no \nreal ability to produce a good-faith effort on the part of the States.\n  We have had meetings between the House and the Senate on this issue. \nWe met with the Governors. We worked out what we believe is a \ncompromise. I hope my colleagues will stay with this provision. If you \nwant a work requirement, you have to enforce it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the Graham amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4955 offered by the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor up to 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is about children. It is \nabout the children of legal immigrants. It is also about deeming. What \nwe are saying is, under this program, legal immigrant children are not \ngoing to be excluded from the range of benefits. We are saying you are \ndeemed to the person that is going to sponsor you. If that person that \nsponsors you runs into hard times, we will not deny the children the \nbenefits they would otherwise receive. That is half the legal \nimmigrants' children.\n  The other half have no sponsor--no sponsor--have no one to deem to \nbecause they are the children of those who come here under the work \npermit. We should not exclude those individuals. They will become \nAmericans, one; and two, more frequently than not, they are with \ndivided households where brothers and sisters would be eligible. The \ncost will be $1 billion in 6 years, affecting 450,000 children that at \none time or another might take advantage of the system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Kennedy amendment. It would \nseriously erode fundamental welfare reform as it relates to \nnoncitizens. The amendment does not just apply to children who are \nalready here. The exemption applies to those who will come to the \nUnited States in the future, as well.\n  The bill provides for a 5-year ban on Federal means-tested benefits, \nincluding cash, medical assistance, housing, food assistance, and \nsocial services. The Kennedy amendment creates a new exception to all \nthese benefits to aliens under age 18. It is the taxpayer, not the \nfamilies and sponsors of the children, who will assume the \nresponsibility for their needs. This is the wrong signal to send to \nthose who would come here for opportunity, not a handout, and for the \nfamilies here who pay for those benefits.\n  The Kennedy amendment would result in a loss of substantial savings \nin the bill.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 4956\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe that it is in order now for the \nconsideration of my other amendment. Am I correct that the time \nallocated is 1 minute and 1 minute in opposition? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple and \nfundamental amendment, but it is one that is desperately important to \ncounty hospitals and to rural hospitals around the country.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to defer the Medicaid \nprohibitions of the welfare provisions for legal immigrants for 2 years \nso that the local hospitals are able to accommodate the provisions of \nthis legislation. Under the provisions of the legislation, all \nimmigrants would be prohibited from the day that they enter the United \nStates, and all of those who are in this country, any State could knock \nthem out in January of next year.\n  Probably the most important health facilities that we have in this \ncountry in many respects are not the teaching hospitals but the county \nhospitals that provide emergency assistance. If we put this enormous \nburden--and it estimated to be $287 million over the period of the next \n2 years; that is the cost of it--it is going to have an impact on \nAmericans because the county hospitals are going to deteriorate in \nquality; they are going to be inundated with additional kinds of cases \nthat they are not going to be compensated for; and they are not going \nto be able to treat Americans fairly or equitably.\n  All we are asking for is a 2-year period.\n  This is endorsed by the American Hospital Association, the National \nAssociation of Public Health Hospitals, the National Associations of \nChildren's Hospitals, community health centers, and the Catholic Health \nAssociation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would delay Medicaid \nrestrictions on noncitizens for 2 years. In effect, the Kennedy \namendment says we need welfare reform but not quite yet. That is not \ngood enough for those who bear the cost of these programs.\n  Let us not lose sight of this debate. These welfare programs were not \ndesigned to serve noncitizens. The restrictions that we have placed on \nnoncitizens have broad bipartisan support. This is no time to turn our \nbacks on reform. The Kennedy amendment would result in a loss of \nsubstantial savings in the bill.\n  So I, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy \namendment and uphold the budget point of order against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 35, the nays are \n64. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe this finishes the amendments \nthat were on our list as of Thursday night. Those who wanted votes have \nhad their votes. Those have been disposed of.\n  Yesterday, Senator Exon raised an omnibus Byrd rule point of order \nagainst a number of provisions contained in the bill. In order to \npreserve our rights, I moved to waive the Budget Act with respect to \neach point of order individually.\n  At this time, I now withdraw my motions to waive with respect to all \nbut the following three provisions: No. 1, section 408(a)(2), which is \nknown as the family cap; No. 2, section 2104, which deals with services \nprovided by charitable organizations; and, No. 3, section 2909, which \ndeals with abstinence education.\n  It is our intention to have a separate vote on each of these three. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \nrequest the yeas and nays on the three at this point.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving right to object, I would simply say to my friend \nand colleague from New Mexico, I appreciate the fact he has expedited \nthings a great deal by, I think, eliminating 22 of the 25 points of \norder that we raised.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply remind all that, for any or all of these three to \nbe agreed to, it would require 60 votes. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. In view of that, and in view of the fact that time is \nrunning on, and I think we all recognize we are going to be on this \nbill--with closing statements from the managers and the two leaders and \nthen final passage--it looks to me like we are going to run up toward 6 \no'clock if we do not expedite things.\n  I am just wondering--I make the suggestion to expedite things--rather \nthan have three separate votes, could we package these three into one \nvote? I remind all, the chance of these motions being agreed to, with \nthe 60-vote point of order, is not very likely. But if there is strong \nfeeling in the Senate on these, then the 60 votes would be there.\n  Will the Senator consider packaging the three into one vote?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank Senator Exon for all the cooperation he \nhas exhibited and the efforts he made to expedite matters. But we have, \non our own, taken 22 of your 25 points of order and said they are well \ntaken. So, in that respect, we have already eliminated an awful lot of \nvotes that could have taken place.\n  Frankly, this is done without anybody whimpering about them on this \nside of the aisle. They have all agreed with my analysis and said that \nis good, save the three.\n  Conferring with the chairmen of the Finance Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee, I arrived at that conclusion; 22 are gone. We \nwould like just three votes on those three waivers. I would like to do \nthem quickly. We will only ask for 2 minutes on a side to debate the \nissues, since none of them have been before the Senate as a substantive \nmatter. That is the best I can do. I hope the Senator will agree with \nthat, I ask Senator Exon.\n  Mr. EXON. What you are saying is three is the minimum?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Three is the minimum, but obviously we sure got rid of \nplenty of them.\n  Mr. EXON. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes equally divided on each of these points of order--two for those \nin opposition and two for those who support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Section 408(a)(2)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the first of our waivers will be the \nfamily cap. I have already moved to waive it in the previous motion, \nand I now yield the time to argue in favor of the waiver to Senator \nGramm of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, only a tortured view of the \nByrd rule would say that our language on the family cap does not save \nmoney. But what I want to focus on here is that this is not a \ncontroversial provision of the bill but is an integral part of the \noverall welfare reform measure.\n  As I am sure colleagues on both sides of the aisle will remember, we \nhave had serious debate over this issue. We have gone back and forth. \nThere have been differences. There are some people who believe--I am \none of those people--that we should have a family cap and that we ought \nnot to give people more and more money in return for having more and \nmore children while on welfare. There are other people who believe that \nwe should have no family cap and that the current incentives built into \nthe system should continue.\n  What we have in this bill is a crafted compromise that was adopted in \ncommittee with broad support. We allow States, at their option, through \ntheir action, to opt out of the family cap if they choose. This is a \nbroad-based compromise. It has been supported on a bipartisan basis, \nand for that reason, I feel very strongly that to preserve common sense \nin this bill in a way that is coherent and can work, we need to \npreserve this compromise language.\n  So I ask Members on both sides of the aisle to vote to waive the Byrd \nrule and keep this provision in place. This provision simply says the \nfamily cap exists unless the State opts out. If States decides that \nthey want to continue to give additional cash payments\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nto those who have more and more children while on welfare, the States \ncan do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. This is compromise language. I hope on a bipartisan basis \nthat we will preserve this compromise.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield our time to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will say, in response to the Senator \nfrom Texas, that there is bipartisan agreement, and the bipartisan \nagreement is that this is a bad idea: The National Governors' \nAssociation, the NGA, headed by Gov. Tommy Thompson, who I think is a \nleading Republican, opposes this measure. The NGA, in their letter to \nall Members of the Congress, say very clearly:\n  The NGA supports a family cap as an option rather than as a mandate \nto prohibit benefits to additional children born or conceived while the \nparent is on welfare.\n\n  What this amendment does is to require that the States affirmatively \npass legislation to get out from under this mandate that people in \nWashington are sending down to the States. That is why the bipartisan \nNGA strongly opposes the provisions in the bill as it is written.\n  They would like the option to do that if they want to, but they \ncertainly do not want Washington to mandate that they cannot have \nassistance to children of a family who are born while they are on \nwelfare, simply because they do not want to penalize the children.\n  Be as tough as we want to be on the mothers and the parents, but not \non the children. In addition to that, the Catholic Bishops' Conference, \nwhich has been very active, along with a number of other groups, feels \nvery strongly this legislation should not have the mandate the bill \ncurrently has. They say very clearly that this provision would result \nin more poverty, hunger and illness for poor children. This is \nsomething that gets me. They say, ``We urge the Senate to reject this \nmeasure which would encourage abortions and hurt children.''\n  I am not sure everybody comes down on these, but I think when you \nhave the Catholic Bishops' Conference saying, if a mother is faced with \nthat choice, abortion becomes a real option, they think they should not \nbe encouraged and, therefore, they do not support Washington mandating \nthat States have to take a certain action. Let them have the option.\n  If we strike this provision, the State has the option to deny \nadditional benefits to additional children if they want to, but we \nshould not be dictating to the States on a block grant welfare program \nhow they have to handle this situation.\n  I strongly urge that we not move to waive the Byrd rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the third reading of H.R. 3734, the following Senators be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes each for closing remarks: Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Roth, Senator Exon, Senator Domenici; I further ask \nthat following the conclusion of these remarks, the floor managers be \nrecognized, Senator Daschle to be followed by Senator Lott, for closing \nremarks utilizing their leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask immediately following passage of H.R. 3734, \nthe Senate request----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the majority leader will suspend.\n  Mr. EXON. My apologies. We thought things were cleared. They are not. \nWe will have to object, pending a few moments. Could the Senator hold \noff for 5 minutes for a chance to work this out?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am willing to do that, but I thought we \nhad an agreement whereby we could get an understanding of how much \ntime--after all the days and hours that have gone into this bill--and \nwe could have closing statements.\n  That is fine, to have final statements as to the position of the \nvarious Senators on what is in this legislation; it was with the \nunderstanding that we would also go ahead and get the agreement and go \nto conference.\n  Mr. EXON. We also thought that we had an agreement, but I am sure you \nhave had exceptions on your side, as we have, and in the best of times \nthey do not always work out.\n  I do not think it is a lengthy delay. I simply say we will try and \ngive the Senator an answer in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Can we proceed with the next vote?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n              Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Section 2104\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The question is on the motion \nto waive the point of order, section 2104. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In moving to waive the Budget Act, the point of order \nregarding the charitable organizations, I yield 30 seconds to my \ncolleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I urge my colleagues to support the \nAshcroft provision, which allows for delivery of social services \nthrough religious charities. I urge this for two compelling reasons.\n  First, it is much more cost effective than the current Federal \nbureaucratic system. Utilization of facilities that are already there, \nthat are neighborhood based and utilizating volunteers makes delivery \nof those services far more efficient than the Government can do.\n  Second, they get better results. Survey after survey, in hearing \nafter hearing that we have conducted in the Children and Families \nSubcommittee on Labor and Human Resources has proven the effectiveness \nin doing this. I urge my colleagues to support the Ashcroft amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there is a real reason to employ the \nservices of nongovernmental charitable organizations in delivering the \nneeds of individuals who require the welfare state. Despite our good \nintentions, our welfare program and delivery system have been a \nmiserable failure. Yet, America's faith-based charities and \nnongovernmental organizations, from the Salvation Army to the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of the United States have been very successful in moving \npeople from welfare dependency to the independence of work and the \ndignity of self-reliance.\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\n  The legislation that we are considering is a provision that was in \nthe Senate welfare bill that passed last year. It passed the Senate by \nan 87 to 12 margin. President Clinton's veto of that bill last year was \nnot related to this measure. I spoke to the President about it \npersonally. In his State of the Union Address, just a few weeks later, \nhe indicated the need to enlist the help of charitable and religious \norganizations to provide social services to our poor and needy \ncitizens.\n  Based upon the record of this Senate, which voted 87-12 in favor of \nsuch a concept last year after a thorough debate and consideration, \nbased upon the support of the Executive, based upon the record of \nwelfare as a failure and the need to employ and tap the resource of \nnongovernmental, charitable, religious, and other organizations, I urge \nthe Senate to pass this motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment. I \nsimply point out to all that, in my opinion, this is a direct violation \nof the church-and-state relationship.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think we have to look at this very \ncarefully. It provides that States can contract for welfare delivery \nwith charitable, religious, or private organizations. I have no \nobjection to charitable or private organizations, but we have been very \ncareful in this church-and-state area.\n  My father happened to be a Lutheran minister. I believe in the \neffectiveness of religion not only in our personal lives, but in giving \nstability to our Nation. We have been careful. For example, we permit \nreligious schools to have some school lunch money. We permit some title \nI funds. We permit, under certain circumstances, assistance for \ndisabled people that can be provided to religious organizations. But, \nunder this, what we do is we not only say that religious organizations \ndo not need to alter their form of internal governance--I have no \nobjection to that--or remove icons, Scripture, or other symbols--I \npersonally have no objection to that, though I know some who do--we \npermit churches and religious organizations to propagate people before \nthey can get assistance. I think that clearly crosses the line in \nchurch/state relations. I think a hungry person should not have to be \nsubjected to a religious lecture from a Lutheran, a Catholic, a Jew, or \na Muslim before they get assistance. What if someone objects? If \nsomeone objects----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will close by saying, within a reasonable period, you \nappeal to the State, and the State eventually makes a decision. I think \nwe should not waive this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

On this vote the yeas are 67, the nays are 32. \nThree-fifths of the Senate duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I opposed the motion to waive the Byrd rule \npoint of order against the language of section 2104 which would provide \na specific authorization for States to contract with charitable, \nprivate, or religious organizations to provide services under this act. \nStates, without this provision, are able to enter into such contracts \nprovided that they are consistent with the establishment clause of the \nConstitution and the State constitution and statutes of the State \ninvolved. Therefore, I believe this provision is unnecessary.\n  I also voted against the language because it could inadvertently \nactually create a headache for religious organizations that currently \ndeliver social services under Federal contract. Religious organizations \ncurrently contract to deliver social services for the Federal \nGovernment. They do so separate from their religious activities, \nkeeping separate accounts, for instance.\n  Under the bill's language, neither the Federal Government nor a State \nmay refuse to contract with an organization based on the religious \ncharacter of the organization, but if a recipient of those benefits \nobjects to the religious character of an organization from which that \nindividual would receive assistance, the State must provide that \nindividual with assistance from an alternative provider that is \n``accessible'' to the individual. So if a religious organization is \ncurrently delivering services in a way that is consistent with the \nConstitution but an individual objects to that institution having the \ncontract, that individual could precipitate an expensive bureaucratic \nsecond track for the delivery of services for that one individual. \nWhile this may not be the intent of the bill's language, it could \neasily lead to that.\n  It is ultimately the Constitution which determines under what \nconditions religious organizations can be contracted with by the \nFederal or State governments for the delivery of publicly funded social \nservices. The statute cannot amend the Constitution. Indeed, this \nbill's language purports to require, in section 2104c, that programs be \nimplemented consistent with the establishment clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. What the bill's language therefore unwittingly does is \nconfuse rather than expand.\n\n\n              Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Section 2909\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the motion \nto waive section 2909. There are 4 minutes equally divided. The Senate \nwill come to order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe the regular order would be \nSenator Faircloth, and he has 2 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Regular order, please, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in 1994, when President Clinton sent \nhis first welfare reform bill to Congress, he said that preventing \nteenage pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births was a critical part of \nwelfare reform. I hope we all could agree with the President on that \npoint and also agree to waive the point of order against the funding \nfor abstinence education programs.\n  Abstinence education programs across the country have shown very \npromising results in reducing teenage pregnancies and reducing the \nteenage pregnancy rate, and it deserves to be expanded with Federal \nassistance. This provision does not take funds from existing programs \nand will be a critical\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nhelp in meeting the bill's goal of reducing out-of-wedlock births.\n  Mr. President, our colleagues on the other side have asked us \nrepeatedly to consider the children. Abstinence education is an \neffective means to help children avoid the trap of teenage pregnancy. I \nurge my colleagues to vote to waive the Budget Act on this provision.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield our time to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  The Senate will come to order, please.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us takes $75 million from the Maternal \nand Child Health Block Grant Program to fund the abstinence program. I \nam sure that everyone here can agree abstinence is important. However, \nI strongly urge my colleagues not to allow us to rob the Maternal and \nChild Health Block Grant Program to fund this abstinence program.\n  The maternal and child health block grant provides critical dollars \nfor prenatal care, newborn screening, and care for children with \ndisabilities. It provides for vital resources like parent education, \nhealth screenings and immunization, children preventive dental visits, \nand sudden infant death syndrome counseling.\n  I am sure my colleagues will agree we should not reduce these vital \nresources by 13 percent. I have a chart here showing how much that will \nreduce each State's allocation if you are interested.\n\n  Let me read quickly to you from the Association of State and \nTerritorial Health Officials, who say:\n\n       State health officers object to the new set-aside on the \n     grounds that states, not the federal government, are better \n     able to decide what programs are necessary and effective for \n     their communities. State health officials share the laudable \n     goals of reducing unintended pregnancies and exposure to \n     sexually transmitted diseases. In fact, abstinence education \n     is an integral component of most maternal and child health \n     programs. Ironically, due to the new administrative costs \n     states will incur and the reduction of overall block grant \n     funds, this set-aside will actually do harm to states' \n     overall abstinence promotion efforts.\n\n  Mr. President, if we agree that abstinence----\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I can hardly \nhear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if we agree abstinence programs are vital, fine; let \nus pay for them. But let us not steal from the critical maternal and \nchild health programs that are so important to so many parents across \nthis country. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Faircloth has yielded me his \nremaining 30 seconds.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, Senator Faircloth is suggesting \nsomething here that I believe we ought to try. What he is saying is we \nhave tried so many things with reference to teenage pregnancy, why not \ntry a program that says to our young people: We would like to give you \nthe advantages of abstinence.\n  Now, you do not have to believe in that; you do not have to be an \nadvocate of it, but you ought to give it a try.\n  We have tried all kinds of things under the rubric of Planned \nParenthood and yet anybody that tries to suggest and receive funding \nfor a program that does this cannot be funded. I believe it ought to be \nfunded, and I think we ought to waive the Budget Act. I commend the \nSenator for this suggestion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am sorry; I should have gotten your \nattention sooner. On behalf of the majority leader, we are now prepared \nto enter into an agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nthird reading of H.R. 3734, the following Senators be recognized for up \nto 5 minutes for closing remarks: Senators Moynihan, Roth, Exon, and \nDomenici. Further, I ask that following the conclusion of the remarks \nof the four managers, Senator Daschle be recognized to be followed by \nSenator Lott for closing remarks utilizing leaders' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \npassage of H.R. 3734, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes thereon, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all \nwithout further action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Section 2909\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Points of Order\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senate that there are 22 \npoints of order remaining. The Chair sustains all but the 15th point of \norder raised against section 409(a)(7)(C).\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yet again during the 104th Congress we \nfind ourselves debating welfare reform on the floor of the Senate. It \nis regrettable that we even have to take the time to debate this issue. \nWe have already twice passed solid welfare reform plans which would \ngive States the necessary flexibility to truly provide for the unique \nneeds of the less fortunate in their States. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's vetoes of the two previous welfare reform proposals has \nleft us with no real reform and has left States floundering.\n  Just over 10 months ago, I stood here on the Senate floor and said \nthat welfare reform was long overdue. It still is. We all know the \nwelfare system in\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nthis Nation is seriously flawed. Maintaining the status quo is not only \nnot an option, I believe it is morally wrong. We must break the cycle \nof poverty which our current system has perpetuated. As Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt once said, ``The lessons of history show conclusively that \ncontinued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral \ndisintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber. To dole \nout relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer \nof the human spirit.'' If we are to restore that spirit, we must give \nthose on welfare a fighting chance--a chance I believe they want--to \nonce again become contributing members of our society.\n  After debating this issue for months, I believe it is safe to say \nthat a majority of Members of Congress recognize that the only true way \nto reform the welfare system is to turn it over to the States. True \nreform, innovative reform, will come from the States, and we should \ngive them the opportunity to prove that they are capable of making the \nchanges the system needs. Turning these programs over to the States \nwill provide them with the opportunity to shape poverty-assistance \nprograms to meet local needs. It will provide States and local \nofficials with the change to use their own creativity and their own \nintimate knowledge of the people's needs to address their problems. And \nwe do not make them go through a series of bureaucratic hoops in order \nto get a waiver to do so.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Idaho is currently in the process of \napplying for just such a waiver. In order to get to this point, the \nGovernor appointed a Welfare Reform Advisory Council which met with \npeople in communities around the State to solicit suggestions on how \nthe current system could be reformed. From those meetings came 44 \nspecific proposals for making welfare work. These recommendations fall \ninto four categories: Making welfare a two-way agreement and limiting \navailability; mandatory work requirements and improvements to the child \ncare system which will allow recipients with young children to work; \nnew eligibility standards which focus on maintaining the integrity of \nthe family structure; and improving child support enforcement.\n  The people of Idaho have spoken on the directions in which they wish \nto go with welfare reform. Unfortunately, the requirement to attain \nwaivers is preventing these reforms from being enacted. To make matters \nworse, not only is the system not being reformed, but limited, vital \nresources are being used to apply for the waivers instead of for \nhelping the needy. The current process is slow, time consuming, and \ninefficient. This is why block grants are so necessary. The people of \nIdaho want a system which helps the truly needy, and they have worked \ndiligently to plan just such a system. Instead, they are given \nadditional bureaucracy. It is time we let the States, like Idaho, \nimplement reforms, rather than just write about them.\n\n  Idaho's concerns are not unique. Many of the States see the same \nproblems with the current welfare system. At the same time, the best \nmanner in which to address these concerns varies considerably across \nthe Nation. A cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach simple does not \nfit in a diverse nation. That is why we must finally let go of Federal \ncontrol.\n  I believe the welfare reform debate is about one word--freedom. It is \nthe freedom of State and local governments to decide how best to \nprovide assistance to the needy. It is the freedom of the various \nlevels of government to create innovative ways to meet the unique needs \nof the downtrodden in their city, county or State. It is the freedom to \nfollow local customs and values rather than Federal mandates. I have \nsaid for some time that when the Government tries to establish a one-\nsize-fits-all, cookie-cutter approach to address a perceived need, it \nignores the unique circumstances which are so important in developing \nthe best way to address that need.\n  I do not want anyone in this country who is struggling to make \nsomething of themselves, regardless of the State in which they reside, \nto be hampered in their efforts because of rules and regulations which \nignore the fact that this Nation is not uniform--that people in all \nareas of the country have unique circumstances which simply cannot be \naddressed in one prescriptive Federal package. What I hope to do, what \nI believe this legislation does, is give current and future welfare \nrecipients the freedom to break out of poverty.\n  Mr. President, this bill is also about freedom for those who are \nalready on welfare, or who are at risk of entering the welfare rolls. \nUnder the current system, generations have grown up without knowing the \nsatisfaction of work and personal improvement. The value of family has \nbeen ignored, aiding the increasing rate of illegitimacy. And possibly \nworst of all, children have been raised without hope in a system that \ndoes more to continue poverty than to break the welfare cycle. For far \ntoo many, the system offers no incentives and no promise of a better \nfuture.\n  For more than 30 years, we have tried to dictate to the States how \nbest to take care of their needy. After 30 years, it is time to accept \nthat the experiment is a failure. And thus, it is time we let the \nStates take control and develop their own solutions to the problem of \npoverty in this Nation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, three times in the last year we have stood \non this floor to debate welfare reform. The first time, the bill passed \nthe Senate by a large bipartisan majority, 87 to 12.\n  Yet, the President has vetoed it. He has since vetoed welfare reform \nlegislation twice more.\n  Today, we are standing here again. We have yet again passed \nlegislation to reform a failed and broken welfare system, a system \nwhich has dragged the most vulnerable of our population into a pit of \ndependency.\n  We must stop this cycle. We must give these families the hope and \nhelp they deserve. This legislation would do just that.\n  This legislation reforms the old system into a new one. This \nlegislation will take a system of degrading, esteem depleting handouts \nand transform it into a transitional system of support that helps \nfamilies gain work experience, training, and self-sufficiency. This \nbill creates a system that gives beneficiaries a leg up and not a shove \ndown.\n  In watching the Olympic long-distance cycling event a few nights ago, \nmy heart went out to those athletes who had trained so hard, but who \nhad hit ``the wall,'' that point in an endurance contest when the goal \nseems overwhelming and when it seems impossible to take another step or \npedal another foot.\n  Mr. President, many of our welfare recipients under our current \nsystem have faced the wall. Our current system is one that simply \nencourages dependence; an individual's self-esteem is shattered; when a \nbetter life seems beyond reach; and it becomes easier to quit and \naccept the help of others.\n  This legislation will help American families climb over the wall of \npoverty. It will build self-confidence and hope for the future on a \nfoundation of work and accomplishment.\n  Yet, Mr. President, welfare recipients are not the only ones who have \nhit the proverbial wall with our welfare system. The taxpayers have hit \nit too. Frankly, while they are a compassionate people, while they want \nto help those who are less fortunate, they also want to see personal \nresponsibility and individual effort restored as a quid pro quo to \nreceiving help.\n\n  Americans have become frustrated that the increasing billions of \ndollars we spend on the war on poverty is not reducing poverty. It is \nnot building strong families. It is just not working.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today would create a \ntransitional system. One that stresses temporary assistance and not a \npermanent handout. It requires that beneficiaries go to work and get \nthe training and educational skills they need to get and keep a job. No \nlonger will beneficiaries be able to get something for nothing. This \nsystem will give them the help they need to get into a job and move \ninto self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, this bill gives the States the flexibility they need \nto design the best systems they can to address their unique mix of \neconomic climate, beneficiary characteristics, and resources available. \nThe Federal Government cannot be responsive to local conditions but the \nStates can.\n  This bill moves the decisionmaking and system design authority to the \nStates where it belongs. It doesn't simply leave Federal funds on the \nstump\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\nas some have suggested. States are required to submit their plans and \nlive up to them. They must serve their needy populations and provide \nthem the resources necessary to move them into jobs and self-\nsufficiency.\n  This legislation is the fourth time the Senate has passed welfare \nreform legislation. This is yet another chance for the President to \nhonor his pledge to ``reform welfare as we know it.'' It is another \nchance for all of us to throw over a system that provides no real hope, \nno real help, no real progress. American low-income families deserve \nmore and so do the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the present welfare system does not serve \nthe Nation well. It does not serve families and children well. It does \nnot serve the American taxpayer well.\n  This bill contains several provisions which I hope can be moderated \nin the conference between the House and the Senate and in discussion \nwith the President.\n  Meaningful reform should protect children and establish the principle \nthat able-bodied people work. It should tighten child support \nenforcement laws and be more effective in getting absent fathers to \nsupport their children. The bill before us represents a constructive \neffort. It is an improvement over the bill the President vetoed last \nyear because it provides more support for child care, requires a \ngreater maintenance of effort from the States, and does not block grant \nfood stamp assistance. And, the Senate has improved the bill which the \nFinance Committee reported by passing amendments which maintain current \nstandards for Medicaid and which eliminate excessive limits on food \nstamp assistance.\n  The funding levels in this bill are aimed at assuring that adequate \nchild care resources will be available for children as single parents \nmake the transition into work. Those levels are significantly improved. \nThis strengthens the work requirement because it better assures that \nStates can effectively move people into job training, private sector \nemployment, and community service jobs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate approved my amendment, \noffered with Senator D'Amato, which greatly strengthens the work \nrequirement in the bill. The original legislation required recipients \nto work within 2 years of receipt of benefits. My amendment adds a \nprovision which requires that unless an able-bodied person is in a \nprivate sector job, school or job training, the State must offer, and \nthe recipient must accept community service employment within 2 months \nof receipt of benefits.\n  I would prefer a bill which did not end the Federal safety net for \nchildren, a bill like the Daschle work first legislation which failed \nin the Senate narrowly and which I cosponsored. I would prefer a bill \nwhich permitted noncash voucher assistance targetted to the children of \nfamilies where the adult parent is no longer eligible for assistance. I \nwould prefer a bill which protects legal immigrants who have become \ndisabled.\n  So the decision is a difficult and a close one. On balance, however, \nI believe that it is so critical that we reform the broken welfare \nsystem which currently serves the American taxpayer and America's \nchildren poorly, that it is necessary to move this legislation forward \nto the next stage.\n  I believe that it is particularly important that partisanship not \ndominate the conference between the House and Senate. I am hopeful that \nthe congressional leadership work with the President to forge a final \nbipartisan welfare reform bill behind which we can all close ranks.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose what is called \nwelfare reform but is really radical change and a surrender of the \nNation's responsibility to our children. This measure ends our 60-year \nnational guarantee of aid to the poor and the disadvantaged. Make no \nmistake, the poor and the disadvantaged to whom we refer are our \nchildren. Today one in five children live in poverty and I am not \nconvinced that this bill will improve our problem and I fear that it \nwill only make it worse.\n  I want our welfare system reformed and I voted for an alternative \nDemocratic welfare reform plan, the Work First Act of 1996, which was \nbased upon last year's Democratic welfare proposal. Work First promotes \nwork while protecting children. It requires parents to take \nresponsibility to find a job, guarantees child-care assistance and \nrequires both parents to contribute to the support of their children. \nWhen this alternative failed, I supported many of the amendments to \nimprove the bill and guarantee assistance to poor children.\n  I am concerned that there are already far too many poor children in \nthis country. I believe that this bill will cause many more children to \nlive in poverty. It is estimated that 130,185 children in Ohio will be \ndenied aid in 2005 because of a mandated 5-year time limit; 52,422 \nbabies in Ohio will be denied cash aid in 2000 because they were born \nto families already on welfare; 79,594 children in Ohio will be denied \nbenefits in 2000 should assistance levels be frozen at 1994 levels. In \ntotal, at least 262,000 children in Ohio would be denied benefits when \nthese welfare provisions are fully implemented.\n  Last year's Senate-passed bill would have pushed an additional 1.2 \nmillion children into poverty. In Ohio alone, 43,500 children will be \npushed into poverty by the bill now before us. Mr. President, I cannot \nsupport legislation that would cause this kind of unacceptable harm.\n  I have been concerned from the start that simply washing our hands of \nthe Federal responsibility for welfare and turning it over to States is \nno guarantee of success. This is very risky policy and we will no \nlonger have a mechanism for guaranteeing a national safety net for our \npoorest families.\n  Perhaps if we were more concerned with moving people from welfare to \nwork rather than just moving people off welfare we would be making a \nreal start. However, I am not convinced that merely putting a time \nlimit on benefits will lead to employment. I am not convinced that this \nlegislation ends welfare as we know it, it just ends welfare.\n  In the end Mr. President, the changes we contemplate today will take \naway from those least able to afford it and will have a devastating \nimpact on children's health, education, nutrition, and safety. \nProviding adequate assistance for our children will save money in the \nlong run and be cost effective. I oppose this bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the people of Minnesota and of the \nNation have made it clear that they want a welfare system that helps \npeople make a successful transition from welfare dependency to work. I \nsupport that goal. That is why I voted for a workfare proposal with a \ntough, 5-year time limit on welfare benefits. That workfare proposal \nwould move recipients quickly into jobs, requiring all able-bodied \nrecipients to work and turning welfare offices into employment offices. \nIt would provide adequate resources for child care, recognizing that \nfamilies can't realistically transition to the workplace unless their \nkids are being looked after. The bill was called work first because it \nprovided the tools needed to get welfare recipients into jobs and to \nkeep them in the workplace.\n  Unfortunately, work first, the workfare proposal I voted for, did not \nprevail in the Senate. Instead, we in the Senate are faced with a bill \nthat would punish innocent children. By sending an underfunded block \ngrant to States, this bill would obliterate the already frayed safety \nnet for children. Last year during this debate, the Office of \nManagement and Budget estimated that 1.2 to 1.5 million children would \nbe pushed into poverty by such a welfare reform proposal. About the \nsame number would suffer under this year's plan. The deep cuts in food \nstamps in this bill would mean that many thousands of children would go \nhungry. I will not sit back and vote for consigning 1 million children \nto poverty. I will not be party to actions that mean that there will be \nmore hungry and homeless children in the most prosperous Nation on \nEarth.\n  Unfortunately, the majority in the Senate did not agree to crucial \nimprovements to the legislation. When I asked that we look at the \neffect of this legislation on poor children and revisit this \nlegislation after 2 years if we find out that it is pushing more \nchildren into poverty, my colleagues turned me down. That was a clear \nsignal to me that the suffering of children is not being taken as \nseriously as it should be\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nby this Congress. When several Democratic Senators tried to allow \nStates to use their grants to provide vouchers for children's \nnecessities like disperse and clothes after their parents reached the \ntime limits for aid, we were turned down by the majority. When several \nDemocratic Senators tried to place more humane limits on the aid legal \nimmigrants could receive, we were again turned down by the majority. \nAnd although we were successful in ensuring that food stamps are not \nblock granted, I continue to have serious concerns about a bill that \ncuts $28 billion from food stamps, which provide the most basic \nnecessities.\n  In addition, I am very concerned that this bill will drop or deny SSI \nbenefits to over 300,000 children during the next 6 years. This was \nalso a concern I had with the work first bill I supported earlier. \nWhile I admit that there are some problems in the SSI Program, we can \ncertainly address the problems through more targeted reforms and \nregulatory changes.\n  I have voted for workfare. Indeed, I voted for an amendment to \nstrengthen the work requirements in this bill by requiring able-bodies \nwelfare recipients to participate in community service jobs within 2 \nmonths of receiving aid. I support moving families from welfare to \nwork. I believe we can accomplish that in a just and humane way. I do \nnot believe, however, that the bill we have before us today is just and \nhumane, and I will not vote to punish innocent children.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nfinal passage of the Republican welfare reform legislation. I will vote \nagainst this legislation simply because although it portends welfare \nreform, it is about neither welfare nor reform.\n  Let me be clear--I am certainly not against reforming our welfare \nsystem. Indeed, I have voted for welfare reform in the past because I \nagree that the current system is clearly broke and in dire need of \nrepair. But if we are going to have reform it should be meaningful and \nnot reform for reform's sake.\n  For me, meaningful welfare reform means concentrating on preparing \nindividuals to enter the work force. And by preparing individuals to \nenter the work force we must prepare them for all the challenges that \nlie ahead. It is important to note that the No. 1 reason people enroll \nfor AFDC benefits is divorce or separation.\n  No doubt, the American taxpayers who pay for this system and those \nwho are recipients of welfare programs want and deserve a better \nsystem. However, reform without the thought of consequence will do more \nharm than good.\n  Already 20 percent of our Nations children live in poverty, and \nundoubtedly this bill will add to that total--by the millions. And \nwhile AFDC caseload has decreased in Nebraska, child poverty continues \nto rise. Last year 3 percent of children in Nebraska were on AFDC, yet \n11 percent of children lived in poverty.\n  My friend, colleague and noted expert Senator Moynihan took to the \nfloor last week to report that more than one million children will be \nthrown off the welfare roles should this legislation become law. He \nsaid, ``It is as if we are going to live only for this moment, and let \nthe future be lost,'' Mr. President, surely what is before us is not \ntrue welfare reform. It is merely a way to cut the deficit on the backs \nof the neediest under the guise of welfare reform.\n  Indeed, this legislation does have its work provisions. I offered an \namendment accepted by both the Republican and Democratic leadership \nthat would allow states to contract--on a demonstration basis--with \ncommunity steering committees [CSC's] to develop innovative approaches \nto help welfare recipients move in to the workforce. The CSC's, created \nby the amendment, would be locally based and include educators, \nbusiness representatives, social service providers and community \nleaders. The main charge of the CSC's would be to identify and develop \njob opportunities for welfare recipients, help recipients prepare for \nwork through job training, and to help identify existing education and \ntraining resources within the community. As well, CSC's would focus on \nthe needs of the entire family rather than just on the needs of adult \nrecipients.\n  This is the type of work provision that works--and I support--because \nit encourages individuals on welfare to move into the work force. It \nprovides much needed resources so that once these individuals get into \nthe work force, it works to ensure they stay in the work force. But \nthis measure alone is not enough.\n  To keep a job, individuals--especially parents--need other things. We \nneed to make certain that every person who is moving into the ranks of \nthe employed has high-quality, affordable child care; otherwise, they \nare not going to be able to be successful in the workplace. We need a \nsystem that gives individuals the opportunity to earn reasonable wage, \nand to have access to health care, education and training. These are \nthe elements of a system that works and this is the kind of system we \nshould be working toward.\n  As a nation we need to focus our efforts on job creation, education \nand personal savings, as well as on meaningful reform to our \nentitlement programs. These elements, more than anything else, will \nhelp to ensure a brighter future for all working Americans.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today endeavors to move \nwelfare mothers into the work force, but it removes valuable resources \nthat would help the individuals achieve the goal of employment because \nit lessens their access to child care and health insurance.\n  There is a tremendous differential between the relative cost of child \ncare for somebody who is in the ranks of the poor and people who are \nnot poor. Above poverty, American families spend about 9 percent of \ntheir income for child care. Below poverty, it is almost 25 percent of \ntheir income. As well, as of 1993, 38 percent of working households \nunder the poverty line are uninsured. While health care reform \nlegislation that passed the Senate unanimously languishes, this \nlegislation, regrettably, makes health care pressures even harder to \nbare.\n  My Democratic colleagues offered an amendment that would have \nconverted funding formulas to help States--like Nebraska--with larger \nproportions of children on poverty. This provision would have provided \naid to States and individuals truly in need. The Senate voted this \nmeasure down, showing the true failings of this legislation--it denies \naid to those who are truly in need.\n  Other amendments designed to help children, but which failed, \nincluded an amendment that would have ensured health care and food \nstamps for children of legal immigrants, and an amendment that would \nhave provided vouchers for children whose families have hit the 5-year \nterm limit so that they may care for the children. But these important \nmeasures--which would have made the reform legislation more humane--\nfailed on party-line votes.\n  Mr. President, the people of the state of Nebraska--indeed most \nAmericans--are strongly in favor of welfare rules that give work a \ngreater priority than benefits. But much of this legislation is being \ndriven solely by the need to reduce the deficit and it has an \nideological bent to it that says it has to be one way or the other. The \nimpetus of this reform is not driven by a desire to say that the system \nis going to work better--it is sadly about matters of political \nexpediency.\n  By pushing mothers and an alarming amount of children off the welfare \nroles and further onto the fringe of society, this legislation will do \nmore harm than good. From a taxpayer standpoint, a beneficiary \nstandpoint, and a provider standpoint, we need a welfare system that \noperates in a more efficient, effective and hopefully humanitarian \nfashion. Unfortunately, this legislation does not offer the necessary \nreforms to bring us that system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since President Johnson declared his War on \nPoverty, the Federal Government, under federally designed programs, has \nspent more than $5 trillion on welfare programs. But, during this time, \nthe poverty rate has increased from 14.7 to 15.3 percent.\n  After trillions of dollars spent on welfare over the past 30 years, \nwe are still dealing with a system that hurts children, rather than \nhelps them. The current system discourages work, penalizes marriage, \nand destroys personal responsibility and, oftentimes, self-worth.\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\n  According to the Public Agenda Foundation, 64 percent of welfare \nrecipients agree that ``welfare encourages teenagers to have children \nout of wedlock,'' and 62 percent agree that it ``undermines the work \nethic.''\n  And, there are serious negative consequences when a child is born \nout-of-wedlock. Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially \nhigher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth weight. \nChildren born out of wedlock are more likely to experience low verbal \ncognitive attainment, as well as more child abuse, and neglect. \nChildren born out of wedlock are more likely to have lower cognitive \nscores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of \nbecoming teenage parents themselves. Children born out of wedlock are \nthree times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.\n  Who would not be full of despair and without hope for the future when \npresented with such a scenario?\n  S. 1956 seeks to change this by allowing States to design programs \nthat counter these trends, and to change general welfare policy so that \nit promotes work and marriage.\n\n\n                           State Block Grants\n\n  S. 1956 replaces the current AFDC and related child care programs \nwith a general block grant and a child care block grant.\n  Limited success in reforming welfare has occurred when States and \nlocalities have been given the opportunity to go their own way. In \nWisconsin, for example--and we all know that Wisconsin is waiting for \napproval of a waiver to continue to reform its welfare system--a \nsuccessful program there diverts individuals from ever getting on \nwelfare. Under a local initiative in the city of Riverside, CA, \nindividuals on welfare are staying in jobs permanently. In both \nWisconsin and Riverside, welfare rolls have been reduced.\n  Arizona is a good example of why reform is still needed. Arizona \napplied in July 1994 to implement a new State welfare program, EMPOWER, \nbased on work, responsibility, and accountability. It took the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services bureaucracy a full year to \napprove the waiver.\n  A shift to block grants to States make sense. By allowing States to \ndesign their own programs, decisions will be more localized, and the \ncosts of the Federal bureaucracy will be reduced.\n\n\n                        NonWork and Illegitimacy\n\n  It must be emphasized over and over that there are two fundamental \ndriving forces behind welfare dependency that must be addressed in any \nwelfare reform bill: nonwork and nonmarriage.\n  Nonwork and illegitimacy are key underlying causes of our welfare \ncrisis and, even with the effective elimination of the Federal welfare \nbureaucracy, they will remain as its legacy if we choose not to address \nthem. People will never get out of the dependency cycle if federal \nfunds reinforce destructive behavior.\n\n\n                                NonWork\n\n  Let us deal with the facts: To escape poverty and get off welfare, \nable-bodied individuals must enter and stay in the workforce. As Teddy \nRoosevelt said, ``The first requisite of a good citizen in this \nRepublic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his own \nweight.''\n  Another fact: The JOBS program that passed as a part of the Family \nSupport Act of 1988 moves a far too small number of welfare recipients \ninto employment. Less than 10 percent of welfare recipients now \nparticipate in the JOBS program.\n  In order to receive all of their block grant funding, under S. 1956, \nStates will be required to move toward what should be their primary \ngoal: self-sufficiency among all their citizens.\n  S. 1956 requires that 50 percent of a caseload be engaged in work by \nthe year 2002. There are work components of this bill that could be \nstrengthened but it provides a good beginning toward these goals. In \naddition, under S. 1956 welfare recipients must be engaged in work no \nlater than 2 years after receiving their first welfare payment. States \nmust also lower welfare benefits on a pro rata basis for individuals \nwho fail to show up for required work.\n\n\n                              Illegitimacy\n\n  Our Nation's illegitimacy rate has increased from 10.7 percent in \n1970 to nearly 30 percent in 1991. Eighty-nine percent of children \nreceiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is \npresent.\n  It must be reemphasized what role the breakdown of the family has \nplayed in our societal and cultural decline. This is not really even a \ndebatable point. The facts support a devastating reality. According to \na 1995 U.S. Census Bureau report, the one-parent family is six times \nmore likely to live in poverty than the two-parent family.\n  S. 1956 provides measures to combat illegitimacy, including providing \nan incentive fund for states to reduce illegitimacy rates.\n  In addition, Federal funds under the block grants, unless a State \nopts out, may not be used to provide additional assistance for mothers \nhaving additional children while on welfare. If the rules of welfare \nare stated clearly to a mother in the beginning, and if allowances are \nmade for noncash essentials like diapers and other items, then such an \napproach is fair. If such a rule reduces out-of-wedlock births, it may \nturn out to be more fair than most other aspects of welfare.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has passed welfare reform two other \ntimes, and twice the President has vetoed the legislation. There is an \nurgency to the task at hand. Children's lives are being compromised--it \nis time to work toward a system that is recognized for the number of \nchildren that never need to be on welfare, rather than the number of \nchildren who are brought into the failed welfare state. The Senate \nshould pass S. 1956.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 1962, President Kennedy, in his budget \nmessage to Congress, noted:\n\n       The goals of our public welfare program must be positive \n     and constructive. It must contribute to the attack on \n     dependency, juvenile delinquency, family breakdown, \n     illegitimacy, ill health, and disability. It must replace the \n     incidence of these problems, prevent their occurrence and \n     recurrence, and strengthen and protect the vulnerable in a \n     highly competitive world.\n\n  This statement presents the strong, initial common ground that we \nshare: that Government has a legitimate role in supporting our most \nhelpless and desperate families with dependent children.\n  Certainly, our second ground of agreement is that an appropriate \nwelfare policy should do nothing to harm the family being supported. \nFamilies are the foundation of our Nation's values. They teach us the \nprinciples of economics, the value of relationships, and the importance \nof moral truths. They define our view of work, responsibility, and \nauthority. They teach us the meaning of trust, the value of honesty, \nand are the wellspring of every individual's strength against \nalienation, failure, and despair.\n  During countless eras when no other organized unit of society even \nfunctioned, the family was the institution that made survival of the \ncultural, political, economic, and social order possible.\n  We should agree on what a welfare policy should protect--the family--\nand what it should protect against--dependence on the State. We should \nalso agree that this Nation's current welfare policy has diverged \ngreatly from President Kennedy's vision.\n  The Government has attempted to end poverty by establishing an \nengorged bureaucracy and writing checks, all told pouring over $5 \ntrillion into the war on poverty. At the same time, individual \ndependence on the Government has increased, individual dignity has \ndeclined, and the family has been dealt a near fatal blow.\n  Today, there are more people living in poverty than ever before--and \nthe only thing the Government welfare state has succeeded at doing is \nspawning generations of people who will be born, live, and die without \never having held a steady job, owned a home, or known the strength of a \ntwo parent family.\n  Individual dependence on the State has increased with every \nGovernment intervention. Indeed, the population receiving welfare \npayments receives checks for extraordinarily long periods of time. \nUnder current law, 25 percent of women can expect to receive those \npayments for more than 8 years. The typical recipient receives payments \nfor almost 4 years. Forty percent of recipients return to the welfare \nrolls at least once.\n  Government intervention has distorted the economic incentive system \nthat, at least in part, motivates a person to give of his labor. \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nintervention eliminates the need to work to support oneself and one's \nfamily by providing money regardless of whether one works. Dependence \non such a system is all but inevitable.\n  Given time, a cash payment that is not tied to a requirement to work \nwill undermine the second motivation to work; namely, the desire to \nproduce some benefit, whether tangible or intangible, for oneself or \nfor society. Who can doubt that a person experiencing such a \ndisconnection for any protracted period of time will eventually suffer \na loss of individual dignity as the welfare system undermines the moral \nand personal responsibility of the recipient?\n\n  Today however, we are turning to the issue of solutions. Whatever the \nproposed solution, we must gauge its effectiveness and desirability in \nterms of the three common grounds discussed throughout this debate. \nDoes our policy foster dependence on the Government or promote \nindependent action by the individual? Does it promote the dignity of \nthe human person or undermine it? Does it destroy the family or build \nit up?\n  I am convinced that we will only achieve successful welfare reform \nwhen we begin to emphasize personal responsibility. Unfortunately, for \nfar too long welfare programs supported by the Federal Government have \nfailed to acknowledge and promote personal responsibility, and many \nother core American values.\n  I would argue that the key goal of welfare reform must be to promote \nself-sufficiency. A beginning step toward self-sufficiency is to change \npeople's expectations about welfare. A recent GAO study noted that a \nkey challenge for States is to learn how to break the entitlement \nmentality--the view that public assistance is a guaranteed benefit. \nStates had to start helping individuals understand that a job was in \ntheir best interests.\n  One successful approach to encourage greater responsibility which is \nbeing experimented with by several States is the use of personal \nresponsibility agreements. I am proud to say that Indiana has been at \nthe forefront of helping individuals and families achieve long-term \nstability and self-sufficiency through the use of personal \nresponsibility agreements. With personal responsibility agreements, \nIndiana's welfare reform plan moves families away from dependence and \ntoward work. More than 39,000 individuals and families in Indiana have \nsigned personal responsibility agreements as of April 1996.\n  Indiana's agreements require that families who receive AFDC \nunderstand that welfare is temporary assistance, and not a way of life. \nThey must develop a self-sufficiency plan and go to work as quickly as \npossible, recognizing sanctions will be imposed for quitting a job, \nrefusing to accept a job or dropping out of the job program. Families \nmust also take responsibility for their children's timely immunizations \nand regular school attendance. Furthermore, their AFDC benefits will be \nlimited to the number of children in the family within the first 10 \nmonths of qualifying for AFDC. Teenage recipients must live with \nparents or other adults. And finally, families are limited to a 2-year \nperiod of AFDC assistance a job placement track.\n  The amendment proposed by Senator Harkin and myself last Thursday \nmakes it clear that States must develop these personal responsibility \nagreements, such as those required of families in both Indiana and \nIowa. This amendment is necessary because under current law States who \nwish to enter into this agreement with their residents, must first \napply to Washington for a waiver of current welfare laws. This \nrequirement to get permission from Washington for such common sense \nreforms not only steals valuable time from a State's reform efforts, \nbut also represents a completely unnecessary Government intrusion. This \namendment frees States from the extended negotiations that are now \nnecessary to receive a Federal waiver, and enables States to move \nforward from failed, dependence-ridden, welfare programs to programs \nwhich promote independence, self-sufficiency, and long-term economic \nstability.\n\n  Senator Harkin has been a real leader in the area of personal \nresponsibility agreements, having recognized early their success in the \nState of Iowa. He introduced a very similar amendment to H.R. 4 last \nyear which was ultimately dropped in conference. This year, personal \nresponsibility agreements are found in both the House welfare reform \npackage, H.R. 3507, and in the President's welfare bill. The amendment \nadopted here last Thursday requires States to adopt this common sense \nreform measure which ensures that everyone who receives assistance \nunderstands from day one that the assistance is a temporary measure \nintended to help the family achieve self-sufficiency and independence \nthrough employment.\n  Personal responsibility agreements help raise people's expectations \nwhile at the same time, giving them a clear goal and positive vision \nfor their future.\n  The time has come for us to reform our Nation's welfare system. A \nyear ago we passed legislation that is nearly identical to the bill \nbefore us today. We have adjusted the bill in many ways in an effort to \nfind the magic formula that would satisfy the opponents of real reform. \nWe have produced a solid package that is best described as a good first \nstep. And we are told that President Clinton may--just may--actually \nsign this bill.\n  This welfare bill makes several important changes to the existing \nsystem. It ends the Federal entitlement and places strict time limits \nand work requirements on welfare recipients. Most importantly, this \nbill turns the task of redesigning public welfare systems over to the \nStates. We will no longer be treated to the spectacle of Governors \ncoming to the Department of Health and Human Services to ask permission \nfor common-sense welfare reform measures.\n  The lesson for this protracted political exercise is that President \nClinton has abdicated leadership on welfare. In 1992, he promised to \nend welfare as we know it. In 1995 and 1996 he fought to preserve the \nstatus quo at every turn. Now, when pollsters and consultants tell him \nthat signing a welfare reform bill might help his reelection campaign, \nthe President has begun to edge his way toward the Rose Garden for a \nsigning ceremony--a ceremony that should have been held a year ago.\n  Welfare reform is simply too important for this kind of gamesmanship. \nIf President Clinton had signed this bill a year ago, we could have \nbegun the difficult task of changing a culture of dependence and \ndespair into a culture of self-sufficiency and hope. A year later our \npath has gotten longer and steeper and rockier. For tens of thousands \nthe habit of dependence has grown stronger while hope and will to \nchange have grown fainter. The burden of this failure falls not on \nCongress--we have done our job not once, not twice, but three times. \nThe burden of failure falls squarely on the shoulders of the President. \nThe very least he can do now is sign this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to say that I believe the chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee have done an excellent job in \nputting together this bill under very difficult budgetary \ncircumstances. They have done an exceptional job of protecting core \nprograms that are of utmost importance to the Nation's farmers, \nconsumers, and communities.\n  There is one provision in this bill that I think is of great \nimportance and deserves special mention, and that is the language with \nregard to cost containment for the WIC program.\n  I think it's fair to say that every Member of the Senate supports the \nWIC program. The long-term benefits accruing to society from ensuring \nadequate pre-natal and neo-natal nutrition have been well documented \nand uncontested.\n  A large portion of the cost of the WIC program is associated with the \npurchase of infant formula for WIC recipients. Fortunately, in recent \nyears competition between formula manufacturers bidding for WIC \ncontracts has led to significant savings in the program, with companies \noffering rebates on infant formula in order to win WIC contracts. \nUnfortunately, the competition that led to these rebates has been \ngreatly diminished by the recent withdrawal by one of the competitors, \nWyeth Laboratories, from the WIC infant formula market. Fortunately, \nanother formula manufacturer, Carnation, has recently entered the WIC \nformula market, which could help ensure competition and therefore help \ncontain\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nthe costs of the program. However, in many States, the price of \nCarnation formula is significantly cheaper than other brands of infant \nformula, which makes it difficult for Carnation to offer rebates as \nhigh as their competitors. However, Carnation may still be able to \noffer the lowest bid, if measured on a lowest net price basis.\n  Unfortunately, some States are awarding WIC formula contracts simply \non the basis of which company offers the highest rebate, as opposed to \nthe lowest net price bid. The detriments of this simplistic approach \nare two-fold. First, by focusing on highest rebate instead of lowest \nnet price, States are spending more for infant formula than they \nshould. Second, by biasing the WIC formula bid process toward the \ncompanies offering the highest rebate, States are effectively excluding \nadditional competitors, such as Carnation, from the WIC formula market, \nand thus jeopardizing future cost containment efforts.\n  To address this problem, the Senate Agriculture appropriations bill \nincludes language that requires States to award infant formula \ncontracts to the bidder offering the lowest net price, unless the State \ncan adequately demonstrate that the retail price of different brands of \ninfant formula within the State are essentially the same.\n  I commend the managers of the bill for including this common-sense \nlanguage, which I believe will help secure the long-term viability of \nthe WIC program. It is my hope that this provision will be maintained \nin conference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of S. \n1956, the Senate's latest attempt to reform the Nation's welfare \nsystem. On two occasions in the last year, the Congress has sent \nwelfare reform legislation to the White House, and on both occasions, \nour efforts have only been met with the veto pen. I sincerely hope \nthat, as the saying goes, the third time will be the charm.\n  S. 1956 is in many respects identical to H.R. 4, the welfare reform \nbill approved in the Senate with my support by a vote of 87 to 12 on \nSeptember 19, 1995. Again we are proposing to block grant the AFDC [Aid \nto Families with Dependent Children] program, giving over the \nresponsibility of day-to-day administration to the Nation's Governors, \nwhile requiring strict work requirements for able-bodied AFDC \nrecipients, 5 year maximum eligibility, limitations on non-citizens, \nand home residency and school attendance requirements for unmarried \nteenage mothers.\n  I am proud to report that these actions are in keeping with the \nimportant steps the Commonwealth of Virginia has already taken to \nreform our own State welfare system. What we in Virginia have \naccomplished under Governor George Allen through a laborious process of \ngaining Federal waiver authority, the Senate is now poised to approve \nfor the entire Nation.\n  In Virginia we call our welfare reform plan the Virginia Independence \nProgram, and we have successfully been in the implementation stage \nsince July 1, 1995. Our goals are simple and to the point: To \nstrengthen disadvantaged families, encourage personal responsibility, \nand to achieve self-sufficiency.\n  On a quarterly basis, and as resources become available in different \nState locales, we are requiring all able-bodied AFDC recipients to work \nin exchange for their benefits. Increased income of up to 100 percent \nof the poverty level is allowed while working toward self-sufficiency. \nThose unable to find jobs immediately will participate in intensive \ncommunity work experience and job training programs.\n  To ease the transition from dependence to self-sufficiency, we are \nalso making available an additional 12 months of medical and child care \nassistance. We understand that these benefits must be provided if \nsingle parents, in particular, are going to be able to fully \nparticipate in job training and new work opportunities.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up by saying that the Federal Government \nhas been fighting President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty for 30 \nyears. Aggregate Government spending on welfare programs during this \nperiod has surpassed $5.4 trillion in constant 1993 dollars. Despite \nthis enormous spending our national poverty rate remains at about the \nsame level as 1965.\n\n  Mr. President, the welfare system we have today is badly broken and \nwe must fix it.\n  I'd like to add a personal note to this debate. Yesterday, I had the \ngood fortune to visit a true laboratory of welfare reform in Norfolk, \nVA. This laboratory is entitled the ``Norfolk Education and Employment \nTraining Center'', otherwise known as NEET.\n  Mr. President, my visit with Norfolk city officials and the NEET \nemployees and students truly strengthened my belief that States and \nlocal communities--not the Federal bureaucrats in Washington--are best \nequipped to help individuals break out of welfare.\n  The city of Norfolk has done a superb job overseeing the NEET \nProgram. There is real cooperation between the city and the contracting \nprivate entity that is running the job training center. There was a \ngenuine pride in the faces of the city workers, NEET employees, and the \nNEET graduates and students.\n  I commend the city employees who work with the NEET Center, and in \nparticular, Ms. Suzanne Puryear, the director of the Norfolk Department \nof Human Services. I would also like to commend Ms. Sylvia Powell and \nthe other fine employees at the NEET Center. There is outstanding \ntalent in these two operations, and I believe the business community in \nNorfolk recognizes this.\n  Without getting into all of the details, I would like to note that \nindividuals referred to the center are given opportunities to develop a \nnumber of job skills, including computer work, and if necessary, the \nstudents are assisted with studying for and earning a GED. They are \nalso provided help with job interview preparation as well as actual job \nsearch and post-employment support.\n  Mr. President, there is tremendous talent among the NEET students and \ngraduates. Arlene Wright came to NEET as a welfare recipient. Today, \nafter some 7 months of training and a loan from NEET, Ms. Wright is the \nproud owner and director of the Tender Kinder Care day care center.\n  I also spoke with some of the students. One of the most poignant \ncomments came from Ray Rogers. In her words, Mr. President, Ms. Rogers \nsaid that NEET is the kind of program that ``helps you pick yourself \nup. You learn that you can take the things that you know and apply them \nto a job.''\n  Pick yourself up. These are very powerful words. It is time that more \nAmericans are helped to pick themselves up and not just be another \nstatistic waiting for another Government check. If we provide \nopportunity and instruction at the State and local level, there will be \nmore Ms. Wrights and Ms. Rogers and Nicole Steversons and others whom I \nmet yesterday in Norfolk.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the pending \nwelfare reform bill.\n  Last September, I voted for the Senate-passed welfare reform bill.\n  I did so then with substantial reservations about many of the \nprovisions in that bill. I do so today with many of the same kinds of \nreservations.\n  I am voting for this measure for two principal reasons.\n  First, I believe that the current welfare system is badly broken, and \nwe must find an alternative to the status quo. No one likes the current \nsystem, least of all the families trapped in an endless cycle of \ndependency, poverty, and despair. The current system is plagued by \nperverse incentives that discourage work. Reforming such a complex \nsystem requires taking some risks, and this bill, any welfare reform \nmeasure, entails some risks. However, some assumption of risk is \nnecessary to change the status quo.\n  Second, I am concerned that continuation of a system dominated by \ndetailed prescriptions from Federal officials in Washington may stifle \nthe innovative approaches from State and local governments that can \nhelp change the status quo.\n  The basic premise behind this bill, and much of the reform movement \ntoday, is that the current system has failed and that we ought to allow \nthe States the opportunity to try to do a better job and give them the \nflexibility to try new approaches to these seemingly intractable \nproblems. This approach places a great deal of faith in the good will \nof State governments to implement programs designed to help, not \npunish, needy citizens.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  Under the framework provided by this legislation, States like \nWisconsin would have the opportunity to implement programs like the \nWisconsin W-2 program without the necessity of securing numerous \nwaivers from the requirements of current law. Indeed, passage of this \nmeasure will render moot much of the need for the current voluminous \nwaiver application filed by the State of Wisconsin earlier this year \nwhich has caused much controversy. Although some aspects of the W-2 \nprogram, particularly those dealing with Medicaid services, may still \nrequire review by HHS, the block grant authority provided for under \nthis legislation is designed to allow the broad flexibility and State \ncontrol needed to implement State initiated welfare reform programs.\n  As a former State legislator myself, I have a good deal of respect \nfor the desire of State and local officials to reform this system and \nhelp break the cycle of poverty for low-income families. I believe that \nthere need to be certain underlying protections that are national in \nscope. For example, I believe civil rights protections must be uniform \nthroughout our Nation to assure that the guarantees of our Federal \nConstitution are extended to all citizens, regardless of their place of \nresidence. I also believe that where Federal funds are being expended, \nthe Federal Government has an obligation to impose certain requirements \nthat should be universal. But States should have sufficient flexibility \nto design how services are actually provided to allow them the \nopportunity to try out new ideas and approaches.\n\n  For these reasons, I voted last September for the Senate-passed \nwelfare reform bill; at that time, however, I indicated that if the \nbill returned from conference with punitive, inequitable provisions, I \nwould withdraw my support. Unfortunately, the conference returned a \nbill which incorporated provisions that were simply unacceptable. The \nbipartisan welfare reform measure that the Senate had crafted was \ndiscarded in favor of a measure based upon the House-passed bill, which \nwas punitive in nature rather than focused upon helping families move \nfrom welfare to the workforce. I therefore voted against that measure.\n  I am pleased to say that the Senate, over the course of this debate, \nhas crafted a measure which will make fundamental changes in the \nFederal role in the welfare area and at the same time has rejected \nvarious provisions which would be harmful to those most in need. The \nSenate has addressed several important issues and corrected some of the \nflaws in the legislation.\n  First, in the area of child care, the Senate bill provides more \nresources for child care services than contained in the bill we passed \nlast fall. Specifically, the bill increases funding for child care \nservices by almost $6 billion to $13.8 billion from $8 billion \ncontained in last year's bill. The Senate also adopted Senator Dodd's \namendment by a vote of 96 to 0 which reinstated critical health and \nsafety standards for licensed child care facilities.\n  Second, by adopting the Chafee-Breaux amendment relating to Medicaid \ncoverage for needy children, the Senate provided a critical safety net. \nAs we endeavor to reform cash grant programs, it is important that \naccess to medical care is not inadvertently sacrificed. The Chafee-\nBreaux amendment reestablished these protections. Had Chafee-Breaux not \nbeen adopted, I would not have been able to accept this bill.\n  Third, the Senate bill retains a State maintenance of effort \nrequirement at 80 percent of the 1994 contribution. That is the \nprovision the Senate adopted last fall which was unfortunately diluted \nin the conference version. Restoration of this provision was also key \nfor me. Without such a maintenance of effort requirement, Federal \ndollars would simply replace State contributions and States like \nWisconsin which make substantial contributions to investing in welfare \nprograms would have simply seen their dollars shifted to States which \nfail to make these kinds of commitments from their State treasuries.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate struck the language providing for \nimposition of a family cap which would prohibit States from providing \nassistance for children born while a family is on welfare. This is \nanother example of where the conference report that the President \nvetoed contained language that had been rejected by the Senate. \nMoreover, the bill that was presented to the Senate last week contained \nthis unfortunate language. However, this family cap language was struck \nby a Byrd point of order.\n\n  The Senate also wisely adopted the Conrad amendment that struck \nprovisions that would have allowed block granting of foods stamps. Food \nstamps have been the mainstay of many families who have been thrown \ninto dire circumstances because of a sudden job loss, an unexpected \nillness that has sidelined the family breadwinner, or other family \nmisfortunes. Although the bill provides strong work incentives to make \nsure that individuals receiving these benefits are working toward self-\nsufficiency, it no longer allows this safety net program to be \nwithdrawn entirely from needy families.\n  Mr. President, although the Senate rejected many onerous amendments \nand provisions, there remain provisions in the bill that I don't \nsupport.\n  This is not a reform bill that I would have drafted if I had been the \nauthor.\n  I believe the immigration provisions are too harsh and fail to \nprovide the kind of balanced response that we strived to achieve in the \nimmigration reform legislation now pending in conference. While I \nsupport the concept of deeming, the kind of absolute ban on assistance \nfor many legal immigrants which is contained in this bill is not \ncarefully tailored to preserve scarce resources while still providing \nhumane, essential services to those individuals who have come to this \ncountry legally.\n  I am concerned that the Senate narrowly rejected the Ford amendment \nwhich would have allowed States to provide noncash vouchers to provide \nservices for children when their families reached the 5-year time limit \nof eligibility for cash assistance. I have repeatedly voted to support \nallowing vouchers in such circumstances. I think it is a reasonable \nresponse to make sure that young children are not denied basic support \nwhen their parents fail to make the transition into the work force \nwithin the designated time period. I recognize that the bill allows a \nState to exempt 20 percent of their caseloads from the time-limit \nprovisions, but I do not believe that this is adequate protection for \nthe children involved.\n  I also fear that the level of cuts in food stamp funds may be too \ndeep, and will hurt needy families. These cuts may need to be \nrevisited, either in conference or in other legislation.\n  I remain uncertain about ultimate wisdom of terminating our 60-year \nFederal commitment of a guaranteed Federal safety net for young \nchildren. The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has been an eloquent \nleader in articulating the dangers of eliminating this entitlement \nprotection for needy children and replacing it with a patchwork quilt \nof State programs. Clearly, there will be States that will fail to use \nthis opportunity to enact real welfare reform measures and instead, \npursue punitive measures designed to stigmatize those who seek welfare \nassistance in times of need. Children in these States will be harmed by \nnot having the Federal safety net that exists today in the AFDC \nprogram. On the other hand, if a number of the States use this \nopportunity to help devise effective ways to help families move out of \nwelfare and into the work force, many children will benefit from the \nhigher incomes and better opportunities they will have.\n\n  We are faced with a difficult choice, Mr. President. On the one hand, \nchildren are hurt by the current system; yet, many may be hurt by the \nloss of this Federal safety net. The bill does contain assessment \nprovisions that will allow Congress to make changes, if necessary, if \neliminating the entitlement under Federal law causes undue hardships. I \nthink those of us who vote for this experiment need to watch carefully \nhow it is implemented and be prepared to take action if the results \nfall short of what we hope will occur.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset, I am voting for this bill \nbecause we cannot continue the current system. I am hopeful that the \nStates will seize this opportunity to develop approaches that will help \nwelfare recipients and their families become economically self-\nsufficient, rather than punishing those who fall through the system. I\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nbelieve that the problems of welfare policy are so complex and \ndifficult that it is a mistake to believe that there is only one \napproach that will work. This bill is intended to encourage State \nexperimentation with approaches that will work.\n  In the final analysis, Mr. President, this vote challenges us to \ndecide whether or not we want to perpetuate the status quo. In my view, \nthe status quo is unacceptable. Therefore, I will support this \nlegislation and the effort to bring about fundamental welfare reforms.\n\n\n                     South Dakota's Workfare Works\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the Senate once again nears final \naction on a workfare bill, I am reminded of an old commonsense saying, \n``Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and \nyou feed him for a lifetime''. This sums up the clear, fundamental \ndifference between today's failed liberal welfare system and the \ncommonsense reform bill before us. The current welfare system has \nfailed. We all know it. Instead of assisting needy Americans, the \ncurrent system holds Americans down, perpetuates a cycle of dependency, \nincreases moral decay, and cripples self-respect. Welfare was meant to \nbe a safety net, not a way of life. The bill before us would change the \nsystem and the lives of many Americans for the better. This bill would \nrestore the values of personal responsibility and self-sufficiency by \nmaking work, not Government benefits, the centerpiece of welfare. I am \nproud to be a part of the team that has brought this historic \nlegislation to the floor.\n  Why does the current system not work? Generations of able-bodied \nfamilies have stayed on the dole rather than work. The rationale is \nsimple: Welfare recipients today can sit at home and make more each \nweek than individuals working full time on the minimum wage. This \ndisincentive to work is an insult to hardworking Americans. In essence, \nwe have a Government program that challenges the American work ethic. \nSouth Dakotans demonstrate that a hard work ethic provides for \nthemselves and their families. Many work long hours, seek overtime, or \nhave two, even three jobs to make ends meet. Imagine how they must feel \nwhen their tax dollars are used to support Americans who need not work. \nI can tell you how they feel--upset. If we work for our wages, welfare \nrecipients should work for benefits. That is why we need workfare.\n  I am pleased Chairman Roth included my workfare amendments during the \nFinance Committee's markup consideration of welfare reform. These \namendments would ensure that welfare recipients put in a full work \nweek, just as other Americans do, in order to receive benefits. These \nentitlements would increase the number of welfare recipients who must \nwork and avoid a liberal loophole to avoid real work.\n  Workfare is not a new idea. Fifteen years ago, South Dakotans wanted \nto address their own special needs and develop real solutions for their \nwelfare system. South Dakota wanted workfare, not welfare. The problem \nis, Federal law makes it difficult to experiment with workfare, \nespecially since the current administration has sought to protect the \ncurrent, failed system. For example, in August 1993, South Dakota \nsought a Federal waiver to operate a workfare program. That waiver took \nnearly a year to approve. Today, South Dakota has a system that \nrequires recipients to sign a social contract and imposes a tough 2-\nyear time limit on benefits. This approach has worked. South Dakota has \nsuccessfully decreased its welfare caseload by 17 percent since January \n1993 and saved more than $5.6 million. South Dakota's experience is \nproof that workfare works.\n  Just as important are the success stories behind the statistics--the \nSouth Dakotans who have moved from welfare to work. Let me share two \nsuch stories about two very special ladies with unique circumstances: \nMarilou Manguson of Rapid City and Belinda Mayer of Sioux Falls. They \ndeserve our praise. Marilou and her 10-year-old son were receiving AFDC \nand food stamps. When she applied for welfare, she was informed she \nwould have to get a job. For 4 months, Marilou attended computer and \naccounting courses, and prepared every day for interviews with the \nSouth Dakota Job Service Job Club. Two weeks later she found a full \ntime job with a government sales agency. In contrast, 20 years ago, \nwhen Marilou was on welfare, she says all one needed to do is show up \nto get a check. Marilou now knows the old system didn't help her. She \nsaid, ``You can't just sit at home and do nothing. You have to get out \nand do something for yourself.'' She's absolutely right. Today, Marilou \nis not receiving any welfare assistance.\n\n  When Belinda Mayer's ex-husband quit paying child support, she was \nleft to care for a child, but was only earning $6 per hour. Belinda \napplied for welfare benefits so she could obtain a 2-year accounting \ndegree from Western Dakota Technical Institute [WDTI] and, hopefully, \nfind a better job. She continued to receive benefits while she went to \nschool and was able to obtain child support. This May, Belinda \ngraduated and found a job right away as a commercial service specialist \nwith Norwest Bank in Sioux Falls. For Belinda, welfare reform is a very \nimportant issue. As she says, help should be there, ``but it should not \nbecome a crutch'' for people. Both of these women can look forward to a \nvery stable, solid future for themselves and their families. I am very \nproud of their hard work and applaud their efforts.\n  Their success is South Dakota's success. South Dakota has reached out \nto enable those in times of difficulty to regain control of their \nlives.\n  These examples demonstrate that workfare is achieving success at the \nlocal level. South Dakota was fortunate to get its waiver approved to \nrun a workfare program. Other States are still waiting for waiver \napproval. This waiver process reflects a basic problem: a one-size-\nfits-all system run by Federal bureaucrats. Welfare cannot be solved \none waiver at a time. Federal bureaucrats have worked to preserve the \ncurrent, failed system by being slow to approve State waivers. That \nmust change. States should be given the flexibility to seek solutions \nand alternatives to welfare problems. I have more faith in South \nDakotans' dedication to welfare reform than I do in Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  Clearly, we need greater State flexibility also because there is not \na grand, ``one-size'' solution to ending welfare dependency. Welfare \nreform programs in Oglala, Fort Thompson, or Rapid City, SD may not \nnecessarily work in Los Angeles or New Orleans. South Dakota's welfare \nproblems are unique, and even differ greatly from our nearest \nneighbors. My State has three of the five poorest counties in the \ncountry. We have some of the lowest wages in the country. We also have \nthe highest percentage of welfare recipients who are Native Americans. \nIn some reservation areas, unemployment runs higher than 80 percent. \nLong distances between towns and a lack of public transportation and \nquality child care are further barriers to gainful employment.\n  To promote greater State flexibility, the bill before us would \nprovide welfare assistance in the form of block grants to the States. \nBlock grants would give States the freedom to craft solutions that best \nserve local needs. It has been proven time and again that Washington \nbureaucrats cannot understand unique local needs from thousands of \nmiles away. The distance, both literally and figuratively, that \nseparates Washington from our cities and towns prevents the most \nappropriate solutions from being tailored to our problems.\n\n  Workfare is not just about restoring responsibility at the individual \nand State level, it is about protecting children in need. The workfare \nbill before us would ensure that children have quality food and \nshelter. This bill would increase our investment in child care by $4.5 \nbillion and increase child protection and neglect funds by $200 million \nover current law. What this bill eliminates is cumbersome bureaucracy \nand needless regulations.\n  The bill also would strengthen child support enforcement and give \nStates new tools to crack down on deadbeat parents. These reforms \nrepresent the toughest child support laws ever passed by Congress. One \nwoman in South Dakota has informed me that her ex-husband owes her \nthousands of dollars in overdue child support. For her and many other \nparents in the same difficult situation, this bill would help. The \ncurrent system fosters illegitimacy and discourages marriage and\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nparental responsibility. Real welfare reform should promote the basic \nfamily unit, and crack down on those who deliberately walk away from \nmeeting the needs of their children. The disincentives to a sound \nfamily structure also must be changed. More and more children are \ngrowing up without the moral guidance and financial support of parents, \nespecially fathers. This is a tragedy of our time.\n  We also no longer can tolerate the blatant abuses of the system. Last \nyear, I was shocked to learn the extent to which prisoners are able to \ncontinue to receiving welfare benefits. The workfare bill we passed \nlast year included my amendment to crack down on prisoner welfare \nfraud. I am pleased this provision is in the current bill. It would put \nan end to cash payments to alcohol and drug addicts, which only \nsubsidizes their habits.\n  Several years ago, President Clinton promised America he would change \nwelfare as we know it. Two years ago, Congress made the same promise. \nLast year Congress delivered on that promise and passed workfare. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that workfare bill. I hope the \nPresident will do the right thing this time and support our workfare \nlegislation.\n  Again, I am proud to be part of this effort to enact workfare \nlegislation. The workfare bill before us would end welfare dependency \nby requiring work and placing a time limit on benefits. We can change \nthe welfare system and encourage people to become self-sufficient and \nproductive members of society, once again. We can provide more \nprotection for children. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will show the same support for workfare that we demonstrated last \nyear. Americans deserve more than a handout for today, they deserve the \nhope and happiness that come through personal financial independence \nand the self-realization of work.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nbefore us to reform our failed welfare system. I commend the majority \nleader for getting this legislation to the floor--I know it has taken a \nconcentrated effort to bring us to this point.\n  Since the beginning of the 104th Congress, we have been debating the \nstate of this Nation's welfare system. Everyone understands that the \nsystem is broken. It encourages illegitimacy. It fails to recognize the \nimportance of marriage and family. It offers no hope or opportunity for \nthose Americans who are trapped within its layers of bureaucracy.\n  Of course, it was not supposed to be this way.\n  After signing the 1964 Welfare Act, President Lyndon Johnson \nproclaimed, ``We are not content to accept the endless growth of relief \nrolls or welfare rolls,'' and he promised the American people that \n``the days of the dole in our country are numbered.'' The New York \nTimes predicted the legislation would lead to the restoration of \nindividual dignity and the longrun reduction of the need for Government \nhelp.\n  In 1964, America's taxpayers invested $947 million to support welfare \nrecipients--an investment which President Johnson declared would \neventually, quote, ``result in savings to the country and especially to \nthe local taxpayers'' through reductions in welfare caseloads, health \ncare costs, and the crime rate. Yet, 30 years later, none of those \npredictions have materialized, and the failure of the welfare system \ncontinues to devastate millions of Americans every day--both the \nfamilies who receive welfare benefits and the taxpayers who subsidize \nthem.\n  Despite a $5.4 trillion investment in welfare programs since 1964, at \nan average annual cost that had risen to $3,357 per taxpaying household \nby 1993:\n  One in three children in the United States today is born out of \nwedlock.\n  One child in seven is being raised on welfare through the Aid to \nFamilies with Dependant Children Program.\n  And our crime rate has increased 280 percent.\n  Mr. President, those are the kinds of devastating statistics which \nuntil the 104th Congress were ignored by the bureaucratic establishment \nin Washington. Those are the statistics this legislation will finally \naddress. By rewriting Federal policies and working in close partnership \nwith the States, we can create a welfare system which will effectively \nrespond to the needs of those who depend upon it, at the same time it \nprotects the taxpayers.\n  Our legislation sets in place the framework for meeting those needs \nby offering opportunity, self-respect, and most importantly, the \nability for those who are down on their luck to take control of their \nown lives.\n  And yes, we are asking something of them in return.\n  The most significant change in our welfare system is that we will \nrequire able-bodied individuals to work in exchange for the assistance \nthey receive from the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the floor repeatedly \nthis session to suggest that our present welfare system promotes \ndependency by discouraging recipients from working. In fact, the \nGovernment routinely makes it so easy for a welfare recipient to skip \nthe work and continue collecting a Federal check that there's \nabsolutely no incentive to ever get out of the house and find work. And \nif someone actually takes the initiative to get a job, they risk \nforfeiting their welfare benefits entirely.\n\n  Last year, during Senate consideration of the ``Work Opportunity \nAct,'' Senator Shelby and I joined forces to ensure that welfare \nrecipients receive benefits only after they work. After all, American \ntaxpayers are putting in at least 40 hours on the job each week, and \nare sometimes forced to take an additional job or work overtime hours \njust to make ends meet. I believe welfare recipients should be held to \nthe same standards, the same work ethic, to which the taxpayers are \nheld. Those beliefs are reflected in this legislation.\n  Under our pay-for-performance provisions, welfare recipients will be \nrequired to work in exchange for their benefits. If an adult is not \nemployed within 2 years, the benefits will stop. Is that enough of a \npush to make a difference? Yes, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It released a report this month which estimates these tough \nwork requirements will put 1.7 million people who are currently on \nwelfare into the work force. That is almost four times the number of \nwelfare recipients who are working today.\n  To ease their transition into the job market and help single parents \nfind accessible and affordable child care, we fold seven major Federal \nchild-care programs into a child care and development grant, with total \nfunding of $22 billion over 7 years.\n  In addition, Mr. President, our bill recognizes that locally elected \nofficials--our State legislators and Governors--are more capable than \ntheir unelected counterparts in far-off Washington to administer \neffective programs on the State and local level. And so this welfare \nreform legislation will give States like Minnesota the flexibility to \nmake their own rules and develop their own innovative programs, and in \ndoing so assist those who need our help most.\n  But despite all the good this legislation will accomplish, I must \ntemper my enthusiasm with my disappointment that the only way to move \nthis bill forward was to strip away its Medicaid reform provisions. Mr. \nPresident, the administration cannot hope to resolve the problems with \nthe Medicaid system by turning its back and pretending these problems \ndo not exist. At some point, they will be forced to deal with a system \nthat is too unwieldy and unable to fully serve the needy. By demanding, \nby threat of veto, that we tackle Medicaid another day, the \nadministration has ensured that political gamesmanship has won out over \npolitical will.\n  The sensible Medicaid reforms outlined in the original reconciliation \npackage would strengthen the system by increasing Medicaid spending \nfrom $96.1 billion in 1996 to $137.6 billion in 2002. That is an \naverage annual rate of growth of 6.2 percent. States would be given \nadditional flexibility in delivering care, while Federal protections \nwould be maintained to ensure that those who need Medicaid's assistance \nwill not be denied.\n  Unfortunately, those reforms will now have to wait. But I can assure \nyou that they will be revisited--if not by this Congress and this \nadministration, then certainly by the next.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today to overhaul our failed \nwelfare programs is a positive step away from a system which has held \nnearly three\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\ngenerations hostage with little hope of escape. Only through its \nenactment can we offer these Americans a way out, and a way up.\n  As Americans, we need to look within ourselves rather than continuing \nto look to Washington for solutions. Does anybody really believe the \nFederal Government embodies compassion, that it has a heart? Of course \nnot--those are qualities found only outside Washington, in America's \ncommunities.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no one I can think of who better exemplifies \nheart and compassion than Corla Wilson-Hawkins, and I was fortunate to \nhave had the opportunity to meet her. She was one of 21 recipients of \nthe 1995 National Caring Awards for her outstanding volunteer service \nto her community.\n  Corla is known as Mama Hawk because, more than anything else, she has \nbecome a second mother to hundreds of schoolchildren in her West Side \nChicago community, children who, without her guidance, might go without \nmeals, or homes, or a loving hug.\n  Mama Hawk gives them all that and more, and she and the many caring \nAmericans like her represent the good we can accomplish when ordinary \nfolks look inward, not to the Government--and follow their hearts, not \nthe trail of tax dollars to Washington.\n  Mama Hawk tells a story that illustrates how the present welfare \nsystem has permeated our culture and become as ingrained as the very \nproblems it was originally created to solve.\n  These are her words:\n\n       When I first started teaching, I asked my kids, what did \n     they want to be when they grew up? What kind of job they \n     wanted. Most of them said they wanted to be on public aid. I \n     was a little stunned. I said, ``Public aid--I did not realize \n     that was a form of employment.'' They said, ``Well, our mom's \n     on public aid. They make a lot of money and, if you have a \n     baby, they get a raise.''\n\n  Mr. President, that is the perception--maybe even the reality--we are \nfighting to change through the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Act of 1996. While there is more to accomplish, this bill \nis a good first step toward fulfilling a promise to truly end welfare \nas we know it.\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Senator Roth, the budget reconciliation bill \n(S. 1795) includes a proposal that is in the jurisdiction of the Senate \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources. As you know, last year during \ndebate on the welfare bill, the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAmendments Act of 1995 (S. 850), which was approved unanimously by the \nLabor Committee on May 26, 1995, was incorporated into H.R. 4. And H.R. \n4 was then included in last year's budget reconciliation bill. During \nthe conference on last year's budget reconciliation bill, conferees \nfrom the Labor Committee and the Finance Committee reached agreement on \na unified system for all Federal child care assistance, including child \ncare assistance for low-income working families as well as for welfare \nfamilies and for families at risk of becoming dependent on welfare. \nThis consolidation and unified system for child care is a major \nimprovement over current law.\n  I would also like to bring to your attention a proposal contained in \nthe House reconciliation bill that falls within the jurisdiction of the \nLabor Committee. The House bill incorporates the Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act Amendments of 1995 (S. 919), which was unanimously \napproved by the Labor Committee on July 18, 1995. Although this \nproposal was not included in S. 1795, it will be considered during the \nbudget reconciliation conference.\n  Because of the unique procedures that apply to budget reconciliation \nbills, the Labor Committee was not given the opportunity to mark up the \nchild care proposal in S. 1795 and the child abuse authorizations in \nthe House bill. I am concerned that members of the Finance Committee \nwill be negotiating changes in these Labor Committee programs during \nthe budget reconciliation conference without any input from the \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  Senator ROTH. Let me assure the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources that I recognize that the child \ncare and development block grant is within the jurisdiction of the \nLabor Committee, with the Finance Committee retaining jurisdiction over \nthe entitlement funds for child care that flow through this program. As \nyou know, the Finance Committee's entitlement funds must be used to \nprovide child care services to families receiving assistance under the \nnew TANF block grant, families transitioning from welfare to work, and \nfamilies at risk of becoming dependent upon welfare. I also recognize \nthat the Labor Committee has jurisdiction over the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. Mr. President, I request that a copy of a letter sent to \nChairman Roth by myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats, and Senator \nDodd and a copy of S. 850, the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAmendments Act of 1995, as approved by the Senate Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources, be made a part of the Record. The text of S. 919, \nthe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Amendments, as approved by \nthe Senate appears in the Congressional Record of Friday, July 19, \n1996.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                    Labor and Human Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: It is our understanding that the Committee on \n     Finance intends to mark-up reconciliation language based on \n     S. 1795, the ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Act of 1996.'' We presume that the Committee on Finance \n     intends to include provisions in Title VIII on child care and \n     provisions in Title VII on child abuse and neglect that were \n     part of last year's conference agreement on welfare reform. \n     Because this language will be reported by the Finance \n     Committee to the Senate Committee on the Budget as part of \n     budget reconciliation, it will have special status during \n     floor consideration of the legislation. One of the conditions \n     of that special status is that extraneous provisions are not \n     in order. Section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget \n     and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended by the ``Byrd \n     Rule,'' creates a point of order against extraneous \n     provisions that are ``. . . not in the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee with jurisdiction over said title or provision.''\n       We are making recommendations to the Committee on Finance \n     in an effort to facilitate the reconciliation process. \n     However, we strongly believe that it must be made clear that \n     the budget procedures in no way alter existing jurisdiction \n     over child care and child abuse/neglect. In order to make \n     this clear, we expect to engage in a colloquy when the \n     reconciliation bill comes to the floor, rather than using the \n     Byrd rule to preserve the committee's jurisdiction.\n       Titles VII and VIII of S. 1795 include extraneous \n     provisions in the form of changes in authorizations under the \n     jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources. Last year, during the development and \n     consideration of the welfare provisions in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1996 and the welfare reform bill, members of \n     the Labor Committee were active participants. The child care \n     and child abuse and neglect provisions in the Senate-passed \n     welfare reform bill were, in fact, Labor Committee-passed \n     bills and were included in the conference negotiations for \n     both the Balanced Budget Act of 1996 and the welfare reform \n     legislation. Both of these Labor Committee bills were passed \n     with strong bipartisan support. To meet the requirements of \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the \n     Labor Committee's child abuse and neglect provisions were \n     dropped from the conference report for the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1996, but were included in the welfare reform \n     legislation.\n       Members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources were conferees on the Balanced Budget Act of 1996, \n     due to the inclusion of the child care provisions and House \n     inclusion of the child abuse and neglect provisions. If this \n     bill were going through the normal legislative process for \n     changes in authorization bills, the Committee on Labor and \n     Human Resources would be entitled to make modifications to \n     the provisions under its jurisdiction. However, because the \n     Finance Committee has included changes in Labor Committee \n     programs in the Medicaid-welfare reconciliation bill, the \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources will be precluded from \n     the opportunity to make changes in the bill.\n       Under these circumstances, we recognize that the only way \n     that revisions can be made to programs under the jurisdiction \n     of the Labor Committee is to have these changes made during \n     Finance Committee consideration of the Medicaid-welfare \n     reconciliation bill. In anticipation of the mark-up of the \n     legislation by the Finance Committee, we would like to \n     recommend several modifications to the Labor Committee \n     provisions in the bill.\n       In ``Title VIII--Child Care:''\n       1. Maintain the health and safety standards in current law;\n       2. Increase the set-aside for activities to improve the \n     quality of child care from 3 percent to 4 percent;\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\n       3. Increase the age from under six (6) to under eleven (11) \n     when a single custodial parent could not be sanctioned for \n     failing to meet the work requirements if adequate, affordable \n     child care is not available; and\n       4. Require the states to maintain 100 percent of 1995 child \n     care funding to be eligible for additional child care funds.\n       All of the recommended modifications to Title VIII were \n     passed by the House Committee on Economic and Educational \n     Opportunities.\n       In ``Title VII--Child Protection Block Grant Programs and \n     Foster Care, Adoption Assistance and Independent Living \n     Programs'' of the Finance Committee bill, a number of \n     authorizations that are in the jurisdiction of the Committee \n     on Labor and Human Resources are rewritten to be consolidated \n     into block grants. These changes have never been formally \n     considered, or debated by the full Labor Committee. In \n     addition, the Medicaid-welfare reconciliation bill even \n     strikes several important provisions that were included in \n     the last year's reconciliation conference report and reported \n     out by the relevant House committees in this year's \n     reconciliation bill. Specifically, those provisions concern \n     the prompt expungement of child abuse records on \n     unsubstantiated or false cases; the appointment of guardian \n     ad litems; and the inclusion of material in support of the \n     state's certification concerning the reporting of medical \n     neglect of disabled infants.\n       We look forward to working with the members of the Finance \n     Committee on this legislation and being formally included in \n     the conference negotiations on provisions under the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n       Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n     Dan Coats,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Children and Families.\n     Edward M.

Mr. President, I ask the chairman if it is his \nunderstanding that this bill should not undermine or contradict the \nviolence against women act?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, that is my understanding.\n\n\n            reconciliation, the deficit and senate procedure\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the Democrat side of the aisle, the \ncharge has been made that we are abusing reconciliation in a way that \nhas never been done before. Reconciliation is a process that is \ndesigned to allow expedited consideration of the budget. The budget has \nbecome an extremely controversial issue and efforts to include \nextraneous matter in reconciliation has led to abuse in the past by \nboth Republicans and Democrats.\n  We adopted in the Byrd rule in 1985 to prohibit the inclusion of \nextraneous matter in reconciliation. Making determinations on whether \nsomething is extraneous falls on the shoulders of the Parliamentarians. \nThis is a small office, comprising just three Parliamentarians, that \nmust make judgments on very controversial and complicated issues in a \nvery short period of time. I think they do their best to apply a very \nambiguous standard against very complicated and lengthy reconciliation \nlegislation.\n  With Republicans in control of the Senate and the House, we have \nheard from Democrats that reconciliation is being abused. Just for the \nrecord, let me read a couple of statements made by Senators Chafee and \nDanforth during consideration of the 1993 omnibus reconciliation bill, \na reconciliation bill that was considered when the Democrats were in \ncontrol of the Senate.\n  The conference report on the 1993 reconciliation bill comprised \nPresident Clinton's controversial budget package. This legislation \nincluded provisions that had nothing to do with deficit reduction \nregarding bovine growth hormones and a national vaccination program. \nSenator Danforth raised a point of order and the Chair ruled against \nhim. Senator Danforth then appealed the ruling of the Chair.\n  During the debate on the appeal, Senator Chafee effectively stated \nthat the Chair's ruling made a ``complete joke out of the Byrd rule'' \nand Senator Danforth implied that the Byrd rule was being applied on a \n``whimsical basis'' and that ``anything goes'' under the standard that \nwas being used for the Byrd rule's enforcement in 1993.\n   Mr. President, during consideration of the budget resolution, the \ndistinguished minority leader raised a point of order against the \nbudget resolution because it ``creates a budget reconciliation bill \ndevoted solely to worsening the deficit''. The Presiding Officer did \nnot sustain that point of order and the Senate upheld the Chair's \nruling on an appeal. I do not want the Senate to be left with the \nimpression that the budget act allows Congress to use reconciliation to \ngenerate an unlimited number of bills that would increase the deficit \nunder reconciliation procedures. Such a use of reconciliation would be \nclearly abusive.\n  We had no intention of using reconciliation to increase the deficit. \nIn\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nfact, the budget resolution we adopted and the reconciliation \ninstructions it includes will not only reduce the deficit, it will \nbalance the budget. Even if an effort was made to use reconciliation \nsolely to increase the deficit, the budget rules would have prohibited \nit.\n  The budget act grants special status in the Senate to reconciliation \nlegislation and any effort to abuse this process represents an abuse of \nthe Senate. While I do not think we have abused reconciliation, I was \ntroubled by the minority leader's point of order and I want to review \nwith the Senate what has occurred since the minority leader made his \npoint of order and inquiries of the Chair. I think this is particularly \nimportant as we proceed with reconciliation legislation.\n\n  The minority leader's chief concern was that reconciliation should \nnot be used to increase the deficit. The Senate-reported budget \nresolution included three sets of reconciliation instructions to \ngenerate three individual reconciliation bills. The first bill would \nreduce outlays by $124.8 billion and the second by $214.8 billion. The \ntwo bills combined would reduce the deficit by $339.6 billion. If, and \nonly if, these two bills were enacted, then a third reconciliation \ninstruction would be triggered to reduce revenues by not more than \n$116.1 billion. In addition, under the Senate's pay-as-you-go point of \norder legislation cannot cause an increase in the deficit unless it is \noffset by previously enacted legislation. Even undue the Senate-\nreported resolution, reconciliation could not increase the deficit. In \nfact, reconciliation had to result in an overall reduction in the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, the minority leader's concern focused on the third \ninstruction in the resolution that called for a reconciliation bill \nthat would reduce revenues by not more than $116.1 billion and would \nreduce outlays by $11.5 billion. The minority leader was correct that \nthird reconciliation bill viewed alone would increase the deficit; \nhowever, we would never have gotten to that third bill without first \nhaving done the first two bills.\n  In conference, we modified the reconciliation instructions to permit \na reduction in revenues in the first instruction. Since the outlay \nreductions in this first instruction exceeded the revenue reduction, \nthis first bill could not increase the deficit. Therefore, \nreconciliation could not be used in this first bill to increase the \ndeficit. The resolution also provides a revenue reduction instruction \nfor the third reconciliation bill if the revenue reductions are not \nincluded in the first bill.\n  As the minority leader pointed out during consideration of the budget \nresolution, under one of the Byrd rule points of order--section \n313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget Act--a provision of a reconciliation bill is \nsubject to the Byrd rule if it would cause an increase in the deficit \nin a year after the period covered by the reconciliation instructions \nand it is not offset by other provisions in the bill. In addition, the \npay-as-you-go point of order prohibits consideration of legislation \nthat would increase the deficit unless it was offset by the enactment \nof other legislation that reduced the deficit. The Parliamentarian made \nit clear to us that the budget resolution could not and the fiscal year \n1997 budget resolution does not include provisions to exempt \nreconciliation from any Senate rule, the Byrd rule, budget act rules, \nor even the pay-as-you-go rule.\n  While this first instruction called for a reduction in revenues, both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate have chosen not to include \nrevenue reductions in their first reconciliation bills. While the \nSenate did agree to an amendment that would cause a reduction in \nrevenues from an adoption tax credit, this amendment was only adopted \nafter the Senate voted 78 to 21 to waive a budget act point of order \nagainst this amendment.\n  This first reconciliation bill will reduce spending and the deficit \nby over $50 billion. We have spend almost a week on this legislation \nand considered over 50 amendments. In addition, the minority has \nexercised its rights under the Byrd rule and the presiding officer has \nsustained points of order against 23 provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. President, the resolution calls for two more reconciliation \nbills. I do not know if we will complete action on these two subsequent \nreconciliation bills. If we do, these subsequent bills must comply with \nthe Byrd rule, budget act guidelines, and the pay-as-you-go point of \norder. Therefore, our resolution never allowed and Senate rules would \nnot have permitted using reconciliation to increase the deficit.\n\n\n                        Abandoning Our Children\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a historic and unfortunate \ntime for the U.S. Senate. This body is on the verge of ending a 60 year \nguarantee that poor children in this country would not starve.\n  For 60 years, we could rest easier at night knowing children across \nthe country had a minimal safety net. The bill before us will take away \nthis peace of mind and throw up to 1.5 million children into poverty.\n  Mr. President, I agree that the welfare system is in need of repair. \nI believe that it needs to help promote work and self sufficiency. I \nthink it should also protect children. Unfortunately, the Republican \nwelfare bill does none of this.\n  First, the Republican bill does not promote work. The bill calls for \nwork requirements for welfare recipients, but it does not provide the \nresources to put people to work. In fact, the CBO said that ``Most \nstates would be unlikely to satisfy this [work] requirement for several \nreasons.''\n  One major reason is that this bill cuts funding for work programs by \ncombining all welfare programs into a capped block grant.\n  Second, the Republican bill hurts children. It would make deep cuts \nin the Food Stamp Program which millions of children rely on for their \nnutritional needs. It would also end the guarantee that children will \nalways have a safety net.\n  Under the Republican bill, a State could adopt a 60-day time limit \nand after that the children would be cut off from the safety net \nentirely. The State would not even be required to provide a child with \na voucher for food, clothing, or medical care.\n  When you take all of these policies together, this bill will throw \napproximately 1.5 million children into poverty.\n  And this is a conservative estimate. It could be much higher.\n  Mr. President, my conscience will not let me vote for a bill that \nwould plunge children into poverty. I cannot vote to leave our children \nunprotected. I was 1 of only 11 Democrats to vote against the original \nSenate welfare bill that would have put 1.2 million children into \npoverty.\n  I voted against the conference report on this bill that would have \ndoomed 1.5 million children to the same fate. And I will vote against \nthis bill for the same reason. We must not abandon our children.\n  Mr. President, I hold a different vision of what the safety net in \nthis country should be. I am afraid that this bill will leave children \nhungry and homeless.\n  I am afraid that the streets of our Nation's cities might some day \nlook like the streets of the cities of Brazil. If you walk around \nBrazilian cities, you will see hungry children begging for money, \nbegging for food, and even engaging in prostitution. I am not talking \nabout 18 year olds, I am talking about 9 year olds.\n  Tragically, this is what happens to societies that abandon their \nchildren.\n  When we don't protect our children, they will resort to anything to \nsurvive.\n  I don't want to see this happen in our country.\n  I want to see this country invest in its children. I think we should \ninvest more in child care, health and nutrition so that our children \ncan become independent, productive citizens. I want to give them the \nopportunity to live the American dream like I had to good fortune to \ndo.\n  If we don't, we will create a permanent underclass in this country. \nWe will have millions of children with no protection. We will doom them \nto poverty and failure.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee, I also want to \ncomment on the priorities that are reflected in this reconciliation \nbill. Despite the fact that this bill is only limited to safety net \nprograms, it is still considered a reconciliation bill. This bill \nreceives the same protections as a budget balancing bill but there is \nno balanced budget in it.\n  This reconciliation bill seeks to cut the deficit only by attacking \nsafety net\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nprograms for poor children. There are no cuts in corporate loopholes or \ntax breaks. Despite the fact that tax expenditures cost the Federal \nTreasury over $400 billion per year, there are no such savings in this \nbill.\n  There are no grazing fee increases or mining royalty increases. There \nare no savings in the military budget or in NASA's budget.\n  The only cuts in this bill come from women and children. This \nreconciliation bill gives new meaning to putting women and children \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. I urge \nall Senators to stand for the 1.5 million children and reject this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe our welfare system \ndesperately needs reform, and most Americans agree. It is obvious that \nthere is a strong consensus that parents seeking public assistance must \nbe required to work or prepare for work. I wish it were more obvious \nthat innocent children should be protected, and I have worked hard to \nmake this case over the years as welfare reform has been debated.\n  As Governor of West Virginia in 1982, I started one of the first \nworkfare programs of the country because I believe in work, and I am \nproud that West Virginia continues to use this community work program \ntoday. I have met parents who are proud to do community service and who \nhave used their experience to gain skills that ultimately got them a \npaying job. This is what we should do. Moving from welfare dependency \nto work is hard, but it is the best path for families and their future.\n  While the debate about welfare reform is full of slogans and \nsimplistic claims, it is far from easy to achieve the fundamental goals \nof promoting work and protecting children. The details of welfare \nreform do count, and that's why the Congress has consumed so much time \nand energy on this topic.\n  I regret that the Senate found itself acting on welfare reform under \nthe rules of budget reconciliation legislation, which has strictly \nlimited our debate to just 20 hours and has drastically constrained our \nability to consider amendments to modify the proposal. Using \nreconciliation procedures, the majority has taken advantage of a \nspecial way to prevent its notion of welfare reform from being subject \nto true debate and alterations.\n  Last year, when the Senate worked on a bipartisan welfare reform \nbill, we spent 8 days debating welfare reform and held 43 rollcall \nvotes. In an important signal of bipartisanship, an additional 62 \namendments were accepted. While Democrats did not prevail with all of \nour amendments, we did have the chance to present our ideas and \narguments for a genuine test of the Senate's will. It is unfortunate \nthat the Republican leadership was not willing to take up welfare \nreform this year in the same fair, open process.\n  But even under the rules and constraints of reconciliation, some \nbipartisan progress has been made on the Senate floor. We have restored \nthe Federal health and safety standards for child care by a rollcall \nvote of 96 to 0. We agreed to another amendment to invest more money to \nenhance the quality and availability of child care. Child care is the \nkey to helping parents work, and parents need to have confidence in the \ncare that their child is receiving.\n\n  I was also proud to cosponsor the Chafee-Breaux amendment to ensure \ncontinued Medicaid coverage to poor women and their children. Welfare \nreform should not be about reducing health care to needy families, and \nthanks to the bipartisan vote of 97 to 2, we know that health care \ncoverage will be available for families with parents who are making the \nstruggle to go from welfare to work--now and into the future.\n  We eliminated the optional food stamps block grant which had the \npotential to unravel this country's commitment to ensuring decent \nnutrition for all poor children, needy families, and dependent senior \ncitizens, no matter what State they reside in. An optional block grant \nof food stamps could have weakened the country's nutrition programs. \nOne of my greatest fears is that States that choose the block grant \nwould be forced to reduce benefits in times of recession or other times \nof need, like national disasters. With our agricultural resources, \nAmerica should not go backward and become a nation where some of its \npeople and children go hungry.\n  And, I cosponsored the Breaux voucher amendment which assured basic \nsupport for innocent children for at least 5 years, and then gave \nStates the option to provide non-cash assistance to children after a \nfamily reached the 5 year time limit. This amendment got 51 votes, but \nthe rules of reconciliation demanded 60--so it fell.\n  An alternative amendment was offered by Senator Ford, but it also \nfailed by a a single vote. Because both of the voucher amendments \nfailed, States are prohibited from using block grant funding to provide \nvouchers for children, and this is disturbing. Previous welfare bills \nfrom last year offered greater flexibility to States on vouchers.\n  But some of the amendments that passed are important bipartisan \nefforts to improve the bill. There is more we should do to protect \ninnocent children, and I can only hope that our colleagues will \nunderstand this in conference or in the near future.\n  But time has run out under the rules of reconciliation, and we now \nare faced with a final vote on this legislation.\n  In my view, this welfare reform bill poses a huge experiment--and \nsomething that must be watched and evaluated carefully.\n  Proponents express full confidence that this new, bold welfare reform \nbill will change the system and put parents to work, quickly allowing \nchildren to benefit as their parents move from dependency to self-\nsufficiency.\n\n  Opponents of the legislation charge that millions of children may be \ncast into poverty, and potentially end up on streets.\n  Because people end up on welfare for such different reasons and in \ndifferent circumstances, it is not clear what the results will be. This \nlegislation charts a new course for welfare, but it is untested.\n  I hope that proponents are right, and that this legislation has the \nright incentives. My hope is that the new pressure of a time limit will \neffectively and efficiently move parents into work, and families will \nbenefit.\n  To help ensure this, I fought hard throughout this Congress to secure \nthe proper funding for child care, which is essential for single \nparents to go to work. Thanks to the effort of many dedicated Members, \nthis legislation invests $13 billion in child care--more money than we \nare now spending, and this is a major accomplishment.\n  The legislation we are now considering has a larger contingency fund \nthan the previously passed Senate bill to offer help to States in times \nof economic downturns and recessions, which is especially needed for \nStates like West Virginia that are vulnerable to economic ups and \ndowns.\n  Under the new block grant, States will have enormous flexibility--and \nstrict requirements--to move families from welfare to work.\n  Will the combination of more child care money and the incentive of \ntime limits be the right mix? Will our economy continue to grow, and \nunemployment rates stay low so welfare recipients truly have a real \nchance to compete and get jobs?\n  We will never know the answers, unless we try.\n  Because the American people want and expect welfare reform, I will \nvote to try this new approach--and hope that Congress does its part to \npush for the desired results.\n  But I also believe that this effort must be watched carefully and \nclosely to ensure that the innocent children, who represent two-thirds \nof the people who depend on welfare, are not hurt.\n  This is why I fought so hard with others last year to secure $15 \nmillion for research and evaluation. Every Member who votes for this \nlegislation has an obligation to work with their State to ensure that \nthis new system works, and to monitor the national progress as well.\n\n  Throughout this debate, I have tried to focus my attention on the \nneeds of children. As usual in today's political environment, areas of \nbipartisan agreement do not attract attention, but they are still \nimportant.\n  In key areas for children, progress has been made. The Senate bill \nretains current law on foster care and programs to protect abused and \nneglected\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nchildren. Such children are the most vulnerable group in our country, \nand I was active in a bipartisan group dedicated to retaining the \nfoster care entitlement and prevention programs for abused and \nneglected children.\n  The child support enforcement provisions in the legislation are \nanother example of positive, bipartisan efforts. And because it was \nbipartisan, little attention has been given to these accomplishments. \nBut these provisions include bold action to crack down on deadbeat \nparents who shirk their obiligation to pay child support. Currently, \nover $20 billion is uncollected in child support payments and \narrearages. Strengthening child support enforcement will truly help \nchildren of all income levels, and this is meaningful action to \nunderscore the importance of families, and support children.\n  There has been a sincere effort to improve this bill, and the \npositive changes are the result of untold hours of hard work and \ndedication.\n  The key point is that the current system does not have public support \nor confidence, and this is not healthy for the country. The cynicism \nand frustration we see among Americans toward Government stems partly \nfrom their anger about welfare. Even families dependent on our existing \nsystem admit that they are frustrated and that the system can trap \nfamilies into a cycle of dependency. We need to make the leap with real \nchanges, tougher rules, and more common sense. We have an opportunity \nto help families and build more support for the protections that should \nstay in place, if the job is done right. A great deal has been promised \nby the architects of this bill and others such as many Governors, and I \nhope we will see the hard work, skill, and compassion required to bring \nabout the right kind of results.\n  Today, I cast my vote for change.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am forced to vote against a \nwelfare reform measure that I believe is bad for children and bad for \nthe State of California, costing my State billions of dollars.\n  This is a difficult vote for me because I stand in favor of welfare \nreform. I want to get people off welfare and put them to work. I voted \nin favor of the Senate welfare reform bill last year because I support \nthis principle.\n  I also continue to support giving States additional flexibility to \nrun their welfare programs, cracking down on deadbeat parents and \nreducing teen pregnancy.\n\n\n                          Costs to California\n\n  In California today, we have approximately 4 million legal immigrants \nresiding in our State--40 percent of the Nation's legal immigrants. \nThus, the proposed cuts in benefits to legal immigrants will have a \ndramatic and disproportionate impact on California, which Senator \nFeinstein and I have quantified as best we can.\n  This bill saves nearly $60 billion over 6 years. Where do these \nsavings come from? More than one-third of the savings will come from \nrestricting benefits to legal immigrants. Of this amount, California \nwill have to shoulder 40 percent of the losses. This is simply unfair \nto California.\n  It has been estimated that California's loss of Federal funds under \nthis bill could be up to $9 billion over 6 years due to the \nrestrictions on benefits to legal immigrants.\n  This will mean a massive cost shift to California's 58 counties. For \nexample, over half of the immigrants on Supplemental Security Income \n[SSI] and Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC] live in \nCalifornia. According to the California State Senate Office of \nResearch, over 230,000 aged, blind and disabled legal immigrants could \nlose their SSI benefits almost immediately. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that 1 million poor legal immigrants would be denied \nFood Stamps under the bill, with many of them living in California.\n  If legal immigrants are made ineligible for Federal and State \nprograms, California's counties will be responsible for providing \nsocial services and medical care to them. Under California law, \ncounties are legally and fiscally responsible to provide a safety net \nto indigent persons.\n  The safety net is already overburdened in many counties. Some of the \ncounties most heavily impacted by legal immigrants have already faced \nissues of bankruptcy. This welfare bill will only further threaten the \nfinancial viability of these counties.\n\n  The largest county in the Nation, Los Angeles County, will be \nseverely impacted by these provisions. Los Angeles County estimates \nthat under this bill, 93,000 legal immigrants would lose their SSI \nbenefits in their county alone. If these legal immigrants applied for \ncounty general assistance, it would cost Los Angeles County $236 \nmillion.\n  California counties further fear damage to their health system if the \nState exercises its option to deny all Medicaid coverage, including \nemergency care, to most legal immigrants.\n  That is why I cosponsored an amendment with my distinguished \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, to mitigate some of the \nimpact of the legal immigrant provisions on California. The Feinstein-\nBoxer amendment would have applied legal immigrant provisions of the \nbill prospectively. This would allow us to make changes for immigrants \nwho have yet to enter the country, but keep the rules of the game \nunchanged for those legal immigrants already present.\n  I think it is important to note who some of these legal immigrants \nare. Many of them are children. Many of them are disabled and unable to \nwork. Many of them are refugees, with no sponsor to fall back on if \nthey are cut off from the assistance they desperately need. According \nto the California State Senate Office of Research, approximately 60 \npercent of legal immigrants receiving AFDC in California are refugees.\n  The Feinstein-Boxer amendment would have decreased the outflow of \nFederal dollars from California, while maintaining what I believe is a \nfair approach for legal immigrants already in our country. \nUnfortunately, our amendment failed.\n\n\n                         Vouchers for Children\n\n  A second reason why I cannot support this bill is the prohibition on \nproviding vouchers for noncash items to children if their family's time \nlimit for assistance has expired. Vouchers could be used to pay for \nitems such as school supplies, diapers, food, clothing and other \nnecessary items for children. An amendment to require States to give \nvouchers to children whose families exceed time limits shorter than 5 \nyears did not pass in the Senate. An amendment to give States the \noption to do this failed as well with only two Republicans voting in \nfavor.\n  I believe the bill's language goes too far to penalize children for \ntheir parents' inability to find work. What kind of country are we when \nwe deny such necessities to innocent children?\n\n\n                              Food Stamps\n\n  In addition, the bill would make major cuts in funding to the \nexisting Food Stamp Program. Reductions in the bill for food stamps \namount to approximately $27.5 billion over 6 years--nearly half of the \nbill's savings. By the year 2002, food stamp spending would be reduced \nby nearly 20 percent. The poorest households would be affected since \nnearly half of the cuts in food stamps would come from households with \nincomes below half of the poverty line.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  The drafters of this latest welfare reform bill wisely improved \ncertain provisions of the bill to increase child care funding, retain \nthe Federal guarantee to school lunch programs--although funding for \nschool lunch has been unwisely cut, and maintain child protective \nservices for abused and neglected children.\n  In addition, key amendments to maintain Medicaid coverage for current \nwelfare recipients, strike the optional food stamp block grant, and \nensure Federal health and safety standards for child care successfully \npassed the Senate.\n  I wholeheartedly support all of these improvements to the underlying \nlegislation.\n  However, for the reasons I have stated above, I cannot support this \nwelfare reform bill that shifts major costs to the State of California \nand shreds the safety net for poor children. I hope that in conference \nmy concerns will be addressed. One State should not be unfairly \npenalized as California is, and no child should suffer as a result of \nour work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will vote for the welfare reform bill \nbefore\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nus today because I believe the welfare system in this country is broken \nand needs to be fixed.\n  The welfare system serves no one well--not recipients and not \ntaxpayers. We need to preserve a safety net for those who truly need \nhelp, but that safety net should be one that encourages work, \nfacilitates self-reliance, and doesn't punish innocent kids.\n  The legislation before us is not perfect, and I have concerns about \nmany aspects of the bill.\n  Despite my reservations, this bill permits us to move the welfare \nreform process forward. This bill requires recipients to work after \nreceiving welfare for 2 years, and set a 5-year limit on total \nassistance. It permits recipients to use some of their time on \nassistance to get the education and training they need to find and keep \na job. It provides child care for welfare recipients who want to work. \nIt places a priority on preventing teen pregnancies. And it requires \nabsent fathers to help pay for the costs of raising their children.\n  And we have made some important improvements since this bill was \nintroduced. We increased the requirement that States continue to make \ntheir own contributions to maintaining a strong safety net. We \nstrengthened provisions to guarantee that the Food Stamp Program will \nprovide assistance when people need it most. And we restored money for \nthe summer food program for kids.\n  I will support this legislation despite my reservations, and advance \nthe bill to conference with the hope that it will be further improved \nin conference. If the final bill does not maintain a strong safety net \nfor children, I will not support it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was ready to vote for a welfare reform \nbill today. I believe we need welfare reform. I have fought for a tough \nwelfare reform bill, and I have voted for welfare reform.\n  It is deeply disappointing to me that I must vote against final \npassage of this bill.\n  I voted for the bill which the Senate passed last year. I hoped at \nthat time that the conference on that bill would make even further \nimprovements in the bill, and that we would be able to send a good bill \nto the President for his signature.\n  I was disappointed when the conferees last year took an acceptable \nbill and turned it into an unacceptable and punitive one. Welfare \nreform was within our grasp last year. But we let it slip away by \nplacing political considerations ahead of sound policy decisions. I \nhope we will not make the same mistake this year.\n  I have not only voted for welfare reform, but I am one of the \ncoauthors of the work first bill, which would have ended welfare as we \nknow it. Along with my coauthors, the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle and Senator Breaux, I am proud that we crafted a plan that is \ntough on work but not tough on children.\n  Our plan called for a time-limited and conditional entitlement. It \nwould have required all able-bodied adults to go to work. Our plan \nprovided people with the tools to move from welfare to work; tools like \njob training, job search assistance, and most importantly, child care.\n  We recognized that the No. 1 barrier to work is the lack of \naffordable child care. So our bill provided sufficient funds to ensure \nthat child care would be available to families as parents moved into \nthe work force.\n  The work first bill also protected children. We made sure that our \nreform was targeted at adults not at children. We included provisions \nto ensure that no child would go hungry or go without needed health \ncare because a parent had failed to find and keep a job.\n  So let me be clear. I support welfare reform. Throughout this \nCongress, I have fought for welfare reform. I have coauthored not one, \nbut two, major welfare initiatives. And I had hoped to be able to vote \nfor a welfare reform bill today.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot vote for this bill. This bill does not \nprovide adequate protection for children. What will happen to children \nonce their parents reach the time limit for benefits? Without vouchers \nto ensure that the basic subsistence needs of children are met, we know \nthat children will suffer if their parents have not found jobs. We \nsimply cannot punish children for the shortcomings of their parents.\n  Although we adopted a good amendment today to prevent the Food Stamp \nProgram from becoming a block grant, this bill still contains deep cuts \nin food stamps. Families who depend on the Food Stamp Program to meet \ntheir basic nutritional needs will suffer from the cuts in this bill. \nEven families with full-time workers sometimes need food stamps because \ntheir full-time jobs don't provide enough money to feed their families. \nThis bill will hurt them too.\n  This bill does not provide enough money for child care. In fact, it \nis likely that States will be unable to meet the work requirements of \nthe bill because of the inadequate level of child care funding. Parents \nwho are ready to work and who want to work will not be able to work if \nthere is not child care which is both affordable and available.\n  These holes in the safety net for children are of deep concern to me. \nIf protecting children is a priority for this Congress, how can we take \na chance on a bill which is sure to hurt innocent children. We cannot.\n  Mr. President, I have not given up on welfare reform. While I cannot \nvote ``yes'' for this bill today, I hope that the conference on the \nbill will continue to build on the progress we have made on this issue. \nUnlike last year's conference, which took an adequate bill and made it \nunacceptable, I hope that this year's conference will make a good, \nstrong bill out of this unacceptable bill.\n  I urge the conferees on the bill to continue to work with the White \nHouse and with the best minds from both parties to reach agreement on a \nplan we can all support, and that the President will sign. We can do \nit. We can have a plan that saves lives, saves tax dollars, creates \nopportunities for work, and protects children.\n  I hope the conferees will negotiate in good faith to achieve a plan \nthat is tough on work and protects kids. I would be proud to vote for \nthat plan.\n\n\n                            protect children\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is nothing more important to this \ndebate today than constantly reminding ourselves that our focus ought \nto be this Nation's children and their well-being. That was the focus \nwhen, under Franklin Roosevelt's leadership over 60 years ago, title \nIV-A of the Social Security Act was originally enacted. As we proceed \nin this debate about children--and it is a debate about children \nbecause over two-thirds of current welfare recipients indeed are \nchildren--their interests should be uppermost in our minds.\n  There is no disagreement that I can find in this Chamber, and very, \nvery little across the Nation, that our welfare system needs reform. \nDespite what on the part of many who have been involved in legislating, \nimplementing, and administering the existing welfare program is good \nfaith and intentions, that welfare system has been buffeted by the \nforces of society and culture; for far too many it offers little real \nhelp or incentives for movement toward self-sufficiency. Instead, for \nfar too many, it has become at best an indifferent means of providing a \nbare subsistence income.\n  In many ways, our world and our Nation are very different places than \nwhen the original Federal welfare program was established in the \nthirties. The objective, Mr. President, ought to be the same. But the \nmeans must be adjusted. The objective is to prevent human misery, to \ngive Americans, especially children, a helping hand when they otherwise \nface destitution and poverty. A handout may once have functioned with \nconsiderable effectiveness to help those in poverty toward that \nobjective. Now we understand the importance of child care, training, \nwork search assistance, health care, and other ingredients if families \nare to move toward self-sufficiency.\n  We know that 15.3 million children in this Nation live in poverty. \nThis means that 21.8 percent of our children--over one in five \nchildren--are impoverished. In Massachusetts, there are more than \n176,000 in this category. Despite the stereotypes, Mr. President, the \nmajority of America's poor children are white--9.3 million--and live in \nrural or suburban areas--8.4 million--rather than in central cities \nwhere 6.9 million of them reside.\n  The other point on which we can agree, because it is a fact rather \nthan an opinion, is that the child poverty\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nrate in this Nation is currently dramatically higher than the rate in \nother major industrialized nations. According to an excellent, \ncomprehensive recent report by an international research group called \nthe Luxembourg Income Study, the child poverty rate in the United \nKingdom is less than half our rate--9.9 percent, the rate in France is \nless than one-third our rate--6.5 percent, and the rate in Denmark--3.3 \npercent--is about one-sixth our rate.\n  We know that poverty is bad for children. This for many would qualify \nas a truism, but perhaps others require to be shown. Nobel Prize-\nwinning economist Robert Solow and the Children's Defense Fund recently \nconducted the first-ever study of the long-term impact of child \npoverty. They found that their lowest estimate was that the future cost \nto society of a single year of poverty for the 15 million poor children \nin the United States is $36 billion in lost output per worker. When \nthey included lost work hours, lower skills, and other labor market \ndisadvantages related to poverty, they found that the future cost to \nsociety was $177 billion.\n  Mr. President, the way in which the Republicans who control both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives repeatedly have attempted to \nreform welfare is not what I believe this Nation wants or believes is \nthe proper way, the best way, or the moral way to address poverty and \nmillions of families that are not self-sufficient in our late 20th \ncentury society. A number of the components of Republican co-called \nwelfare reform proposals, even charitably, can best be described as \npunitive, or budget driven. I simply recoiled as I reviewed proposals, \nfor example, to eliminate the access of children to health care. I \nshook my head in disbelief as I read provisions that would deny food \nstamps--and very probably a minimally nutritious diet--to children \nwhose parents in some cases have made unacceptable choices, no matter \nhow misguided and unacceptable they are.\n  But we are faced here, in the institution that has been elected by \nthe people of the United States to make the Nation's major policy \ndecisions and to design its major government interactions with those \npeople, with the necessity to work together to produce change. Either \nwe struggle successfully to reach some kind of middle ground which a \nmajority can accept, or we do nothing at all.\n  Surely, in welfare as in all other areas, there are those who so fear \nchange--for any of a host of reasons--that they prefer the status quo. \nI do not believe the status quo best serves this Nation and its people. \nI do not believe the status quo best serves this Nation's future. And I \ndo not believe the status quo best serves those who are the \nunfortunate, the impoverished, the destitute, the left out in our \nNation.\n  Democrats have labored mightily to turn a punitive bill into one that \nwill work, one that would be desirable for the country. I was \npersonally involved in that effort. Last week, I offered an amendment \nthat the Senate approved by voice vote which makes what I believe to be \nan important change. In keeping with my belief that we must keep our \neye on the ball as we legislate--and that objective in this case is to \nreduce poverty and increase the self-sufficiency of America's poor \nfamilies--my amendment provides that if a State's child poverty rate \nincrease by 5 percent, then the State must file a corrective action \nplan with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If States can--\nas they and the Republican authors of this bill fervently maintain they \ncan--achieve economies of scale never realized when the program was \noverseen by the Federal Government, and successfully refocus the \nprogram on moving the family heads in welfare families and other \nimpoverished families toward self-sufficiency, then child poverty \nshould decrease. More children, and more families, will be better off \nif this new approach works. But if that is not the outcome--if child \npoverty increases, then my amendment will require States to confront \nthat reality and to adjust in an attempt to meet the program's \nobjectives. I and many others will be watching extremely closely to see \nhow the program works, and to see how this adjustment mechanism I \nauthored functions.\n\n  And if neither the program nor the adjustment mechanism functions \nacceptably, I will be the first to fight to devise a new approach. \nUltimately, if we are sending Federal money to the States to combat \npoverty, we must demand that poverty recede.\n  When I came to the Senate floor this morning, I was gravely concerned \nthat the democratic process, as it often will, had produced an \nunacceptable product. Despite the addition of my amendment and some \namendments by others, this bill still tore huge holes in the safety \nnet.\n  Today, repair stitches were made in two of the most distressing of \nthese holes. The Senate voted to maintain the current eligibility \nstandards for Medicaid, ensuring that those who now qualify for medical \nassistance, including those who do so by virtue of their eligibility \nfor the welfare program the legislation would abolish, will continue to \nqualify for medical assistance. The repair made by the Chafee-Breaux \namendment was of great importance.\n  The Senate also voted to preserve the Food Stamp Program as a Federal \nassistance program that will be available to all Americans on the basis \nof the same income and assets limits that now apply. That means the \nFood Stamp Program will continue to operate as a safety net on a \nnational basis, ensuring that, at the very least, Americans can eat--\nand that the assistance will fluctuate as it must based on economic \nconditions across the Nation. The Department of Agriculture had \nestimated that, if the block grant originally proposed in this \nlegislation had been in place during the last national recession, 8.3 \nmillion fewer children would have been served by the program. Under \nthis bill, not only would they not have had food stamps, many of them \nwould have had no welfare either. Where would they have been, Mr. \nPresident? Fortunately, we stitched up this hole today.\n  When I cast my vote for final passage, I will be very mindful of \nthese critical changes today. I also will be mindful of the fact that \nthis bill was in several ways better than the welfare reform \nlegislation that the Senate passed last fall. This bill includes nearly \n$4 billion more for day care for the children of parents required to \nfind and hold jobs. It includes a $2 billion contingency fund to help \nStates as they try to help what inevitably will be a growing number of \nimpoverished people when recessions hit, as they unquestionably will.\n\n  I also will be acutely mindful, Mr. President, of the limits to which \nI am willing to go with this experiment called for by President Clinton \nduring the 1992 Presidential campaign and endorsed by the Republican \nParty in the 1994 congressional elections. Ideally, this bill will be \nimproved and strengthened in conference committee. That is certainly \npossible if the President, who has been very quiet when asked how he \nbelieves this bill must be augmented, will clearly enunciate what he \nbelieves to be essential ingredients if he is to sign welfare reform \nlegislation into law. I maintain hope that we can provide vouchers that \nwill continue to provide basic human necessities for children whose \nparents hit the lifetime assistance limit imposed by this bill. I also \nhope that the cutoff of legal immigrants will be rethought and at the \nvery least made less severe. The President can and I hope will lead the \nway in both these matters and others.\n  At the very least, Mr. President, there must not be reversion or \nerosion in this legislation. We must not see retrenchment with regard \nto those few hard-won improvements that make this bill a marginally \nacceptable risk. It is time for an experiment that we hope will improve \nthe lives and opportunities of millions of families and their children. \nIt is not time to take frightful risks with those lives, based on a \ngroundless faith that harsh discipline will remedy all social ills. I \nmust serve notice that if the legislation that returns for final Senate \napproval increases those risks, I will oppose it.\n  If this bill becomes law, Mr. President, no one should prepare to \nrelax. We have much, much more to do and this is only the opening \nchapter. As this new picture unfolds, I will be watching intently--and \nI will not be alone--to be certain that our efforts and resources have \na positive effect on children and families, and that they have real \nopportunities to realize their potential as human beings. That is the\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nobjective we seek, and it is on reaching that objective that we must \ninsist.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I had truly hoped that I could support \nlegislation that could deliver meaningful and historic reform of our \nNation's welfare system, but this bill forces California to bear far \nmore than our fair share of the burden.\n  Last year I voted for the Senate bill and against the conference bill \nbecause California's concerns were not met. This year, I would hope \nthat some of these items could be fixed in conference committee, so \nthat we are able to vote for a bill at the end of this process.\n  Nearly one-third of the net reductions contained in this bill fall on \njust one State: California. California is being asked to shoulder $17 \nbillion in cuts--one-third of the entire savings. The question is, what \nis the State able and willing to provide to fill in the gap? An \nexamination of Governor Wilson's budget indicates that dollars budgeted \nfor food stamps, AFDC, and benefits for legal immigrants drop from an \nestimated $1.9 billion in the current fiscal year to just over $1.5 \nbillion in 1997--therefore, counties cannot expect a large bailout from \nthe State.\n  Consequently, for those who deserve special help, whether they be \naged, blind, developmentally disabled or mentally ill, an increased \nburden will most certainly fall on the counties.\n\n\n                       no safety net for children\n\n  S. 1795 ends the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor \nchildren and families, and provides no safety net for children whose \nparents reached the 5-year time limit on benefits. There are \napproximately 2.7 million AFDC recipients in California, of which 68 \npercent are children. Under the time limit, 3.3 million children \nnationwide and 514,000 children in California would lose all assistance \nafter 5 years.\n  The Children's Defense Fund estimates that under this bill, 1.2 \nmillion more children would fall into poverty. California's child \npoverty rate was 27 percent for 1992-94, substantially above the \nnational average of 21 percent. Under this bill, even more children in \nCalifornia would be living in poverty.\n\n\n                    food stamps drastically reduced\n\n  California will lose $4.2 billion in cuts to the Food Stamp Program, \nreducing benefits for 1.2 million households. Nearly 2 million children \nin California receive food stamp benefits. Children of legal immigrants \nwould be eliminated from food stamp benefits immediately.\n\n\n                     child care funding inadequate\n\n  Currently in California, paid child care is not available to 80 \npercent of eligible AFDC children. The Senate welfare reform bill \nawards child care block grants to States based on their current \nutilization of Federal child care funds. But California's current \nutilization rate is low, so California would be institutionally \ndisadvantaged under this bill.\n\n\n                    no health coverage for children\n\n  The Senate bill ends the Federal guarantee of health insurance or \nMedicaid for women on AFDC and their children. In California, 290,000 \nchildren and 750,000 parents would lose coverage, according to the \nChildren's Defense Fund. California has the third highest uninsured \nrate in the Nation at 22 percent of the population.\n\n\n                 denial of benefits to legal immigrants\n\n  The Senate welfare reform bill would deny SSI and flood stamps to \nmost legal immigrants, including those already residing in California. \nIn 1994, 15.4 percent, or 390,000, of AFDC recipients in California \nwere noncitizens.\n  Fifty-two percent of all legal immigrants in the United States who \nare on SSI and AFDC reside in California. Los Angeles County estimates \nthat 234,000 aged, blind, and disabled legal immigrants would lose SSI \nbenefits, 150,000 people would lose AFDC, and 93,000 SSI recipients \nwould lose benefits under this bill. The county estimates that the loss \nof SSI funds could result in a cost shift to the county of more than \n$236 million annually. Loss of Medicaid coverage for legal immigrants \nwould shift an additional $100 million per year.\n  With this in mind, I cannot support this bill, because I believe it \nunfairly disadvantages California. It would be my hope that as the \nconference process continues, this can be taken into consideration and \nthe bill that emerges can be fair across the board and not single out \nany one State for one-third of the burden of the cuts.\n  It is especially important that individual counties in California \ntake a close look at the impact this legislation will have on their \njurisdiction. For example, Los Angeles County continues to be the most \ndevastated county in the Nation under this bill with almost $500 \nmillion in added costs each year. California counties must help us \npress our case with the House-Senate conferees on the impact of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 3734.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3734) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 201(a)(1) of the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 1997.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 3734 is stricken and the text of S. 1956, as \namended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 3734), as amended, was ordered to a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor to yield 2 minutes to \nmy distinguished friend from New Jersey, Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I do not think we have really even \nstarted to talk about the consequences of this act on the lives of \npeople who actually live in American cities. If this bill passes and we \nlook ahead 5 years into the future, city streets will not be safer, \nurban families will not be more stable, new jobs will not be created \nand schools will not be better. None of these things will happen. \nInstead, this bill will simply punish those in cities least able to \ncope.\n  With the repeal of title IV of the Social Security Act, the Federal \nGovernment would have broken its promise to children who are poor. It \nwill have washed its hands of any responsibility for them. It will have \npassed the buck.\n  What we need to do to change the broken welfare system is not block \ngrants. What we need is not transferring pots of money from one group \nof politicians to another group of politicians without regard to need, \nrules or accountability.\n  In fact, with the block grant, we will even be paying for people who \nhave been shifted off the State welfare rolls onto the Federal SSI \nrolls. In 22 States that have cut welfare rolls, 247,000 adults went \noff AFDC and 206,000 went on to SSI.\n  Because Governors are good at gaming Federal funding systems, we will \nbe paying for these 206,000 people through the block grant at the same \ntime we are paying for them through SSI. What we need is a steady \nFederal commitment and State experimentation so that we can change \nwelfare in a way that will encourage marriage, get people off welfare \nrolls and into jobs for the long term. Sadly, this bill will produce \nthe opposite result.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor to yield 2 minutes to \nmy distinguished friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Senate will rue the day that we \npass this legislation. This day, this bill opens up the floor under \npoor children which in our lifetimes no child has ever had to fall no \nmatter how poor, how irresponsible its parents might be. This day, in \nthe name of reform, this Senate will do actual violence to poor \nchildren, putting millions of them into poverty who were not in poverty \nbefore.\n\n  No one in the debate on this legislation has fully or adequately \nanswered the question: What happens to the children? They are, after \nall, the greatest number of people affected by this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n  Mr. President, 67 percent of the people who are receiving welfare \ntoday are children, and 60 percent of those children are under the age \nof 6 years old. This bill makes a policy assault on nonworking parents, \nbut it uses the children as the missiles and as the weapons of that \nassault.\n  I believe that this bill does not--does not--move in the direction of \nreform. Reform would mean that we give people the ability to work, to \ntake care of their own children. It would have a commitment to job \ncreation, to adequate child care, to job training, to job placement. \nBut this legislation, Mr. President, does none of those things.\n  This legislation does not give able-bodied people a chance to work \nand support their own children. It simply is election-year politics and \nrhetoric raised to the level of policy. I believe this bill cannot be \nfixed--not in conference committee, not on anybody's desk--and I \nbelieve that this bill is a shame on this U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senators such as I, such as Senator Paul \nWellstone, cannot conceive that the party of Social Security and of \ncivil rights could support this legislation which commences to repeal, \nto undermine both. Our colleagues in the House did not, nor should we.\n  The Washington Post concluded this morning's editorial, I quote:\n\n       This vote will likely end up in the history books, and the \n     right vote on this bill is no.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is now recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, S. 1956 is a good package, and just as this \nCongress has begun to reverse 30 years of liberal-spending policies, \nthis welfare reform proposal reverses 30 years of social policy.\n  Mr. President, 30 years of welfare policy has demonstrated that \nGovernment cannot promote policies that divide families and expect \nhealthy children; Government cannot centralize power and expect strong \ncommunities; Government cannot challenge and undermine religion and \nthen expect an abundance of faith, hope, and charity.\n  This reform initiative is largely based on the proposals made by our \nNation's Governors, and it mirrors the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995. Remember, Mr. President, that act was reported \nout of the Finance Committee and passed the Senate by a vote of 87 to \n12 before being vetoed by Bill Clinton.\n  This legislation is much the same. While it doesn't have everything \nit should--while it does not, for example, contain any provision to \nreform Medicaid--it represents a good start. There have been \ncompromises, Mr. President. Welfare reform is so important to the \nAmerican people that they have let us know that there should be \ncompromise, if that's what it takes.\n  This legislation, I believe, represents a good compromise. It \ncontains real work requirements. It contains real time limits. It \ncancels welfare benefits for felons and noncitizens. It returns the \npower to the States and communities, and it encourages personal \nresponsibility toward combating illegitimacy.\n  Mr. President, this welfare reform proposal is the first step in a \nnecessary effort to bring compassion and sensibility to a process that \nhas gotten out of hand. It benefits children by breaking the back of \nGovernment dependency; it requires sincere effort on the part of their \nparents--effort that will restore respect, pride, and economic security \nwithin the home--effort that will lay a new foundation for future \ngenerations.\n  Our current failed system has not done this. Prof. Walter Williams \nshows how the money spent on poverty programs since the 1960's could \nhave bought the entire assets of the Fortune 500 companies and \nvirtually all U.S. farm land. Consider that again--all the assets of \nthe Fortune 500 companies and virtually all U.S. farm land. With all \nthis, where are we? Welfare rolls are at record highs, problems are \nmounting and the attendant consequences are worse than ever.\n  Our reform legislation ends this destructive cycle. It replaces the \nhopelessness of the current system that engenders dependency with the \nhope that comes from self-reliance. Thirty years is long enough. The \nsafety net has become a snare. Freedom for the families trapped in \ndependency comes only through responsibility--through personal \naccountability--and that is the step we take today with this \nlegislation.\n  I appreciate all who have worked on both sides of aisle to bring us \nto this point. We have established a reform proposal that the President \nshould be able to sign. I ask him to make good on his promise. Mr. \npresident, please take this first, important step toward ending welfare \nas we know it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the welfare reform bill before us will win \nno beauty contests. It is not the fairest of them all--and I intend the \ndouble meaning.\n  With reservations, I voted in committee to send the measure to the \nfloor. I wanted changes for fairer treatment of children and other \nstated concerns. We have made some improvements, but more are needed.\n  In the opinion of this Senator, we have already voted on the best \nwelfare reform bill. That distinction belongs to the Democratic work \nfirst plan that regrettably, in my view, did not pass the Senate.\n\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the bill before us is maybe, just \nmaybe, the framework for a welfare plan that can win the support of a \nmajority in both Houses, and just as important, the approval of the \nPresident. It is near the best plan we can pass and bring to bear on a \nwelfare system that cries out for change.\n  I will not strike my tent now because I did not get everything I \nwanted in this bill. I believe that it goes a long way to reforming \nmuch that is wrong with the welfare system. We cannot lose this \nopportunity to break welfare's bitter cycle of dependency.\n  It is my sincerest hope that the majority will work with those of us \nappointed as minority conferees and with the President during \nconference to improve this measure, and to push that process forward. I \nhope, as well, that the Senate will insist on its more moderate \npositions in the conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, in my 18 years in the Senate, this Senator has always \nsought the middle ground. I do so again today. I will vote for this \nbill today and reserve my final determination until the conference \nreport returns to the Senate.\n  In closing, let me take a moment to thank the Democratic staff, and \nin particular, Bill Dauster, Joan Huffer, Jodi Grant, and Mary \nPeterson. They have provided invaluable service to this Senator and our \ncaucus.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, how I wish I could vote for this bill. I voted for the \nlast Senate bill and then voted against the conference committee report \nbecause I did not think the conference committee report was an \nimprovement on the Senate bill.\n  Today I, and I believe my colleague from California, will vote \nagainst this bill in hopes that when the bill comes out of conference \nit is a bill that does not so severely disadvantage one State in this \nUnion, and that State is California.\n  Mr. President, as I look at the savings of this bill, a net of about \n$55 billion, $17 billion of those savings come from the largest State \nin the Union and the State I believe most impacted by poor people. We \nknow $9 billion comes from the cutoff of legal immigrants, including \nrefugees and asylees who have no sponsor--the aged, the halt and the \nblind--$3.5 billion of AFDC, and $4.2 billion of food stamps, totaling \nabout a $17 billion impact on the State of California.\n  Now, I ask the State legislature, the State of California, look at \nthe budget. Are they prepared to pick up some of the difference? I ask \nthe counties to let Senator Boxer and I know how this bill impacts your \ncounty, because I\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nsuspect it is going to be a major transfer, particularly on counties \nlike Los Angeles. I suspect Los Angeles County will be the county most \nimpacted by the passage of this bill in the United States of America.\n  A fair bill, OK, I vote for; but a bill that says, OK, we will take \nfrom the biggest State in the Union as much as we possibly can--and \nthat is what this bill has done to date. I do not believe it is a fair-\nshare bill. I do not believe we see communities across the Nation doing \ntheir share. Perhaps because we have the two largest metropolitan areas \nin the Nation is one of the reasons why this bill will fall very hard \non poor people and cities, and particularly on cities that have large \nnumbers of dispossessed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds, if I \nmight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In my 30 seconds, I want to underscore, first of all, \nwhat my senior Senator said, which is that we are very willing to make \nchanges in welfare. We want to reform welfare. We both said that when \nwe ran for the U.S. Senate. We have both supported our Democratic \nleader's bill, and we even voted for a Senate bill.\n  The fact of the matter is that this, essentially, is paid for by one \nState. I will tell you, that is unfair. Yes, we are the largest State, \nand we have a lot of the population, but not to the extent that we are \nhit.\n  Also, when this country cannot pay for diapers for its children and \nfood and school supplies for its kids, I think we ought to relook at \nwho we are.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my leader time to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the majority leader. Mr. President, I just want \nto say that this is welfare reform. This is the dramatic change in the \nsystem that the American public has been asking for for years and years \nand years. This is the real deal. This is the opportunity to change \nmillions of people's lives. This is the opportunity that people who are \npoor in this country have been wanting and asking for for a long, long \ntime--the opportunity to get education and training that is meaningful, \nthe opportunity to go to work, and if you cannot find a job in the \nprivate sector, if you cannot get a job on your own, the State will \nassist you getting that job. If you cannot find a private-sector job, \nthe State will assist you in getting a public-sector job. There are no \nmore barriers because of labor unions to get that job in the public or \nprivate sector. This is the real deal when it comes to work, when it \ncomes to education, training, and helping families get out of poverty. \nFrom now on, after this bill, we are no longer going to measure whether \nwe are successful in poverty by how many people we have on the welfare \nrolls, but by how many we got off of the welfare rolls, because they \nhave dynamic opportunities for education and training to make that \nhappen. And, yes, they have requirements.\n  We have had lots of welfare reform pass in the U.S. Senate for years \nand years. But there has never been the requirement to have to work. I \nknow some people say that is mean and tough. I can tell you that it is \nthe only way that you move people who are having struggling times in \ntheir lives off of those welfare rolls. It is tough love--but the \noperative word is love. It is there and it is to help people.\n  I hear a lot of people say, ``Well, this is going to punish children, \nand we should not punish the children,'' as if the current system does \nnot punish children, as if illegitimacy rates where over a third of all \nthe children born in America are born to single moms does not punish \nchildren. That does not hurt kids not to have a father in the \nhousehold? That does not hurt kids not to have the work values that are \ntaught in the household where a mom gets up in the morning and a dad \ngets up in the morning and goes to work? That does not hurt kids? It \ndoes not hurt kids to have to go out and play in a playground and worry \nabout stepping on a needle from a drug addict? Of course, it does. This \nsystem hurts kids. That is why we are here--because the system hurts \nkids.\n\n  The issue before us is whether it is more important to have a Federal \nsafety net system that is there to provide for every aspect--and the \nmajority leader will talk about this--of the 50 or more programs that \nare there to take care of every possible need a child in America has. \nIs that what we want? Do we want the Federal Government guaranteeing \nevery aspect of everybody's life? Or do we want solid families, safe \nneighborhoods, good schools, the values of work, and an opportunity to \npursue the American dream? I will trade guarantees of Government \nprotection of every aspect of someone's life for a solid home, a solid \ncommunity, and loving parents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank the majority leader for \nhis backing on this bill and for his constantly pushing us to get this \njob done. I want to thank Senator Dole, who left the Senate to run for \nPresident, for his work before he left here. Without that work in \nleading us on the budget resolution that created it, we would not be \nhere.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to talk about history, because I heard a \ncouple of speakers from the other side say that history would rue this \nday. I believe history will praise this day, because I believe a system \nthat has failed in every single aspect will now be thrown away, and we \nwill start over with a new system that has a chance of giving people an \nopportunity instead of a handout. They will have a chance to get \ntrained and educated, go to work and feel responsible, instead of this \nlaw on the books for decades that is out of tune with our times, which \nmakes people feel dependent, makes people feel neglected. It is time \nthat it be changed.\n  Now, frankly, kids are us, and this bill is about our kids, because \nif anybody thinks the children that are under this welfare system are \ngetting a good deal today, then, frankly, I do not know what could be a \nrotten deal, because they are getting the worst of America. We are \nperpetuating among their adult relatives and parents a system of \ndependency, a system that lets them think less of their children \nbecause they think less of themselves. We can go right down the line.\n  We intend to return responsibility to the States, with prescriptions \nthat are set out by us that give them plenty of room to do a better job \nthan we have been doing. That is what this approach is all about.\n  This is a bill that gives those who have been campaigning for years, \nsaying, ``Let us get rid of welfare as we know it''--and I will not \neven cite who used that the most. Well, we are finally doing that \ntoday. When we come out of conference, we are going to send our \nPresident a bill. Our President is going to have before him a bill that \nsays: Here, Mr. President, you can get rid of welfare as you know it. \nJust sign this endeavor.\n  Now, from my own standpoint, I have been part of trying to push \nreform and save money. Many times, the bullets that we vote on are not \nreal bullets, but this is a real one. When you vote on this bill, you \nare going to change the law. When you voted on amendments, they were \nreal amendments. I compliment the Senate for a tough job. There were \nmany amendments. The bill that came out of it is a better bill than \nwhen it started. I believe some other Senators will cite the many \naspects of this bill that protect our children. For myself, I believe \nthere are 8 or 10 provisions. Food stamps remain an individual \nentitlement, current law Medicaid protection, child care subsidized, \nchild development block grants--$5 billion more, for a total of $14 \nbillion. So people can go to work and have somebody care for their \nchildren. This and many more provisions make this a bill that we can be \nproud of for our children.\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\n  Last but not least, let me conclude, if ever we had a chance to say \nto Americans, as America's economy grows, we want you to be part of it, \nprofit from it, have a dream, and this is an opportunity for welfare \nrecipients of the past to participate in a real future, and for us to \nnever again have welfare people among us that we think we are helping \nwhen, in fact, we have been hurting them. Let them share in the dream, \nalso. That is our hope, that is our wish, and that is what we believe \nhistory will say about this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it now, both leaders have \ntheir leader time to be used for purposes of closing the debate. I will \nyield 2 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding. Is this \nbill perfect? Of course not. Nothing that we as humans do is ever \nperfect. But is it a bill that desires and needs and deserves our \nsupport at this time in order to send it to conference? The answer, I \nthink, is clearly yes.\n  President Clinton said that the goal of welfare reform should be to \nbe tough on work, but good for kids. This bill is tough on work. It \nsets time limits for how long someone can be on welfare. It sets out \nwork requirements. It tells teen parents, for the first time, that they \nhave to live with an adult or with their parents. It is a tough bill on \nwork, but it is also a bill that is good for kids.\n  This bill has the same language on vouchers as a bill that passed \nthis body 87 to 12.\n  I would have liked the Ford amendment to pass. But the language is \nexactly what we passed already 87 to 12 when it comes to taking care of \nfamilies after this time limit on welfare is determined.\n  There are about 49 programs that will be available to families after \nthe 5-year limit is reached; 49 separate programs that we in America \nsay we are going to make available to families.\n  We have corrected the Food Stamp Program with the Conrad amendment. \nIt is still an entitlement program.\n  We have preserved the Medicaid health protections for families and \nfor children, and for pregnant mothers. It is still an entitlement \nprogram.\n  We have added $5 billion to what passed this Senate in terms of child \ncare. We have current law on child welfare protections for foster care \nbecause of our amendments.\n  We have SSI cash payments for disabled children, social service \nprograms for children under title XX, housing assistance, child \nnutrition assistance for children, the school lunch program, the school \nbreakfast program, and the summer food program.\n  This bill is not perfect. But it is a major step in the right \ndirection. It deserves our support and our vote to send it to \nconference and see if it can somehow be improved. It is not a perfect \nbill. But I would suggest it is a major improvement over the current \nsystem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my leader time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment Senator \nDomenici and Senator Roth for their leadership on this bill; in \naddition, Senator Lott and Senator Dole because they have worked hard \nto bring this about. This truly is a historic piece of legislation \nbecause we really are reforming welfare. And we should. The present \nwelfare system is broke. It is a failure. It has not worked.\n  We have 334 federally defined welfare programs stacked on top of each \nother. They cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The cost of welfare \nin 1960 was $24 billion. The cost of welfare in 1995 was almost $400 \nbillion. We have spent trillions of dollars in the last three decades. \nWhat do we have? We have more welfare dependency, more people dependent \non the Federal Government, and more people addicted to welfare. In my \nopinion, it has hurt the beneficiaries in many cases more than it has \nhelped them, and it certainly has hurt the taxpayers in the process.\n  We need to help taxpayers save some money. But, more importantly, we \nneed to help the so-called beneficiaries to help them climb away from \nwelfare into jobs; into more self-reliance; into more independence and \naway from more Government dependence.\n  This bill has time limits. This bill has real work requirements. This \nbill is real welfare reform.\n  President Clinton, as a candidate and also recently, has been saying \nthat we need to end welfare as we know it. I have applauded that \ncomment. But, unfortunately, his actions have not done that. He has \nvetoed real welfare reform twice. I hope he does not veto this bill.\n  A ``yes'' vote, in my opinion, is a vote for real welfare reform. A \n``no'' vote is a vote for status quo; the continuation of a welfare \ncycle in a welfare system that unfortunately is a real failure.\n  I thank my leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska for his admirable job in helping to \nmanage this piece of legislation on the Senate floor. I also want to \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, the \nSenator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, Senator Breaux, and so many \nothers on our side who have worked so diligently now over the better \npart of 18 months in an effort to bring us to this point.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that everyone of us knows that reform is \nnecessary. We also know after the experience we have had for the last \n18 months that there is no easy solution.\n  Democrats offered the ``Work First'' bill that did three things: It \nrequired work for benefits. It provided flexibility for States, and it \nrequired protection for children. I am disappointed that not one \nRepublican voted for that piece of legislation.\n  Every single Democrat supported welfare reform when it came to the \nSenate floor--not once, not twice, but on three different occasions.\n  In spite of our failure to convince our Republican colleagues to join \nus in passing a bill that represented meaningful welfare reform, \nDemocrats have worked with Republicans to improve the pending bill.\n  There are, as a result of our amendments, more resources for child \ncare. There is a greater requirement for States for maintenance of \nState effort. There is a requirement for access to Medicaid and food \nassistance, and protection for women from domestic violence.\n  So now at this hour at the end of this debate the question is very \nsimple: Is this bill now good enough to pass? In my view, \nunfortunately, the answer is no. Too many kids will still be punished. \nToo many promises about work will remain unfulfilled. Too many \nopportunities to truly reform welfare will have been lost.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that most States, even with the \nbill before us today at this moment, will fail to meet the work \nrequirement. The Congressional Budget Office says there are \ninsufficient funds in this legislation to make a meaningful difference. \nThe bill is heavy on rhetoric, and we have heard a lot of it today and \nthroughout this debate. But in my view, Mr. President, this bill is \nstill too light on real reform. It is either a huge new unfunded \nmandate to the States, or an admission by Republicans that they really \ndo not expect this bill to work in the first place.\n  But perhaps my biggest concern is the concern that many of us share \nfor children. This bill says that it does not matter how bad things \nare, how destitute, how sick, or how poor kids may be. Kids of any \nage--6 months or 6 years--are going to have to fend for themselves. \nWhen it comes to kids, when it comes to their safety net, this bill is \nstill too punitive.\n  And I have heard the discussion of a list of other Federal programs \nthat may be provided. But, Mr. President, the emphasis is on ``may.'' \nWe are talking for the most part about discretionary programs here that \nare in large measure underfunded today.\n  Eight million children in this country do not deserve to be punished. \nThey need to be protected.\n  You can come up with a litany as long as you want of programs that \ntechnically are designed to provide assistance. But, if they do not \nhave the resources, if we do not have the safety\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nnet, if they do not have the opportunities to access those programs, \nthen, Mr. President, they are meaningless.\n  Finally, the treatment of legal immigrants in this bill is far too \nharsh. We ought to require more responsibility of sponsors, and the \n``Work First'' bill did that. But this bill even cuts off assistance to \nlegal immigrants who are disabled. What kind of message does that send \nabout what kind of people we are? We can do better than this. On a \nmatter so important we have no choice but to do better.\n  This bill must be improved. This bill must protect kids. It must not \nforce the States to solve these problems by themselves. It must provide \nsome empathy for disabled citizens regardless of where they have come \nfrom.\n  We can improve it in conference, if the political will is there--\nsince we are not doing it here. Or, we are not doing it this afternoon. \nBut, because it is not done, the best vote on this bill, the best vote \nat this time, is to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from the CBO \nreport, to which I referred about the States' inability to meet the \nwork rates under the pending bill, be printed in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First, the bill requires that, in 1997, states have 25 \n     percent of certain families receiving cash assistance in work \n     activities. The participation rates rise by 5 percentage \n     points a year through 2002. Participants would be required to \n     work 20 hours a week through 1998, 25 hours in 1999, 30 hours \n     in 2000 and 2001, and 35 hours in 2002 and after. Families \n     with no adult recipient or with a recipient experiencing a \n     sanction for non-participation (for up to 3 months) are not \n     included in the participation calculation. Families in which \n     the youngest child is less than one year old would be exempt \n     at state option. A state could exempt a family for a maximum \n     of one year.\n       States would have to show on a monthly basis that \n     individuals in 50 percent of all non-exempt families are \n     participating in work activities in 2002. CBO estimates that \n     this would require participation of 1.7 million families. By \n     contrast, program data for 1994 indicate that, in an average \n     month, approximately 450,000 individuals participated in the \n     JOBS program. (The bill limits the number of individuals in \n     education and training programs that could be counted as \n     participants, so many of these individuals would not qualify \n     as participants under the new program). Most states would be \n     unlikely to satisfy this requirement for several reasons. The \n     costs of administering such a large scale work and training \n     program would be high, and federal funding would be frozen at \n     historic levels. Because the pay-off for such programs has \n     been shown to be low in terms of reductions in the welfare \n     caseload, states may be reluctant to commit their own funds \n     to employment programs. Moreover, although states may succeed \n     in reducing their caseloads through other measures, which \n     would in turn free up federal funds for training, the \n     requirements would still be difficult to meet because the \n     remaining caseload would likely consist of individuals who \n     would be the most difficult and expensive to train.\n       Second, while tracking the work requirement for all \n     families, states simultaneously would track a separate \n     guideline for the smaller number of non-exempt families with \n     two parents participating in the AFDC-Unemployed Parent \n     (AFDC-UP) program. By 2002, the bill would require that 90 \n     percent of such families have an adult participate in work-\n     related activities at least 35 hours per week. In addition, \n     if the family used federal funds to pay for child care, the \n     spouse would have to participate in work activities at least \n     20 hours per week. In 1994, states attempted to implement a \n     requirement that 40 percent of AFDC-UP families participate, \n     and roughly 40 states failed the requirement.\n       Finally, states would have to ensure that all parents who \n     have received cash assistance for two years or more since the \n     bill's effective date. The experience of the JOBS program to \n     date suggests that such a requirement is well outside the \n     states' abilities to implement.\n       In sum, each work requirement would represent a significant \n     challenge to states. Given the costs and administrative \n     complexities involved, CBO assumes that most states would \n     simply accept penalties rather than implement the \n     requirements. Although the bill would authorize penalties of \n     up to 5 percent of the block grant amount, CBO assumes--\n     consistent with current practice--that the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services would impose small penalties (less \n     than one-half of one percent of the block grant) on non-\n     complying states.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the managers of \nthe bill, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, and the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon. \nI guess Senator Exon is managing his last reconciliation bill on the \nfloor, and maybe he will get to take up a conference report. But I am \nsure this is a blessing in many ways for the Senator from Nebraska. He \nhas always been very kind and approachable. We appreciate his \ncooperation--on both sides of the aisle. Senator Breaux certainly has \nworked to try to make this a bipartisan bill. Senator Hutchison today \nshowed real courage in saying we should keep the formula that has been \nworked out and has been agreed to.\n  It has been a very slow process. It has taken too long, in my \nopinion, to get to this point on this bill. But we are here.\n  But I am shocked to hear the Democratic leader say after 18 months, \nafter all these efforts, after changes have been made, working across \nthe aisle to get real welfare reform, that the answer will still be no.\n  I think this is a case of Senators who talk a lot about wanting \nwelfare reform, but every time they have the opportunity to actually do \nsomething about it, they back away from it.\n  Now, we have had amendments accepted on both sides, some that \nobviously we did not agree with, some that you did not agree with, but \nit has been a bipartisan effort. So we are now in a position where we \ncan take this positive step forward to go to conference and then send \nanother welfare reform bill to the President.\n  The Senate stands on the brink of passing a welfare reform bill \nworthy of the name; not a hollow shell that we will send to the \nPresident and say we will give you real welfare reform and not do it.\n  We have done this before--twice, as a matter of fact--but in both \ncases, President Clinton vetoed what we sent him. I hope this will not \nbe the case this time around.\n  After we pass this bill--and I'm certain it will pass--it should not \ntake too long for our Senate and House conferees to work out their \ndifferences so we can send a bill to the White House.\n  I appeal to President Clinton to consider carefully its provisions. \nThey have the broad support of the American people.\n  They emphasize work as the best way out of the welfare trap. That's \nwhy the bill significantly expands resources available to the States \nfor child care. This bill will give States the flexibility they need to \nhelp welfare recipients into the mainstream of American life.\n  The bill also ends the entitlement status of welfare. That's an \nimportant step. It will not only help to control costs, but will let \nState and local governments speed the transition from welfare to \nproductive participation in the economy.\n  It imposes time limits for welfare and discourages illegitimacy, \nwhich everyone now realizes is the single most important root cause of \npoverty in this country.\n  A lot of questions have been raised about programs for children. As a \nmatter of fact, there are some 49 programs included in this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that this list of selected programs which benefit \nchildren be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Selected Programs for Which Families on Welfare Would Continue to be \n                         Eligible After 5 Years\n\n       Supplemental Security Income.\n       Social Services Block Grant.\n       Medicaid.\n       Food Stamps.\n       Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Programs.\n       Community Health Center Services.\n       Family Planning Methods and Services.\n       Migrant Health Center Services.\n       Family nutrition block grant programs.\n       School-based nutrition block grant programs.\n       Rental assistance.\n       Public Housing.\n       Housing Loan Program.\n       Housing Interest Reduction Program.\n       Loans for Rental and Cooperative Housing.\n       Rental Assistance Payments.\n       Program of Assistance Payments on Behalf of Homeowners.\n       Rent Supplement Payments on Behalf of Qualified Tenants.\n       Loan and Grant Programs for Repair and Improvement of Rural \n     Dwellings.\n       Loan and Assistance Programs for Housing Farm Labor.\n       Grants for Preservation and Rehabilitation of Housing.\n       Grants and Loans for Mutual and Self-Help Housing and \n     Technical Assistance.\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\n       Site Loans Program.\n       Grants for Screening, Referrals, and Education Regarding \n     Lead Poisoning in Infants and Children.\n       Child Protection Block Grant.\n       Title XIX-B subpart I and II Public Health Service Act.\n       Title III Older Americans Act Programs.\n       Title II-B Domestic Volunteer Service Act Programs.\n       Title II-C Domestic Volunteer Service Act Programs.\n       Low-Income Energy Assistance Act Program.\n       Weatherization Assistance Program.\n       Community Services Block Grant Act Programs.\n       Legal Assistance under Legal Services Corporation Act.\n       Emergency Food and Shelter Grants under McKinney Homeless \n     Act.\n       Child Care and Development Block Grant Act Programs.\n       State Program for Providing Child Care (section 402(j) SSA)\n       Stafford student loan program.\n       Basic educational opportunity grants.\n       Federal work Study.\n       Federal Supplement education opportunity grants.\n       Federal Perkins loans.\n       Grants to States for state student incentives.\n       Grants and fellowships for graduate programs.\n       Special programs for students whose families are engaged in \n     migrant and seasonal farmwork.\n       Loans and Scholarships for Education in the Health \n     Professions.\n       Grants for Immunizations Against Vaccine-Preventable \n     Diseases.\n       Job Corps.\n       Summer Youth Employment and Training.\n       Programs of Training for Disadvantaged Adults under Title \n     II-A and for Disadvantaged Youth under Title II-C of the Job \n     Training Partnership Act.\n       Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this list includes supplemental security \nincome, social services block grants, Medicaid, food stamps, family \nnutrition block grants, school-based nutrition block grants, grants for \nscreening, referral and education regarding lead poisoning, not to \nmention Medicare and housing assistance--a long list of programs that \nwill help children.\n  So there are good programs here that will be preserved and, in many \ncases, improved. So if you really want welfare reform, this is it.\n  This may be the last opportunity to get genuine welfare reform. Vote \nyes. Send this bill to conference. We will get it out of conference \nnext week, and we will send it to the President before the August \nrecess.\n  I hope the President will not veto welfare reform for a third time in \n18 months.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill passed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House and appoints \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Gorton) appointed, from the Committee on \nthe Budget, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Exon, and Mr. \nHollings; from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \nMr. Lugar, Mr. Helms, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Heflin, \nand Mr. Harkin; from the Committee on Finance, Mr. Roth, Mr. Chafee, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Bradley, Mr. \nPryor, and Mr. Rockefeller; from the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, Mrs. Kassebaum and Mr. Dodd, conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the cosmetic improvements made in this \nbad bill cannot possibly justify its passage. It is no answer to say \nthat this bill is less extreme than previous bills. Less extreme is \nstill too extreme.\n  This bill condemns millions of innocent children to poverty in the \nname of welfare reform. But no welfare bill worthy of the name reform \nwould lead to such an unconscionable result. This bill is not a welfare \nreform bill--it is a ``Let them eat cake'' bill.\n  In fact, welfare reform would have nothing to do with the tens of \nbillions of dollars in this bill in harsh cuts that hurt children. Cuts \nof that obscene magnitude are totally unjustified. They are being \ninflicted for one reason only--to pay for the massive tax breaks for \nthe wealthy that Bob Dole and the Republican majority in Congress still \nhope to pass. Today the Republican majority has succeeded in pushing \nextremism and calling it virtue. It is nothing of the sort. This bill \nwill condemn millions of American children to poverty in order to \nproivde huge tax breaks for the rich.\n  These are the wrong priorities for America. If children could vote, \nthis Republican plan to slash welfare would be as dead as their plan to \nslash Medicare. But children don't vote--and they will pay a high price \nin blighted lives and lost hope.\n  Perhaps the greatest irony of all is now on display, as America hosts \nthe Olympic games. We justifiably take pride in being the best in many \ndifficult events. We may well win a fistful of golds in Atlanta. But \nAmerica is not winning any gold medals in caring for children.\n  The United States already has more children living in poverty--the \nUnited States already spend less of its wealth on its children--than 16 \nout of the 18 major industrial nations in the world. The United States \nhas a larger gap between rich and poor children than any other \nindustrial nation. Children in the United States are twice as likely to \nbe poor than British children, and three times as likely to be poor \nthan French or German children. And we call ourselves the leader of the \nfree world? Shame on us. Shame on the Senate. Surely we can do better--\nand there is still time to do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8501-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8532-S8552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n        RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, could we have order? The Senator is \nentitled to be heard. I do not agree with what he is entitled to be \nheard on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators conversing in the aisles remove \nthemselves from said aisles?\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in light of the position of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, I am especially appreciative of his courtesy.\n  The proposal is outlined on this yellow sheet. Somebody from one of \nthe sugar-producing States accused me of yellow journalism, but I hope \nthe Members of the Senate will take time to review the sheet.\n  It essentially says the sugar program and producers will be put on \nthe same level as students, veterans and homeowners who, when they \ndefault on a loan to the Federal Government, are personally responsible \nto pay it.\n  Under the program, as currently structured, that is not the case. I \ncould have offered an amendment which would deal with the essence of \nthe sugar program in the pricing policy, which is this outrageous \nripoff of the American consumer to the extent of $1.4 billion.\n  But rather than do that, I have limited this to the issue of \nliability in the area of a sugar processor who fails to repay their \nloan. And it only applies to sugar processors with more than $15 \nmillion of annual sales. Therefore, I think it is a very reasonable \namendment. And I would appreciate the consideration by the body.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Gregg \namendment to the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I believe it is time to reform the sugar program. The sugar program \nhas become nothing more than corporate welfare for a small group of \ngrowers which operates to the detriment of consumers and sugar refiners \nlike Domino Sugar in Baltimore and other refiners around the country.\n  The Gregg amendment simply requires growers to repay their loans to \nthe Federal Government. It is shocking that sugar growers are the only \ngroup of people who do not have to repay their loans to the Government. \nIf students and veterans have to re-pay their loans to the Government, \nthen so should sugar growers.\n  While the sugar program gives growers a significant advantage, sugar \nrefiners have no such benefits or protection. Sugar refiners must use \nimported raw product in order to stay in business because there is not \nenough domestic supply to satisfy demand.\n  While growers receive artificially high prices, refiners must bear \nthe high cost of domestic product without any benefits or protection. \nIt is time this Government recognize the value of our sugar refining \nindustry and the jobs that depend on it.\n  Since 1981, the sugar refining industry has lost forty percent of its \ncapacity not to mention the thousands of blue collar jobs that went \nwith it. Sugar refining is one of the few manufacturing industries \nstill left in our inner cities. Domino Sugar in Baltimore employs \nalmost six hundred people. Their jobs are just as important as the jobs \nof growers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment and vote for \nfairness in the sugar program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time against the amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will join with me and \nothers this afternoon in a motion to table this amendment. We have just \ncrafted a new 7-year farm bill. In a rough and tumble way, we have \nplanned for agriculture, at least as it relates to Government's \ninvolvement.\n  We made major changes in the sugar program. We eliminated marketing \nallotments, we implemented a 1-cent penalty on loan rates, we created \nthe assessment of $300 million coming into the Treasury all in a sense \nto create a more balanced field for the production of sugar in our \ncountry while there is a more equitable flow of import sugar into our \nrefiners.\n  The Senator says, let us change the game one more time. I hope that \nthe Senate will work its will, but understand that once we have crafted \na farm bill that we would stay with that farm bill for the period of \ntime of that policy. And that is why I hope we will support a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Gregg amendment No. \n4959, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\nto lay on the table the amendment No. 4959. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nis absent due to a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nHawaii [Mr. Inouye] would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is our hope that we will be able to \npropound a unanimous-consent agreement and get an agreement to take up \nthe remaining amendments on this bill tonight, and for any votes that \nare required, put them over until tomorrow. That is the effort that we \nare making now.\n  There are a number of amendments that we have listed in this proposed \nagreement. I can read them now. We have given copies to both sides of \nthe aisle. Senators are looking at them in an effort to determine \nwhether this agreement can be reached. I hope it can. I know Senators \nare tired. They have been here all day.\n  The leader wants us to finish this bill tonight, but it looks like we \ncannot because of the long list of amendments. But we can take up the \namendments and dispose of the amendments. Those that we cannot dispose \nof, which require votes, can be voted on tomorrow. That is the \nsuggestion for the further disposition of this Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I will be happy to yield to anyone who wants to ask a question about \nthat, or to my distinguished friend from Arkansas, the manager on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHarkin be added as a cosponsor on amendments Nos. 4979 and 4978.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, regarding what the Senator just said--\nand I certainly do not want to take any more time--this is going to be \na rather burdensome evening. I am not too hot for this agreement, to \ntell you the truth. But if we can move expeditiously and get these \namendments disposed of--and I defer to the chairman on this--according \nto my list, we have about five amendments here that have not been \ncleared. I think that probably the first thing we ought to do is to \ntake the amendments that have been cleared and accept them on both \nsides and narrow down the list. I think, perhaps, of the remaining \namendments, two or three of them will fall. I think that would be an \nexpeditious way to get a resolution of this thing. I do not know \nwhether we are going to get an agreement tonight to say that any \namendments that will not be laid down tonight will be in order \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to understand a bit more \nabout where we are at the moment. I have noticed an amendment dealing \nwith barley and the problem that has come about as a result of the \nchange in the payment rate for barley under the Freedom To Farm Act.\n  As some of you might know, those who signed up under freedom to farm \nto raise barley signed up with the understanding that their original \npayment under the freedom to farm bill was going to be 46 cents a \nbushel in 1996. Then they were told later that the calculation under \nthe Freedom To Farm Act was inaccurate and that their payment would be \n32 cents. That probably doesn't sound like too much to some, but it is \na 30 percent reduction from what the estimate would be and the basis on \nwhich they signed up for the program--a 30 percent reduction from that \nlevel. It is somewhere around $35 million to $39 million. No State in \nthe country raises more barley than North Dakota, and the folks that go \nout and plant that barley, and expect to harvest it, did so under the \nprovisions of this farm bill, fully expecting to do so receiving 46 \ncents a bushel as original payment.\n  Now, I guess the question that I have is whether we can address this \nissue in this appropriations bill. This appears to be the only \nopportunity to address this issue on behalf of the barley growers. And \nbefore we agree to a unanimous-consent request of some type in order to \ncompress the time and limit the opportunities to address this issue, I \nsay to the manager and ranking member that I very much would like to \ndiscuss, at some length, with them how we can address this issue.\n  I do not think this is a circumstance where we can say this doesn't \nmatter; it won't be addressed. This is a substantial amount of money \ncoming out of the pockets of those who signed up for this program \nexpecting to get a payment of 46 cents a bushel, which, under current \ncircumstances, they will not get. Before I agree to a unanimous-consent \nrequest of any kind, I would like to see if we can work through and \nsolve this problem.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, let me say to the Senator from North \nDakota that his amendment actually is a farm bill amendment. The \nchairman and I have both said in our opening statements that we hope we \nwill not get into trying to amend the farm bill that we passed last \nyear.\n  I have strong empathy for the Senator from North Dakota because he \nhas a great interest in the issue of barley. But I hope that the \nSenator would be willing to take the manager's word for the fact that \nthis really needs to be considered by the chairman and ranking members \nof the Agriculture Committee, because that is where this really \nbelongs. To say that if there is a package of farm bill amendments that \nmight be approved by the authorizers at the conclusion of this bill, \nthere might possibly be a chance--and I do not want to guarantee or \npromise the Senator from North Dakota this, but we might be able to do \nsomething at the end in the way of a package of amendments.\n\n  In any case, whether we deal with it that way or not, there might be \na possibility of doing something with it in conference. I know the \nSenator from North Dakota feels strongly about this, but I really feel \nthat we probably ought to deal with this in a slightly different way, \nbecause it really is an amendment to the farm bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, that distinction is obviously lost on \npeople who are out there planting barley and who signed up for a \nprogram in which they felt they were going to get a 46-cent-per-bushel \npayment because they were promised that. Then it turns out there was a \nmiscalculation determined by USDA in the process of constructing this \nfarm bill, which results in a 30-percent reduction in the payment they \nexpected.\n  Now, the Senator from Arkansas is generous, and I appreciate working \nwith him. But he knows, and I know, that we may not have another \nopportunity to correct this. It seems to me\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nthat while one can make the case that this is an authorizing committee \nissue, one can also make the case that this is an appropriations issue, \nbecause the Secretary of Agriculture needs to have the money in order \nto restore this payment that was promised to family farmers.\n  This is not a circumstance where there is confusion about what the \npromise was. The Freedom To Farm Act made specific representations \nabout, if you planted a certain commodity, what kind of payment you \nwould receive for that planting. In the case of barley, there is no \nconfusion. The promise was 46 cents a bushel. Now we are told, for \nthose who fuel up the tractor and plant barley seeds, the thing has \nchanged, the deal is off, there is a 30-percent reduction. That just, I \nsay to my colleagues, is not satisfactory to me. I do not think it is \nsatisfactory to the farmers who believe that we ought to keep our word \non this.\n  So I just would say that I am not interested in any sort of unanimous \nconsent request until we can work through this. I am not trying to draw \na line in the sand here. I am just saying that we can work through \nthis. This can be done. This can be solved. This is not a problem for \nwhich there is no solution. There is a solution. I think there are no \ntwo better people in the Senate to help us address it than the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and the Senator from Arkansas. Both of them are about \nas good at doing these things in the Senate as anybody I know. But I \nreally want us to address this.\n  As the Senator from Mississippi, for whom I have great respect, \nknows, I am not sure the amendment is the right amendment, and I am not \nsure the method I have chosen to pay for this is the right method. In \nfact, I might prefer a different method. But I gave notice a day or two \nago that I would want to deal with this issue on the floor of the \nSenate when this bill came to the floor.\n  I also understand those who manage this legislation--and the majority \nleader, for that matter, and others--would like to just package this up \ntight, wrap a bow around it, and run it through to final passage in the \nmorning. Gee, I would like to see that happen as well, and I am \nperfectly willing to see that happen as long as the result of this bill \naddresses their question of how we make good on our word as a Congress \nto those that produce barley.\n  So I know my colleague, Senator Conrad, has an interest in this as \nwell. But I really do hope that we can visit and find a way to address \nthis problem the way farmers would expect us to address it. They were \ngiven a promise. We need to keep that promise. A failure to keep that \npromise will be a failure on all of our parts. We do not need to fail. \nWe can in this piece of legislation find $35 million and keep the \npromise that was made to those that raise barley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I hesitate to extend the discussion of \nthis matter. I would like to rivet the point and confirm what my \ncolleague from North Dakota is saying.\n  Barley farmers in this country were made a clear promise. They were \ntold they were going to get 46 cents a bushel under this farm bill. \nSomebody made a miscalculation. We do not know yet whether it was USDA \nor the Agriculture Committee staffs of the Senate and the House. But we \nknow with great precision what promise was made--46 cents a bushel. \nThat is already a significant reduction from what they would have \ngotten under previous legislation. But now they are told they are not \ngoing to get 46 cents. They are going to get 32 cents.\n  Farmers have already planted understanding that they were going to \nreceive a certain level of payment. So they have moved on the promise \nthat was made to them. They have planted the crop. It is there. Nothing \ncan be done about it. But we now cannot go back on the pledge that was \nmade to these people and say, ``Well, you know that is the way \nWashington works sometimes. You were told you were going to get \nsomething, and on that basis you acted, and now we are going to go back \non our word and instead of 46 cents you are going to get 32 cents.''\n  That is an economic disaster to literally thousands of people who \nplant barley in this country--barley that goes into making beer which \nis important to our country. You have to have beer. If you do not have \nbeer, what kind of a country have you got?\n  [Laughter.]\n  The next thing you know we will have the Germans over here selling \nall the beer. We do not want to do that to America--to deny those in \nour country who enjoy a tall cool one; that they are going to have to \nbuy German barley or Canadian barley. They ought to be able to get \nAmerican barley. And those barley farmers ought to be getting what they \nwere promised.\n  So I would be very hopeful that our colleagues would recognize this \nis an extraordinary circumstance that somehow we have to keep our word \nwith respect to what barley farmers were promised.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not want those listening who do not know anything \nabout barley to believe that barley is only used to produce beer. Of \ncourse, malting barley is used in the production of beer. But beef \nbarley is used for a great amount of animal feed in this country.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, makes a point. I would \nlike to stress it. There is not any other commodity in the farm bill \nthat is affected like this. Every other commodity got what they were \npromised they would get. Every other commodity got what they were \npromised they would get. But this farm bill contains a provision that \nsays barley will get 46 cents a bushel, and then now it contains \nanother provision that says, ``Oops. Oops''. Someone made a mistake. \nOops. We are $35 million short.'' ``Oops'' does not mean very much \nunless that $35 million comes out of your pocket. Then ``oops'' is a \nreal serious problem.\n\n  All we ask is that we find a way somehow to address this dilemma. The \nfailure to address it now means it will not get addressed. That is why \nwe do not want to miss this moment.\n  We are not talking about some mountain. We are talking about a \nrelatively small problem that can be fixed--a big problem for barley \ngrowers, but a problem that can be fixed without great difficulty, in \nmy judgment,\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senators from North Dakota on this barley issue. This \nis also a subject that is addressed in an amendment that has been \ncrafted and proposed by Senator Burns of Montana. And the other Senator \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus, mentioned to me his interest in the \nissue. So it is something that Senators on both sides have an interest \nin.\n  We would like to see it resolved. Our problem on this appropriations \ncommittee is that we have a limited amount of money to allocate among \nall of these programs administered by the Department of Agriculture. We \nare advised variously that it would cost up to $40 million. It may not \ngo that high, as the Senator says. It may be $38 million, or something \nlike that.\n  Rather than spell out specifically a support level in the legislation \nbefore the Senate, I hope that we would consider as an option language \ndirecting the Secretary of Agriculture to study the suggestion that the \nBarley program be revised on the grounds and for the reasons stated by \nthe Senators who have spoken and direct that he has the authority to \nmake changes that would result in a fair solution and equitable \nresolution of the difficulty holding harmless those producers in other \ncommodity programs that already have their signups approved and already \nhave their farm plan in operation.\n  The reason I say that is one concern I have is that, if we do not \nhave some language like that, the Secretary could take the funds from \nother commodity programs and give it to the barley producers. And I \nthink we would have a furor on our hands, and that would be \nunderstandable.\n  But so long as the other producers are not harmed by this change, I \nwould have no objection to including language like that in this bill. I \nthink it does have to be cleared by the legislative committee. Senator \nLugar and\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\nSenator Leahy ought to be consulted about it.\n  What I can say at this point is that the Senators have my assurance \nthat I will try very hard to get language of that kind approved here in \nthe Senate. If we cannot get it spelled out in this bill, we can do it \nin conference, but at some point to make sure that this problem is \naddressed in this bill.\n  I cannot--like the Senator from Arkansas said--guarantee it because I \njust have 1 vote in here, and there are 99 others. But we can recommend \nand we can work with the Senators to craft that kind of language. I \npledge to them my best efforts to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I guess what I would encourage us to do \nis to work this evening and tomorrow morning to see if we can craft a \nsolution to include in this bill that solves the problem. As the \nSenator knows, he has been a veteran of these many battles in the \nCongress directing the Secretary to study something, suggestions that \nit may or may not get solved, and it may or may not get solved in the \nnext 5 years.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, there are two parts: The \nstudy to do something equitably to address and resolve the issues; and \nwe have to worry, too, about how the Congressional Budget Office may \nscore language like that.\n\n  I do not know what their scoring would be. I am sometimes mystified \nand dumbfounded by the scoring decisions that are made by the \nCongressional Budget Office on something like this.\n  So we will have to reserve judgment on that basis. We do not want to \nput ourselves out of business because of some scoring decision that \nthey make.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that. My point was that I do not know that \nthe problem needs much study. I understand the problem. We understand \nthat those who signed up with the program who raise barley find out now \nthat they are going to get 30 percent less than the freedom to farm \nbill proposed at 46 cents a bushel.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, it has to be \nstudied. There was a misinterpretation of estimates provided by \nDepartment of Agriculture for the payments for barley producers. But \nthe barley producers were told that an erroneous support level would be \nmade a part of the barley program. Then they found out later that they \nwere wrong and it would be a lower level. Now they are caught in this \nsituation where they do not want to have to admit that the facts were \nmisrepresented about the support level and the basis on which it was \ncalculated.\n  That is why it ought to be studied because there is a difference of \nopinion at the Department of Agriculture as to what this level ought to \nbe. I do not know what the level ought to be. You are saying one level. \nThe barley producers are expecting that level that you are talking \nabout. That is the part of the problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Department indicates that the majority party in \nconstructing the freedom to farm bill made the error. I do not know who \nmade the error. I do know this. That when someone signs up for a \nprogram and is told they will get 46 cents a bushel for a barley \npayment under a contract, and then are told later, ``Well, gee. That \nwas wrong. You actually are going to get 30 percent less than that,'' \nand, where this is the only crop in the country that is put in that \nposition, our position is let's go ahead and make them whole.\n  We do not have to wait forever to do that. Let us try to find a way \nto do that now. It has been kicking around here for a while. I have \ntalked to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, so I know you have been \nworking with him, and Senator Baucus. My understanding is some of the \noriginal discussions about that would be maybe to fix part of the \nproblem.\n  I would very much like to fix this problem so that those who signed \nup on the basis of getting 46 cents a bushel for barley will be able to \nunderstand that is what they are going to get. That is what everybody \nelse got. Everybody else got exactly what this Congress told them they \nwould get as a payment under freedom to farm. It was a fixed payment. \nIt did not require rocket scientists to understand what it was going to \nbe; it was a fixed payment. Everybody signed up and understood what \nthey were going to get.\n  The only crop that is disadvantaged this way, the only farmers who \nare going to be short-changed will be those who raise barley who were \ntold it is not 46; something happened in between with calculations and \nit will be 30 percent less than that. Our position is that is not the \nright way to deal with these growers.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee has offered to work with the \nSenator and the other Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Burns, and has an amendment reservation pending to try \nwork this out in a way that is acceptable to Senators.\n  We need to get an agreement on how we are going to proceed tonight \nand in the morning. I would like to propound a unanimous consent \nagreement, and the chairman, I am sure, is going to be prepared to work \nwith Senators right now and see if he can find something that is \nacceptable. As he said, he is in an awkward position because he is, in \neffect, trying to represent what he understood the Agriculture \nDepartment's position might be. We are not all barley experts, but he \nis willing to work with Senators on that.\n  So let me ask consent so that we try to get agreement on how we \nproceed. By the way, I want to say the distinguished Democratic leader \nhas been working with me to come up with a fair and equitable way to \nhandle this bill and amendments. There is a lot of emotion on \nagriculture bills and commodities, and we have worked together to try \nto come up with a procedure here that will be a fair process that \neverybody can get their case made and maybe we can go ahead and be \nworking on barley and water rights and peanuts and FDA and everything \nthat is pending.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order to the pending agriculture \nappropriations bill, that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments, that no motions to refer be in order and no points of order \nbe considered as having been waived by this agreement. The amendments \nare as follows and must be offered and debated prior to the close of \nbusiness this evening with the exception of the Kennedy amendment \nregarding FDA: Burns regarding barley; Brown regarding water rights; \nSantorum regarding peanuts, eight amendments, which I hope will wind up \nbeing no more than one; the Mikulski amendment regarding FDA; Leahy \nregarding milk orders; Craig regarding GAO study; Lugar regarding \ndouble cropping; Kerrey Nos. 4978, 4979 and 4980; Kennedy regarding an \nFDA amendment; Simpson regarding wetland easements; a Pell amendment \nunspecified; Thurmond regarding agriculture research; a Frahm amendment \nregarding section 515, rental housing program; Bryan No. 4977; and \nGregg No. 4955.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion of debate on the above-\nlisted amendments, any votes ordered with respect to the amendments be \nstacked to occur beginning at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, tomorrow, with the \nfirst vote limited to the standard 15 minutes and any stacked votes \nthereafter limited to 10 minutes with 2 minutes for debate to be \nequally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, would the distinguished majority leader \nnote on his list instead of an amendment by me on milk orders, that it \nis an amendment on the Northern Forest Stewardship Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Northern Forest Stewardship Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suspect it is going to be accepted anyway, but it will \nnot be on milk orders.\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend my unanimous-consent request to reflect that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, it is not my intention to \nhold up the Senate, and I do want to help this process move along. I am \nconstrained to object at the moment.\n  What I would like to suggest is that we sit down here for a few \nminutes and see if we can divine a way by which we can address this \nproblem so that we can have a UC that I would not object to. I do not \nwant to be in a circumstance where we now lock in a process so that at \n11:30 in the morning this thing is done and gone and our opportunity to \naddress this issue is over and we are told, well, we are very \nsympathetic; we think you had an awfully good case; we have 16 people \nstudying it; we have 86 staff people looking at it. And the fact is, \nnothing will get done and we know that.\n  So what I want to do, if we can, is spend a few minutes, perhaps in \nthe next few minutes, seeing if we can find a way to solve this problem \nnow that we have the opportunity to solve it, and if we can find a way \nto do that and find a process by which that can be done, then we can \nhave the unanimous-consent request that I would not object to.\n  It is not my intention to hold this up. I want to be helpful, but I \ndo also want to be helpful to some thousands of farmers out there who \nsigned up for something that under the current circumstances they will \nnot get, and that is not fair and we ought to fix it. So I do object. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, as I stand here before you, amendments are \ncoming in. It is growing. If we do not get a unanimous-consent \nagreement, it is going to continue to grow. We need to get the \nagriculture appropriations bill done. I understand Senators want to \nwork it out. The Senator has indicated he is willing to do that. But \nmaybe we should just go ahead and go on with the business and get a \nrecorded vote up as soon as we can. I believe we have one we could do \non maybe market research, something, but we have to get our work done. \nIf we cannot get a UC, then let us start voting.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is there a unanimous-consent request pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not know if the Senator actually objected or not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did.\n  Mr. LOTT. He did.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I made the point that if we can take \njust a couple minutes here, we may be able to solve this problem. I \nsuggest that we have a brief quorum call and see if we could through \nsome discussion solve this problem. It is not my intention to hold up \nthe Senate. I understand exactly what the majority leader wants to do.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is a fair request. Let us make a run at it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may direct a comment to the majority leader on \nthis--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Excuse me. Did the Chair note my objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. The objection was heard, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection was heard.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, first of all, I want to cooperate with the \nmajority leader. I am afraid, as they say, he has poured out more than \nwe can smooth over this evening. There are a lot of amendments here \nthat are going to require a lot of debate. For example, Senator \nSantorum does not have one amendment; he has eight amendments.\n  To suggest that all of these amendments will be debated tonight, and \nwe start voting at 11 o'clock in the morning, we would be lucky to \nfinish by 11 o'clock in the morning if we stayed here all night the way \nI look at this thing. So I would suggest that we try to craft this in \nsuch a way that we say, first, these amendments be the only ones in \norder. I sympathize with that totally, and I think that is the first \npart of the agreement that we get, if we possibly can, to stop the very \nhemorrhaging you are talking about of new amendments.\n  Second, I think we ought to limit the time agreement on these \namendments so that we do not take 2 hours. I know Senator Kennedy feels \nvery strongly about one amendment and wants 2 hours. So I am just \nsaying that if we could limit the amendments in the unanimous-consent \nagreement--and I do not believe the Senator from North Dakota would \nobject to that--I think we could get that done now, and that would be a \nmajor step toward getting this bill finished.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, let us see if we can get the sticking \npoint we have before us worked out. In the meantime, while the \ninterested parties are talking about that, we will see how we can craft \na unanimous consent that would reflect that.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am glad to either file the amendment \nwhich I would hope we would have an opportunity to debate--but I am \nglad to send that at an appropriate time to the desk this evening. I \nwas told by the floor managers they preferred to deal with the \nagricultural issues this evening. I said I would speak tonight on this \namendment. They indicated that, as much as they wanted to hear me \nspeak, they would rather deal with particularly agricultural amendments \nand then go over until tomorrow.\n  I want to indicate I am not interested in an undue delay, but I have \nhad a number of Members who have spoken to me, saying that they would \nlike to speak on this issue. I can file the amendment here this \nevening. We will be prepared to be on the floor at a time to be \ndesignated by the leader to either follow those amendments that deal \nwith agriculture or whatever order the majority leader wants. But I \nwant to be able to preserve both my right and time tomorrow to address \nthis issue, which is of major importance and really not relevant to the \nsubject at hand.\n  The subject at hand is the agricultural appropriations. This is \ndealing with the Food and Drug Administration. It is a part of a bill \nthat is currently before the Senate and also before the House, where \nthere are good-faith negotiations, allegedly, taking place to try to \nwork out some of the differences. I want to have an opportunity to \nspeak to that issue, but I want to also indicate I have been requested \nto restrain that now to deal with the agricultural issues. I will \nfollow that request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we have been working as the Senator has \nbeen talking. If the Senator will allow me to renew this unanimous-\nconsent request, I think we have something we can get done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the following \namendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments in order to \nthe pending agriculture appropriations bill, that they be subject to \nsecond-degree amendment, that no motions to refer be in order, and no \npoints of order be considered as having been waived by this agreement. \nThe amendments are as follows. My intent here is to lock in this list \nof amendments so it will not continue to grow as the night progresses. \nHere is the list:\n  Burns, regarding barley; Brown, regarding water rights; Santorum \namendments, regarding peanuts; Mikulski, regarding FDA; Leahy, \nregarding Northern Forest Stewardship Act; Craig, No. 4971; Leahy, \nregarding double cropping; Kerrey, Nos. 4978, 4979, and 4980; Kennedy, \nregarding FDA; Simpson, regarding wetlands easements; Bumpers, \nregarding agriculture research; Thurmond, regarding agriculture \nresearch; Frahm, regarding section 515, rental housing program; Bryan, \nNo. 4977; Gregg, No. 4959; Burns, relevant; Smith, relevant; Hatfield, \ntwo relevants; Brown, relevant, one,\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\nand the second would be water rights task force; Murkowski, two \nrelevant amendments; Domenici, regarding drought; Cochran, two relevant \namendments; Hatch, regarding FDA; Lott-Bumpers-Wellstone with two; \nDaschle with two; Leahy, regarding agriculture; Sarbanes, regarding \nagriculture; Leahy, regarding wild rice; Dorgan, regarding barley; and \nDorgan, regarding a sense of the Senate on Canadian trade; that we \nwould have stacked votes at 11 o'clock on those that have been debated \nand debate completed, then we would resume after those stacked votes \nwith the remainder of these amendments until we complete the list, many \nof which I hope will not be offered.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For clarification purposes, the majority leader did not \nnote, I do not believe, second-degree amendments would have to be \nrelevant, but I am sure that was the intent.\n  Mr. LOTT. I may have read over that because I was reading it fast: be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And there is no time limit on the amendments for \npurposes of debate?\n  Mr. LOTT. Not at this time. We are just trying to lock in the list of \namendments, which is a lengthy list, and all of our agriculture \nfriends, I am sure, would like to have an agriculture appropriations \nbill. So we need a little cooperation here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Further reserving the right to object, I hope we could \nagree with this. The majority leader and I have been working. As he \nmade the list, I am quite sure there are at least as many Republican as \nDemocratic amendments, so this is true bipartisanship. There is as much \ninterest in amending this from the Republican side as there is from the \nDemocratic side, so I certainly hope no one would come to any \nconclusion that it was only the Democrats that were holding this up.\n  But I do believe this unanimous consent works for both sides. It \nprotects Senators to offer their amendments, and it gives us an \nopportunity to work tonight to address some of them. I hope we could \nfinish the work sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Democratic leader for his effort to be helpful \nin this regard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I ask the able majority \nleader that I be added, a Conrad amendment with respect to barley, so \nwe have another slot. So, hopefully, we can get this worked out in a \nway that achieves a result. If we could reach that understanding, I \nwould not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will amend my unanimous-consent request to that extent: \nSenator Conrad regarding barley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could ask the distinguished majority leader, did that \nlist include under my name an aquaculture reauthorization?\n  Mr. LOTT. I had it listed as agriculture. Is it supposed to be \naquaculture?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Aqua. You have to forgive my New England accent.\n  Mr. LOTT. You talk a little funny.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We talk a little funny up in New England, but we do our \nbest. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Put my name down for an amendment on dairy.\n  Mr. LOTT. Heflin regarding dairy. We need to get dairy in here. It \nwould not be a normal agriculture bill without it. All right, sir. We \nhave added that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object to \nthis request, the majority leader does not, by this request, limit the \ntime on the bill. He attempts to limit the amendments that will be \noffered. I only want to make certain the amendment that he has \nreferenced, the barley amendment that I would offer--you are describing \nan amendment about barley, not necessarily the amendment that I have \nsent to the committee. I may want to change the method of paying for \nthat. I assume the unanimous-consent request simply allows me a \nrelevant barley amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, you are on the list for a relevant barley amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But I am not necessarily tied to the amendment I \nsubmitted to the committee. I assume I will be able to modify that \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Any Senator can modify his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I further ask, as I did earlier, when we begin the \nstacked votes at 11 o'clock, the first vote be 15 minutes and the \nstacked votes thereafter be limited to 10 minutes, with 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Reserving the right to object, I sort of feel like some \nof these things are a little complicated. Could we have, on peanuts, 4 \nminutes equally divided instead of 2?\n  Mr. LOTT. If there are any peanut amendments, then 4 minutes on the \nfirst of those that might be offered, equally divided. Is that all \nright?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. First two. We have eight.\n  Mr. LOTT. Four minutes on first two equally divided with the hope \nthere would not be more than one. That agreement is included in our \nrequest.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, as I \nunderstood the unanimous consent agreement, the first part was these \namendments would be an exclusive list.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The second part of the agreement, the second unanimous \nconsent agreement said that we would stack votes beginning at 11 \no'clock in the morning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right, sir.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It did not say all of these amendments would be disposed \nof prior to that time?\n  Mr. LOTT. No, just those debated and ready for votes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am confused by the Senator's request for 4 minutes on \npeanut amendments.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. If they come up. If we can get everyone to agree to a 4-\nminute time agreement, maybe we could finish tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. He wants 4 minutes immediately prior to the votes in the \nstacked order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. OK.\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the best thing to do at this point, as laboriously \nas that agreement was worked out, let us go forward now with the \nefforts to get an agreement on barley and start taking up the \namendments and turn it over to the very able managers of the \nlegislation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if I could have the attention of the two \nmanagers, I do have an amendment on behalf of myself, the Senators from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe and Mr. Cohen; the Senators from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg and Mr. Smith; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords; and \nSenators Moynihan, Kennedy, and Kerry regarding the northern forest \nstewardship.\n\n  If the managers are in a position to accept this, I am willing to \noffer it and go forward. If they prefer we wait until a later time, I \nam willing to do that. I just understand some people want to get some \nthings moving forward. So I ask the distinguished managers, if that is \nthe case, I will offer it on behalf of those Senators, otherwise I will \nwithhold until a later time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the President will yield, let me \nrespond by saying this is an issue that is not an agriculture \nappropriations issue, as the Senator knows.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is related to forestry and comes under the \njurisdiction of other committees. So I am not able to accept the \namendment or recommend it be accepted. I understand there are some \nobjections to it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will withhold, Madam President. If I can ask the Senator \nfrom Mississippi a further question, my\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nunderstanding is that under the unanimous-consent agreement we are now \noperating under, this amendment, however, is protected at least to the \nextent of being able to bring it up, subject to all the other \nconditions. If I do not bring it up tonight, it is still protected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As I understand it, he has the right to offer the \namendment at any time. He can offer it now, and it will become a \npending amendment which will have to be laid aside temporarily to \nconsider other amendments, or he can offer it later.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I believe, then, I will offer it now and \nthen yield to the Senator from Mississippi who will then move to set it \naside and make the bill available for other amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4987\n\n(Purpose: To implement the recommendations of the Northern Forest Lands \n                                Council)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Snowe, \nGregg, Jeffords, Smith, Cohen, Moynihan, Kennedy, and Kerry, and that \nit be reported and become the pending business.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am attempting to understand this \namendment and would like to work with the Senator from Vermont. It has \nnot had the kind of airing I would hope for, and there is a question, \nas the chairman just said. I do not want to object this evening to \nthis, but I would like to sit down with the Senator from Vermont prior \nto the consideration of it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, let the distinguished chairman move to \nset it aside, but it will be there. Under the unanimous-consent \nagreement, I have the right to bring it up at any time. I will offer it \njust so I can now leave the floor and it is there. Obviously, it will \nnot be brought up until such time as the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho and I have had a chance to talk.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Under that understanding and consideration of the Senator \nfrom Vermont, I will not object.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I was going to say for point of \nclarification, there are other amendments pending as well, so it is not \nlike this is the only amendment offered. There is a market access \namendment, Senator Kerrey has three amendments pending, and there are \nothers, all of which are pending before the Senate now. This is not \nunusual. The only reason you were asking unanimous consent was so that \nthose could be set aside and you could offer that amendment. I suggest \nthat the clerk report the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Smith, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Kerry proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4987.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to seek the Senate's approval of \nS. 1163, the Northern Forest Stewardship Act, the result of a joint \neffort on the part of my colleagues from New England and New York--\nSenators Jeffords, Gregg, Smith, Snowe, Cohen, Moynihan, Kennedy, \nKerry, and thousands of constituents who live in our region, one \ncharacterized by some 26 million acres of forest spanning four States.\n  The Northern Forest Stewardship Act of 1995, S. 1163, is an example \nof what Congress can achieve when it heeds the public's voice. The \nbipartisan legislation that I introduced with several other northern \nforest Senators on August 10, 1995, is founded on extensive research, \nopen discussion, consensus decisions, and visionary problem solving by \nthe people who have a stake in the future of the forest.\n  Legislation rarely embodies such a thorough effort by so diverse a \nconstituency. Our goal was to accurately reflect the recommendations of \nthe northern forest communities, envisioned in the final report of the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council.\n  The council process was initiated to avoid the conflicts that have \ndivided communities in some regions of our country. These conflicts \nhave very often been fueled by misinformation, politics and short-term \neconomic gain.\n  Over the past 4 years, northern forest communities have made a \ndedicated effort to develop a shared vision for their future. They have \nworked hard to arrive at a consensus and our job is to insure that \ntheir efforts are rewarded.\n  This legislation is guided solely by the council's recommendations--\nit goes no further, nor does it fall short. The bill includes a package \nof technical and financial assistance which the Congress can and should \nsupport.\n  Between the Family Forestland Preservation Act (S. 692) and the \nNorthern Forest Stewardship Act (S. 1163), Congress can meet the \nrecommendations made by the people of the northern forest.\n  The Northern Forest Stewardship Act includes provisions on the \ncouncil's fundamental principles; formation of forestry cooperatives; \ndefining measurable benchmarks for sustainability; a northern forest \nresearch cooperative; interstate coordination and dialog; forest-based \nworker safety and training; funding for land conservation planning and \nacquisition; landowner liability; and nongame wildlife conservation.\n  The legislation embodies the conservation ethic of the 1990's--non-\nregulatory incentives and assistance to realize community-based goals \nfor sustainable economic and environmental prosperity. The rights and \nresponsibilities of landowners are emphasized, the primacy of the \nStates is reinforced, and the traditions of the region are protected. \nYet, the bill also promotes new ways of achieving our goals and a \ncommon vision that did not exist several years ago.\n  Moving ahead with the Council's work, we will pursue enhanced forest \nmanagement, land protection that supports the recreational and wildlife \nneeds of the region, integrated research and decision making, and \nincreased productivity in the traditional as well as new compatible \nindustries.\n  Through this bill, we can boost sustainable development and protect \nthe ecological integrity of biological resources across the landscape. \nThe Nation has taken notice of this highly successful effort as a model \nfor meeting the conservation challenges of the country, and I am \nconfident of its inevitable success.\n  We welcomed the constructive input of many people and organizations \nwho compared our legislation with the final recommendations, research, \nand public participation of the Northern Forest Lands Council.\n  It was our goal to create the best possible representation of the \nfuture described in the report to Congress, Finding Common Ground: \nConserving the Northern Forest--to make the Council's solutions work, \nand work well. I want to thank the many citizens for their hard work \nwhich helped shape the final product.\n  The Northern Forest Stewardship Act is the work of many people. I \nwant to congratulate the members of the council for their success, and \nmost importantly the people of the northern forest for their enthusiasm \nduring the long process. Thousands of people took time to turn out for \npublic meetings and share their views on the northern forest. Hundreds \nmore put pen to paper or picked up the phone to register their \nthoughts.\n  Senators Gregg, Jeffords, Cohen and Snowe deserve particular thanks \nfor their contributions to this effort.\n  The Northern Forest Lands Council recommendations reflect the first, \ntrue consensus vision of northern forest communities. We must reward \nthat cooperation by providing a fair and true legislative reflection of \ntheir combined wisdom.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise in support of the Northern \nForest Stewardship Act and commend Senator Leahy for his leadership on \nthis initiative.\n  It was almost a decade ago that a sudden sale of a large tract of \nforest land in northern Vermont and New Hampshire forced people to take \nnotice of the value and vulnerability of the timber lands in an area \nwhich has become known as the Northern Forest.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\n  Foresters, conservationists, and recreationists became somewhat \nalarmed at the prospects that these forest lands, long valued for the \naforementioned traditional uses, might instead be parceled and sold to \nbidders whose intentions and values did not necessarily match those of \nthe landowners who had long provided stewardship of these lands.\n  The States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont marshaled \ntheir resources and convened a study group to investigate the nature \nand extent of the matter. We learned, frankly, that some of our \nconcerns were overstated. A study of land transfers did not reveal an \nimminent threat of large scale land sales. But we also learned how \nfragile the economics of forestry has become. And if the business of \nforestry cannot be sustained, then neither can we take for granted the \nbenefits of the wooded lands.\n  So the Northern Forest Lands Council studied these issues in depth \nand in 1994, issued its recommendations. These recommendations, it is \nimportant to note, reflect a consensus among many sectors concerned \nwith forest issues. The council worked hard to ensure a high level of \nagreement between diverse constituencies, and we here in Congress have \nsought to continue in that mode.\n  We have followed two tracks to implement the consensus \nrecommendations, and the Northern Forest Stewardship Act represents the \nconservation and stewardship part of the equations. Our goal here has \nbeen to closely follow the council's suggestions, and I greatly \nappreciate the efforts and energies of the many stakeholders who have \nhelped move this initiative forward. This Stewardship Act is designed \nto help the States and private owners to move forward on many \ninitiatives designed to protect and enhance the forest health, forest \neconomies, and community development.\n  The other part of the equation has been put forward in a bill \nsponsored by Senator Gregg. These measures would implement the many \nFederal tax policy changes recommended by the council. My desire would \nbe to merge the two bills, as one complements the other. As I have \nsaid, there is broad agreement that it is increasingly difficult to \nmake a living as a forester, and the tax changes contained in the Gregg \nbill would be of great benefit to Vermont forestry professionals. While \nit is not practical or possible to move the Gregg bill in concern with \nthe Stewardship bill at this time, I think it is something toward which \nwe should work, and I know several of my colleagues share this view.\n  Madam President, this bill is an important step for the Northern \nForest. As our progress here tonight is only possible because of the \nwork already done by the Lands Council and all those involved in \ndeveloping the consensus recommendations, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe mission statement of the Northern Forest Lands Council be printed \nin the Record. This statement reflects the guiding principles of the \ncouncil, and serves as our benchmark, as well.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                     Northern Forest Lands Council\n\n\n                           mission statement\n\n       The mission of the Northern Forest Lands Council is to \n     reinforce the traditional patterns of land ownership and uses \n     of large forest areas in the Northern Forest of Maine, New \n     Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, which have characterized \n     these lands for decades. This mission is to be achieve by:\n       Enhancing the quality of life for local residents through \n     the promotion of economic stability for the people and \n     communities of the area and through the maintenance of large \n     forest areas;\n       Encouraging the production of a sustainable yield of forest \n     products, and;\n       Protecting recreational, wildlife, scenic and wildland \n     resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nMississippi for his usual courtesy and help, and the rest of the Leahy \nfamily thanks him, because I think this will make my evening somewhat \neasier than his.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Idaho, who is chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee of the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture. He is familiar with these issues, and his \nhelp and efforts to understand the implications of this amendment will \nbe deeply appreciated.\n  I am hoping that other Senators can come to the floor and offer their \namendments or debate amendments that are pending. We had a lot of \ndebate yesterday on the market access program. I suggest we probably \ndebated that enough. We can vote on that at 11 o'clock in the morning, \nin accordance with the request of the majority leader.\n  There may be other amendments that can be voted on at that time as \nwell. Certainly, the market access program is one we fully debated \nyesterday, and I expect a vote can occur at 11 o'clock on that \namendment. There are probably others as well.\n  There may be some amendments that have been cleared. I do know \nSenator Thurmond had an amendment that we talked about involving \nresearch by the Department of Agriculture. It might be cooperative \nState research. I am prepared to submit that amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendments be set aside for the purpose of \noffering this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, to introduce an amendment to \nrestore funding for three agricultural research projects that are \nconducted by Clemson University. While I am aware that funding is \nlimited this year for all programs, these particular research projects \nwill benefit all American farmers.\n  The alternative cropping systems project is a joint research effort \nwith Clemson University, the University of Georgia, and North Carolina \nState University, which is conducting research in production and \nmarketing of alternative crops to the traditional agronomic crops grown \nin the southeast. To continue this research, $232,000 is needed.\n  The peach tree short life research project is currently conducting \nfield trials to determine if a ground cover used in peach orchards \ninhibits reproduction of ring nematodes, a contributing cause of peach \ntree short life. This disease causes the premature death of peach \ntrees. Of the $500,000 included in this amendment, $162,000 would be \nused to continue this research.\n  The last program this money would be used for is the pest control \nalternatives research project. Currently, Clemson University is working \nto develop innovative pest control techniques which help reduce \nenvironmental concerns and increase returns to farmers. For this \nresearch program, $106,000 is requested.\n  The consumer is asking for safer food production methods. Further, \nour farmers need research assistance to help reduce pesticide usage on \nfruits and vegetables and increase the marketing potential of our \ncrops. These research projects will help find solutions to these \nproblems, thus aiding farmers as well as consumers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. It deals with research in the State of South Carolina. I know of \nno objection to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this deals with the 515 housing \nprogram, the low-income housing program.\n Mrs. FRAHM. Madam President, this is an amendment to H.R. \n3603, the 1997 agriculture appropriations bill, to remedy a problem \nwith an important low-income housing program.\n  My amendment specifically addresses the Rural Housing Services \nProgram administered by the Department of Agriculture--the so-called \nsection 515 program. This multifamily rural rental housing program is \none of the few resources available to give very low-income and low-\nincome residents of rural America access to decent, safe, and \naffordable housing. My staff has been informed by the CBO that this \namendment will not increase the deficit.\n  While I firmly believe that housing issues and problems are best \nresolved on the State and local level, as the Agriculture Department \nstill retains control of these programs we should make them work as \nefficiently as possible. I hope that in the near future we can make \nsweeping reforms that push these responsibilities to State and local \ngovernments; just as our forefathers originally intended when they \nwrote the tenth amendment.\n  Despite improvements in housing quality, 2.7 million families still \nlive in substandard housing. According to 1990 census data, rural \nrenters were more than twice as likely to live in substandard housing \nas people who owned their homes. With lower median income and higher \npoverty rates than homeowners, many renters simply cannot find decent, \naffordable housing.\n  The section 515 program assists the rural elderly, the disabled, and \nfamilies. The average tenant served by the program has an income of \n$7,300. In my home state of Kansas the average tenant income is even \nlower, only $6,590. Make no mistake, these people would not be able to \nafford decent housing without this program.\n  My amendment would make several changes to the section 515 program \nthat help alleviate existing problems. It would limit project transfers \nto instances when the Secretary determines that such transfer would be \nin the best interest of the Federal Government.\n  Currently, when a project begins to fail financially, the Rural \nHousing Service transfers the property to another owner rather than \ninstitute foreclosure proceeding. When the property is transferred, the \nnew owner assumes the terms of the old debt, but at the fair market \nvalue at the time of the transfer. As many of these properties have \ndecayed and experienced vacancy problems, the appraisal will often be \nfor much less than the previous loan amount. The losses the Government \nincurs can be substantial as properties age and tax credits are \nexhausted.\n  Under current law, an account is established in the Department of \nAgriculture to offset the cost of guarantees for private-market equity \ntakeout loans. Owners pay a certain amount into the account to offset \nthe future cost of those loan guarantees.\n  Current law requires each owner to deposit $2 per unit rent into the \nreserve account each month. It further allows the owner to increase the \nper unit rent by this amount to pay for these deposits. Since tenants \nare limited as to how\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nmuch they can pay for rent, these payments must come from additional \nrental assistance. My amendment would reduce the cost of rental \nassistance by no longer letting owners increase the rents to fund their \ndeposits into the reserve.\n  The most important part of the amendment is the addition of criminal \npenalties for any owner, agent, or manager who willfully uses or \nauthorizes the use of rents or income of the property for any purpose \nother than to meet actual or necessary expenses. This provides an \neffective deterrent to wrongdoing by unscrupulous participants.\n  Madam President, I believe these modifications to the section 515 \nprogram are a good first step toward getting the program back on track. \nThey return the program to its important public purpose, one that has \nworked in Kansas, of creating safe and sanitary rental alternatives for \nvery low-income residents in America's rural communities. I ask that my \ncolleagues support my amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I rise to support the amendment \nsponsored by the gentlelady from Kansas which would reform the \nDepartment of Agriculture's section 515 Rural Rental Loan Program. I \nsalute Senator Frahm for her dedication and commitment to reforming and \nimproving this program which serves as the only source of affordable \nrental housing in much of our Nation's rural areas. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs I would like to \npersonally commend our newest Member for her quick action in proposing \nbipartisan reform measures which should become law this year.\n  I would also like to express appreciation to Senator Cochran and \nSenator Bumpers for their consideration of this amendment at the \nrequest of the Banking Committee. The Banking Committee will consider \nmore comprehensive reforms to the section 515 program in the context of \nan overall examination of housing programs within the Rural Housing \nService of the Department of Agriculture. However, Senator Frahm's \namendment includes changes to section 515 which are overdue and should \nbe made in advance of a thorough analysis of this important program.\n  This amendment would respond to a February, 1996 evaluation report \nentitled ``Legislative Proposals to Strengthen the Rural Housing \nServices' Rural Rental Housing Program'' issued by the Department of \nAgriculture's Office of Inspector General. Specifically, the amendment \nwould include the inspector general's No. 1 legislative objective--the \nenactment of civil and criminal penalties for participants in the \nprogram that misuse rural rental housing project assets or income. It \nis absolutely imperative that those in criminal violation be swiftly \nand severely punished. Specifically, any owner, agent or manager of \nsection 515 or section 414 farm labor housing projects that willfully \nuses or authorizes the use of any part of the rents, assets, proceeds, \nincome or other funds derived from the property for an unauthorized \npurpose may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned for up to 5 years.\n  In addition, the amendment would make reforms to the section 515 \nprogram which include: the prohibition of transfer of ownership of a \nproject unless the Secretary of Agriculture--Secretary--determines that \nsuch transfer would further the provision of low-income housing and be \nin the best interests of residents and the Federal Government; the \nelimination of the occupancy surcharge charged to residents to fund \nequity loans; and the requirement that an equity loan may not be made \nunless the Secretary determines that available incentives are not \nadequate to provide a fair return on the investment, prevent \nprepayment, and prevent resident displacement.\n  Finally, the amendment would extend the section 515 program for 1 \nyear, from its current expiration date of September 30, 1996 to \nSeptember 30, 1997. A permanent extension will be considered during \ncomprehensive reform of the program.\n  The need for affordable housing in rural areas is severe. The 1990 \ncensus estimated that 2.7 million rural Americans live in substandard \nhousing. The section 515 program is one of the few resources available \nto respond to this critical unmet housing need. Since its inception in \n1962, the section 515 program has financed the development of over \n450,000 affordable rental units in over 18,000 apartment projects. The \nprogram assists elderly, disabled, and low-income rural families with \nan average income of $7,300.\n  I thank Senator Frahm for her recognition of the great need for this \nprogram and her steadfast commitment to ensuring that every Federal \ndollar appropriated serves the greatest number of rural poor. I look \nforward to working with her to further improve this much needed program \nin the future and I support immediate passage of this amendment. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

And that is, that we should not be required--and I \ndo not think we are going to be required--to sit here all night pending \nsome Senator deciding to come over and offer his amendment.\n  The unanimous-consent agreement has been entered into. Everybody \nknows which amendments are going to be in order. Senator Cochran and I \ndo not have any interest in sitting here during numerous quorum calls \nhoping that somebody will show up. So I hope Senators will be \nconsiderate enough to get them offered and disposed of this evening, if \nwe can. And with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I understand that the majority leader is \nworking on an agreement of some sort. So I will not begin any kind of \nformal amendment proceedings. But I do have an amendment at the desk, \nwhich I would like to talk about.\n  I am not going to offer this amendment. I want to talk about it \nbecause I think it is important to realize the cost of the peanut \nprogram. Not only do I refer to the cost of the peanut program to the \nAmerican peanut farmers, to the millions of processing jobs, and to the \nconsumers, but the cost to the Federal Government of the peanut \nprogram.\n  As a result of the past farm bill, we now have a no-cost peanut \nprogram. Well, that may be true within the confines of the peanut \nprogram, but the program does two things. It limits the amount of \npeanuts grown for domestic consumption. It is a program that says here \nis how much will be grown in this country for use in this country. The \nDepartment of Agriculture sets that amount. In addition, it doesn't \njust limit the amount of the peanuts that are grown, it also sets the \nprice.\n  You might think that I am talking about the former Soviet Union here. \nNo, this is America. We set how much farmers can grow, and we set what \nwe are going to pay for that--all done by the Federal Government--which \nis an amazing thing, but that is how the peanut program works.\n  Well, the fact is that the Federal Government is a consumer of \npeanuts. We have a variety of nutrition programs in the Federal \nGovernment. We have TEFAP and the school lunch programs, and all down \nthe list. You would not be surprised that a lot of these programs are \nfocused on kids, and you probably wouldn't be further surprised that \none of the major staples of young kids is peanuts and peanut butter. I \nhave a 5-year-old who loves peanut butter. Guess where we have to buy \nour peanuts for domestic consumption with the Federal programs; we have \nto buy quota peanuts.\n  Quota peanuts sell between $600 and $700 a ton. The world market \nprice for peanuts--the price for additional peanuts not grown under the \nblessings of the Federal Government, which can be sold here but have to \nbe exported--is about $350 to $400 a ton. So the Federal Government has \nto pay roughly twice what the world pays for peanuts. All these \nnutrition programs have to pay twice what the world pays for peanuts to \ngo ahead and feed our kids.\n  The GAO--this was some 6 years ago, and the quota price has jumped \naround a bit, but it is relatively the same as 6 years ago--said that \nover $14 million a year the Federal Government spends. Where? Out of \nthe mouths of people who could be fed through Federal nutritious meals. \nTo where? To wealthy quota farmers. That is where that money goes, \ninstead of feeding more kids.\n  We heard Member after Member, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, \nsay, ``What about the kids? Don't you care about the kids? We should \nhave more money to feed these children. We should have more money to \ntake care of these kids.'' So what do we do with the peanut program? We \nsuck money out of these nutrition programs to go to help kids, and it \ngoes where? To a bunch of wealthy quota owners, many of whom don't even \nfarm the land. They sit all over the world with their little quota that \nthey got passed down from their granddaddies. They take money right out \nof the mouths of kids in our Federal Government programs.\n\n  I had an amendment at the desk that would say that USDA, who \npurchases peanuts and peanut products for the variety of the nutrition \nprograms that they operate, would not have to buy quota peanuts, would \nnot have to pay twice the world price to feed our poor kids in America.\n  The problem with that amendment, as I find out, is that the quota has \nalready been set for this year. Thereby, if we took those quota peanuts \nthat--the way they calculate the market and the production--would have \nordinarily come to the USDA, we would, in a sense, have more peanuts go \non loan, which means the price of the peanut program would go up about \n$5 million. So we score it as a $5 million loss this year.\n  Unfortunately, because this is an appropriations bill, I cannot \nchange the law in the future. As a result, the savings in the future \nare tens of millions of dollars. But because of the quirk in the way \nthis bill is structured, and the way the amendment had to be structured \nto comply with the bill, the amendment that I have to offer, in fact, \nwould not be a cost-effective amendment. Therefore, I am not going to \noffer it. But the principle is a solid one.\n  We just finished welfare reform. We just finished saying that we need \nto make sure that those resources that we do have dedicated to helping \nthe poor should be used as efficiently and effectively as possible. A \nlot of the reform we saw in the nutrition programs out of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, particularly the Food Stamp Program, were \nfocused in on making this system a more effective and efficient system \nin delivering services to people who need them in this country. Yet, we \nhave this dinosaur of a program that looks more like something that \ncame out of Communist Russia than out of the United States, which is \ncosting children food.\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\n  Let us just lay it on the line. We are taking food out of the mouths \nof children and putting money in the pockets of wealthy quota holders. \nNow, that is wrong. That is wrong by anybody's standard. We should fix \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, again, because of the legislative vehicle we have \nbefore us, we cannot fix that. But I will tell you that I will be back. \nWe will talk about this issue. I am anxious to hear how those who \ndefend the peanut program can defend money being taken away from these \nnecessary feeding programs for children to put money in the pockets of \nwealthy quota holders, most of whom don't even farm their own land to \ngrow peanuts.\n  At this point, because I understand the majority leader is working on \nsomething, I will yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in disagreement with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I do not want to prolong this, so I will make a \nbrief statement.\n  I assume the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania was speaking of \nthe amendment he had at the desk, No. 4962, which was the prohibition \non purchase of quota peanuts for domestic feeding programs. I assume \nthat is what he had. He was talking about the School Lunch Program. As \nI understand it, he was saying that, because of the program, the \nGovernment has to pay twice the world price--twice as much for peanuts \nthat go to the School Lunch Program and other programs that the \nGovernment might be involved in. Unfortunately, I believe that the \ndistinguished Senator is not really familiar with the School Lunch \nProgram and the other USDA commodity distribution programs.\n  We have a chart here that I will point out briefly, which is based \nupon USDA calculations. This chart here is designed to show the \nmanufacturer's cost, based on USDA figures, of two jars of peanut \nbutter, both being the same size, both being generic.\n  This chart shows that the manufacturers are able to make and sell \npeanut butter to the USDA School Lunch Program at 81 cents a pound. \nYet, consumers at the market would pay $1.87 a pound. Eighty-one cents \ndoubled is $1.62. So already when you have a program by which the \nmanufacturers, in effect, bid against each other for the school lunch \npurchases, it ends up that there are considerable savings.\n  I would like to point out the pack of peanuts and the jar of peanuts. \nThis chart was prepared before the bill was passed dealing with the \nfarm bill which had the peanut program and in which the peanut program \nwas substantially reformed. In fact, it was reformed to the extent that \nit is about a 30-percent cut to the producer. But this is where it was \nprior to that time. A bag of peanuts that cost 50 cents is 99 percent \npeanuts. This is the jar of peanuts, and of peanut butter, which shows \nthat the farmer was getting 7 cents out of the 50. Then on peanut \nbutter where it is 90 percent peanuts, the farmer was getting 54 cents. \nThat would have been $1.64, and then 44 cents in addition to that, \nwhich would be $2.08 for a jar of peanuts which had 90 percent peanuts. \nBut with the cuts that have now taken place under the farm bill and \nunder this reform, you would have to take away 30 percent, which would \nshow 4.9 cents that the farmer got. And here, in regard to the 30 \npercent, it was changed; the farmer, instead of getting 54 cents, is \ngoing to get 38 cents.\n  There has been a lot of talk that there would be pass-ons by which \nthe savings would be passed on to the consumer. The GAO, in a study, \nconsulted and talked to the manufacturers, and the manufacturers had \nindicated that they could not guarantee any savings would be passed on \nin that the money would be used to develop new products and \nadvertising.\n  It is sort of interesting what has occurred recently in regard to \ncereals. This is not about peanuts but about cereals. Corn and other \ngrain prices today are at an all-time high. Corn, for example, was at a \n5-year historical average of $2.30 a bushel, and the price today on \ncorn is $5.35 a bushel, which is substantially more than double. But \nyet, the cereal manufacturers have recently reduced the price of their \nbreakfast cereal by as much as 25 percent to 30 percent.\n  I think this demonstrates that there is very little relationship \nbetween what the farmers are paid for their commodity and what food \nproducts are sold for at retail.\n  So, therefore, it ought to be plain that any savings to the \nmanufacturers through reduced or capped costs on the farmer would not \ntranslate into savings to the retail consumers.\n  To give you some idea as to the cost, we have a chart showing what a \njar of peanut butter sells for in the United States, being an 18-ounce \nequivalent jar of brand name peanut butter, not generic. It sells for \n$2.10. These are USDA figures. In Mexico it is $2.55, and so on.\n  Actually, ours are the lowest in the world and by far the safest. \nThere are matters pertaining to inspection of foreign peanuts coming in \nthat raise questions concerning food safety because there is a problem \nthat is known as aflatoxin, and aflatoxin in the United States is \ncontrolled. It is a disease, and it is such that can cause cancer. But \nthe peanuts that come in from foreign countries do not have the \nstandards that we have in the United States.\n  I could go on, but I do not want to unduly take time to talk about \nthis. The matter of peanuts could be discussed for a great while. The \npeanut program has been substantially reformed. The Department is now \nin the process of implementing the law. I just do not believe that we \nought to move at this time to try to change it. Let us see what is \ngoing to happen with the program.\n  So I would say that this is not the time. Most of the peanut farmers \nhave gone to the bank, and they have made their loans. They have made \ntheir plans for the year. They have signed up relative to the crop \ninsurance and other things. Now in the middle of a crop year, I just do \nnot believe is the time for us to be changing the peanut program.\n  I appreciate very much the fact that the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is not planning to offer the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside in order to offer a couple of amendments that \nhave been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Hatch and Senator \nHarkin, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 55, line 7, after the colon, insert the following: \n     Provided further, That a sufficient amount of these funds \n     shall be used to ensure compliance with the statutory \n     deadlines set forth in section 505(j)(4)(A) of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(4)(A)):''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It \ndirects the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to devote sufficient \nresources to making sure that generic drug applications are reviewed \nwithin the statutory deadline, which is 180 days.\n  Many of my colleagues may be surprised to know that the FDA is not \nmeeting this deadline. In fact, it has fallen woefully short of meeting \nthe law's requirement.\n  It is obvious to me that the Senate has learned one thing from our \nextensive debate on GATT and pharmaceutical patents over the past 8 \nmonths. We all want to do what we can to speed less-costly \npharmaceutical products to the marketplace.\n  And that is the goal of our amendment.\n  There are two compelling points I want to leave with Members of this \nbody.\n  The first is that FDA resources devoted to review of generic drugs \nare insufficient, and are dwindling from an alltime high in 1993.\n  The second is that the FDA's actual review time for generic drugs is \nincreasing, even while their estimates of that review time would have \nus believe the time is falling.\n  Let me elaborate.\n  On the first point, the FDA estimates that they will devote 390 full-\ntime equivalents [FTE's] to generic drug review in fiscal year 1997, \nwhich is down from the fiscal year 1996 estimate of 397 FTE's. It is \nalso down from the actual number of 396 FTE's in fiscal year 1995 and \n432 FTE's in fiscal year 1994.\n  As a matter of fact, statistics provided by the FDA itself indicate \nthat there has been a build up over the past decade from 227 FTE's \ndevoted to generic drug reviews in fiscal year 1986, steadily \nincreasing to the all-time high of 448 FTE's in fiscal year 1993, and \nnow declining each year.\n  Perhaps not coincidentally, the start of the decline was the exact \ntime when the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA] was enacted, the \nlaw which guaranteed subsidization of innovator drug reviews through \nnew user fees. Those fees were not applied to generic drug reviews.\n  On the second point, I would like to note that there is a substantial \ngap between the FDA's estimates of how long it will take them to review \ngeneric drugs and the actual review time.\n  For 2 recent years for which I have statistics supplied by the FDA, \nthere has been a large discrepancy between the time FDA thinks it will \nneed to review generic drug applications and the actual review time. In \nfiscal year 1995, for example the FDA told the Appropriations Committee \nit would take an average of 24 months to review generic drug \napplications; in fact, it took 34.2 months. The next year, the current \nfiscal year, even though the FDA had not come close to meeting its \ntarget from the year before, FDA estimated that the approval time would \nfall--to an average of 20 months. In fact, the current estimates are \nthat it is taking an average of 30 months.\n  What is really astonishing is that the law mandates a 6-month review \ntime.\n  Instead of seeking the resources to meet that statutory deadline, the \nFDA has been seeking to expand its regulatory purview, by dusting off \nold regulations such as ``Medguide'' or starting new initiatives such \nas tobacco, each of which undoubtedly requires new funding.\n  While the FDA blindly rushes to make a case for both initiatives, \nonly part of which is compelling from a public health perspective, I \nfind it intriguing that the Agency has chosen to ignore a statutory \nmandate on the one hand while it voluntarily seeks to expand its \npurview on the other.\n  What is particularly compelling is that, as the review times for \ngeneric drugs increased, the review times for innovator drugs has \ndecreased dramatically. It is now about 24 months on average; the \nmedian is estimated at 17.5 months.\n  And so we find ourselves in the ironic position that review times for \nnew drugs--both actual and projected--is shorter than the review time \nfor the generic copies, a position I find untenable.\n  Mr. President, generic drugs represent a very cost-effective means of \ncontrolling health care expenditures.\n  Any delay in sending these drugs to market increases costs to \npatients, who may end up paying more for pharmaceuticals, and it \nincreases costs to taxpayers through Government-funded programs such as \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  It is clear to me that the FDA should be giving generic drug \napplications more attention, not less.\n  That is the motivation for the amendment we offer today, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with a \ngeneric drug issue in the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction. We \nsupport passage of the amendment and recommend its approval.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside. It is agreeable to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4998) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in behalf of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith], I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Smith, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4999.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47, line 17, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, notwithstanding \n     section 306(a)(7) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(7)), the town of Berlin, \n     New Hampshire, shall be eligible during fiscal year 1997 for \n     a grant under the rural utilities assistance program''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on this \nside. It deals with a water issue in the State of New Hampshire. I \nunderstand it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me ask the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi for a moment. We have not seen the language on this \nyet. We probably will have no objection but before agreeing to it, we \nwould like to see the language.\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4999) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                          cane sugar refining\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, cane sugar refining has been around in \nAmerica since the beginning of the Republic. Christopher Columbus \nintroduced sugarcane from West Africa to Santo Domingo on his second \nvoyage in 1495. Our Nation's leading cane sugar refiner, Domino Sugar, \nwhich is headquartered in New York City, has been in business for \nnearly 200 years. Domino's Brooklyn refinery has been in operation for \n119 years.\n  The refining industry is an important part of our economy, employing \nthousands of Americans in good-paying manufacturing jobs. The Domino \nemployees at the Brooklyn plant, for instance, make about $40,000, on \naverage. Domino alone employs over 800 people in New York and 2,000 \nnationwide. Refined Sugar Inc., located in Yonkers, employs another few \nhundred. These refining jobs are, for the most part, located in inner \ncities and along urban waterfronts where other manufacturing jobs are \nscarce.\n  But the refining industry is on the brink of collapse. In the last 10 \nyears, the number of cane sugar refineries nationwide has been cut in \nhalf, from 22 to 11. Plants in Boston and Philadelphia have closed; a \nrefinery in Hawaii may have to close later this year. Other domestic \nrefiners, including Domino and Refined Sugar Inc., have had to shut \ndown several times because they have been unable to obtain adequate \nquantities of the raw product and affordable prices.\n  The domestic refining industry--one of the last bastions of \nmanufacturing in some of our cities--is being crippled by overly \nrestrictive administration of the sugar price support program. The loan \nrate for sugar is 18 cents per pound. But bowing to pressure from beet \nsugar producers, the administration has kept cane imports so low that \nthe domestic price for raw sugar has fluctuated between 22 and 25 cents \nper pound. These prices are far higher than what is necessary to \nprevent loan forfeitures, and they have stimulated beet sugar \nproduction, which has driven down the price of refined sugar. Cane \nrefiners operated in the red throughout 1995.\n  The situation has eased somewhat this year as the administration \nbelatedly and sporadically increased the quotas. But more is needed, \nand it is needed urgently, or we will lose this industry.\n  I understand my colleagues' concerns about potential disruptions to \nsugar growers in their States. In turn, I would expect them to share my \nconcern about the very real disruptions refiners in my State and \nelsewhere are experiencing.\n  The House version of H.R. 3603 includes an eminently sensible \nprovision, section 729, designed to ensure that the sugar price support \nprogram is operated in a fashion beneficial for both growers and \nrefiners. The provision stipulated that no Federal funds could be spent \nto support raw cane sugar prices at more than 117.5 percent of the \nstatutory loan rate of 18 cents per pound. This amounts to a little \nmore than 21 cents per pound. A very reasonable price for producers. \nMore than the loan rate, more than enough to prevent forfeitures--a \nprice sufficient to repay loans and cover interest and transportation \nof raw sugar to market. And a price at which refiners can operate. In \npractice, the House provision would require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to allow sufficient imports from existing quota holders so \nthat the price does not exceed 21.1 cents per pound. Growers would \nprofit. Refiners could stay in business. Adequate supplies would be \navailable at affordable prices.\n  Let me be clear. I'm no fan of the sugar price support program. It's \nSoviet-style intervention in the market. But if we are stuck with it--\nfor the time being--at least we can operate the program so that it \ndoesn't drive our refiners out of business.\n  The House provision does not abolish the sugar program. It does not \nlower the loan rate for sugar. It will not induce loan forfeitures or \ncost the Federal Government any money. Indeed, revenue from import \nduties would increase. And the provision does not open the door for \n``subsidized European sugar.''\n  I think the House provision is a very fair compromise that balances \nthe interests of producers, refiners, and end users. I urge the Senate \nconferees to H.R. 3603 to agree to the House provision, or something \nmuch like it. Last year, when Congress reviewed the sugar price support \nprogram and a majority decided to retain it, there was an understanding \nthe program would be operated in a way that is beneficial not only to \nproducers, but to refiners, users, and consumers alike. Implementation \nof the program has left something to be desired in this respect. \nSection 729 would help. I entreat the Senate conferees to H.R. 3603 to \nsupport the House provision. Otherwise, we will be driving thousands of \nmanufacturing jobs overseas.\n\n\n                    emergency disaster loan program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first commend the Chairman on the \noutstanding work he has done on this important appropriations bill. I \nwould like to bring his attention to one provision in the bill that is \nespecially important to New Mexico and the Southwest in general. The \nentire Southwest is currently in the grip of the worst drought in half \na century. Despite recent rains, stream flows in New Mexico are \npredicted to be 33 to 100 percent below average through the summer, \nwith no end in sight. This drought has devastated crops and livestock \nin my State to such an extent that every single county in New Mexico is \ncurrently eligible for USDA's disaster assistance programs. I know that \nevery State in the Southwest is suffering just as greatly.\n  One of the USDA programs that has been critical in helping the \ncitizens of my State cope with this drought is the emergency disaster \nloan program. The Western Governors' Association has identified funding \nthis program at the maximum level possible as one their top priorities \nin combating the effects of the drought. Sadly, the Clinton \nadministration chose to zero this crucial program out of its fiscal \nyear 1997 budget. In addition, the House has allocated the program a \nmere $25 million for fiscal year 1997. Fortunately, under the \nChairman's leadership, the Senate has included $75 million for \nemergency disaster relief. I would like his commitment to fight to \nmaintain the Senate funding level for this much-needed program.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand just how important the emergency disaster \nloan program is to those people whose farms and ranches have been \ndevastated by this drought, and I agree with the Senator that it was \nunfortunate that the Clinton administration chose to zero out the \nprogram just when those farmers and ranchers will need it the most. The \nSenator has my commitment that I will seek to maintain the Senate level \nof $75 million when this bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman for his outstanding leadership on \nthis important issue.\n\n\n                         raw cane sugar supply\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for his work on \nthis bill and recognize the delicate balance he must strike in \nsatisfying the varying interests of each Member. I would like to bring \nto the chairman's attention a situation that has plagued many of our \ndomestic sugar refineries with regard to raw cane sugar supply. Is the \nchairman aware that the Secretary of Agriculture has administered the \nSugar Program in such a manner as to cause shutdowns and cutbacks in \ncertain sugar refineries across the country?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, I am aware of this.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is the chairman also aware of the fact that it is the \nSecretary's responsibility to administer the program in such a manner \nthat provides an adequate supply of sugar to satisfy our domestic \nneeds?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am aware of this and am cognizant of the Senator's \npoint.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to advise the chairman that we have a \nrecurring problem with regard to supply of raw sugar for cane \nrefineries in the current administration of the sugar program. I would \nappreciate the chairman's support in reviewing report language \naddressing this supply issue as the bill moves to conference. I will be\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nhappy to provide him with such language.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The comments of the Senator from Georgia are appreciated \nand his points are well received. We will review such language that the \nSenator provides in conference.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator's overture is appreciated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4995\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to provide a total amount of \n   nonrecourse loans to producers for peanuts in excess of $125,000)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4995 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4995.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON AMOUNT OF NONRECOURSE LOANS FOR \n                   PEANUTS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to provide to a producer of a crop of \n     quota peanuts a total amount of nonrecourse loans under \n     section 155 of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 7271) in excess of $125,000.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am offering an amendment here that I think remedies \na huge inequity in the peanut program that makes the peanut program, \nfrankly, different than any of the other traditional commodity programs \nin existence. The other commodity programs in existence have a \nlimitation on payments for a particular entity that farms that product, \nthat produces that product. Under the freedom to farm act, the \nlimitation per commodity, per entity--entity can be either a single \nperson or a partnership, corporation or whatever--the limitation of a \ncommodity payment--and for the purposes of making it easier on me--per \nperson is $40,000. Prior to the freedom to farm act the limitation was \n$50,000 per payment to an entity, to a person. We reduced it to $40,000 \nin the freedom to farm bill.\n  Now, unlike all of these other commodity programs, there is no \nlimitation on how much Government support a peanut quota holder can \nreceive. And in fact there are quota holders who receive in Government \nsubsidized quota payments $6 million a year --$6 million in guaranteed \nincome from the Federal Government as a result of the peanut program.\n  We made some reforms in the freedom to farm bill. This is one area \nthat slipped through the noose. What this amendment does--it is a very \nsimple amendment. It says we are going to limit the benefits of the \npeanut program to small- and medium-size farmers.\n  I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle and, frankly, on \nthis side of the aisle who support the peanut program say: You know, \nRick, if you go after this program, there are thousands of small \nfarmers in my State you will destroy, the small- and medium-size \nfarmers in my State, if you change the peanut program.\n  I have been sensitive to that. I understand the rural economy. In \nmany areas where peanuts are grown, there is a limited number of crops \nthat can be grown. Many areas are impoverished. I understand that, and \nI sympathize with the Members who represent those areas. But what we \nare talking about here are not small farmers.\n  Let me review. I have talked about this many, many times, and I have \ntalked about the peanut program. But just let me report to you what a \nGAO study reported: That 22 percent of the peanut growers in this \ncountry receive 85 percent of the quota benefits. What does that mean? \nYou have a bunch of big farmers who get almost all the benefits of this \nprogram.\n  What I am doing here is actually a very modest change, one I would \nthink, if Members want to target these funds, target the benefits of \nthe program to the farmers who need it, then they should be supportive \nof this. This is one I am hoping we can get some support for.\n  It is an amendment that says that every entity, person, can get up \nto--are you ready for this?--$125,000 of loan payments from the Federal \nGovernment--$125,000. That means every entity can get that much. If you \nhave $6 million of peanuts to sell, you still get $125,000 at the \nguaranteed quota price, but the rest you have to sell on your own. If \nyou are producing $6 million worth of peanuts, I would think you have a \npretty good slice of the market and you can probably get a pretty good \nprice for your peanuts. What we have done here is focus the program in \non the folks who need it the most.\n  I want to step back and give a little bit of the origin of the peanut \nprogram, to show how it has evolved over the years to concentrate more \nand more of these quotas in the hands of bigger and bigger quota \nholders. I mentioned before who holds 68 percent of these quotas. A \nquota is the right to grow peanuts and sell them in this country. You \nget a quota from the Federal Government. It is passed on from \ngeneration to generation. They are sold like stocks. It is a right. It \nis worth something. It is worth a lot. It is worth $200 to $300 a ton, \nif you are growing peanuts.\n  Mr. President, 68 percent of the quota production in this country is \nheld by people who do not touch one speck of dirt. They do not farm a \nlick. They rent it to somebody else to do it for them. These are people \nwho sit in--I am from Pennsylvania. We have quota holders in \nPennsylvania. We do not grow a whole lot of peanuts in Pennsylvania. \nThere are quota holders in New Hampshire, and I am sure they do not \ngrow any peanuts in New Hampshire.\n  What we are trying to do here is deal with those folks who have sat \nback and said, ``This looks like a pretty good investment. Let's buy \nsome quota shares and make a little money on the Federal Government \nprogram.'' They have done that. They have done very well for many \nyears. Now we are going to say, ``Look, you folks, start selling those \nquotas back to the small farmers.''\n\n  If anything, what this will accomplish, in my mind, is not to really \naffect the overall amount of quota peanuts grown. What it will do is \nmake some of these big barons, quota barons, sell their quotas to folks \nwho are out there leasing land right now to grow their additional \npeanuts, which are peanuts that do not get these big, high prices. \nImagine. This is the United States of America. If you do not have a \nquota to grow peanuts, if you do not have a license from the Federal \nGovernment to grow peanuts, you cannot sell your peanuts in this \ncountry. This is America. If you do not have a license from the Federal \nGovernment to grow peanuts, you cannot sell your peanuts here.\n  I know some may have just tuned in and thought, ``Am I looking at the \nRussian Duma?'' No. This is the U.S. Senate, not the Russian Duma. You \nare not getting a translation from an interpreter. My lips actually \nmatch the words that I am saying. But, in America this goes on every \nday. This is a program that started during the Depression. They handed \nout these quotas during the Depression, prior to World War II.\n  You can imagine who got these quotas. It is no surprise that most of \nthe quotas are held by wealthy landowners. You had to own your land to \nqualify for a quota. There were a lot of sharecroppers back then, many \nof them minorities, who did not own their land. Who were these quotas \ngiven to? They were given to these local associations to distribute \naround to their buddies and themselves. It is no shock that a lot of \nthe unwashed never ended up with any quotas. This is a system that, \nfrom its origin, is rife with injustice, injustice to the people who \ngrow peanuts, injustice to the consumers who have to pay higher prices \nas a result.\n  What we are trying to do here is put one little--little--restriction \nin, to say $125,000 of guaranteed income from the Federal Government of \n50 percent more than what your peanuts are really worth is a pretty \ngood deal. Take it. Be happy. And sell some of those quotas to other \npeople who can use them and maybe benefit from them a little bit more.\n  If I was a Senator from the peanut States, I would say this is a good \namendment because what this will do is divest a lot of these peanut \nquotas\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\nand give more people a stake in this program. That means more people \nwho want to see this program survive. There are a lot of people in \npeanut-growing States who do not have quotas who would very much like \nto see this program go away. We are giving you an opportunity to say \nlet us get some of these benefits, if they are going to continue. I \nknow the powerful Senator from Alabama--and I will miss him, I will \nmiss him as a person, I will not miss him as an adversary on this issue \nbecause he whips me every time we come to the floor--but I will tell \nthe Senator from Alabama that he has an opportunity here to broaden his \ncoalition, to get more folks to participate in the quota system because \nof the limitation on what people can benefit from the program.\n  I would think, if you are truly concerned about small- and medium-\nsize farms, farms of 100 or 200 acres, if you really are concerned \nabout those folks, then give them a chance here. They will be fine \nunder this amendment. They will not be hurt at all under this \namendment. They will not be hurt one bit by this amendment.\n  I am hopeful that maybe we can get this amendment accepted. It is a \nchange to the peanut program. I know nobody likes to change programs. I \nheard the Senator from Idaho come down here and say: You know we have \n7-year farm bills and 5-year farm bills for a reason. We do not like to \nchange and monkey with these programs year by year, and we want to keep \nthe farm communities stable.\n\n  I do not think this will have a major impact on the farm communities. \nI think what it will do, it will have a major impact on small farmers, \non farmers who do not have quotas right now, who will be able now to go \nout and have quotas available to them because a lot of these wealthy \nquota barons will have to divest themselves of all these quotas they \nhold.\n  Who are they going to sell them to? They are going to sell them to \nfolks who right now have to sweat, toil as hard as the folks who get \n$650 a ton for their peanuts, and they sweat and toil for $350 a ton \nfor their peanuts. Now we are going to give them a chance at the pot at \nthe end of the rainbow that Washington has created in this program. We \nare going to get the small and medium-size farmers in Alabama, in \nGeorgia, in Mississippi, in Oklahoma, in Texas, in New Mexico, all over \nthe United States where they grow, now we are going to have people who \nhave heretofore never had the opportunity to enjoy the fruits and \nbenefits of this very generous program, to participate in it. I am \nhopeful that we can get this amendment accepted.\n  I think this is an amendment that probably, contrary to my own good, \nwill broaden the base of support of this program by including a lot of \nsmall farmers who have heretofore been boxed out by folks who have \ngobbled up, used their masses of wealth to gobble up these quotas and \nmake money out of this Federal program.\n  Now we are going to get this money out of the boardrooms in \nPittsburgh and in Concord and Boston and Paris and all the other places \nthey own these quotas, and get them back into the hands of the folks \nwho go out everyday and till that soil and make sure those crops are \nhealthy and produce a good yield.\n  That is the way it should be. If we are going to have a program--and \nI am resigned to the fact that the Senator from Alabama, the Senators \nfrom Georgia and the others, have whopped me fair and square--but I am \nsaying, if we are going to continue this program, let's continue this \nprogram to where it benefits everyone--all of the small farmers, all of \nthe medium-size farmers.\n  If you folks really believe that is who you are representing and you \nare not representing the big peanut interests, the big guys who come \ndown here in force and lobby and the big guys who are very influential \nlobbyists, very influential in the political process in these States, \nif that is not who you are representing, then you will be for this \namendment. You will be for an amendment that says ``get the big guys \nout of the big money of big Government and put it back to the little \nguy who really needs the help.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, let me say that one aspect of his argument \nwas agreed to in the recently passed farm bill, when he talks about \nthese people who had quotas and lived in Boston and farmed in Alabama. \nThere was a provision in the farm bill where production was shifted to \nthe family farm, and that was one of the accomplishments that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania brought about.\n  He has already brought about several changes in this bill which was \nin the farm bill. The production will shift to the family farms. Public \nentities and the out-of-State nonproducers are ineligible now for \nparticipation in the program.\n  What he was talking about, in giving his illustration, he has already \naccomplished. So that argument, I do not think, is applicable to this \namendment.\n  Originally, the amendment had a $40,000 figure on it. We figured up \nat 2,500 pounds of production per acre that this would come out to \nabout a farm of about 52 acres, and the national average of the peanut \nfarmer is 98 acres. But he then, in effect, by raising it to 125, has \ntripled it, which means that basically he is talking about a farm of \nabout 156 acres which would be involved.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania confuses payments with a loan. They are \ntwo separate and distinct things. You put a commodity in loan; \ntherefore, it is sort of like going to the bank, you get some money. \nBut the commodity is in loan, and it is designed for farmers to use in \norder that if the price goes up, then they can make money. It is a sort \nof hedge. The loan program is a Government program designed to allow \nfor generally and, in most of the commodities, for 12 months that it \nstays in the loan. During that time, the price may go up and down, \nand the farmer can choose when he wants to sell. It is sort of an aid \nand assistance, it is not a payment.\n\n  Payment limitations, as we have it, have been in the past, up until \nthis farm bill was passed, a limitation on what is known as target \nprices in a deficiency payment, and that is where the limitations came \nin as to how much a farmer could draw relative to a deficiency payment.\n  For example, in cotton, there was a target price that they hoped a \ncotton farmer might be able to obtain in order to be able to meet the \ncost of production. As I recall, up until this year, it was 72.9 cents \na pound. If the cotton price per pound fell below that price, then that \ndeficiency payment paid the difference between the market price and the \ntarget price, but there was a limitation in that.\n  Loans are different. They are not any type of limitation relative to \nthat. It is a different situation.\n  Now the farm bill came along and we have a contract price, and there \nis a limitation relative to contract price. But peanuts have never had \nany deficiency payments. It has only had a loan; therefore, it is \nentirely different. You are mixing apples with oranges here, and, \ntherefore, it is a confusing situation.\n  In regard to peanuts and the fact that he is talking about these \npeople who have these quotas and they do not farm, that is more of the \nfactor of what is known as tenants or leasing. In regard to all of the \ncommodities--these are based on the Bureau of Census figures--actually \nthere are more farmers who farm their land in peanuts than there are in \nwheat, than there are in soybeans, than there are in cotton. So that \nargument relative to that, I think, is one that is just misunderstood \nand a lot of people misunderstand it because of the fact of quotas.\n  In regard to price, this next chart shows the relationship between \nthe peanuts and the peanut support price and the farm value and the \nretail price of a 16-ounce jar of peanut butter over a period from 1984 \nto 1992. That is basically the same as to the present time. The blue \nshows the support price. The red shows the farm price. And then the \ngreen here shows the retail price.\n\n  Well, note that really that in the loan price, it has always in each \nof these years been lower than the farm price that they got on the \nmarket. In none of these years has it been where the loan rate of where \nthe Government is involved in it, with the payment--that could be made \nin the event that the peanuts have defaulted to the loan\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\nto the CCC--but in all of those years, the price has always been above \nthe loan rate where he wants to put a limitation in regard to it. So \nagain, that is a misunderstanding of the program as it has occurred \nover the years relative to this.\n  Then the argument is made that you have to have a license to sell \npeanuts in the domestic market. I think you find here that this is a \nchart which shows that we have had a substantial increase from 1986 now \nhere to 1995 of the number of new farms that receive quotas.\n  Farmers have easy access into the peanut program. More than 10,000 \nnew farmers received quotas under the peanut program over the last 10 \nyears, proving the point that the program is not closed to outsiders. \nAnd so we have had a situation that has developed over the years that \nhas shown that you can grow peanuts, you can start growing peanuts, you \ncan gain quotas, you can do it. And the people that grow peanuts can \nsell in the U.S. market.\n  There is, in regard to the national eatable market, restrictions \nrelative to that. But as to the other aspects of it, they can be sold. \nAnd you do not have to have a license. You can start growing additional \npeanuts today anywhere you want to. There are many farmers that are \ndoing that that have started growing it.\n  In the new farm bill that we had, the peanut is open to new \nproducers, more so than even in the past. Access to the program has \nbeen made easier for producers desiring to grow peanuts. So I think \nthere is some confusion.\n  I think, No. 1, that the Senator from Pennsylvania is to be \ncongratulated relative to the fact that out-of-State people in these \nnonentities, that are public entities, that held it before --he moved \nand was able, with the help of his staff, to get that changed.\n  But we now find that we are in a situation where I think there is \nconfusion here, particularly on a payment as opposed to a loan. They \nare just two different things. He wants to limit the ability to use the \nloan. And what he is saying, in arguing on all the rest of the \ncommodities, they have a payment limitation on Government payments to \nthem. So I think there is a distinction there that has sort of been \noverlooked relative to this.\n  So we are really talking about small farmers here, when the average \npeanut farm in the country is 98 acres. And we are talking about here \nat the utmost this would apply to a farm of about 150 acres. And those \nare not big farmers, the people involved in it. They are just slightly \nabove what is the average farmer in this country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Alabama is a clever man. And he \nfocuses in on a number of farmers. I have never said that there are not \na lot of farmers who have a little quota. The point I have tried to \nmake is 22 percent of the farmers own 80 percent of the quota. Sure \nthere are people who have, you know, a little quota here, a little \nquota there. But it does not amount to much. This program is stacked \nwith the big farmers.\n\n  So he makes these arguments that, you know, well, you look at peanuts \nand cotton and soybeans and that, you know, peanut farmers are a \ndisproportionate number of them, more of them own the farms that they \ngrow peanuts on than cotton, soybeans, and the like. What he does not \nsay in the chart--maybe it is true--he does not say whether those \npeanut farmers are quota holders or nonquota holders.\n  Probably a lot of these peanut farmers do own their land but they did \nnot own a quota. He said, well, you know, there are some restrictions. \nI know it was an euphemism, but he said there are some restrictions on \nthe domestic sale of additional peanuts. I will tell you what those \n``some restrictions'' are. You cannot sell them for eatable use. That \nis some restriction. I think maybe he meant to say that is sum \nrestriction instead of saying that is some restriction. Maybe it was \nthe emphasis. But that is a complete restriction. You cannot sell them \nhere. You have to sell them overseas. And you have to sell them at a \nheck of a lot less than what the quota price is.\n  He said there are, you know, there are no restrictions. Everybody \nwants to go out and plant peanuts. That is right. No restrictions. Go \nout and plant peanuts and sell them at $300 a ton, if you own quota, at \n$400 a ton or $700 a ton, but there is no restriction to sell your \npeanuts for half the price to the guy next door that has a quota. You \nare absolutely right. It is a good deal.\n  But I would just suggest that this amendment, which says that every \nperson who owns a quota of peanuts can put on loan up to $125,000 worth \nof peanuts, and get a price double the world market, that that is a \npretty good deal. I mean, that is a pretty generous offer.\n  How many peanut growers are we talking about? How many would be \ncovered by this amendment? Oh, about 1,900. So 1,900 farmers would be \nlimited as to how much they could put on loan, a very select few of the \ntens of thousands, and maybe hundreds of thousands of peanut growers in \nthis country. Talking about 1,900 of the wealthiest farms.\n  I have made this sound like this is a dramatic change for those folks \nwho are the 1,900 select few. The point of fact is, and the Senator \nfrom Alabama knows this, this is not. This is not a substantial \namendment. The Senator from Alabama, and folks who know this issue, \nrealize that the only reason you would put your peanuts on loan is if \nyou could not sell your peanuts for more than the quota price.\n  As we know, as a result of the farm bill, the Secretary of \nAgriculture has an interest in keeping demand above supply, in other \nwords, shorting the market, keeping the price well above the quota \nprice. Why? Because in the farm bill we say we want peanuts to be a no-\ncost program. We do not want peanuts to be put on loan and have the \nFederal Government buy this crop. That is what ``put on loan'' means. \nThat means the quota holder will sell the peanuts to the Government for \nthat quota price.\n  We do not want that to happen. The only way you can stop that from \nhappening is to control the amount of peanuts that are open. If you \nshort the market, prices go up. So the only time that this might--this \namendment, as minor as it is, as limited as it is to the number of \nfarmers that we are talking about--the only time that this could even \nhave an impact is if there is a huge crop of peanuts in excess of what \nthe Secretary thought could be grown by the number of quota holders.\n  In that case you are talking about a lot of farmers who have a lot of \nproduct, who will sell a goodly amount at the quota price. And they \nhave to sell the rest out on the market and make, I suggest, well above \nwhat additional farmers are making. So this is an amendment that is \nfair.\n  This is an amendment that has limited scope with respect to the \nnumber of people involved and is limited to an occurrence that is not \nlikely to happen, given the controls of the Secretary of Agriculture \nover the amount of peanuts grown in this country. This truly is an \namendment that is more principle than it is of tremendous substance.\n  That is why I was hoping the Senator from Alabama, who made a lot of \narguments about the difference between loans and deficiency payments--\nand I understand the difference--that is why deficiency payments were \nlimited to $50,000 and I put $125,000 as a loan payment. It is \nsubstantially more. There is a reason: Because there is a difference. I \nrecognize that difference. I set a limit that was a very small \npercentage of the people who farm peanuts. I wanted to get at the hoi \npolloi of the peanut growers. We have done that. I think this is a fair \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside amendment 4995.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4967\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out a peanut program \n    that is operated by a marketing association if the Secretary of \n Agriculture determines that a member of the Board of Directors of the \n  association has a conflict of interest with respect to the program)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I send to the desk an amendment No. 4967.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4967.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN PEANUT PRICE \n                   SUPPORT PROGRAM.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to carry out a peanut program under \n     section 155 of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 7271) or part VI of subtitle B of title III of the \n     Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1357 et seq.) \n     that is operated by a marketing association if the Secretary \n     of Agriculture determines, using standards established to \n     carry out title II of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 \n     U.S.C. App.), that a member of the Board of Directors of the \n     association has a conflict of interest with respect to the \n     program.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is an amendment that gets, again, to what I see as \na group of very influential, wealthy, graced quota holders who have \nbeen put in a position to profit extraordinarily by this program, and \nhave put themselves in a position that is, I think, virtually unique in \nthe agriculture industry.\n  Most of the commodity programs, all but a couple, have been run \nhistorically by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That would make \nsense. USDA has the authority to oversee these programs, and, as a \nresult, the USDA has taken the responsibility of running the program, \nof operating their loan programs or deficiency programs, of carrying \nout the price of programs, of penalizing wrongdoers, of promulgating \nregulations--all of that has been done within the Department of \nAgriculture, with the soybean program, the cotton program, and a whole \nlot of other programs. All of them have been run and operated by a \nbureaucrat out of USDA, but not the peanut grower. Not the peanut \ngrower.\n  The Government, USDA, contracts with what are called marketing \nassociations or cooperatives to administer the program. What does that \nmean? These are associations--get this--these are the people who \noperate the program, who oversee it, penalize wrongdoers, help \npromulgate regulations for the program. And who are the people who \ncompose the marketing associations? I will give three guesses--you are \nright, the quota growers. The people who participate in the program run \nthe program.\n  Now, some of the skeptics among us might consider that to be a \nconflict of interest, that people who own the quotas are responsible \nfor overseeing the program of which they benefit, of administering the \nprogram of which they benefit, of promulgating regulations of which \nthey benefit, of punishing the wrongdoers among them, of which they \nbenefit.\n  My amendment is a very simple amendment dealing with conflicts of \ninterest. My amendment is very straightforward. It says you have to \ncomply with the Government standards for conflict of interest. Since \nyou are in a sense an agency of the Federal Government carrying out \nthis program, we will hold you to the same standards as someone who \nwould, in fact, be a member of the Government in administering this \nprogram, and that is, you cannot have a conflict of interest.\n  Now, if they are, in fact, vested, as they are, with the authority to \ncarry out this program and have, in fact, the ministerial duties and \nother policymaking duties and other programs reserved to USDA, they \nshould be held to the conflict-of-interest standard of a USDA employee \nadministering the program.\n  I know that sounds like a very radical idea. What that will cause is \na much more arm's-length regulation of this industry than the folks who \nare running it now, for their benefit. Maybe you need to look back \nhistorically how these associations--and they have run them for a long \ntime, and maybe this anomaly that has occurred with a small percentage \nof the farmers owning a big percentage of the quotas is a result of who \nruns the program. I suggest if we look at these marketing associations \nthat run the programs locally, they probably are not a lot of the folks \nwho have just a ton or two of quota. They are folks who have the big \nquotas, who have the big interest in this program, and run the program \nto benefit themselves.\n  That clearly is a conflict of interest. This has nothing to do with \ndenying anybody a quota. This has nothing to do with, really, reforming \nthe program per se. What this is, again, these are two amendments that \nI am offering today on peanuts, where I have accepted the fact this \nprogram is going to continue. We are going to have a peanut program. I \nwill not mess around with it. Like the Senator from Idaho, Senator \nCraig said, ``Do not mess around with these programs; keep them in \nplace so we have some certainty.'' Well, I am for that. If that is what \nhappens, that is the way it has to be, then that is the way it has to \nbe, but at least have a program that does not benefit the wealthy, \nwhich is what my first amendment deals with, and, No. 2, does not have \nwhat appears to be a blatant, bald-faced conflict of interest between \nthe people who benefit from the program who also happen to be the very \nsame people who operate and regulate the program.\n  What I am offering here is an amendment that, again, I hope, given \nthe nature of the amendment, we can get an agreement on this and maybe \nadopt it tonight with little discussion after mine. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. There are marketing co-ops. There is the Virginia-\nCarolina peanut growers marketing cooperative and the Georgia-Florida-\nAlabama co-op, and the Southwest peanut growers co-op, who are allowed \nunder the USDA regulation to enter into various activities pertaining \nto the operation of the peanut program.\n  In regard to this, it is my understanding that the manufacturers are \nin the process of having a lawsuit pertaining to this issue. They have \nfiled a protest letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but the \nissue over the years has been worked out with the co-op with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture in such a manner as to be within the purview \nof the ethics rules and regulations. And therefore the concept is not a \nviolation of a conflict of interest. The associations and co-ops are \nclosely supervised by the U.S. Department of Agriculture personnel. \nThey have extensive in-house audits by Government officials, which are \nconducted each year. It results in cost savings to the Government \nbecause the operation is contracted out. These are conducted in small \ntowns where the cost is less than it would be if operated in \nWashington.\n\n  Now, there have been large groups of merchants pertaining to it that \nhave attempted to bid for these positions and to qualify to administer \nthe program, and that has been several years ago, but they did not \nqualify pertaining to this matter. This is a matter that if there is \nany violation or any conflict of interest, in our judgment, it ought to \nbe determined by the courts rather than by the Congress at this time, \nbecause there is a law firm that is very much involved. They have \nalready filed some letters, and they certainly are in the process of \nworking themselves into a court case pertaining to this matter. But \nunder it, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has clearly looked at this \nover the years, and they do not feel that this is any violation of any \nconflict of interest.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just say to the Senator from Alabama \nthat my amendment merely says\n\n       if the Secretary of Agriculture determines, using standards \n     established to carry out title II of the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978, that a member of the Board of Directors of the \n     association has a conflict of interest with respect to the \n     program.\n\n  You say that is something informally being done. If we have an \nagreement here, I would be happy to move the amendment and, hopefully, \nwe can adopt it by consent.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. We can consult with the Department of Agriculture before \nany agreement relative to this matter. As I understand it, this has \nbeen submitted to them and they have objections to it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I can't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. As I understand it, this has been shown to the Department \nof Agriculture, and they have reservations pertaining to this. They are \nin the process right now of probably becoming involved in a lawsuit. \nTherefore, they object to it, and because they object to it, I cannot \nagree to it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4995\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I call up amendment No. 4995 and ask for the yeas and \nnays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor to the Senator from Mississippi, so \nwe can all go home.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 4979 and 4980, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Earlier tonight, the Senate adopted two amendments \noffered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey. These were \nmodifications of previous amendments that he had filed and were at the \ndesk.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendments Nos. 4979 \nand 4980, offered previously by the Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nKerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4979 and 4980) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there have been cleared two additional \namendments--one we offered earlier and had withdrawn, and another \namendment.\n  I will send one up on behalf of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, dealing \nwith rural utilities assistance program, and the other offered on \nbehalf of the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and others.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 5000 and 5001, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a grievous error committed by U.S. negotiations in the final \nhours of the NAFTA negotiations. This error has ripped apart the social \nfabric of dozens of communities as factory after factory in the wool \nand wool apparel industry have shut their doors. Let me state for the \nrecord that I supported the Canadian Free-Trade Agreement, but I was a \nvigorous opponent of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. The bill \nI introduced today is not aimed at scuttling the NAFTA. At another time \nI will debate the merits of the NAFTA. Instead the bill is designed to \nclose a loophole in the NAFTA that has exposed the wool and wool \napparel industry to a tidal wave of Canadian imports and has left the \nindustry without a fundamental right to impose a safeguard against \nimport surges. How this industry lost its right to impose a safeguard \nis one of the tragic stories in the history of trade agreements. In the \nwee hours of the morning our negotiators bargained\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\naway the wool and wool apparel industry in order to secure the \nCanadians agreement to several provisions of the NAFTA. Mr. President \nthe NAFTA contains a rule of origin for textile products that was \nsupposed to benefit and encourage production in North America. A \nspecial tariff preference level was established for fabrics that were \nin short supply or unavailable. A gentleman's agreement was reached \nthat the products coming in under the TPL would be spread out over a \nbroad range of product categories. Instead, the Canadians have flooded \nthe United States market in one product category, wool suits. These \nsuits which have been dumped into the U.S. market are not made of North \nAmerican fabric, which is readily available. Instead these suits are \nmade of fabric produced in China, Turkey, and Italy. The last I \nchecked, these countries are not in North America.\n  Since 1988 as a result of the abuse of the TPL, production of wool \nsuits has declined by 40 percent. Dozens of companies have suffered \nlosses, layed off employees, or in some cases declared bankruptcy. \nGrief, the third largest manufacturer of suits in the United States, \nwas forced to close plants in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Over 1,300 \nworkers have lost their jobs. The 500 Fashion group, makers of Botany \n500, announced that it will close two plants in Pennsylvania and one \nplant in Florida. Over 1,000 people are now without work.\n  Plaid, the second largest manufacturer of suits, was forced into \nbankruptcy. Plants were closed in Georgia, Maryland, Delaware, and \nPennsylvania, and 1,500 jobs were eliminated. The same sad story can be \ntold in the fabric industry. Frostman Co., the second largest producer \nof wool fabric, was forced into bankruptcy. Burlington Industries, the \nlargest producer of wool fabric, has suffered a 30-percent drop in its \nmenswear wool fabric, business and laid off over 1,000 employees.\n  What recourse do these companies have? Can they, like every other \nindustry in America turn to their Government to seek relief? No, that \noption was dealt away in the dark of night. So the bill I introduce \nwill correct that situation. It directs the United States Trade \nRepresentative to negotiate an agreement with the Canadians. The bill \nwould permit Canada to maintain the same overall level of wool apparel \nexports to the United States while at the same time preventing serious \ninjury to the United States industry by adjusting the distribution \namong different product lines. If the Canadians fail to come to an \nagreement the bill requires that the President apply MFN duty rates to \nall wool apparel TPL imports from Canada as of March 1, 1997. Mr. \nPresident the men and women were unfortunate pawns in an international \nnegotiation. It's time we stood with them and gave them there rights \nback and protect their jobs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join Senator Hollings and others as \na cosponsor of the Emergency Safeguard Act of 1996, and call on the \nCongress to move this bill with great haste. This is vitally important \nto over 600 employees of Corbin Limited in West Virginia, who are \nfacing an unprecedented threat from a surge in imports of wool suits \nfrom Canada.\n  Those of us who opposed the North American Free-Trade Agreement \n[NAFTA] did not want to find ourselves with situations like this, but \nwe certainly feared they would occur. In this case, decisive action is \nnow needed to stand up for American workers and industries facing an \nunfair threat.\n  Three years ago, when explaining my vote against the NAFTA, I pointed \nto the disparities between the economies of Canada, the United States, \nand Mexico, as a primary reason for opposing the trade agreement. At \nthat time, I did not think it was right to ask West Virginia and other \nStates with fragile economies to absorb the brunt of forced integration \nwith Mexico. I was particularly concerned that workers in our labor \nintensive industries would face a considerable threat from much lower \nwage Mexican workers.\n  Since that time, in the last 2-plus years, many of my concerns have \nproved well founded. Certainly, last year's bailout of the Mexican peso \nis the most conspicuous evidence of problems raised by the NAFTA, but \ntoday I am here for a wholly different reason.\n  Today, I am forced to discuss a problem with our neighbors to the \nNorth--specifically to textile manufacturers in Canada.\n  During consideration of the NAFTA, a provision was inserted at the \nlast minute which allowed Canadian manufacturers to import fabrics from \nthird countries nearly duty free--compared with the 36 percent duties \nthat we pay--and then export finished garments to the United States \nregardless of the harm they might do to American industry and workers.\n  Specifically, the provision precluded taking what are known as \n``safeguard'' measures under the NAFTA for wool apparel exported to the \nUnited States under the tariff preference levels established during the \nCanada-United States Free-Trade Agreement. At that time, the Canadians \nassured our negotiators that this loophole was needed simply to protect \nthe existing levels of exports of various categories of low cost wool \nproducts; things such as caps, sweaters, knits and socks. At that time, \n10 percent of Canadian wool exports were high end products such as \nsuits.\n  However, Mr. President, since the NAFTA went into effect, nearly all \nCanadian wool exports have been suits, and of that, virtually all of \nthem are coming from one Canadian company. Contrary to the stated \nintention of the negotiators, suits now account for 90 percent of \nCanada's wool exports, instead of 10 percent when the deal was made. \nThis has done grievous harm to American suit manufacturers, who were \nblindsided by this shift in Canadian export patterns.\n  Under normal circumstances, when you have an import surge of this \nsort, and obvious harm is being done to a domestic, American industry, \nthe American companies and its workers can seek relief. They can take \naction under the trade laws to stem the surge, and get remedies from \nunfair and injurious trade. You can do this in every area we trade in \nbut one, textile and apparel from Canada. In fact, if these very same \nimports were from Mexico instead of Canada, the United States industry \nand its workers could petition the United States Government for a \nsafeguard to prevent serious injury.\n  That is why this legislation is needed, and needed in a hurry. When I \nopposed the NAFTA I was afraid this kind of thing would happen. We may \nnot be able to rewrite history and undo the NAFTA, but we can take \nreasonable steps to stem the hemorrhaging. I know the calendar shows \nvery few days in which this body will be conducting legislative work, \nbut I hope the majority leader will work with us to make this into law \nbefore even more harm is done.\n  This Senator counts the creation of new and better paying jobs for \nthe people of West Virginia as one of the most important things he can \ndo to help improve the way of life of the good people of his State. But \njust as important is maintaining the jobs we already have. This \nlegislation is necessary, and should be passed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, and several others Senators to \nsponsor the Emergency Safeguard Act of 1996. This legislation corrects \na loophole created by the passage of NAFTA that has allowed Canadian \nsuit makers an unfair advantage in the United States marketplace. \nCurrently, over 140,000 people are employed in the textile and apparel \nindustry in South Carolina. Several thousand of these jobs supply or \nmanufacture men's and boys' wool suits, sport coats, and slacks. These \njobs are in jeopardy due in part to a manipulation of the tariff \npreference level [TPL] by Canada.\n  The TPL, which was established under the Canadian Free-Trade \nAgreement, was originally designed to allow special trade benefits to \nwool products made in Canada from foreign wool fabric when that fabric \ncould not be sourced in either Canada or the United States. However, \nCanada has begun sourcing wool fabric from other countries, despite the \nfact that fabric is available from NAFTA countries. Canada has been \nimporting fabric from Turkey, Italy, China, and Korea to make items \nwhich are shipped into the United States under the favorable NAFTA \ntariffs.\n  Canada has seized on the TPL loophole to specifically target and \nflood the United States market with men's and boys' tailored wool \napparel. The import surges are causing layoffs and is putting the \nfuture of the domestic wool apparel industry in jeopardy.\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would place a reasonable sublimit on \ntailored wool apparel exported through the TPL to the United States by \nCanada. The size of the TPL would not change, but Canada would be \nprohibited from using it in a damaging way. This language is necessary \nbecause NAFTA eliminated the safeguard for U.S. industries to prevent \ninjurious imports from flooding the U.S. market. Due to NAFTA, the \ndomestic apparel industry has no recourse in stemming the damage caused \nby Canada while all other industries have this protection. Therefore, \nlegislation is needed to correct this inequity.\n  Mr. President, I hope this measure can be expeditiously considered to \nbring relief to the domestic textile and apparel industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. McCain and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1983. A bill to amend the Native American Graves Protection and \nRepatriation Act to provide for native Hawaiian organizations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n The Native American Graves Protection And Repatriation Act Amendment \n                              Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, \ncosponsored by Senators McCain and Akaka, which would amend the Native \nAmerican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to clarify certain \nprovisions of that act as they pertain to native hawaiian \norganizations.\n  In 1990, the Congress enacted the native American Graves Protection \nand Repatriation Act [NAGPRA] to address the growing concern among \nIndian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and native Hawaiian \norganizations associated with the disposition of thousands of native \nAmerican human remains and religious objects currently in the \npossession of museums and Federal agencies.\n  The act requires museums and Federal agencies in the possession of \nsuch cultural items to compile inventories and written summaries of \nhuman remains, associated and unassociated funerary objects, sacred \nobjects, and objects of cultural patrimony.\n  The act further establishes a process governing the repatriation of \nsuch items to appropriate Indian tribes or native Hawaiian \norganizations.\n  In the years since its enactment, native Hawaiians have been at the \nforefront in the repatriation of ancestral remains.\n  Hundreds of native Hawaiian kupuna (ancestors) have been returned to \nHawaii --released from the confines of over twenty museums in the \nUnited States, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia --and returned to the \nlands of their birth.\n  Despite these accomplishments, native Hawaiian organizations have \nexperienced great difficulty in ensuring the act's implementation--\nironically, not abroad--but in Hawaii.\n  In written testimony submitted to the Committee on Indian Affairs by \nHui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawaii Nei, a Hawaiian organization recognized \nunder the act, for a December 9, 1995, oversight hearing on the act, a \nnumber of concerns were raised--concerns which this bill seeks to \naddress, namely--the lack of written consent where native American \nremains are excavated or removed for purposes of study; following an \ninadvertent discovery of remains, the lack of assurances that the \nremoval of native American remains will adhere to the same requirements \nas an intentional excavation; and the lack of notification to native \nHawaiian organizations when inadvertent discoveries are made of native \nAmerican human remains on Federal lands.\n  As one of the original sponsors of the act, it is my view that the \namendments which I propose are consistent with the original purpose, \nspirit, and intent of NAGPRA, and are necessary to clarify the existing \nlaw.\n  It is my expectation that, if adopted, these amendments will ensure \nbetter cooperation by Federal agencies in the implementation of the act \nin the State of Hawaii.\n  The responsibility born by those who choose, or who are called upon \nto care for the remains of their ancestors is a heavy one.\n  By acting favorably on this measure, I hope that we can assist these \nindividuals and organizations as they continue in their efforts to \nbring their ancestors home.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time today, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill when it comes before the Senate for \nconsideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

NORTHERN FOREST STEWARDSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--With respect to the Northern Forest in the \n     States of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, \n     Congress finds that--\n       (1) the current land ownership and management patterns have \n     served the people and forests of the region well; public \n     policies relating to the Northern Forest should seek to \n     reinforce rather than replace the patterns of ownership and \n     use that have characterized lands in the Northern Forest for \n     decades;\n       (2) people have a right to participate in decisions that \n     affect them;\n       (3) the rights of private property owners must be \n     respected;\n       (4) natural systems must be sustained over the long term, \n     including air, soil, water, and the diversity of plant and \n     animal species;\n       (5) the history and culture of the Northern Forest and the \n     connections between people and the land must be respected;\n       (6) States should work in partnership with local \n     governments and the Federal Government;\n       (7) differences among the 4 Northern Forest States must be \n     recognized;\n       (8) people must appreciate that the Northern Forest has \n     values that are important beyond the boundaries of the \n     Northern Forest;\n       (9) because public funds are scarce, the greatest public \n     benefit must be secured for any additional investment;\n       (10) proposals must be judged by their long-term benefits, \n     looking at least 50 years into the future;\n       (11) programs and regulations in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act should be continually evaluated, built \n     upon, and improved before new ones are created;\n       (12) the actions described in this section are most \n     appropriately directed by the States, with assistance from \n     the Federal Government, as requested by the States;\n       (13) certain Federal tax policies work against the long-\n     term ownership, management, and conservation of forest land \n     in the Northern Forest region, and Congress and the President \n     should enact additional legislation to address those tax \n     policies as soon as possible; and\n       (14) this section effectuates certain recommendations of \n     the Northern Forest Lands Council that were developed with \n     broad public input and the involvement of Federal, State, and \n     local governments.\n       (b) Principles of Sustainability.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture, acting \n     through the Chief of the Forest Service, is authorized, at \n     the request of the State of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, \n     or Vermont, to provide technical assistance for a State-based \n     initiative directed by the State, to define the appropriate \n     benchmarks of sustainable forest management that address the \n     principles of sustainability, as recommended by the Northern \n     Forest Lands Council.\n       (2) Principles of sustainability.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that for the purposes of paragraph (1), principles \n     of sustainability should include--\n       (A) maintenance of soil productivity;\n       (B) conservation of water quality, wetlands, and riparian \n     zones;\n       (C) maintenance or creation of a healthy balance of forest \n     age classes;\n       (D) continuous flow of timber, pulpwood, and other forest \n     products;\n       (E) improvement of the overall quality of the timber \n     resource as a foundation for more value-added opportunities;\n       (F) addressing scenic quality by limiting adverse aesthetic \n     impacts of forest harvesting, particularly in high-elevation \n     areas and vistas;\n       (G) conservation and enhancement of habitats that support a \n     full range of native flora and fauna;\n       (H) protection of unique or fragile natural areas;

and\n       (5) analysis of strategies for the protection of areas of \n     outstanding ecological significance, high biodiversity, and \n     the provision of important recreational opportunities, \n     including strategies for areas identified through State land \n     acquisition planning processes.\n       (d) Interstate Coordination Strategy.--At the request of \n     the States of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, \n     the Chief of the Forest Service is authorized to make a \n     representative of the State and Private Forest Program \n     available to meet with representatives of the States to \n     coordinate the implementation of Federal and State policy \n     recommendations issued by the Northern Forest Lands Council \n     and other policies agreed to by the States.\n       (e) Land Conservation.--.\n       (1) Federal assistance.--The Secretary of Agriculture \n     (acting through the Chief of the Forest Service) and the \n     Secretary of the Interior (acting through the Director of the \n     National Park Service and Director of the United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service) at the request of the State of Maine, \n     New Hampshire, Vermont, or New York, is authorized to provide \n     technical and financial assistance for a State-managed public \n     land acquisition planning process and land acquisition \n     initiatives directed by the State.\n       (2) Program development.--A goal-oriented planning process \n     for a State described in paragraph (1) to establish a land \n     conservation program shall include--\n       (A) identification of, and setting of priorities for the \n     acquisition of, fee or less-than-fee interests in exceptional \n     and important lands, in accordance with criteria that \n     include--\n       (i) places offering outstanding recreational opportunities, \n     including locations for hunting, fishing, trapping, hiking, \n     camping, and other forms of back-country recreation;\n       (ii) recreational access to river and lake shorelines;\n       (iii) land supporting vital ecological functions and \n     values;\n       (iv) habitats for rare, threatened, or endangered natural \n     communities, plants, and wildlife;\n       (v) areas of outstanding scenic value and significant \n     geological features; and\n       (vi) working private forest lands that are of such \n     significance or so threatened by conversion that conservation \n     easements should be purchased;\n       (B) acquisition of land and interests in land only from \n     willing sellers;\n       (C) involvement of local governments and landowners in the \n     planning process in a meaningful way that acknowledges their \n     concerns about public land acquisition;\n       (D) recognition that zoning, while an important land use \n     mechanism, is not an appropriate substitution for \n     acquisition;\n       (E) assurances that unilateral eminent domain will only be \n     used with the consent of the landowner to clear title and \n     establish purchase prices;\n       (F) efficient use of public funds by purchasing only the \n     rights necessary to best identify and protect exceptional \n     values;\n       (G) consideration of the potential impacts and benefits of \n     land and easement acquisition on local and regional \n     economies;\n       (H) consideration of the necessity of including costs of \n     future public land management in the assessment of overall \n     costs of acquisition;\n       (I) minimization of adverse tax consequences to \n     municipalities by making funds available to continue to pay \n     property taxes based at least on current use valuation of \n     parcels acquired, payments in lieu of taxes, user fee \n     revenues, or other benefits, where appropriate;\n       (J) identification of the potential for exchanging public \n     land for privately held land of greater public value; and\n       (K) assurances that any land or interests inland that are \n     acquired are used and managed for their intended purposes.\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\n       (3) Willing seller.--No Federal funds made available to \n     carry out this section may be expended for acquisition of \n     private or public property unless the owner of the property \n     willingly offers the property for sale.\n       (4) Land acquisition.--\n       (A) Funding.--After completion of the planning process \n     under paragraph (2), a Federal and State cooperative land \n     acquisition project under this section may be carried out \n     with funding provided exclusively by the Federal Government \n     or with funding provided by both the Federal Government and a \n     State government.\n       (B) Objectives.--A cooperative land acquisition project \n     funded under this section shall promote State land \n     conservation objectives that correspond with Federal goals \n     and the recommendations of the Northern Forest Lands Council.\n       (5) Complementary program.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     shall conduct activities under this subsection--\n       (A) as a complement to the State Comprehensive Outdoor \n     Recreation Plan for each Northern Forest State in existence \n     on the date of enactment of this section;

and\n       (B) private lands help provide important forest-based \n     recreation opportunities for the public in the Northern \n     Forest region.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     States and other interested persons should pursue initiatives \n     that--\n       (A) strengthen relief-from-liability laws to protect \n     landowners that allow responsible public recreational use of \n     their lands;\n       (B) update relief-from-liability laws to establish hold-\n     harmless mechanisms for landowners that open their land to \n     public use, including provision for payment by the State of \n     the costs of a landowner's defense against personal injury \n     suits and of the costs of repairing property damage and \n     removing litter;\n       (C) private additional reductions in property taxes for \n     landowners that allow responsible public recreational use of \n     their lands;\n       (D) provide for purchases by the State of land in fee and \n     of temporary and permanent recreation easements and leases, \n     including rights of access;\n       (E) foster State and private cooperative recreation \n     agreements;\n       (F) create recreation coordinator and landowner liaison and \n     remote ranger positions in State government to assist in the \n     management of public use of private lands and provide \n     recreation opportunities and other similar services;\n       (G) strengthen enforcement of trespass, antilittering, and \n     antidumping laws;\n       (H) improve recreation user education programs;

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man \nwho has played a pivotal role in the economic growth and development of \nwestern Kentucky. Harry Ruth, president of the Greater Paducah Economic \nDevelopment Council, will be able to retire with the satisfaction of a \njob well done.\n  When Ruth interviewed for the job in 1989, the committee members who \ninterviewed him were immediately convinced that he was the right person \nfor the job. Aubrey Lippert, a bank president in Paducah, told the \nPaducah Sun that Ruth ``has the ability to walk into a room full of \nstrangers and make everyone feel comfortable''.\n  Since he became president of GPEDC, Harry Ruth has given ``100 \npercent of his ability and energy'' to making Paducah and the region a \nbetter place to live. According to the Paducah Sun, Ruth has played a \nlarge part in bringing to Paducah a great deal of infrastructure \nnecessary to expand economic development. This includes the Paducah \nInformation Age Park, a 600-acre high-technology park on the outskirts \nof the city and a University of Kentucky engineering extension program \nthat will open in about 2 years. In addition, a new industrial park is \nin the planning stages and the community has improved its image \nconsiderably.\n  Further proof of the growth that has taken place during Ruth's tenure \ncan be found in the general economic indicators in the community. There \nare more jobs in Paducah than there were 7 years ago, employment is up, \nunemployment is down, and retail sales are up.\n  Dwane Tucker, who worked closely with Ruth on the Information Age \nPark project, told the Paducah Sun that Ruth ``gave an enormous amount \nof time to positioning [the] community for long-term growth . . . He \nput the needs of the organization above his own needs.'' Tucker added, \n``He's also exceptionally skilled at building long-term relationships \nwith people and organizations.''\n  It's said that a man's greatest legacy is his friends--and in that \nregard, Harry Ruth has a rich legacy indeed. As Harry closes this \nparticular chapter in his life, he can take special satisfaction in the \nrelationships he has built. It is with pleasure that I count myself \namong Harry Ruth's many friends in Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Harry Ruth for his \ndedicated service to western Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8581-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REV. JOHN NUTTING\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont is a very small State in \ngeography but extremely large in the quality of our people.\n  One of the very special people in Vermont is the Reverend John \nNutting. For as long as I can remember my good friend John has been an \noutspoken and extremely effective advocate for those in Vermont who \nneed him the most. An article in the Vermont Sunday Rutland Herald and \nthe Sunday Times Argus speaks well of his lifetime service to our \nState. I ask that it be printed in the Record. Marcelle and I are among \nthose privileged to have known and worked with John and I send him my \nvery best as he opens his next career.\n  The article follows:\n\n [From the Sunday Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus, June 16, \n                                 1996]\n\n        Activist's Activist Rev. John Nutting Leaving The Field\n\n                          (By Kristin Bloomer)\n\n       It's hot as heck under the studio skylights, and Rev. John \n     Nutting is hawking one of his paintings.\n       ``Name your price,'' he says, gesturing to a few of the \n     smaller watercolors in his second-story garage studio in \n     Waterbury. ``Any price.''\n       Nutting is walking around in his regular gear; a yellow \n     shirt, denim shorts, white socks and sandals. No one has said \n     anything about buying any paintings, but Nutting, 64, doesn't \n     seem to want to take no for an answer.\n       ``Come on. Don't be shy,'' he says with a broad, goofy \n     smile and turning toward some larger forest scenes. ``Hundred \n     and fifty bucks. I have an easy payment plan. You can pay me \n     in increments, whatever you want, `til it's all paid up.''\n       It's hard to say no to John Nutting, for 40 years one of \n     Vermont's most active and visible social activists.\n       ``He represents what has really been at the heart of what's \n     good in Vermont,'' says Scudder Parker, a former minister and \n     legislator who has known Nutting all his life. At a recent \n     retirement party for Nutting, Gustave Seelig, executive \n     director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, \n     called him Vermont's leader of ``a conspiracy of good will.''\n       In addition to serving as a pastor and outreach minister \n     for the United Church of Christ since 1956 and more recently, \n     writing a 500-page book on the church's history (on sale for \n     $50), Nutting has served as president of the Vermont \n     Association for Mental Health, chair of the Vermont Human \n     Services Board, vice president of the Vermont Natural \n     Resources Council, Vermont Housing and Conservation Board \n     member, and consumer board member for the Vermont Program for \n     Quality in Health Care.\n       He will retire from his ministry July 1. A retirement party \n     for Nutting is set for Sunday, June 29, at the Second \n     Congressional Church in Hyde Park. He says he has ``no set \n     plans,'' aside from wanting to sell his house and move with \n     his wife to Colorado.\n       Nutting says he will have more time to paint--though \n     friends, colleagues and social advocates say they will miss \n     him.\n       ``Good'' Nutting exclaims. ``That's great I love it, I love \n     it. Weep! Weep! Worry! Gnash your teeth. * * * In a sense, I \n     want someone else to do it. I've done it. I see it now as \n     `the ministry of getting out of the way.' ''\n       ``Getting out of the way,'' however, may be hard for \n     Nutting.\n       ``I'm in massive denial,'' he admits.\n       Many of the organizations and programs he founded on behalf \n     of Vermont's poor will continue--he's made sure of that. For \n     example, Camp Bethany Birches--an annual, free, three-day \n     event for low-income people--has drawn as many as 200 people \n     annually for almost 20 years, and will continue to serve as a \n     tool for political empowerment Campers will still gather to \n     set the coming year's lobbying/legislative agenda.\n       ``You could say the theme through my ministry has been to \n     create a community out of diversity, to gather people who \n     don't naturally come together,'' Nutting says. ``The idea is \n     to create this new kind of community, that we all might be \n     one.''\n       ``The Hyde Park pastor never wanted to enter the ministry \n     until he was assigned to a congregation in West Dover for a \n     summer. In college he had wanted to be a physician, like his \n     father in Duluth, Minn., until senior year. Then he switched \n     to history and enrolled at Yale Divinity School, still \n     without a commitment to becoming a minister.\n       ``I was interested in figuring out the Monty Python thing--\n     the meaning of life,'' he says, smiling.\n       ``His greatest theological influences were Karl Barth, a \n     Swiss theologian who became a church leader in opposing the \n     Nazis, and Jurgen Moltmann, one of the leading proponents of \n     the ``theology of hope,'' a belief that God's promise to act \n     in the future is more important than God's action in the \n     past. Moltmann's belief that people should not withdraw from \n     the world but act in it to aid the coming of a better one \n     became Nutting's inspiration.\n       The list of programs he has helped initiate in Vermont \n     reads like a hippie agenda: Project Love, a series of evening \n     dinners geared toward low-income people; Partners in Service, \n     an adopt-a-social-worker program for churches; Vermont \n     Assistance Inc., a corporation that hired and funded a low-\n     income advocate when Vermont Legal Aid was prohibited from \n     lobbying the Legislature; Vermont Campaign to End Childhood \n     Hunger; Vermont Food Bank; Bridges to Peace, an exchange \n     program with the Soviet Union; and Neighbors in Need, an \n     organization that has distributed thousands of dollars worth \n     of emergency grants to low-income people. That's just to name \n     a few.\n       But Nutting, who started doing singing gigs in homes and \n     ski areas in the nineteen fifties, predates most hippies.\n       ``I had a Volkswagen bug, and I could get 12 folding chairs \n     in the back, my guitar, song books, three kids and my wife,'' \n     Nutting said. ``We would go off to prayer meetings--the \n     traveling church.''\n       He also cut a record, called ``Songs of Lamoille County,'' \n     which begins with a spoken ballad called ``Hills of Dover.'' \n     Nutting's voice sounds uncannily like Pete Seeger's.\n       ``I came to Vermont in the summer of 1954, and I've been \n     here off an on ever since,'' Nutting narrates against the \n     guitar chords. ``That year, I lived with Ted Burchards on a \n     farm in the town of West Dover.''\n       The two worked the land together, Nutting says, and he \n     tells how he would listen from the house as Burchards mowed \n     the lawn and, invariably, hit a rock: ``He'd stop, swear a \n     few times, and then back it up and start over, go around that \n     rock. That's been the story of Vermonters almost ever since \n     they came here; they've had to back up and start over. It's \n     been the land that's made the difference.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8581-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8581-S8582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LILLIAN HOFFMAN\n\n Mr. BROWN.

Her valiant efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewery I am \nconvinced made a real difference in the lives of many.\n  As a volunteer for the American Red Cross during World War II, \nLillian acquired a taste for public service and community work. Lillian \ncommitted herself to gaining freedom for Jewish refuseniks from the \nformer Soviet Union for over 20 years. She was cochairwoman of the \nColorado Committee of Concern for Soviet Jewry since the group was \nformed in 1970. This committee fought for people that faced oppression \nin their homeland. Lillian spent endless hours writing letters and \ntelegrams and making phone calls to Soviet and U.S. officials to help \ngain the release of Jewish families who were refused immigration visas. \nShe showed what real determination was.\n  In 1974, Lillian went to Washington, DC to lobby for the Jackson-\nVannik amendment, which linked trade with the Soviet Union with the \nemigration of Soviet Jews. The amendment was passed in large part \nthanks to Lillian's efforts.\n  In addition to dealing with the oppression of Jews in the Soviet \nUnion, Lillian turned her attention to other causes. Lillian began to \nfocus on her opposition to Israeli terroritorial concessions and to \nfree Raoul Wallenberg. Lillian was a member of the Raoul Wallenberg \nCommittee. Mr. Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, saved 100,000 Hungarian \nJews during World War II from Nazi death camps. Lillian presented a \nbust of Wallenberg as a gift to the U.S. Government which stands in the \nU.S. Capitol.\n  Lillian was well known for her efforts nationally and \ninternationally. Her endless contributions to our community in Colorado \nand around the world were truly remarkable and will never be forgotten.\n  Those of us who knew Lillian Hoffman will never forget her. She \ntaught us what real commitment is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8581-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO ISAAC TIGRETT\n\n Mr. FRIST.

Isaac Tigrett has long been known for founding the world-\nfamous Hard Rock Cafe chain, which combined rock music, memorabilia, \nand the all-American hamburger in locations throughout the United \nStates and internationally. But his most recent business venture, the \nHouse of Blues, has not only gained enormous popularity in its short \nexistence, it is showcasing a bit of Tennessee and Southern heritage \nfor audiences on the east and west coasts.\n  A native west Tennessean, Isaac Tigrett grew up a stone's throw from \nthe actual birthplace of the blues--Memphis, TN. The influence of the \nblues and black culture on him was strong and has stayed with him over \nthe years. Music of all kinds, but especially the blues, actually takes \ncenter stage in his House of Blues restaurant-clubs. With restaurants \nin Cambridge, MA; Los Angeles; New Orleans; and the brand-new Olympic \nspecial in Atlanta, the music that had such an influence on Isaac \nTigrett's life in west Tennessee is quickly finding new homes and new \nfans across the country.\n  In addition to spreading blues music, Isaac Tigrett is also working \nto spread a message to America's youth. Through the House of Blues \nFoundation, he is reaching out to inner city youth and providing a new \noutlook on African-American culture in the United States. His \nfoundation brings school children to the House of Blues--either in \nperson or by using video teleconferencing equipment--and lets them \nexperience the history that the blues and the folk art lining the \nrestaurants' walls so eloquently express. The House of Blues also \nprovides college scholarships in the arts, sponsors a program for blues \nmusicians to present workshops for kids, and supports a training center \nfor teachers interested in the blues.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Isaac Tigrett for his ingenuity and \nhis entrepreneurship. As anyone who knows him can attest, the four \nHouse of Blues locations in the United States and the House of Blues \nFoundation are just the beginning for Isaac. And to me and many other \nTennesseans living throughout this Nation, the House of Blues is not \njust great entertainment, it's a piece of home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/23/senate-section/article/S8582-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 1996\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
