Mr. President, I have some photographs here that have \nbecome all too familiar to the Senate. This is a photograph of a young \nboy, a victim of a landmine. You can see from the photograph, he has \none badly injured leg, another leg that has been torn off, and an arm \nthat is also missing. These are similar to photographs I have on my Web \npage in my office on the Internet. Thousands of people turn to that Web \npage, and what they see there are these photographs of landmine \nvictims.\n  Here is one that they turn to, this young woman. I have had somebody \ntell me that as the picture comes down on the computer screen, the page \nends at the bottom of her long skirt. Then they click on further and \nthe picture\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\ncontinues down and they realize she has only one leg. This woman is \nfrom Laos. She lost her leg from a landmine.\n  Mr. President, these photographs are not unusual. Each one represents \na tragedy, of course, not only for the person involved, but also but \nfor his or her family. These are only two victims. There are hundreds \nof thousands of victims of antipersonnel landmines alive today, and of \ncourse as many more who died. They are the victims of these tiny, \nhidden explosives that litter whole countries. They are scattered like \nseed. They are a blight on our planet, and they must be stopped. This \nmine I am holding in my hand cost $2 or $3, and is made almost entirely \nof plastic to make it harder to detect.\n  These are not weapons that know the difference between a combatant or \ncivilian. They are, as somebody else said, the only weapon where the \nunsuspecting victim pulls the trigger.\n  A little over a year ago, President Clinton, in a courageous speech \nat the United Nations, declared the goal of ridding the world of \nantipersonnel landmines. With 100 million of these weapons in over 60 \ncountries waiting to explode, they have become the world's most \ndevastating cause of indiscriminate, mass suffering.\n  Every 22 minutes, the State Department estimates someone somewhere, \nusually an innocent civilian, is killed or maimed from stepping on a \nlandmine.\n  NATO forces have suffered 42 landmine casualties since they arrived \nin Bosnia in December, including 7 deaths. There were three casualties \njust last Friday, all soldiers of our European allies. Landmines are, \nby far, the worst threat to our troops there, but also to the people of \nBosnia who will be clearing these landmines, an arm and a leg at a \ntime, for decades to come.\n  The entire 184-member U.N. General Assembly adopted the goal \nannounced by the President. But since President Clinton's announcement, \na debate has ensued over how to reach the goal of eliminating \nantipersonnel mines.\n  The Pentagon, which says it shares the goal, pushed a strategy to \npromote the use of so-called smart mines. Mr. President, technology has \nan answer for many things, but this is not one of them. Antipersonnel \nlandmines are by nature indiscriminate.\n  There is nothing smart about a landmine that cannot tell the \ndifference between a soldier and a 5-year-old child. These mines are \nscattered from the air by the tens of thousands, and the same areas can \nbe reseeded many times during a conflict. They legitimize the use of \nlandmines despite their indiscriminate effect.\n  I am very pleased that Pentagon officials are now questioning the \ndistinction between smart and dumb mines. Again, landmines are by \nnature indiscriminate. That is what makes them so insidious. I also \nwant to commend our U.N. Ambassador, Madeleine Albright, and her Deputy \nKarl Inderfurth, who have urged a stronger policy against antipersonnel \nmines.\n  A growing coalition, from our soldiers in Bosnia to retired Army \ngenerals to officials in the Pentagon to the Pope and the American Red \nCross, are urging that we renounce these weapons as we have nerve gas \nand other indiscriminate killers.\n  On February 12, my amendment to impose a moratorium on U.S. use of \nantipersonnel mines was signed into law by President Clinton. That \namendment had broad bipartisan support with over two-thirds of the U.S. \nSenate of both parties voting for it. It represents a clear shift in \nU.S. policy. But it is already being eclipsed by events elsewhere.\n  In the past 2 months, Canada and the Netherlands have unilaterally \nbanned their use of antipersonnel mines, and they have joined 22 other \ncountries that have called for an immediate international ban. Many of \nthese countries have been among the largest contributors to U.N. \npeacekeeping forces, and they have seen the havoc wreaked by landmines. \nSeveral, like Belgium and Austria, are destroying their stockpiles of \nthese weapons.\n  Mr. President, yesterday's New York Times ran a front page story \nentitled ``Pentagon Weighs Ending Opposition to a Ban on Mines.'' It \nreports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, has ordered a review of the landmine issue. I want to \napplaud General Shalikashvili for this. There is nothing harder than \nchallenging the conventional wisdom, and when others have said \nsomething cannot be done, to ask why not and to look for a way to do \nit.\n  I want to reiterate what I have said before. There is a tremendous \nopportunity here for U.S. leadership. We should listen to our Armed \nForces veterans, many of whom say antipersonnel mines made their job \nmore dangerous, not safer, and who remember their buddies being blown \nup by their own minefields.\n  Over 7,400 of the Americans killed in Vietnam, 20 percent in the \nPersian Gulf, and 26 percent in Somalia died from landmines. We have \nmore to gain if the use of landmines is a war crime.\n  We should think of the devastation these weapons are causing around \nthe world. Regardless of what some here may think, the world does look \nto the United States for leadership. We are the most powerful democracy \never known in history, by far the most powerful nation on Earth. We can \nexert great moral and political leadership when we want to lead as a \ncountry. The President can lead. There are few people more persuasive \nwhen he is convinced of something. I have seen him in meetings with \nworld leaders, and I know how effective he can be. With the support of \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the \nPresident could bring enormous pressure to bear on world leaders to \nfollow our example.\n  It is not just the example of the Leahy amendment, but the leadership \nto press ahead for a ban on antipersonnel landmines worldwide.\n  Mr. President, this is not a Democrat or Republican issue. It is not \na matter of civilians versus the military. It is an opportunity for the \nUnited States to end this millennium as the leader of a global effort \nto ban a weapon that Civil War General Sherman called ``a violation of \ncivilized warfare.''\n  Mr. President, I commend the Congress for first adopting the \nmoratorium that I proposed, the moratorium on the export of landmines \nfrom this country.\n  I commend the President for supporting my efforts in introducing a \nresolution in the United Nations to call for the eventual elimination \nof antipersonnel landmines.\n  I also commend the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives, liberals, moderates joining together to vote for a \nmoratorium on the use of landmines by the United States. Each one of \nthese steps, Mr. President, has given hope and encouragement to other \ncountries. Each one of these steps has reinforced our leadership.\n  Years ago when I first started on this quest, it seemed a lonely one. \nSo many times Tim Rieser and I would visit other countries, and here on \nCapitol Hill and to the United Nations, to speak to world leaders and \nU.N. ambassadors about landmines. At first, we heard only a few \nencouraging words. But then the International Red Cross, for the first \ntime since the 1920's when it condemned chemical weapons, called for a \nban on antipersonnel mines. Then the Pope, and the leaders of so many \nother nations, especially those who had sent peacekeepers overseas, \nhumanitarian organizations like the American Red Cross, religious \norganizations, veterans organizations--they are all speaking out \nagainst the use of these weapons.\n  Mr. President, the only way to stop the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines is to stop the use of antipersonnel landmines. When 100 \nmillion of these killers are hidden in the ground in over 60 countries, \nwe have to say ``enough is enough.'' Another 2 million are being added \neach year.\n  The only way we will stop this is to ban their use, and to turn our \nattention to the immense job of clearing the mines that have turned so \nmany parts of the world into death traps.\n  This is an issue whose time has come. I commend those at the \nPentagon, the White House, and here in the Congress, in both parties, \nwho have supported this effort so far. Let us go one step further, and \nmake this for all time U.S. policy, to ban their use; and then go to \nour allies around the world, and to other countries, and say, join with \nus in what is both a security and a moral imperative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from \nyesterday's New York times and an Associated Press article related to \nthe subject be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 17, 1996]\n\n          Pentagon Weighs Ending Opposition to a Ban on Mines\n\n\n     policy review ordered--threat to u.s. force in bosnia brings \n                reconsideration of moves against weapon\n\n                          (By Raymond Bonner)\n\n       Washington, March 16.--With the daily threat of land mines \n     to American soldiers in Bosnia having brought the issue home, \n     Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, has ordered a review of the military's longstanding \n     opposition to banning the use of land mines, which kill or \n     maim more than 20,000 people a year, primarily civilians.\n       In asking for the review last week during a meeting with \n     the chiefs of the military services, General Shalikashvili \n     said he was ``inclined to eliminate all anti-personnel land \n     mines,'' a senior pentagon official said.\n       The Pentagon was prompted to review its policy in part by a \n     strong bipartisan anti-mine sentiment in Congress, led by \n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, as well as by \n     a growing international campaign to ban antipersonnel mines, \n     Pentagon officials said.\n       These separate Congressional and international campaigns \n     against mines gained new momentum after American soldiers \n     began arriving in December in Bosnia, where an estimated \n     three million land mines have been planted. Three American \n     soldiers have since been wounded by the weapons.\n       Nearly a dozen countries have banned the use of land mines. \n     Senator Leahy and other advocates of a ban argue that if the \n     United States renounced their manufacture, sale and use, many \n     other countries would follow. While they concede that there \n     would still be outlaw states, they counter that an \n     international ban backed by sanctions would result in a \n     substantial overall reduction in the use of land mines.\n       Pentagon officials say General Shalikashvili acted after he \n     and Defense Secretary William J. Perry received a \n     confidential letter from the American representative to the \n     United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, who has just returned \n     from a trip to Angola. That country has many young men and \n     children whose limbs were ripped off in landmine explosions.\n       Ms. Albright wrote that a new policy on land mines was \n     urgently needed, because the Administration's current policy \n     would not achieve their elimination ``within our lifetimes.'' \n     She sent copies to other senior Administration officials; \n     parts of the letter were read to The New York Times by a \n     supporter of the ban who had received a copy.\n       Two years ago in a speech at the United Nations, President \n     Clinton called for the ``eventual elimination'' of land \n     mines. Under current policy, the Administration supports an \n     amendment to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons that \n     would allow the use of only ``smart'' mines, which deactivate \n     or destroy themselves after a few weeks or months.\n       The United States was barred by Congress in 1993 from \n     exporting land mines for three years. Another law prohibits \n     the United States from using land mines for one year in 1999.\n       There are an estimated 100 million land mines planted in 62 \n     countries, and an official with the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency said last week that the number is \n     increasing by two million a year. The State Department has \n     said 600 people a month are killed or wounded by mines; the \n     American Red Cross has estimated that it is twice that many.\n       This week, the Dutch Government renounced the use of land \n     mines, joining Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Austria, Norway and \n     five other countries; France recently prohibited the \n     production and export of land mines. Twenty-four countries \n     have called for an international ban, according to the latest \n     tally by Human Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights \n     organization, which has been a leader in an international \n     campaign for a ban.\n       Last fall, the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     opened a campaign to ban antipersonnel land mines. It was a \n     highly unusual step for the Swiss organization, which is not \n     an advocacy organization and only once before has called for \n     a weapons ban--of chemical weapons, back in the 1920's.\n       ``We've simply seen too much,'' said Urs Boegli, director \n     of the Red Cross's land mine campaign, explaining why the \n     organization had acted.\n       More than any other single organization, the Red Cross \n     works in conflicts around the world, he said. He added that \n     the Red Cross had begun its ban campaign only after having \n     fought unsuccessfully to strengthen the 1980 conventional \n     weapons treaty to restrict their use.\n       China and Russia, which each have stockpiles of more than \n     100 million mines, have been the major countries blocking an \n     amendment to the convention that would allow all but \n     ``smart'' mines.\n       In the Pentagon, the Office of Special Operations and Low-\n     Intensity Conflict has pushed for a complete ban on all \n     antipersonnel mines--``smart'' and ``dumb''--except in \n     limited situations, such as along the border between North \n     and South Korea.\n       Land mines should be put in the category of chemical \n     weapons, said Timothy Connolly, principal Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for special operations. Even though they \n     have military utility, chemical weapons have been banned \n     because of their devastating consequences, to soldiers and \n     civilians.\n       ``Some day, and that day has to be sooner rather than \n     later, we are going to reach that same conclusion about \n     antipersonnel land mines,'' Mr. Connolly, who was an Army \n     captain during the Persian Gulf War, said during an interview \n     this week.\n       Mr. Connolly's office rejects the ``smart'' mine \n     compromise.\n       The basis of the American support for such a compromise is \n     that it is possible to develop a mine that will self-destruct \n     or self-deactivate with 99.7 percent certainty, according to \n     Robert Sherman, director of advanced projects of the Arms \n     Control and Disarmanent Agency and a negotiator in talks on \n     amending the conventional weapons pact.\n       But Mr. Connolly said, ``There is no evidence in the United \n     States that we are capable of building a device capable of \n     working 100 percent or nearly 100 percent of the time.''\n       Until this recent review, Mr. Connolly's voice had been a \n     lonely one in the Pentagon.\n       Pentagon officials predicted that the Army and Marine Corps \n     would fight the hardest to be allowed to keep at least some \n     land mines, Pentagon officials said. Military doctrine calls \n     for land mines to reduce the number of soldiers needed in \n     certain situations, to canalize the enemy and to protect \n     vital installations, like power stations.\n       In the closed-door meeting last week when Gen. \n     Shalikashvili ordered the review, the chiefs of the Army and \n     Marine Corps said they needed land mines to police the border \n     between North and South Korea, a Pentagon Official said.\n       ``The U.S. Army's position is that we use land mines \n     responsibly,'' said an Army general who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity.\n       Senator Leahy believes, however, that with American troops \n     in Bosnia, if President Clinton renounced the use of land \n     mines, ``he would get very substantial support in the \n     military.'' Mr. Leahy, who has led a four-year effort in \n     Congress to ban land mines, said he was constantly hearing \n     from servicemen, from sergeants to generals, who urge him on.\n       Recently, he received an E-mail message from an Air Force \n     master sergeant, Dale A. Lamell, on duty in Bosnia, who \n     wrote: ``I would like to salute you for your efforts to \n     eliminate the international use of land mines. Bosnia should \n     serve as an example to the rest of the world.''\n       Requesting anonymity, a senior military officer at the \n     Pentagon also said this week that there was considerably more \n     support among officers for getting rid of land mines than \n     emerges publicly.\n       Freed from the constraints of being in uniform, several \n     prominent retired generals have agreed to sign an open letter \n     to the President calling for an international ban on the \n     production and use of antipersonnel land mines, said Robert \n     Muller, director of the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     Foundation, which began soliciting signers three weeks ago. \n     Among them are Gen. Frederick R. Woerner, a former commander \n     of the United States Southern Command in Panama, and Lieut. \n     Gen. Harold Moore, a former commander of the Seventh Infantry \n     Division and author of ``We Were Soldiers Once . . . and \n     Young.''\n       ``I very much oppose antipersonnel land mines because they \n     are indeed indiscriminate in their killing and maiming,'' \n     Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf wrote this month in a letter to \n     Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican \n     National Committee during the Reagan Presidency and who had \n     written to the general asking him to join the campaign to ban \n     antipersonnel mines.\n       Though he said he wanted to think a bit longer before \n     deciding whether to sign the letter to the President, General \n     Schwarzkopf said his wish to see land mines ``forever \n     eliminated from warfare'' was based on his personal \n     experiences of ``having seen hundreds of my own troops killed \n     or maimed by them,'' as well as being ``keenly aware of the \n     devastating effects'' of land mines on civilians.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 17, 1996]\n\n        Senator Praises Pentagon For Reconsidering Landmine Use\n\n                           (By Sally Buzbee)\n\n       Washington.--A Senator long opposed to U.S. use of land \n     mines said Sunday he's delighted the Pentagon will reevaluate \n     its position that the deadly, hidden weapons are needed for \n     troop safety.\n       ``There are certain weapons you just don't use,'' said Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy, D-VT.\n       A Pentagon spokesman confirmed Sunday that a review of the \n     military's longstanding policy on anti-personnel land mines \n     was under review.\n       ``It's been an ongoing issue here,'' said Pentagon \n     spokesman Major Steve Manuel. ``We're still in the process of \n     examining it.''\n       Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, ordered the review last week, The New York Times \n     reported Sunday.\n       A senior Pentagon official told the newspaper that \n     Shalikashvili was ``inclined to eliminate all anti-personnel \n     land mines.''\n       Worldwide, the use of land mines targeted at people, not \n     tanks, has escalated in the last 15 years, They now kill or \n     injure 26,000\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\n     people each year, the State Department estimates.\n       Most victims are civilians in war-torn countries like \n     Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam and El Salvador, but land mines \n     also pose risks to U.S. troops participating in the Bosnian \n     peacekeeping mission.\n       U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the \n     International Red Cross have urged a worldwide ban on land \n     mines. And Canada, Austria, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Mexico, \n     the Netherlands and five other countries already have \n     renounced their use.\n       But until now, U.S. military officials have insisted they \n     needed the option of using land mines to protect the lives of \n     American soldiers. They also have argued that the United \n     States should not give up a weapon if other nations won't.\n       Despite Pentagon objections, Leahy pushed through Congress \n     a one-year ban on the military's use of anti-personnel land \n     mines, except along borders and in demilitarized zones. The \n     ban would begin sometime within three years, and President \n     Clinton signed it into law.\n       ``The rest of the world wants the United States to lead on \n     this,'' Leahy said in an interview Sunday. ``If the most \n     powerful nation in the world can't do away with land mines, \n     how can we ever persuade other countries to?''\n       Shalikashvili ordered the review of Pentagon policy after \n     he and Defense Secretary William J. Perry received a \n     confidential letter from the U.S. ambassador to the United \n     Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, the Times said.\n       Albright, who had just returned from Angola, urged that the \n     current policy on land mines be changed, the Times said. \n     Parts of the letter were read to the newspaper by an \n     unidentified official who received a copy.\n       Leahy argues that many military officials, both retired and \n     active-duty, also privately support a permanent ban on land \n     mines.\n       ``This is not a Republican-Democratic, liberal-conservative \n     or civilian versus military issue,'' Leahy said.\n       The Pentagon estimates Bosnia has 3 million land mines and \n     Croatia another 3 million. Some are sophisticated; others \n     crude or homemade. NATO officials say no more than 30 percent \n     have been mapped.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has released \na report which describes the appalling state of Russia's nuclear waste \nstorage facilities. It described how a GAO investigator was able to \nenter one facility without identifying himself, and there was only one \nguard present, who was unarmed. There are other descriptions of \nincredibly lax security that even the most inept thief could easily \npenetrate undetected. It is almost an open invitation.\n  The implications of this are staggering. A grapefruit-sized ball of \nuranium, which would weigh about 30 pounds, could obliterate the lower \nhalf of the city of New York. A lot more uranium than that is already \nunaccounted for. We do not know whether it is in the hands of \nterrorists, or where it is. All we know is that it is missing.\n  We have already witnessed several instances of nuclear smuggling, in \nsome cases enough uranium to cause incalculable damage. The fact that \nthese attempts were thwarted should not give anyone a lot of confidence \nabout the future because many, if not most, crimes go unsolved.\n  Mr. President, I mention this today both because of the timeliness of \nthe GAO report, but also because we spend countless hours, sometimes \ndays and months, here holding hearings on arcane topics and debating \nsometimes relatively meaningless resolutions, unless it is meaningful \nfor someone's campaign, or voting repeatedly on issues that pale in \nimportance to the dangers of nuclear terrorism. We make speeches about \nit. I am making one now. But when it comes to providing the money and \nother resources to seriously address this threat, the Congress \noftentimes shirks its responsibility.\n  One good example is in the foreign aid budget. Some Members of \nCongress were eager to take credit for sharply cutting funds for \nforeign aid last year over the objection of myself and a minority of \nother Senators. To his credit, Senator McConnell, the chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, supported funds to combat \ninternational crime, as did I. But the budget was cut anyway. In fact, \nsome of those funds could have been used to help safeguard nuclear \nmaterial in countries of the former Soviet Union. It would be hard to \nthink of an example where foreign aid is more in the interest of the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  I want to single out Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar, who have led the \neffort in Congress to get funds appropriated to safeguard nuclear \nweapons in the former Soviet Union. Senator Nunn made the point in \ntoday's issue of Defense News, when he said ``there is skepticism about \nspending any money in Russia. Nunn-Lugar funds are often described as \nforeign aid, in quotes, as if some type of charitable giving was going \non * * * We are talking about dismantling warheads and missiles aimed \nat us * * * things we spent trillions of dollars trying to arm \nourselves against.''\n  We are about to begin the fiscal year 1997 budget process. I hope \nthat the Congress does not make the same mistake twice. I hope Members \nof Congress will read this GAO report on nuclear proliferation. Unlike \nsome Government reports that you can read to help fall asleep at night, \nthis one will keep you awake. Cutting these programs is the ultimate \nexample of penny-wise, pound-foolish. I am already hearing rumors that \nforeign aid may be slashed again this year. If that happens, some of \nthose who vote that way should ask themselves what responsibility they \nbear.\n  There is no way to guarantee the safety and security of fissile \nmaterial, but there is a lot more that we and others can and should do \nto combat the threat of nuclear terrorism. It is going to cost a lot of \nmoney. Budgets are already stretched, but can anyone here say that we \ncan afford to watch this problem get worse? This is about the security \nof every American, and of future generations.\n  So I urge the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Energy, and other agencies with responsibility for \nnuclear safety to develop an effective program to combat this threat. \nTell us what needs to be done, and come to Congress with a request for \nadequate funding for it.\n  I wish there were better security controls in the former Soviet \nUnion, but there are not. That is the reality, and it is a reality that \na lot of thieves, a lot of would-be terrorists know even better than we \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to comment just a moment on an \neffort we made last week and intend to make again tomorrow relating to \nthe affairs in the Taiwan Strait. All of us know that there has been \nnow for some time a series of threats, a series of missiles, a series \nof live-ammunition military maneuvers by the People's Republic \ndesigned, we believe and I believe, to intimidate the Taiwanese \nelection that comes up this week. Certainly, our country and the world, \nindeed, has a great interest in what happens in this area, partly \nbecause of our efforts to improve our relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China--a relationship that will be increasingly important \nas time goes by, increasingly important to the Pacific rim and to the \nAsian\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\narea, increasingly important in the area of trade; 1.2 billion people \nwith an economy growing at 10 percent--partly because of our concern \nfor Taiwan and the development there of a democracy, this election of \nthe President, the first free election that has been held, one of the \nfirst areas of success of democracy in an Asian country; partly because \nof the agreements that we have made with Taiwan and China through the \nyears, three communiques and the Taiwan Act that spells out where we \nare, spells out the fact that we have supported the one-China policy \nand continue to support the one-China policy, spells out the fact that \nbasic to that agreement is the agreement that it be pursued in a \npeaceful way, and that it not be involved in the military action.\n  So I think it is appropriate that we do have a statement from this \nSenate. We have put together a resolution. We put it together last \nweek. It has sponsorship by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee as well as the ranking member, and is sponsored by the \nleader, Bob Dole. However, we were not able to bring it up by unanimous \nconsent last week. We have now talked to those who were concerned about \nit, and hopefully we will be able to bring it up tomorrow and get it \npassed.\n  The resolution basically, of course, deplores the notion and the \nactivities of the Peoples Republic in these military actions, the idea \nthat they have fired off missiles very close to Taiwan, close to both \nthe ports of Taiwan, and now are involved in live-ammunition activities \nthere.\n  We have asked in the resolution for the People's Republic as well as \nTaiwan to come together to discuss these issues in a peaceful way. We \nalso recognize our obligation, if there is military action against \nTaiwan by the People's Republic, that we will assist in helping them \nprepare for themselves to have the equipment to defend themselves.\n  Hopefully, these activities are simply efforts to intimidate. I \nbelieve they are. I believe they are simply an expression of the \nconcern that the People's Republic has had, and I hope that they will \ndiscontinue that kind of activity. I further hope the Taiwanese will go \nout of their way not to create the kind of tension that we have had.\n  So, Mr. President, we intend to bring again, tomorrow, a resolution \nthat will put the Senate on record in that regard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week in March is a traditionally \nbusy one here in Washington as tens of thousands of children of all \nages arrive in the Nation's Capital. They come to the District of \nColumbia from all over the United States during their spring break \nvacation to learn about our Government and our history, both of which \nare unparalleled.\n  Over the past 4 or 5 days, I doubt that there one Member of this \nChamber who has not met several groups of his or her young \nconstituents, boys and girls who have stopped by for Gallery passes, a \nphoto, or just to say ``hello.'' I also doubt that there is one Senator \nwho was not pleased to meet with these children as each of us \nrecognizes that the youth of today represent the future of our country. \nThat recognition clearly guides us as we work to ensure that the United \nStates remains a nation of opportunity and freedom.\n  While what we do here in the Senate helps our children, there are \nother organizations out there who dedicate all of their efforts to \nmaking the lives of our youngest citizens better. One such group is the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America. From coast to coast and from north to \nsouth, there are boys and girls clubs in thousands of communities of \nevery imaginable size. The service this organization provides range \nfrom recreational activities to counseling, but most importantly, they \nprovide a place for our young people to go and be involved in \nconstructive activities.\n  Each year, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America hosts a congressional \nbreakfast, and as the Capitol is filled with children this week, I \nthought this would be an ideal time to share the thoughts and comments \nof those who spoke at this year's event. Their comments will give those \nwho read them an insight into this organization and the significant \nwork they do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      1995 Congressional Breakfast\n\n\n                            senator thurmond\n\n       Representative Steny Hoyer, Mr. George Grune, the Chairman \n     of the Board, Mr. Robbie Callaway, the Senior Vice President, \n     Melvin Laird, Arnold Burns, one of the outstanding lawyers of \n     this nation, Judge Freeh, all of the distinguished guests, \n     and ladies and gentlemen, I'm very honored to be here on this \n     occasion. Now, as a Senator, there are a lot of events you \n     are asked to attend. I'm always pleased to attend this \n     breakfast. It's the twelfth year.\n       I'm a strong believer in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \n     There's no more important resource than our children. Boys & \n     Girls Clubs of America work to help protect and promote that \n     resource. This is an organization that is making a difference \n     in the lives of tens of thousands of at risk teens. It \n     provides parks and recreational activities, a safe haven from \n     the mean streets, teaches kids the importance of work and \n     responsibility, works to get kids into school, into jobs, off \n     welfare roles, out of public housing and away from the \n     temptations of a life of crime.\n       The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is an organization on the \n     move, serving more children each year. Thirteen years ago, \n     they served approximately one million kids. This year, they \n     are serving more than 2.2 million boys and girls. More than \n     1,700 clubs are in the United States. Last year, they \n     averaged an opening of one new club every three days. This is \n     a group that seeks continued growth. By the year 2001, the \n     Boys & Girls Clubs of America aims to have 1,000 new clubs, 1 \n     million new members, over 3 million kids involved in \n     productive activities.\n       The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is one of the most \n     effective organizations in the nation for supporting our \n     children. It is an organization worthy of the support of \n     everyone in this room. As members of Congress, we are in the \n     position to help the Boys & Girls Clubs and our children. We \n     can support legislation that is beneficial to the Boys & \n     Girls Clubs. One example is the current crime bill. The Boys \n     & Girls Clubs of America is seeking 100 million dollars out \n     of the crime bill over the next five years. The Board of \n     Directors of the Boys & Girls Clubs will match that 100 \n     million from the crime bill. That is 200 million dollars \n     pumped directly into the future of our nation's children.\n       By attending this breakfast, each of you is demonstrating \n     your support for a worthwhile cause. I urge you to continue \n     to help the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. You can do nothing \n     more worthy. We are proud of the Boys & Girls Clubs of \n     America and we're going to keep on working to make it bigger \n     and stronger every year. Good luck, God bless you and God \n     bless the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and God bless our \n     country.\n\n\n                        congressman steny hoyer\n\n       One problem with the Strom and Steny show is that I have to \n     follow Strom Thurmond. Thurmond and Hoyer, that sounds like a \n     good name for a firm at some point in time. Strom's show has \n     been running a lot longer than mine, as you know, but I'm \n     always amazed at the energy, his commitment and the verve \n     that he brings to life and the endeavors which he \n     undertakes. And Senator, I want you to know what an honor \n     and privilege it is to co-chair this breakfast on a \n     continuing basis with you. George Grune, your leadership \n     is critically important. General Burns, you've seen \n     General Burns up here, he looks a lot like Colin Powell. I \n     asked him if he was running for President. He's got those \n     four stars on his lapel, here. I'm sure it's got to have \n     something to do with that. He is outranked, of course, at \n     his table by Secretary Laird and the Secretary is keeping \n     him in line, luckily, so they'll be peaceful. Pete Silas, \n     thank you for all you've done and your leadership. We look \n     forward to working with you on a continuing basis. My \n     friend, Robbie Callaway. I think we ought to give Robbie \n     Callaway a big round of applause for the outstanding \n     leadership he brings to this effort on a regular basis. \n     Ken Gordon is here today, too.\n       Six or seven of the top law enforcement officials in our \n     nation are here. We have Louis Freeh and a group of his \n     distinguished colleagues. They're the ones who lock up and \n     help convict those who break the laws in our country, to keep \n     our communities and streets and schools safe. That's their \n     job. We ask them to do that. They're people that sometimes \n     themselves risk their life and limb to do so. They're here \n     this morning and I reflect on why and what message that \n     brings us. They're here because unless parents and Boys & \n     Girls Clubs leaders and other youth leaders all over this \n     country do\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\n     their job, they know they can't lock up enough people. God \n     bless them and you ladies and gentlemen of the Boys & Girls \n     Club, God bless you. Senator Thurmond is correct because you \n     do God's work.\n       This is the first line of defense. This is the first line \n     in a battle we all must wage if we are to stop the crime and \n     the violence and the drugs from taking over our streets, our \n     children. And that, ladies and gentlemen is what it's all \n     about.\n       I am very, very proud to be here with two people who \n     symbolize what is the first line and the best line and \n     ultimately the line that will get us to where we need to be--\n     two parents who all America, and indeed all the world applaud \n     just a few days ago.\n       Lou Gehrig had the kind of character that all the world \n     would admire. Let us thank God that his record was equaled \n     and surpassed by another individual who had the character of \n     which we can all be proud and say, ``He was worthy of Lou \n     Gehrig''. But, why was it so? It was so because Vi and Cal \n     Ripken Sr. Gave him the leadership and the charcter and the \n     understanding that gave him the will and the strength of \n     character to persevere in the face of pain, the face of \n     frustration, the face of being tired. We all get tired. Cal \n     Ripken Jr. rose and he said, effective, ``My Dad and Mom said \n     go to work every day and do the best you can.'' Is there a \n     more powerful, potent message to be given to young people \n     than that message? God bless Vi and Cal Ripken, Sr. We're \n     proud of you and proud of what you've done. By the way, \n     they're from Maryland.\n       I know if you'll allow me four more minutes, I will close \n     with this. I hope all of you have read the books left for \n     you. There is a young woman sitting at my table who is \n     typical of all of the young people we come here today to \n     honor. She's a success story. Not just the kind of success \n     story we read about every day, but also a success story of \n     the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. She's from Dallas. \n     She's a young woman. She's an African American woman and a \n     true success story. Read here quote. She says, ``I am \n     proud to tell my story. One of struggle and hardship, but \n     also one of triumph and achievement.'' LaWanda Jones, \n     that's what it's all about because, there are a lot of \n     people who don't have a Vi and Cal to lift them up, to \n     nurture them, to protect them, to give them the kind of \n     internal mechanism and compass that they need to succeed.\n       And so, as Todd Green said, one word came to mind when he \n     thinks of Boys & Girls Clubs, and that's ``family . . . \n     family''. All of us are extended family for an awful lot of \n     young people who need the kind of nurturing and caring and \n     courage given by Cal and Vi to Cal, Jr. Each of you in this \n     room is a part of that caring family of America that \n     ultimately will be the difference. Not the government, it \n     won't happen in government. Government can help. I am one who \n     believes that government needs to a partner. I'm one who \n     believes that we need to marshall our resources in the form \n     of, yes, paying taxes and applying those to good efforts. \n     But, in the final analysis, we will not solve the problems of \n     making sure America's future is secure and the security of \n     our young people is assured if it's not through our families \n     and through us, individually, caring for our young people. \n     That's what Boys & Girls Clubs of America do. Brooke Kersey \n     said, ``In good times and bad times, the Boys & Girls Clubs \n     have been my life line.'' You do God's work. I am proud to be \n     a part of all of you. Thank you.\n\n\n                      ``captain'' arnold I. burns\n\n       Good morning. Thank you very much for our kind invitation. \n     I'm delighted to be here with the distinguished members of \n     the law enforcement community mentioned by Congressman Hoyer.\n       I've come today to make some important arrests. I've come \n     to arrest crime and I've come to arrest violence, to arrest \n     the drug epidemic, to arrest teenage pregnancies, to arrest \n     alcoholism, to arrest youth gangs. One thing responsible \n     people in the law enforcement business have come to know, and \n     know very well, and Steny made this point, and that is that \n     law enforcement alone cannot solve our societal problems. We \n     have come to believe it and to espouse the old adage that an \n     ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We know that in \n     order to make our streets safer and more secure, we must work \n     with organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n       We need more programs for the young people of this nation \n     of ours--programs like the tried and proven initiatives that \n     have earned Boys & Girls Clubs the reputation as the positive \n     place for kids. These programs help young people to resist \n     the peer and other pressures that lead to substance abuse, to \n     say ``no'' to drugs, ``no'' to alcohol, to say ``no'' to \n     teenage premature sex and to say ``no'' to gangs.\n       We need more Boys & Girls Clubs which keep kids coming back \n     day after day and year after year under professional, adult \n     supervision to learn how to get up in the morning, to show up \n     on time for an interview, to find employment, to develop good \n     work habits and to become a reliable and important part of \n     the work force. Boys & Girls Clubs of America programs \n     literally save hundreds of thousands of kids from harm and \n     destruction each year. It is these programs that keep kids \n     from harm and destruction each year. It is these programs \n     that keep kids out of our courtrooms and out of jail. It is \n     these programs that prepare kids to become productive and \n     participating citizens in the mainstream of our society. It \n     is these programs which make our kids producers of tax \n     dollars and not consumers of tax dollars as wards of the \n     State or as welfare participants. Boys & Girls Clubs of \n     America saves billions of dollars, multi-billions of dollars \n     of our tax dollars, because the cost of prevention pales \n     beside the cost of cure, particularly as the cure \n     rehabilitation so rarely works.\n       So, my department, today, is issuing an APB--an all points \n     bulletin--to the 1680 boys & girls clubs facilities across \n     our nation--reach out--reach out for more kids. Ten years \n     ago, boys & girls clubs served 1,000,000 kids. Today, over \n     2,220,000 kids. Tomorrow--within the next few years--\n     3,000,000 kids. No alibis.\n       We in law enforcement will continue to investigate, \n     apprehend, prosecute, convict and incarcerate those who slip \n     through the prevention net. We would like--no, we need, no, \n     we must have your help--your continued top flight work, to \n     cut potential miscreants off at the pass and bypass the \n     criminal justice process entirely by opting for good and \n     productive citizenship early. I close by congratulating our \n     ``Youth of the Year'' finalists: Jason Reese, Russell \n     Roberson, Fernando Pantoja, Michael Smith and Michael \n     Lampkins. Each of them personifies the success boys and girls \n     clubs can achieve in providing youngsters with a real \n     alternative to life on the streets.\n       We will continue our work, you continue yours--ours must be \n     a partnership, a collaboration. Together, we can make America \n     a better place for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2217-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Robert E. \nHenderson, of Columbia, SC, for his dedicated service as the president \nof the South Carolina Research Authority.\n  Throughout his life, Dr. Henderson has worked to make his community, \nState, and Nation better places in many different ways, not the least \nof which was through his stint in the Army during World War II. During \nthat time, he fought our enemies as an infantryman, rising to the rank \nof staff sergeant and being awarded a Purple Heart. Nearly 50 years \nlater, he continued to work for the defense of the Nation when he was \nappointed to the prestigious Defense Science Board and the Defense \nManufacturing Board.\n  Dr. Henderson's most significant contributions to my State came \nthrough his work as the president of the South Carolina Research \nAuthority, a position from which he recently retired. Under his \ndirection, the authority has helped the Palmetto State to become a \nforce in high-technology research and development, industry, and \neducation. Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Henderson and the SCRA, \nbillions of dollars have been added to our State's economy and South \nCarolina has become a favored place for companies to do business. \nAppropriately, Dr. Henderson's good work has been recognized many times \nand he has even been awarded South Carolina's highest award, the Order \nof the Palmetto.\n  Mr. President, Robert Henderson has had an important impact on South \nCarolina and we are grateful for all his efforts on behalf of our \nState. I wish him good health and much happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2218-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2218-S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO COY A. SHORT UPON WINNING THE SAM NUNN AWARD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the United States gained its freedom \nfrom our colonial masters in a bloody and hard fought war for \nindependence. By the end of our 8-year struggle with the Crown, the \nyoung United States possessed the Continental Army, the force that \nultimately defeated the English, but in 1776, it was ordinary men who \ngrabbed weapons and first fired on the redcoats at Lexington. With that \n``shot heard 'round the World,'' not only was a blow for freedom \nstruck, but the tradition of the citizen-soldier was hatched, one that \nremains alive and strong in our Nation today in the form of the \nNational Guard.\n  In cities and towns throughout the United States, one will find \narmories where men and women, much like their Minuteman forefathers, \ndrill and prepare to meet the missions with which they are tasked. \nWhile much about the Guard has changed since the 1700's, muskets have \nbeen replaced by M-16A2 rifles and the horse cavalry has been replaced \nby the M1A2 main battle tank, one thing has remained constant, that \nthose who serve in the Guard are willing to serve selflessly as they \ncome to the aid of their community and work for the defense of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n  In recent years, perhaps one of the biggest backers of the National \nGuard here in the Senate has been my good friend, and predecessor as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. \nOver the years, Senator Nunn has established a well-deserved reputation \nfor being one of the most well-versed Members of the Senate in matters \nrelated to defense and national security. Without question, his opinion \nis valued and respected by Senators on both sides of the aisle, by \nsenior officers in each of the services, by Presidents, and by the \npeople of the United States. He has stood as an advocate for a strong \ndefense, including what he believes should be a well-trained, well-\nequipped, and well-supported National Guard.\n  In recognition of Senator Nunn's support of the military and his \nbelief in the National Guard, the National Guard Association of Georgia \nestablished the Sam Nunn Award which it presents each year to a person \nwho they believe has demonstrated ``solid and continuous support for \nthe role, function, mission and purpose of the National Guard in \nmeeting its international, national, state, and local mission.'' I am \nvery proud to have been the recipient of the award for 1995, and I am \npleased to have this opportunity to congratulate my friend, Mr. Coy \nShort of Atlanta, on being awarded this recognition by the National \nGuard Association of Georgia this year.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Coy for a number of years, over \nwhich time he has consistently demonstrated not only his patriotism, \nbut his support for those who serve in all branches of the service, in \nboth the Active Forces, the Reserves, and the Guard. He is a person who \nhas taken a leadership role in community-military relations, lending \nhis leadership to a number of committees designed to serve those who \nserve, including the Governor's Military Advisory Council; the USO \nCouncil of Georgia; and the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce's Greater \nAtlanta Military Affairs Council. His efforts on behalf of those in \nuniform have been recognized numerous times over the years by the Army, \nthe National Guard, and by defense-related and community-spirited \ngroups in the following manners:\n  The 94th Airlift Wing Man of the Year Award; National Committee for \nEmployer Support of the Guard and Reserve Award for Outstanding Public \nService; Oglethorpe Distinguished Services Medal for Outstanding \nSupport of the Georgia National Guard, and National Distinguished \nService Award, Association of the United States Army.\n  Also the Phoenix Award by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, for \nproviding leadership to the Greater Atlanta Military Affairs Council; \nAward from the National Guard Bureau for outstanding support of the \nArmy National Guard; and Army Commendation Medal for public service on \nbehalf of Forces Command.\n  Coy Short not only works hard on behalf of Atlanta's military \ncommunity, he is one of the city's biggest boosters. As a member of the \nPeach Bowl's executive committee, he helps to make one of college \nfootball's most popular events a success, and through his position as \nthe Deputy Regional Commissioner for the Social Security \nAdministration's Atlanta region, Coy's professional efforts have \nbenefited tens of thousands of Georgians. Not surprisingly, he has been \nrecognized by the Social Security Administration for his work, \nincluding being awarded the Commissioner's Citation, the highest \nrecognition that can be given by that agency.\n  At this very moment, there are National Guard soldiers and airmen who \nare selflessly serving in dangerous assignments throughout the world, \nand if given the opportunity, I am certain that they would want to \nexpress their appreciation to Coy Short for all he has done to support \nthem. I join these brave men and women who are serving in the defense \nof our Nation, along with the National Guard Association of Georgia, in \nsaluting a man who sets the highest standard for civic mindedness and \nsupport for the Nation's military forces. His efforts make Atlanta a \nbetter place to live and the United States a safer and more secure \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2218-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is now \nbefore the Senate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3548 to Amendment No. 3530\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 28, United States Code, to divide the ninth \njudicial circuit of the United States into two circuits, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to amendment No. 3530 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3548 to amendment No. 3530.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of the \npeople of Montana. This issue was reported--in other words, dealing \nwith the ninth judicial district--this issue was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee with an 11 to 7 vote, with strong bipartisan \nsupport, and a conference report that was overwhelmingly recommending \nits passage.\n  It has often been said that one would wonder, why is there such a \nmovement to reform habeas corpus when the very idea of habeas corpus is \nas American as apple pie and hot dogs? Americans have always been \nsensitive to the rights of the accused. It has been a hallmark as long \nas this United States has been a union. But in our court of appeals, \nMr. President, we happen to be situated, in the State of Montana, in \nthe largest judicial district. It is the ninth: Montana, Idaho, \nWashington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, and Alaska.\n\n  Our proposal, under this proposal to split the ninth circuit, would \nleave California, Hawaii, Guam, and the northern Mariana Islands with a \nmission of a 15-judge unit. Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, \nOregon, and Washington would form the new 12th circuit of 13 judges. \nThe caseload would be split, and 60 percent of the present-day caseload \nwould still be represented in California and Hawaii, and 40 percent of \nthe present-day caseload would be in the newly formed twelfth. The \nreasons are very, very compelling for those States that would remain in \nthe 9th district, after the newly formed 12th went into full operation, \nto remain there.\n  In this amendment is also a section that allows a national study of \nour courts of appeals. I think that study should move on. It was \nrecommended by the Senator from California, and I see her on the floor. \nIt made good sense whenever the suggestion was made, and it still makes \ngood sense today. But I think we already have studies. We have studies \non the shelf, and yet, after we got the studies, nothing was done to \naddress the problems.\n  Let us take a look at this circuit. The ninth circuit is big, too \nbig. It includes nine States, 1.4 million square miles, 45 million \npeople. By comparison, the sixth judicial district serves less than 29 \nmillion people, and every other circuit serves less than 24 million \npeople.\n  The Census Bureau is telling us that by the year 2010 the population \nin the ninth, if it remains in its present size, will be more than 63 \nmillion people because of the demographics and the movement of people. \nThat is a 40-percent increase in just 15 years.\n  Judge O'Scannlain, of the ninth judicial district, testified, and I \nquote:\n\n       In light of the demographic trends in our country, it is \n     clear that the population of the States in the ninth circuit, \n     and thus the caseload of the Federal judiciary sitting in \n     those States, will continue to increase at a rate \n     significantly ahead of most other regions in the country.\n\n  The number of judges stands at 28. The fifth judicial district has 17 \njudges; the first has 6 and the seventh and eighth each have 11. The \naverage of the circuits, other than the ninth, is 12.6 judges. I do not \nknow what they do with the other four-tenths of 1 percent. The ninth \nrecently unanimously made a request from that district requesting an \nadditional 10 more judges. So the prospect of even a larger ninth will \nbe upon us in just a very near future.\n  If you can imagine having 38 active judges, in addition to 12 senior \nstatus judges, on one court, that should give all of us pause. If we do \nnot deal with this issue now, we will only be putting it off into the \nfuture. In other words, let us get started.\n  Having said that, this is the situation that is existing in the \ndistrict itself today. No. 1 is delay. The ninth is the second slowest \nof all the circuits. The chief judge himself on the circuit commented \nin his written testimony, ``It takes about 4 months longer to complete \nan appeal in our court as compared to the national median time.'' Mr. \nPresident, 315 days is the national median time from the filing of \nappeal to the final conclusion. In the ninth, it is 429 days.\n\n  Other methods have been used and they come up with similar results. \nWhat does it do? Delay; the bigness leads to inconsistency, \nunpredictability, and I think what is more important, the lack of \ncollegiality.\n  The formation of the 3-judge panel, and with 28 of them there on the \ncourt, gives us 3,276 different combinations whenever you go up before \nthe ninth district court of appeals. It is difficult for litigants to \npredict outcomes. The sheer size of the caseloads makes it increasingly \ndifficult for judges to keep abreast of the decisions to avoid \nconflicting decisions.\n  We will be hearing the argument there are new devices, new computer \nsystems, where they have a ready library of information to where they \nbe consistent with other decisions. Mr. President, that just has not \nbeen the case. They cannot even use what all other districts use. That \nis en banc. In other words, all the judges in that district getting \ntogether, listening to a case, trying to come to some consensus in the \nconsistency of the law. The ninth does not even use that. Mr. \nPresident, 28 judges do not use that procedure to resolve intracircuit \nconflicts. Instead, they use a limited en banc procedure, forming 11-\nmember\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\npanels--10 drawn from the list of judges plus the chief judge. The \nmethod permits as few as 6 of the sitting judges to dictate the outcome \nof a case contrary to a judgment of 22 others, solely depending on the \nluck of the draw.\n  In summary, there was a judge in the eleventh circuit that noted what \nhappens and the many ill effects you have in business courts. First, \nthe dynamics of a jumbo court are such that as the court grows larger, \nthe productivity of individual judges declines. Second, the clarity and \nthe stability of the circuit law suffers, creating incentives to \nlitigate that do not exist in jurisdictions with smaller courts. \nFinally, jumbo courts create and maintain a legal environment that is \ninhospitable to individual rights. Individuals find it more difficult \nto conform their conduct to increasingly indeterminate circuit law and \nsuffer higher litigation costs to vindicate a few remaining clear \nrights to which they may claim. In other words, we go right back and we \nsay it is too big.\n  The conclusion is that it is inevitable that this is going to happen. \nA study of 23 years ago called for it then. I think they called for it \nand also the split of the fifth circuit at that time. The fifth circuit \ndid what it was told to do or was recommended to do and it has been \nvery, very successful. This is a balanced approach and allows the \nwheels to start turning where we can serve our people in the judiciary \na lot better and more efficiently, with more consistency. It is the \nright thing to do. After all, we provide the services for our citizens. \nThe infrastructure has to be there in order to get it done.\n  The fifth circuit split was very, very successful. I think when we \nlook at the evidence, the evidence of what is happening in all the \nother circuits, the first circuit only has 6 judges, a total population \nof 13 million people; in the ninth circuit, 28 judges, population 49 \nmillion people, over 1.4 million square miles. It is hard to serve an \narea that big.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment. We need to do it for the \njustice of the people who live and reside and do business in the ninth \njudicial district. I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment and \nalso to raise a point of order. Prior to making the point of order, \nhowever, I point out that as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I do \nnot believe this measure passed by an overwhelming majority. It really \npassed only on the basis of partisan lines with one exception on our \nside of the aisle.\n  Essentially, this was the subject of much discussion before the \nJudiciary Committee, Mr. President. As you, yourself, know, there was \nno hearing on the bill to split the ninth circuit that is encompassed \nin this second-degree amendment. No public hearing on this proposal was \nheld before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Essentially, what this proposal does is take the States of Alaska, \nWashington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Arizona, split them \nfrom the ninth circuit, and set up their own circuit. This would leave \nthe States of California and Hawaii, along with the territories of Guam \nand the northern Marianas, in their own circuit. Never before in \nhistory has there been a circuit comprised of fewer than three States.\n  If Congress votes to divide the ninth circuit despite the \noverwhelming opposition of its bench and bar, Congress will be making, \nI believe, an irreversible decision that will have far-reaching and \nlong-term implications for all circuits. Congress will be endorsing the \nview that a political division with no real data to support it is an \nacceptable way to determine circuit composition. I say it is not an \nacceptable way to determine what a circuit court of the United States \nshould be.\n  The fifth circuit has been held to be some kind of a model. This was \nsplit in 1980, following the 1973 findings of the Hruska Commission. It \nis my understanding that the fifth circuit has one of the poorest \nrecords with respect to delays today.\n  The problems of caseload growth are nationwide problems that cannot \nbe resolved by zeroing in on one circuit and wantonly, haphazardly, \nchopping it up.\n  I believe that there ought to be a study of the structural aspects of \nall of the circuits. There ought to be a study of the structural \nalternatives available to the circuit courts of appeal. Qualified \nmembers of a commission should make recommendations to the Congress on \ncircuit structure and alignment, whether and how any realignment should \noccur.\n  If you recall, the Hruska Commission, a long time ago, recommended a \nsplit of the State of California. I think, in view of the new \ntechniques that have been put into play by the ninth circuit in the \npast 23 years, this recommendation is perhaps out of date. The ninth \ncircuit has made requests for new judges. These requests have not been \nhonored in terms of presenting the circuit with an adequate number of \njudges to do the job.\n  The State bars oppose a ninth circuit split. That is also what makes \nthis a very dangerous proposal. The eleventh circuit split from the \nfifth only after all of the judges and bar associations essentially \nagreed with the proposal to create a new circuit.\n  This is the opposite case. The bar associations of Arizona, of \nNevada, of Montana, of California, and of Hawaii have all expressed \ntheir opposition to splitting the circuit, as did Idaho, the last time \nthis split came up. I ask unanimous consent that those resolutions be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The ninth circuit judicial conference has opposed the \nsplit. The Judicial Council, the governing body of the ninth circuit, \nunanimously opposes a split. The Federal Bar Association has opposed \nthis split.\n  I ask unanimous consent, also, that their statements be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As the distinguished Chair knows, the board of \ngovernors of the Arizona bar has issued a resolution against the recent \nBurns proposal, stating the following:\n\n       The proposal cuts Arizona off from California, the State \n     with which it shares the greatest legal and economic ties.\n\n  This bill would create a two-State circuit, with one tiny State \ndwarfed by a large State. California would have 94 percent of the new \nninth circuit's caseload.\n  It is also a very costly proposal. I find it just ironic that the \ncommittee would vote to spend so much for no demonstrated gain, when \nthis Congress is so concerned--and I believe commendably concerned--\nwith reducing the costs of the judiciary.\n  Splitting the ninth circuit would require duplicative offices of \nclerk of the court, circuit executive, staff attorneys, settlement \nattorneys, courtrooms, libraries, and mail and computer facilities.\n  The estimated additional costs of a new or rehabilitated courthouse \nfor a proposed headquarters in Phoenix range from $23 to $59.5 million. \nBoth GSA and CBO have allocated startup costs at an additional $3 \nmillion.\n  GSA and CBO have estimated annual costs of duplicative staff \npositions at $1 million, and an additional $2 million for the cost of \nleasing space for the headquarters until permanent quarters could be \nmade available.\n  So we have duplicative staff to the tune of $1 million, and \nadditional lease costs--unnecessary--of $2 million.\n  If the twelfth circuit, as proposed in this second-degree amendment, \nwere to be created, substantial expenses already incurred by the \ntaxpayers also would be wasted. Congress has authorized, and GSA has \nalready completed, an extensive post-earthquake restoration of the \ncurrent ninth circuit headquarters building in San Francisco, at a cost \nof over $100 million. The GSA has also completed the build-out of the \ncourt of appeals courthouse in Pasadena. I am told that 35 percent of \nthe $100 million was essentially spent on quarters for the ninth \ncircuit.\n  I do not believe that this effort to split the ninth circuit really \nrepresents a genuine effort to deal with the problems of the U.S. court \nsystem.\n  I believe, really, it is an example of judicial gerrymandering \nbecause some decisions made by that court were not to the liking of \ncertain people. I am aware of the fact that the Senator from Montana, \nin his press release of May 25, states:\n\n       We are seeing an increase in legal actions against economic \n     activities in States like\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\n     Montana, such as timbering, mining, and water development. \n     This threatens local economic stability, but as bad as this \n     economic backlog is, I am particularly disturbed by \n     the delays experienced by families of victims.\n  The press release of the Senator from Montana also says:\n\n       State Senator Ethel Harding, of Polson, knew firsthand the \n     pain of this kind of delay, whose daughter was murdered by \n     Duncan Meccans 20 years ago, but Meccans was put to death \n     only 2 weeks ago. The appeal ended up in the ninth circuit \n     three times over the 20-year period, and part of the delay \n     can be attributed to the heavy caseload and inefficient \n     system of the ninth circuit.\n\n  Senator Burns' press releases illustrate the fact that, clearly, this \neffort to split the ninth circuit is politically motivated--because a \nhabeas decision of the ninth circuit was not agreed with, for example. \nI respectfully submit to my distinguished colleague from Montana that \nthere is habeas reform pending. I happen to support that reform. I \nsubmit to this body that that is the appropriate way to deal with \nhabeas reform--not to gerrymander the circuit, but to pass a reform law \nthat changes habeas corpus.\n  Another issue that was brought out in Senator Burns' press release \nwas the Montana sheriff's appeal of background checks under the Brady \nlaw. This was cited as further evidence of the need to split Montana \nand other northwest States from the circuit. I go into this not to \nmeasure the good or the bad of the decision relating to background \nchecks, but simply to say that I believe this is the heart of the \nreason for the split. It is being done precipitously, without study, at \ngreat cost, and I believe for the wrong reasons. It, therefore, sets a \nprecedent for these kinds of political maneuverings.\n  Let us take a look at the ninth circuit. The ninth circuit does a \ngood job. In the 23 years following the Hruska Commission report, the \nninth circuit has become a national leader in experimentation in \njudicial administration. It is producing good results. The average \ntime, from oral argument submission to disposition, is 1.9 months, or \nhalf a month less than the national average. In fact, the ninth circuit \nis the second most efficient circuit in deciding cases once they are \nsubmitted to judges.\n  The ninth circuit terminates over 8,500 cases a year, almost two-\nfifths more than the number it terminated 7 years ago.\n  Since 1992, the number of cases pending before the ninth circuit has \ndecreased annually.\n  It is also the first Federal court circuit to automate its docket \nwith computerized issue tracking systems that are far more \nsophisticated than anything available in 1973. These systems keep ninth \ncircuit panels apprised of other panel decisions, helping them avoid \nintra-circuit conflicts.\n  So the ninth circuit has pioneered a number of different \ntechnological and structural improvements. Additionally, it has used a \nlimited en banc procedure, which has also proved effective in resolving \npotential intra-circuit conflicts. All active judges participate in the \ndecision as to whether a case will go en banc. The Court's rules allow \nfor rehearing by the full court at the request of either judges or \nlitigants. So either a judge or a litigant can request a hearing by the \nfull court.\n  It should be noted that the limited en banc procedure is called upon \nvery infrequently. There are only about 12 to 13 limited en banc \ndecisions per year out of a total of about 4,000 written decisions.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n                          State Bar of Nevada\n\n\n                               resolution\n\n       Whereas, The State Bar of Nevada, through the years, has \n     consistently supported the maintenance of the Ninth Circuit \n     as presently constituted; and\n       Whereas, a question of dividing the circuit may well \n     reoccur during the present session of Congress or in the \n     discussions before the Judicial Conference;\n       Now, therefore, the Board of Governors of the State Bar of \n     Nevada Resolves that the Ninth Circuit is well constituted as \n     is, promotes judicial economy, and as constituted, promotes \n     the interests of justice, and no alteration should be made \n     nor should the Ninth Judicial Circuit be divided.\n       Dated: This 9th day of March, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          State Bar of Montana\n\n\n                              resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, Montana is one of nine states and two territories \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit has provided significant guidance to all circuit \n     courts regarding issues of collegiality, maintaining \n     precedent and effectively accomplishing and administrating \n     the business of the circuit courts; and\n       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit has been a leader in implementing Gender Equity and \n     recognizing the need to address Racial and Ethnicity concerns \n     to improve the involvement of all citizens in the \n     administration of justice; and\n       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit has provided innovative leadership in the involvement \n     of lawyers in all functions and committees of the circuit; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit has instituted long range planning to project the \n     needs of the circuit into the upcoming century; and\n       Whereas, Montana has therefore reaped significant benefit \n     from being a part of the Ninth Circuit; and\n       Whereas, the Congress has once again undertaken \n     consideration of a bill to divide the circuit and to create a \n     new Twelfth Circuit which would divide out the northern tier \n     states into a new separate smaller circuit; and\n       Whereas, a divided circuit would remove the numerous \n     benefits which Montana enjoys as a part of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with very little, if \n     any, gains; and\n       Whereas, a divided circuit would result in additional one \n     time construction and division costs and increased annual \n     administrative expenses thereby straining the already \n     inadequate budget of the Judiciary, resulting in fewer funds \n     for the direct administration of justice and for Civil \n     Justice panel lawyers and other essential components of the \n     administration of justice; and\n       Whereas, a division of the Ninth Circuit would not address \n     or resolve the principal problem of circuits which serve \n     rapidly growing regions, that is, the crisis of volumes of \n     filings with inadequate judicial resources to resolve them; \n     and\n       Whereas, a division of the circuit would remove the present \n     opportunity to obtain the appointment of a practicing Montana \n     lawyer to current vacancies on the Ninth Circuit and would \n     significantly reduce the opportunity to appoint practicing \n     Montana lawyers to the Twelfth Circuit in the future.\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the State Bar of \n     Montana Opposes Passage of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     Reorganization Act of 1995.

Bill Baker,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Baker: The Board of Governors of the \n     State Bar of California urges you to oppose H.R. 2935 and \n     substitute bill S. 956, which would split the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, leaving California, Hawaii and the Pacific \n     territories in a new Ninth Circuit and placing the remaining \n     seven states (Alaska, Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah \n     and Washington) into a new Twelfth Circuit.\n       H.R. 2935 was introduced on February 5, 1996. Substitute \n     bill S. 956 was reported out of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on December 21, 1995. We urge you to oppose both of \n     these bills.\n       The case for splitting the circuit has not been made. The \n     Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit; however, size alone \n     does not argue for its division. In fact, we believe the size \n     of the Ninth Circuit gives its residents certain advantages. \n     It is an advantage to all states bordering the West Coast to \n     have a single federal court of appeals. This single circuit \n     provides uniform and predictable case law applicable to the \n     region and crucial to Pacific Rim trade, which is of growing \n     importance to California and other Western states. Splitting \n     the region into two circuits is likely to increase inter-\n     circuit conflict, forum shopping and races to the courthouse. \n     The size of the Ninth Circuit also provides greater \n     flexibility in responding to caseload growth and greater \n     diversity of judicial backgrounds as a result of judges drawn \n     from a larger area.\n       The issue of caseload growth is common to courts of appeals \n     nationwide. However, repeated division of circuits in \n     response to growth is not likely to be the answer to this \n     problem and will likely create a proliferation of balkanized \n     circuits. Splitting the Ninth Circuit, ostensibly because of \n     its caseload, before considering how to respond to growing \n     filings nationwide, will complicate rather than advance \n     solutions to caseload growth.\n       In an era where shrinking financial resources dictate cost-\n     saving measures, a Ninth Circuit split would increase costs \n     by requiring a new circuit office, more court clerks and \n     attorneys, as well as additional courtrooms and libraries. \n     Absent a compelling argument for a split, and a clear and \n     comprehensive study on the most efficient method to \n     effectuate this division, the proposals are both premature \n     and imprudent.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n       The Board of Governors respectfully urges you to oppose \n     H.R. 2935 and substitute bill S. 956.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  James E. Towery,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          State Bar of Arizona\n\n\n         Resolution of the Board of Governors, October 20, 1995\n\n       This Board, in repeated resolutions, has expressed its \n     opposition to the various proposals to divide the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and its support for maintaining the \n     Circuit as it is. A new proposal has now been raised as to \n     which the view of the Bar is desired. This new proposal would \n     divide the Circuit by creating a Ninth Circuit of California, \n     Hawaii and the Pacific Islands and a Twelfth Circuit \n     consisting of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, \n     Nevada and Arizona. Such a plan would be extremely \n     unfortunate for Arizona and wastefully unwise as a matter of \n     judicial administration. The considerations which concern us \n     follow:\n       1. The proposal cuts Arizona off from California, the state \n     with which it shares the greatest legal and economic ties. On \n     the one hand, as we have previously declared, Arizona does \n     not wish to be in a circuit dominated by California; but at \n     the same time, it needs to be in a circuit with California. \n     Our law is commonly guided by California law. The proposed \n     division puts a premium on racing for choice of forum so that \n     California and Arizona parties to a disputed business \n     transaction will each have an incentive to sue first to keep \n     the matter in ``their'' circuit; and yet this may be a matter \n     which, without fostering a race to the courthouse, might \n     never be litigated at all.\n       2. The headquarters of the proposed Twelfth Circuit would \n     presumably be in Seattle. This would materially increase \n     costs and inconvenience for Arizona attorneys and litigants. \n     Airfare between Arizona and either Portland or Seattle is \n     such that this proposal will cost Arizonans at least two or \n     three times as much in every case. Flights to the Northwest \n     take twice as long as to San Francisco and are less than half \n     as frequent, giving Arizona endless burdens with so remote a \n     court.\n       3. Politically the disadvantages to Arizona are \n     substantial. With the present Ninth Circuit, non-California \n     senators outnumber California senators 14 to 2, and non-\n     California judges also outnumber California judges. In the \n     newly proposed Twelfth Circuit, Arizona and Nevada would be \n     outnumbered in the Senate 10 to 4, which means that the \n     judgeships and courthouses will go to the Northwest.\n       4. The dollar waste is regrettable. The Ninth Circuit \n     presently has a major court building to serve the Circuit in \n     Pasadena and is in the final stages of completion of a $100 \n     million post earthquake renovation of the present Circuit \n     headquarters in San Francisco, a headquarters for the entire \n     Circuit. Not only will much of the San Francisco space be \n     wasted under this proposal, but something of the kind will \n     have to be duplicated in the proposed Twelfth Circuit. There \n     will also need to be duplication of offices of Clerk, Circuit \n     Executive, computer center, mailroom and other support \n     offices.\n       In the light of all these factors, the Board of Governors \n     of the State Bar of Arizona strongly recommends against the \n     proposal for a new Arizona-to-Alaska Twelfth Circuit.\n                                                  Michael Kimerer,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Hawaii State Bar Association,\n\n                                    Honolulu, HI, August 21, 1995.\n     Re Division of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (S. 956).\n\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     U.S. Senate, 109 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: The Hawaii State Bar Association Board \n     of Directors last week voted unanimously to oppose proposed \n     legislation to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Similar legislation proposed in 1989, 1991, and earlier \n     this year was also opposed by the Hawaii State Bar \n     Association. See 10/30/91 letter from Wolff to Inouye, \n     Exhibit A.\n       A position paper prepared by the Office of the Circuit \n     Executive dated 6/22/95 sets forth the arguments against \n     dividing the Ninth Circuit. See Exhibit B. The Hawaii State \n     Bar Association is in agreement with those arguments and \n     would like to reiterate its concern over inconsistent law \n     that would inevitably occur as a result of a division in the \n     Ninth Circuit. As explained in Peter Wolff's 10/30/91 letter \n     to you, a different rule of law might apply to a maritime \n     case depending on whether the departure or destination point \n     was Seattle or Los Angeles.\n       We hope that you will vote and lobby against the passage of \n     Senate Bill 956. If we can be of any assistance to you in \n     this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at 547-\n     6119.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sidney K.

Idaho Bar Commission \n     Rule 906 requires that we engage in a plebiscite of our \n     members before considering resolutions for changes of law or \n     policy. The resolution process is conducted each November.\n       Resolution S2-1, considered last fall, was entitled \n     ``Bifurcation of 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,'' and was \n     circulated at the request of both of our U.S. Senators. A \n     copy of the resolution is included with this letter.\n       The resolution failed by a vote of 978 to 2373.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William A. McCurdy,\n                                       President, Idaho State Bar.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                         Governor Pete Wilson,\n\n                                                 December 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: I have been following with interest the current \n     debate over whether to split the Ninth Circuit, and wish to \n     register my strong opposition to any split before an \n     objective study is concluded as to whether a split before an \n     objective study is concluded as to whether a split will \n     properly address the concerns that have been raised \n     concerning the size of the circuit.\n       As you know, I have been on record in opposition to \n     previous bills to split the circuit on the grounds that they \n     were a form of gerrymandering which sought to cordon off some \n     judges and keep others.\n       Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit handles more cases than any \n     other circuit. However, the median time for it to decide \n     appeals (14.8 months as of December 1994) is only slightly \n     higher than that for the Sixth, Seventh, and D.C. Circuits \n     and less than the Eleventh Circuit (14.8 months), and in \n     fairness, the destruction of the San Francisco courthouse in \n     the Loma Prieta earthquake is party responsible for the \n     backlog.\n       Splitting the circuit, without adding more judge, will not \n     necessarily expedite the processing of the Ninth Circuit's \n     cases and may generate a number of inconsistent rulings along \n     the West Coast in areas such as admiralty, environmental law, \n     and commercial law, since the West Coast would be split, \n     under the pending proposal, into two circuits (i.e., \n     California in one, and Washington and Oregon in the other). \n     Indeed, splitting the Ninth Circuit could add an additional \n     burden on the Supreme Court, which ultimately must resolve \n     conflicts between circuits. I recognize that some concerns \n     have been raised over intra-circuit conflicts, but there is a \n     mechanism for resolving them--the en banc hearing. See \n     Fed.R.App.Pro. 35.\n       Ultimately, the real issue raised in the debate over \n     splitting the Ninth Circuit appears to be one of judicial \n     gerrymandering, which seeks to cordon off some judges in one \n     circuit and keep others in another. If this is the issue, I \n     submit that the proper means to address this is through the \n     appointment of new judges who do not inspire judicial \n     gerrymandering because they share our judicial philosophy \n     that judges should not make policy judgments but interpret \n     the law, based on the purpose of the statute as expressed in \n     its language, and who respect the role of the states in our \n     federal system.\n       An objective study can focus on the concerns raised about \n     the Ninth Circuit and determine whether a split is the \n     answer. For instance, reform of our habeas corpus procedures \n     and reforms which curb frivolous inmate litigation may do \n     more to address a growing caseload than splitting the \n     circuit.\n       In any event, I would urge that a study be commissioned to \n     carefully examine the concerns raised about the Ninth Circuit \n     and determine whether the concerns are legitimate and whether \n     a change in the circuit's boundaries is the best method of \n     addressing them. I would be pleased to contribute one or more \n     representatives to assist with such a study.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Wilson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                                Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                      Reno, NV, December 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am pleased that you are going to \n     carry your opposition to S. 956 to the floor of the Senate. \n     You will be speaking for more than the interests of the \n     citizens of your state. This important issue affects all of \n     the people of our nation and their united belief that there \n     must be one federal law applicable to each of us.\n       As you know, I was a Republican member of the United States \n     House of Representatives from a district in southern \n     California for a period of 12 years, commencing in 1967. I \n     served continuously on the House Judiciary Committee. In \n     addition, I was a member of the Hruska Commission in 1972-73. \n     I left Congress voluntarily in 1979. In 1984, I was appointed \n     by President Reagan to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit. I am now an active judge on that Court.\n       The foregoing record of public service gives me, I believe, \n     special insights into the management of cases within the \n     existing Ninth Circuit. My understanding of the role of \n     circuit courts in our system of federal justice has changed \n     over the years from that which I held when the Hruska \n     Commission issued its final report in 1973. At that time, I \n     endorsed the recommendations of the Commission calling for a \n     division of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits. I have grown wiser \n     in the succeeding 22 years.\n       The Hruska Commission was created to deal with the problem \n     of the Fifth Circuit. In recommending the division of the old \n     Fifth Circuit into a new Fifth Circuit and a new Eleventh \n     Circuit, we were responding to the united views of federal \n     judges and bar associations in the respective states, and not \n     insignificantly, the views of the late Senator Eastland, the \n     then Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The \n     recommended changes in the Fifth Circuit were ultimately \n     implemented, but those respecting the Ninth Circuit were, \n     wisely I think, not.\n       You have recommended a new Commission to be appointed to \n     review and update the findings of the old Hruska Commission. \n     I endorse this recommendation. Although I strongly oppose the \n     division of the Ninth Circuit, I believe the Senate is \n     entitled to review facts, and modern case management \n     techniques, now employed within the Ninth Circuit. Moreover, \n     the continued balkanization of our circuits must be \n     confronted and the case for fewer, larger, circuits, must be \n     studied. I wish you well in this undertaking.\n       The proponents of a new Twelfth Circuit have evidently \n     abandoned their often made arguments that the new circuit \n     would be needed to save excessive travel costs. No circuit \n     stretching from Tucson, Arizona, to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska \n     will support this argument.\n       The majority report also contains the misleading statement \n     that the recommended division of the Ninth Circuit is not in \n     response to ideological differences between judges from \n     California and judges elsewhere in the circuit. I strongly \n     disagree that such a motive does not in fact underlie the \n     proposal for the change. Such a regionalization of the \n     circuits in accordance with state interests is wrong. There \n     is one federal law. It is enacted by the Congress, signed by \n     the President, and is to be respected in every state in the \n     union. The law in Montana and Washington is the same law as \n     exists in Maine and Vermont. It is the mission of the Supreme \n     Court to maintain one consistent federal law. I do hope that \n     you will challenge the supporters of the revision to explain \n     the reasons justifying their proposal.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Charles E. Wiggins,\n                                                    Circuit Judge.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me speak for just a moment on the \nsubject of the pertinence of this amendment at this time. This \namendment filed by the distinguished Senator from Montana is really not \na relevant amendment, to which, if the subject of the amendment were \nknown, there would clearly have been objection. The amendment carries \nan appropriation for the Judiciary, which has been funded for the \nentire fiscal year through a previous continuing resolution. That is \nthe vehicle for this kind of appropriation. It is not relevant to this \nbill before us.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid and myself, I raise this \npoint of order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for just a moment \nso that we can consult?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to withhold for a moment.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I raise this point of order that \namendment No. 3530 is not relevant to the Hatfield substitute or to the \nHouse bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the underlying \namendment that has been offered by my friend from Montana.\n  Mr. President, first of all, in reviewing the amendment, it appears \nto me that the amendment is backward. What I mean by that is that the \namendment by my friend from Montana calls not only for the division of \nthe ninth circuit but it also calls for a commission to study the \nrestructuring of the circuit.\n  I have spoken to the Presiding Officer of this body, I have spoken to \nthe Senator from Montana, I have spoken to the Senator from California, \nwho is in the Chamber, and lots of other people about this circuit and \nwhether or not it should be split. I think this is a very good \nquestion. We should give some serious consideration to it. But it would \nseem to me that the best way for this body to do that would be to have \na commission, one that is composed of prominent people appointed by the \njudiciary. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, I think, should \nbe in on the appointment of people to serve on this prestigious \ncommission, and the President of the United States. Of course, we \nshould have legislative input into this commission.\n\n  I think, also, the commission should have adequate staff so that they \ncan report back to us in a short period of time. It seems to me, if we \nwould empower this commission to go forward with the appropriate \nresources to look into the structuring of the circuits, that we, by \nnext year at this time, would have all of the information at our \ndisposal to make an appropriate decision.\n  The Hruska commission that was impaneled some 23 years ago came up \nwith some ideas that were based on some good that they have done. They \ndecided that the fifth circuit and the ninth circuit should be split. I \nsay to my friend, the junior Senator from Montana, that the split of \nthe fifth circuit subsequently took place. The split of the ninth \ncircuit has not taken place. But I say to my friend from Montana that, \nif you are going to follow the 23-year-old Hruska commission and its \nfindings, you certainly will not split the ninth circuit the way they \nhave done it in this bill, because what the Hruska commission said is \nthat you would, in effect, cut the ninth circuit in half and have one-\nhalf in northern California and one half in southern California and the \nrest of the circuit would be split up in a number of different ways.\n  So I say to my friend from Montana and to everyone within the sound \nof my voice that I think the amendment is backward. I think we should \nhave a commission to study the restructuring of the circuits, and once \nthat is done, come back here and determine if, in fact, there should be \nchanges in the ninth circuit and all of the rest of the circuits in the \ncountry, because, if you go ahead and divide the ninth circuit and \ncreate a twelfth circuit, you have already taken away the ability we \nhave to realign some of the other circuits.\n  Mr. President, if you look at this long, very narrow twelfth circuit, \nyou have the chief judge, the headquarters of the court, sitting in \nPhoenix, AZ. I do not know how far away from Montana, I do not know how \nfar away from Alaska, but it is away from major population centers in \nthat circuit. Seattle and Portland are examples. I cannot imagine, with \nmost of the cases coming from Oregon and Washington, why it would be \nfair for them to have to travel to Phoenix.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, in November 1994, after there was \nthis revolution that took place with the elections in the House and, to \na lesser degree, in the Senate, we were told that we were going to \nstart saving money, that we would not be wasteful in the things that we \nspent money on. If there was ever a waste of money, it would be what we \nare trying to do here--upward of $60 million in one-time spending to \ncreate this new circuit and, of course, spend lots more money on a\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nyearly basis because you would have two circuits whereas in the past \nyou have one circuit.\n  So, Mr. President, I really believe that I should ask my friend, with \nwhom I serve on the Appropriations Committee and for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, to review the offering of this amendment.\n  The Chair has ruled that this amendment is not germane, and it really \nis not. I appreciate the ruling of the Chair because we entered into a \nunanimous-consent agreement that there would be only relevant \namendments. Mr. President, if, in fact, the Chair had ruled any other \nway, this place would be chaotic. There simply would be no end to floor \nprocedures. There would never be another unanimous-consent agreement \nreached.\n\n  I, for example, wrote a letter to our staff here on my side of the \nfloor several months ago saying if anything comes up regarding the \nsplitting of the ninth circuit that I be notified. The reason I mention \nthat, of course, is that this amendment was offered late at night, and, \nfor whatever reason, the procedure was that this is not relevant. I am \nglad the Chair has ruled accordingly.\n  I think it is appropriate, though, Mr. President, that we talk about \nthe ninth circuit and whether or not this should be split. To divide \nthe ninth circuit would create two geographically and demographically \nunequal units. What I mean by that is, splitting this circuit is not \ngoing to solve the problem. Splitting the circuit is not going to solve \nthe problems that I know my friend from Montana--and, believe me, many \nof my constituents in Nevada--is concerned about. Creating two circuits \nfrom one without increasing judicial resources would not address the \nfundamental problems of expanding caseloads and delays. We know from \ndividing the fifth circuit in 1980 that it has resulted in no long-term \nbenefits in expediting case processing.\n  I, also--back to the commission aspect of it--again stress that I \nwould be very happy to have this commission that we created on a \nbipartisan basis have a short time-line as to when to report back to \nus. The Hruska Commission reported back in 1973. In 1980, the fifth \ncircuit was split. But, as I have mentioned, there have been no long-\nterm benefits in expediting case processing. That does not mean the \nsplit was not important and was not necessary, but if we are going to \nlook at splitting the circuits to expedite case processing, that will \nnot do it, especially when you consider the ninth circuit judges are \nthe fastest in the Nation in disposing of cases once a panel receives \nthe cases.\n  Also, understand that, if you look at the western coast of the United \nStates, you have the long, long State of California. But also on that \ncoast you have Oregon and Washington, two extremely important States as \nfar as maritime and admiralty law. One reason we have had peace and \nquiet in the admiralty and maritime law in the western part of the \nUnited States is because there has been one voice that has spoken about \nthat most important part of our commerce. If the split took place, we \nwould have one circuit ruling and deciding cases in Washington and \nOregon; you would have another circuit deciding cases based in \nCalifornia, that great Western United States. The maritime law of that \npart of the country would be bifurcated. That is not the way it should \nbe.\n  It would increase the potential for inconsistent law relating to \nadmiralty, commercial trade, and the utility laws on the western \nseaboard. Establishing a circuit consisting of just two States would \ndefeat the federalizing function of the multistate circuit. That is the \ncentral purpose of the American Federal appellate process.\n  Senator Feinstein talked, Mr. President, about the cost to construct \na new twelfth circuit with its headquarters. As I have indicated, the \nestimate, among others, with the GAO is $60 million--approximately \n$59.5 million--plus $2 to $3 million in annual costs duplicating \nexisting administrative functions.\n  An additional headquarters would result in waste of taxpayer dollars \nspent on the recently completed $100 million earthquake rehabilitation \nin San Francisco.\n  Mr. President, prior to coming back here, I was a trial lawyer, and I \nhave appeared in that beautiful ninth circuit where I have argued \ncases. It is a beautiful, beautiful building, and the earthquake \ndamaged that. One reason the ninth circuit does not have a better \nrecord of moving cases is because they had no building in which to \nwork. The earthquake damaged the building so that the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals could not work in it. So the money that was spent \nrehabilitating that facility, $100 million, in effect would be wasted.\n  Mr. President, it is also important, I think, for me to say \nsomething--it is unnecessary, but in this age of political correctness, \nperhaps I should mention it. I have a son who just graduated from \nStanford Law School last June. We are very proud of him. He is one of \nmy four boys. He works as a clerk in the ninth circuit. So if I have \nany prejudice because of my son, I acknowledge that here in this \nChamber, but I was against this split long before my son went to work \nin whatever--sometime this past summer--for one of the judges of the \nninth circuit.\n  That beautiful ninth circuit court building was restored, and I am \nhappy it was restored. But let us not have any waste of it at this \nstage.\n  The official bar organizations of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \neven Montana, and Nevada, and the Federal bar associations have all \nadopted resolutions opposing any split. I think it is important we have \ninput of the bar relative to this split. But I can say to my friend \nfrom Montana that if, in fact, we have a commission and the study comes \nout that there should be a restructuring, I would weigh that much more \nheavily than I weigh the opinion of the bar from the State of Nevada \nbecause the bar from the State of Nevada, even though I have great \nrespect for them, are traditionalists and would not have the benefit of \nthe study of what I feel would be this bipartisan Commission composed \nof people appointed by the Chief Justice, people appointed by the \nPresident, and people appointed from the legislative branch.\n  The ninth circuit judges, I repeat, are the fastest in the Nation in \ndisposing of cases once the panel receives the cases. That is pretty \ngood. The ninth circuit I think--I have certainly not asked them \nindividually, but I think they would welcome an independent, \ncongressionally mandated study of Federal appellate courts to update \nCongress certainly before it makes any far-reaching structural changes. \nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has functioned successfully in its \npresent configuration for more than 100 years. The sponsors, including \nmy friend from Montana and also my friend, the senior Senator from the \nState of Washington, who is one of the prime movers of this \nlegislation, have cited a number of reasons for this legislation. One \nis the unmanageable caseload, a decrease in consistency of decisions \ndue to size, inability to appreciate the interests of the Northwest, \nand, lastly, a decline in the performance of the circuit.\n  First of all, let us talk about caseload. The ninth circuit has \nmanaged efficiently a caseload that is comparable on a per-judge basis \nand far exceeds in total that of other circuits. Also, as far as \ncaseload, the ninth circuit has maintained a high degree of consistency \nin its case law. Also, the ninth circuit has functioned well to avoid \nregionalism by federalizing the application of national law over a wide \ngeographic area, and, Mr. President, they have demonstrated a high \nlevel of performance in managing the caseload.\n\n  I also say that the ninth circuit is a court that our U.S. Supreme \nCourt looks to for guidance, for lack of a better word, if the Supreme \nCourt looks anyplace for guidance. If there is a conflict in the ninth \ncircuit and one in the tenth circuit, heavy reliance is placed upon \nprecedents developed out of the ninth circuit. I think that answers one \nof the criticisms that my friend from Montana has raised.\n  I think the proposals to divide the circuit have numerous drawbacks, \nincluding the substantial cost of setting up, as I have already \noutlined, the duplicative administrative structures and a new circuit \nheadquarters. I do not think I can talk too much here about the fact \nthat we are supposed to be balancing the budget, so how can we, in good \nconscience, spend $60 million with this legislation and still call for \na study where we are going to have to do some more restructuring. It \njust does not make a lot of sense.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  I would also say that the loss of advantage of size really does not \nanswer the question. We have strong opposition of the majority of the \nlawyers and judges in the circuit to which we have to give some \ncredence. This is the ninth circuit. We cannot say we are going to \nignore the lawyers and judges. We are talking about one of our branches \nof government, a separate but equal branch of government. With the \npotential for inconsistent law relating to admiralty, commercial trade, \nand utility law along the western seaboard, including Alaska and \nHawaii, which I have not talked about, and the territories, it is \nimportant that we speak with one voice in that regard.\n  An opportunity for litigants to forum shop certainly would come about \nas a result of this split. The potential for increased inner-circuit \nconflicts would place an additional burden on the U.S. Supreme Court to \nresolve these conflicts that are now handled internally within the \ncircuit.\n  We need hearings on this. I am willing to forego hearings. I know \nthat the Judiciary Committee, of which neither sponsor of this \nlegislation, and certainly not the junior Senator from Montana, is a \nmember, has spent, as I understand it--I know it is true--the full \nJudiciary Committee had a single half-day hearing on this legislation \nthat is now before the Senate. So I think that we really need to spend \na little more time on this.\n  I am convinced that the Commission could do a good job with all the \nmany things that we have to do, especially this being a Presidential \nelection year. And I know how my friend from Montana and others feel \nabout it. I repeat for the third time here today that we would be \nwilling to put a short time limit on how long it would take for them to \ncome back with their work. We would make sure during that short time \nperiod that they have adequate resources to study it well.\n\n  The proposed legislation very simply would not solve the problems of \ncaseload growth and would increase the ninth circuit caseload burden. \nHere is why I say that. Throughout the United States, in all the \ncircuits, the caseload has increased dramatically in proportion to the \nnumber of judges. Some of these figures are really startling. So the \nkey problem to be addressed is the number of judges to handle the \ncaseload rather than configuration of circuits.\n  It is interesting here; this Senator from Nevada, a Democrat, and my \nfriend, the Senator from California, who has just spoken, a Democrat, \nhave always supported the Republicans in the changing of habeas corpus. \nEvery time I have had a chance to vote here since I have been in the \nSenate I have supported streamlining and expediting the habeas corpus \nprocedures in this country.\n  That is something that would allow the ninth circuit and every other \ncircuit to move on with its cases. I think it is absolutely wrong for a \nperson--it does not matter how you feel about the death sentence. If \nyou believe in the rule of law, it is absolutely wrong that someone be \nsentenced to death when it takes an average of 16 or 17 years from the \ntime that sentence is imposed until the time the execution takes place, \nif, in fact, it ever takes place. If we want to talk about expediting \nthe cases that the ninth circuit and other circuits hear, that is how \nwe can do it. Let us move the habeas legislation that would streamline \nwhat the Federal courts hear.\n\n  There are other things we could do. Forty percent of the cases in the \nFederal District in Nevada are cases that are initiated by prisoners. \nThe majority leader, Senator Dole, and I, and others have joined in \nlegislation that has passed this body, saying let us do away with that. \nIf somebody has a good case, a prisoner, let him file it. But not as to \nwhether or not it should be chunky peanut butter or smooth peanut \nbutter, how many times can you change your underwear, whether it is \nreal sponge cake or not sponge cake. These are ridiculous things that \nreally turn my stomach, and that is what is taking the time of our \nFederal judiciary, hearing these ridiculous nonsense cases. It is not \nthe size of the circuits, it is what they are forced to hear because \nwe, as a legislative body, have not acted responsibly.\n  I repeat, the key problem to be addressed is the number of judges to \nhandle the caseload rather than the configuration of the circuits. From \n1978 to 1995 the number of appeals filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals increased by 179 percent. The number of judges increased 22 \npercent. In spite of this, in spite of this, plus the earthquake that \ncompletely disrupted its operations, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nshould receive an award, rather than being criticized for not doing \ntheir work well. Remember, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals moves its \ncases. There is no one faster in the entire circuit system in disposing \nof cases once the panel receives the cases.\n  In spite of this, in spite of the 22-percent increase in judges to \ncover the 180 percent increase in caseload, and the courthouse being \ndamaged and ruined, almost--it took $100 million to fix it up--they \nstill managed to keep up with their work. They actually are determining \nmore cases in the last 3 out of 4 years than were filed. They are not \ndropping behind, they are gaining. This is a remarkable record.\n  The presumption that increasing the number of circuits would solve \nthe problem of expanding Federal court caseloads is the underlying \nfallacy of my friend's amendment. I say the cases are resolved by \njudges, men and women wearing those robes, not by circuits, this \nartificial tenth or twelfth, because increasing the number of circuits \nwithout increasing the number of judges would only exacerbate the \nproblem. What we are being asked to do here is not only not increase \nthe number of judges, but build an entire new court complex, and of \ncourse we would have a new circuit with all of its administrative \npersonnel, which we have already established would cost at least $3 \nmillion extra a year. This would have no effect on caseload growth and \nthere is no reason to believe it would be different in the proposed \ntwelfth circuit than in the ninth circuit.\n  In its review of circuit size, the American Bar Association Appellate \nPractice Committee--and we have to go to the American Bar Association \nor some group of lawyers. Remember, we are dealing with courts here. We \ncannot go to the American Medical Association or certified public \naccountants or the Stock Car Racers of America. We have to go to \nattorneys, no matter how people feel about attorneys. What the ABA has \nsaid is, ``We have found no compelling reasons why circuit courts of \nvarious sizes, ranging from a few judges to 50, cannot effectively meet \nthe caseload challenge.''\n  Indeed, for every argument in favor of smaller circuits there is an \nequally compelling argument for larger circuits. That is why I say, Mr. \nPresident, we are not doing this the right way. That is why it is \nimportant that we step back from this and let experts look at it, not \nwe Senators who have preconceived ideas. Let us have the Chief Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court appoint some prominent people to take a look \nat this, and the President, and we as legislators should have our \ninput. Equal numbers, so the judicial does not have too many on it, the \nexecutive does not have too many, nor do we--equally distributed \nbetween the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of the \nGovernment. I repeat, give them adequate staff, other resources, and \nhave them report back to us in a reasonable period of time. That way, \nthen we can make decisions as to whether it is going to be important to \nhave more circuits, or have more judges, or have both.\n  I believe that the administration of justice in any society, \nespecially in ours, is based upon the certainty of punishment, if we \nare talking about the criminal justice system. The problem we have in \nour system, of course, is that we do not have certainty of punishment. \nI think a study of the circuit system in our country, with that in \nmind, would go a long ways to satisfying some of the questions that I \nhave.\n  I think it is important that we spread across this record the fact \nthat the proposed legislation would be costly and it would be wasteful, \nfor the reasons I have already outlined. The GSA [General Services \nAdministration] has virtually completed an earthquake rehabilitation of \nthis historic building in San Francisco at a cost of over $100 million. \nThat renovation was designed to accommodate the administrative \npersonnel of the ninth circuit as it presently exists, to meet its \nneeds for\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nthe foreseeable future. If we did not do that, we would waste what we \nhave already done.\n  We have some advantages from the size of the ninth circuit. The \nconsequences are not all negative. That is why I think this panel, this \ncommission we should appoint, will be instructive. The size of the \nninth circuit, some say, is an asset that is to improve decisionmaking \nand judicial administration both within the circuit and throughout the \nFederal judiciary. There are some legal scholars who feel rather than \nsplitting circuits we should be joining some of them; that there are \nbuilt-in efficiencies. As my friend from Montana, in his statement, \ntalked about one circuit--and I apologize, I do not know to which he \nwas referring, but there were six appellate judges, as I recall the \nstatement--maybe we should join that with another circuit. I do not \nknow. But, certainly, is it not worth looking at?\n\n  A single court of appeals serving a large geographic region, the \nninth circuit, has promoted uniformity and consistency in the law and \nhas facilitated trade and commerce by contributing to stability and \norderly process.\n  I again talk about admiralty and commerce under that entire western \nPacific United States, which includes, as I have mentioned, Hawaii and \nthe area out through there. We have one voice speaking about what the \nlaw should be. That has been very important. The court of appeals is \nstrengthened and enriched, and the inevitable tendency to be parochial \nis done away with. This is because of the variety and diversity of the \nbackground of its judges drawn from the nine States comprising the \ncircuit.\n  I had a conversation with a very close friend of mine who was home \nthis weekend, somebody for whom I have the greatest respect. He was \ncomplaining about a decision that had been reached within the past \ncouple of weeks, dealing with assisted suicide. He was complaining \nabout that, about, ``This judge did this.''\n  I proceeded to remind my friend that it was an 11-member panel that \ndecided the case, 11 judges out of the ninth circuit. They heard this \ncase en banc. The decision by the majority was by 8 of the 11. The \ndecision was written by that one man just because he happened to have \ndrawn the assignment to write it, but seven of the other judges joined \nwith him. So, in the ninth circuit more than any other circuit, there \nis not a tendency of one judge to dominate that circuit. There is not a \ntendency of two or three or four judges to dominate that circuit.\n  The ninth circuit is a leader in developing innovative solutions to \ncaseload and management challenges, and they have done this in many \ndifferent ways. It served as a laboratory for experimentation in many \nother areas, including computerized docketing and case tracking \nsystems, decentralized budgeting, improving tribal court relations, \nflexible judicial reassignments and effective and limited en banc \nprocedures, which is--really, what they have done with en banc \nprocedure in that case is really historic in nature.\n  No one complains about 11 of these appellate judges sitting down and \nhearing these cases. They do it expeditiously. We have had improved \nFederal-State judicial relations. They have been far advanced with \nalternative dispute resolution and use of appellate commissioners.\n  If I were going to vote today, I would vote against splitting the \ncircuit, but I am not going to be voting today, Mr. President. I am \ngoing to be, hopefully, reviewing what has taken place on the floor.\n  I see standing today my friend from Arizona, who is a fellow \nattorney. I have great respect for his legal talents and abilities. He \nwas a prominent and very refined lawyer before he came here. I am \nwilling to sit down and talk with him and anyone else as to what is the \nright way to go in coming up with this division. But let us not make it \nhere on a Monday afternoon or by an amendment offered late at night.\n  I think there is a better way to do this. I do not in any way \ncriticize or think that my friend from Montana did anything improper or \nwrong. If I felt that, I would say that to him personally. I do not \nfeel that is the way it is. I just feel that on multiple appropriations \nbills--five bills lumped into one--it is not the way to do it. I think \nwhat we should do, I repeat for the fourth time, is have a commission, \na fair commission with a reasonably short period of time to report \nback.\n  Mr. President, while we are still talking about the ninth circuit, it \nhas a high degree of consistency in its case law. It would be improper \nfor a circuit court of appeals to favor regional interests. This is a \ncourt of the land.\n  Also, an objective, updated study is needed before undertaking \npiecemeal realignments of the circuit. We had the Hruska study, which \ntook place 23 years ago, and it was very important that we did that. \nThe effects of growth on the entire Federal appellate system needs to \nbe reviewed. It can be done in a relatively short period of time with \ncomputerization and all the other modern methods we have at our \ndisposal to get statistics.\n  Yet, in the last two decades, no hearing has been held on that \nsubject, nor has any commission conducted a study to determine how the \nFederal appellate system will continue to manage the continuing, \ngrowing influx of cases. It is not only that the ninth circuit is \ngrowing, the whole United States is growing. So we need to look at all \nof them.\n  I repeat to my friends who feel this is the appropriate way to go--\nstop and look at this. What this amendment does is call for a split of \nthe ninth circuit, creating the twelfth circuit, and, at the same time, \nit calls for a commission to study restructuring. It is the wrong way \nto do it. We have already, in effect, let the cow out of the barn, \nbecause it makes it almost impossible to go back and pull out some of \nthe resources, the assets of the twelfth and ninth circuits to help \nrealign part of the other circuits if, in fact, that is necessary.\n  If you look, Mr. President, at the alignment of the court system, you \nwill find that the way my friend from Montana has proposed this in his \namendment, we have a very strange-looking circuit. I do not know how \nfar it is from the tip of Washington to the tip of Arizona, but I would \nsay it has to be 1,000 miles or more, because I know the State of \nNevada is 600 miles long or more. So it is probably, I would say, 1,200 \nmiles.\n  If we are going to talk about realignment, we might want to see if it \nis appropriate that the tenth circuit remain the way it is. I think if \nwe follow the findings of the Hruska Commission, or at least take that \nas a starting point, we might want to cut California right in two, if, \nin fact, there is a cut necessary. If you did that, I think there would \nbe a significantly different division than my friend has here.\n\n  Also, there are some long-time tendencies, practices, and procedures \nof which we have to be aware, and I think people need to study this. \nFor example, we do not have a law school. Nevada does not have a law \nschool. I do not know if there is another State in the Union that does \nnot have a law school, but we do not have a law school. The vast \nmajority of our lawyers are educated in California. I might say just \noffhand, I oppose the taxpayers of Nevada spending a lot of money on a \nlaw school. It comes up in every legislative session. I think we have \nenough law schools, and Nevada has plenty of lawyers. They are not \nhaving difficulty finding a place to go to school.\n  I say that it is going to take a little education in Nevada--and I \nthink this commission is the way to go--to have lawyers, judges find \nsome rationale for splitting Nevada off from California. What the U.S. \nSenate decides in a debate of a few hours is not going to satisfy the \ncourt and bar in the State of Nevada.\n  I think this commission that I have recommended, that was originally \nthe idea of my friend from California, Senator Feinstein, is an \nappropriate way to go. I respectfully submit, Mr. President, that it is \nnot the right way to go to split the circuit and then come back and \nsay, ``Let's do a restructuring study.'' An objective, updated study is \nneeded before undertaking piecemeal realignment of the courts.\n  Some say that the Hruska Commission is outdated and the time has long \nsince passed when its findings are of any merit. I do not know that to \nbe the case, although there are some who feel that is the case. Arthur \nHellman, who testified at our hearing, who is a professor and served as \ndeputy executive director of the Hruska Commission 23 years ago, wrote \nin 1995:\n\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n\n       Although the Hruska Commission recommended in 1973 that the \n     ninth circuit be divided, that recommendation has been made \n     obsolete by intervening events.\n\n  This is not some disinterested professor who was asked to look at it; \nthis was the executive director of the commission.\n  A former Congressman, a member of the ninth circuit, Judge Wiggins, \nwho was a member of the Hruska Commission and a former Member of the \nHouse of Representatives on the Judiciary Committee, one of the people \nwho was responsible for the Hruska Commission going forward, has \nexpressed in a recent letter his opposition to a circuit division and \nsupported the idea of an up-to-date new study. That is not \nunreasonable.\n  Our lurching off into this is not the right way to go. Senator, now \nGovernor, Pete Wilson conveyed similar sentiments in a recent letter to \nSenator Hatch. He said, among other things:\n\n       I would urge that a study be commissioned to carefully \n     examine the concerns raised about the ninth circuit and \n     determine whether those concerns are legitimate and whether a \n     change in the circuit's boundaries is the best method of \n     addressing it.\n\n  That is from Pete Wilson, a veteran legislator and certainly now a \nveteran administrator.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have the letter from \nGovernor Pete Wilson printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Governor Pete Wilson,\n\n                                                 December 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: I have been following with interest the current \n     debate over whether to split the Ninth Circuit, and wish to \n     register my strong opposition to any split before an \n     objective study is concluded as to whether a split will \n     properly address the concerns that have been raised \n     concerning the size of the circuit.\n       As you know, I have been on record in opposition to \n     previous bills to split the circuit on the grounds that they \n     were a form of gerrymandering which sought to cordon off some \n     judges and keep others.\n       Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit handles more cases than any \n     other circuit. However, the median time for it to decide \n     appeals (14.3 months as of December 1994) is only slightly \n     higher than that for the Sixth, Seventh, and D.C. Circuits \n     and less than the Eleventh Circuit (14.8 months), and in \n     fairness, the destruction of the San Francisco courthouse in \n     the Loma Prieta earthquake is party responsible for the \n     backlog.\n       Splitting the circuit, without adding more judges, will not \n     necessarily expedite the processing of the Ninth Circuit's \n     cases and may generate a number of inconsistent rulings along \n     the West Coast in areas such as admiralty, environmental law, \n     and commercial law, since the West Coast would be split, \n     under the pending proposal, into two circuits (i.e., \n     California in one, and Washington and Oregon in the other). \n     Indeed, splitting the Ninth Circuit could add an additional \n     burden on the Supreme Court, which ultimately must resolve \n     conflicts between circuits. I recognize that some concerns \n     have been raised over intra-circuit conflicts, but there is a \n     mechanism for resolving them--the en banc hearing. See \n     Fed.R.App.Pro. 35.\n       Ultimately, the real issue raised in the debate over \n     splitting the Ninth Circuit appears to be one of judicial \n     gerrymandering, which seeks to cordon off some judges in one \n     circuit and keep others in another. If this is the issue, I \n     submit that the proper means to address this is through the \n     appointment of new judges who do not inspire judicial \n     gerrymandering because they share our judicial philosophy \n     that judges should not make policy judgments but interpret \n     the law, based on the purpose of the statute as expressed in \n     its language, and who respect the role of the states in our \n     federal system.\n       An objective study can focus on the concerns raised about \n     the Ninth Circuit and determine whether a split is the \n     answer. For instance, reform of our habeas corpus procedures \n     and reforms which curb frivolous inmate litigation may do \n     more to address a growing caseload than splitting the \n     circuit.\n       In any event, I would urge that a study be commissioned to \n     carefully examine the concerns raised about the Ninth Circuit \n     and determine whether the concerns are legitimate and whether \n     a change in the circuit's boundaries is the best method of \n     addressing them. I would be pleased to contribute one or more \n     representatives to assist with such a study.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pete Wilson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have indicated that Arthur Hellman, former \ndeputy executive director of the Hruska Commission, is opposed to the \nsplit. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter written to Senator Feinstein, dated December 5, 1995, from Prof. \nArthur Hellman, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, in \nopposition.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          University of Pittsburgh\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                 Pittsburgh, PA, December 5, 1995.\n     Re S. 956.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: You have asked whether dividing the \n     Ninth Circuit today would interfere with Congress's ability \n     to pursue more comprehensive appellate reform in the future. \n     Plainly, it would.\n       The Ninth Circuit's problems are problems that are shared, \n     in varying degrees and in differing manifestations, by all of \n     the circuits. As the American Bar Association's Standing \n     Committee on Federal Judicial Improvements emphasized in a \n     1989 report, ``the problems of the federal courts of appeals \n     . . . are problems of an entire system, which cannot be \n     solved by examining each component of the system in \n     isolation.''\n       In 1990, the Federal Courts Study Committee, which included \n     among its members Senators Heflin and Grassley, concluded \n     that the Federal appellate courts were already in a ``crisis \n     of volume.'' It anticipated that ``within as few as five \n     years the nation could have to decide whether or not to \n     abandon the present circuit structure in favor of an \n     alternative structure that might better organize the more \n     numerous appellate judges needed to grapple with a swollen \n     caseload.'' The Committee's report presented several \n     ``structural alternatives,'' but it did not endorse any of \n     them; instead, it called for ``further inquiry and \n     discussion.''\n       Dividing the Ninth Circuit today would significantly \n     interfere with Congress's ability to pursue the \n     reconsideration that the Study Committee urged. This is so \n     for three reasons.\n       First, if a Twelfth Circuit is established--whatever its \n     configuration--the effect will be create new structural \n     arrangements and institutionalize new modes of doing \n     business. These will soon take on a life of their own, \n     reinforcing the status quo and making comprehensive reform \n     more difficult.\n       Second, dividing the Ninth Circuit would set Congress on a \n     course that prefers circuit splitting to other, perhaps more \n     fruitful, measures for meeting the ``crisis'' of appellate \n     overload. Indeed, even today, the division of the Fifth \n     Circuit is being cited as a precedent for dividing the Ninth, \n     notwithstanding the many and significant differences between \n     the two situations.\n       Finally, to divide the Ninth Circuit now would be to lose \n     the full benefit of a vital experiment in judicial \n     administration. As noted above, the Federal Courts Study \n     Committee presented several models of appellate \n     reorganization, but it did not endorse any of them. That is \n     quite understandable. None of the models is very attractive; \n     all have serious drawbacks.\n       Over the last decade, the Ninth Circuit has undertaken a \n     remarkable range of innovations in an effort to determine \n     whether a large circuit can be made to work effectively. \n     Nothing could be more useful to Congress as it considers \n     systemic reform than to have the concrete empirical \n     information that the Ninth Circuit's experimentation will \n     provide.\n       Of course, it would be wrong to conduct an experiment if \n     the ``subjects''--here, the judges, lawyers, and citizens of \n     the Ninth Circuit--were being hurt. But the evidence is \n     overwhelming that they are not. For example, bar associations \n     in five Ninth Circuit states have spoken out on S. 956. All \n     have expressed opposition to the split. Other evidence is \n     presented in Chief Judge Wallace's statement at the September \n     hearing.\n       More than five years have passed since the Federal Courts \n     Study Committee issued its strong warning. Rather than divide \n     one circuit ad hoc, Congress should proceed systematically by \n     creating a new, focused commission to examine the problems of \n     the ``entire [appellate] system'' and make recommendations \n     that will serve the country for the long run.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Arthur D. Hellman,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also, I think we should look at how the \npress feels about this split throughout the Western part of the United \nStates.\n  I think it is fair to say that most all the press is opposed to the \nsplit. I say this, not based upon the newspapers being all of a liberal \npersuasion, because I think that, for example, if you take the Arizona \nRepublic, I think it has been accused of a lot of things, but certainly \nit does not have a liberal bias. They wrote in an editorial on November \n10, 1995, among other things:\n\n       The bill can best be described as a case of unwarranted \n     political meddling in the Federal judiciary . . . The bill is \n     a wolf in sheep's clothing. What it's really about is a \n     perceived liberal bias that comes from domination of the \n     district by--guess who?--California. The agenda of the bill's \n     backers is less geared toward the efficient administration of \n     justice than it is to isolate California.\n\n  It goes on to state what a bad idea it is to split this.\n  Mr. KYL. Would my friend yield for one quick question or comment on \nmy\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nbehalf in relation to what the Senator just said?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to doing that, I ask for the regular \norder. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The regular order is amendment \n3533 to amendment 3482, which is the first-degree amendment to 3466.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. The regular order having been \ncalled, it is my understanding that the ability to appeal the rule of \nthe Chair on germaneness is now not possible; relevancy is not \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Intervening business having taken place, the \nright of appeal has been lost.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend from Arizona, without losing \nmy right to the floor, for purposes of a question.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate my colleague yielding. I want to make it clear, \nsince you were quoting from my hometown newspaper editorializing \nagainst the bill, it was not the bill that is before us today.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that, I say to my friend from Arizona. I did \nnot know that.\n  Mr. KYL. That was the original bill as introduced that they were \nwriting about, not the amendment of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend very much.\n  Mr. President, we have editorials, as corrected, from the Arizona \nRepublic, from the San Francisco Chronicle, the Seattle Times, the Los \nAngeles Times--and not a western newspaper, of course--the New York \nTimes.\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to comment on some of the things \nthat have been said so far. I say to the Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein, and the Senator from Nevada, who has just been \nspeaking about their presentation, this is a rather complex issue. I \ncertainly would begin by noting this is a matter on which reasonable \npeople can differ.\n  In this case I do differ, but certainly the arguments they have made \nare legitimate points to debate. I would like to get on with that \nprospect right now. The Senator from Montana has revised the original \nversion of the bill as introduced, as I just pointed out to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, and has presented what I think now represents a division \nof the ninth circuit of appeals that would make a lot more sense than \nproposals that had earlier been made.\n  As the Senator from Montana knows, there have been numerous hearings \nand numerous substitutions as to how to divide the circuit, hearings \nbeing conducted almost every 5 years, 1984, 1990, 1995, not to mention \nthe hearing of the Hruska Commission back in 1993. I am sure the \nSenator from California winced a little bit when the Senator from \nNevada said that Hruska recommended dividing the State of California \ninto two parts.\n  In any event, to the first point. The Senator from Nevada said that \nthis would be a rather odd looking circuit, stretching from the tip of \nAlaska to the southern boundary of Arizona. I would note that that is \nexactly what the north and south boundaries of the ninth circuit today \nare. It stretches from the northern tip of Alaska to the southern \nboundary of Arizona.\n  This new circuit would be precisely the same. What it would not have \nis the extreme western part of the trust territories, the States of \nCalifornia and Hawaii. The States of Arizona and Alaska, those would be \nmade part of the new twelfth circuit. The remainder of the ninth would \nremain the same, but be part of the new twelfth circuit.\n  So it does not seem to me that represents some strange division, but \nrather a commonsense way of dividing the circuit in order to operate \nmore efficiently. What we are talking about is a caseload which would \nbe split roughly 60 to 40, with the States of California, Hawaii, and \nthe Trust Territories.\n  Mr. President, to show you how much the State of California dominates \nthe ninth circuit today, it dominates it by virtue of the fact that it \nhas by far and away the largest amount of the caseload and the largest \npopulation. The ninth circuit itself represents by far and away the \nlargest circuit in the country. It spans nine States and two \nterritories, covering 1.4 million square miles, serving the population \nof 45 million people. The next circuit in size by way of illustration \nis the sixth circuit, serving fewer than 29 million people. Every other \ncircuit serves fewer than 24 million.\n  Mr. President, the Census Bureau estimates by the year 2010 the \npopulation of the ninth circuit will be more than 63 million, a 40-\npercent increase. That is in just 15 years. Everyone who studies the \nissue understands that sooner or later that the size of the ninth \ncircuit will have to be dealt with.\n  As long ago as 1993 the Hruska Commission was suggesting a division \nof the circuit. In the ninth circuit there are 28 judgeships there \ntoday, and 13 active senior judges. The court has asked for 10 \nadditional judgeships, which would make 38 --excuse me--I think there \nare about 10 senior circuit judges right now. So in addition to the 28 \nexisting, and 13 senior judges, the court has asked for an additional \n10, which would put it close to the 50 mark in terms of the number of \njudges that would be deciding cases when those additional 10 are \ngranted.\n\n  As a result of the large number of judges in the circuit, there are \ndivisions within the circuit unlike other circuits. It is impossible \nfor all of the judges to know what each of the judges is deciding. It \nis also impossible for the court to sit en banc, as the Senator from \nNevada noted.\n  I will state from the beginning, that I think that the ninth circuit \nhas done a good job and the presiding judges of the ninth circuit have \ndone a good job under very difficult circumstances in managing the \ncaseload of the circuit. They have tried to institute efficiencies \nwhich have enabled it to do its job notwithstanding the huge amount of \narea and population under its jurisdiction and the large number of \ncases coming to it as a result. So my discussion of the court's \nhandling of its caseload is in no way meant to be a criticism, Mr. \nPresident. If anything I would take my hat off to the presiding judges, \nwho have done a good job under the circumstances. But facts are facts.\n  This is a circuit that has never been able to have an en banc hearing \nbecause the number of judges are simply too great. You do not have all \n26 judges or 28 judges sitting down at the same time to hear a decision \nor an argument based on a decision of the 3-judge panel, which is what \nthe courts ordinarily sit on.\n  As a result of the ninth circuit, you end up with 11-judge en banc \nhearings, unique among all of the other circuits. What that means is \nessentially by a luck of the draw, your decision is reviewed not by the \nentire circuit but by 11 judges in the circuit. I will come back to \nthat point in just a moment.\n  One of the questions about the splitting of the circuit is whether it \nwould make much of a difference. I think that depends on what you \ndefine the problem as. A part of the problem is the large caseload.\n  The Senator from Nevada makes the point that until we add more \njudges, we will not know whether that problem has been resolved. But \nthat is not the only problem, Mr. President. As a matter of fact, size \nitself is just part of the problem. As I noted, adding more judges \nmight help to resolve more cases, but it does not do anything about the \nproblems that are cropping up in this large circuit as a result of \njudges not being able to keep track of what each other are doing and \nwhat the various 3-judge panels are doing. This has created \nopportunities for intracircuit conflicts. It has also meant there are \nmore per curiam decisions. Judges usually write opinions. And an \naverage is more than a fourth of the cases result in opinions being \nwritten. In the ninth circuit, it is down to about 19 percent of the \ncases that actually have opinions written.\n  So with that low number of cases in which opinions are written, it is \ndifficult for the judges to keep up with the decisions that have been \nmade by the other three-judge panels, and it is not always the case \nthey can clearly follow or clearly determine the circuit's precedent \nhas been followed when cases are simply decided without the benefit of \nan opinion.\n  This is also rather maddening for the litigants and for the lawyers. \nIt is, I am sure, understandable that if litigants spend thousands of \ndollars to\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\ntake a case to the circuit and say, ``You win in the lower court and \ntake it on appeal to the ninth circuit,'' and they reverse without \nopinion--all they say is, ``The case is reversed.'' You do not know why \nthey reversed the case. It is more than maddening because you \nordinarily have to make decisions based on what the law is. If the \ncourt has not told you why it reversed, then you are not going to know \nwhat you have to do in the conduct of your business or other affairs to \ncomport with what the law theoretically is. It is difficult when you do \nnot have an opinion telling you what you should be doing. That is one \nof the problems that lawyers have told me has caused them to be unclear \nabout advice that they give their clients with respect to the question \nof whether or not to appeal in a case.\n  This is very difficult for clients because you may lose a case at the \nlower level and wonder whether you should expend the time, energy and \nmoney to take the case to the circuit court. If it is unclear what the \nlaw is going to be, it is kind of a crap shoot, to use the phrase that \na lawyer in Arizona used with me. He said, ``With so many judges, it is \na crap shoot as to what kind of a panel you get.'' In a circuit that \nhas six judges, as mentioned earlier, you have a pretty good idea of \nwho will be sitting on your panel or what its likely composition will \nbe. If you have a number of possibilities, as exists in this particular \ncircuit, you have no idea what the composition of the court is going to \nbe. There are 3,276 possible combinations of panels on this court--\n3,276. It is impossible for a litigant to have any idea who the judges \nwill be and, therefore, what to expect. Given the broad range of \nideology within this particular circuit, therefore, a lawyer hardly \nknows how to advise his clients.\n  Assume you have a decision from a three-judge panel. The question is, \ndo you try to take it en banc? But you have no idea who the 11 en banc \nwill be and whether it will be a fair reflection of the circuit. Since \nthere are not as many written decisions as there are in other circuits, \nyou also find it more difficult to follow the precedence of the court. \nIt is more difficult for lawyers to advise their clients on whether to \ntake an appeal or not in the ninth circuit than it is in most of the \nother circuits.\n  Much has been made, Mr. President, of the length of time that it \ntakes for a case to get to hearing, and the ninth circuit is the worst \nor second worst, depending on how you count in this regard. There has \nbeen a statistic cited, and I think cited by both the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from California, that suggests, actually this \ncourt is fairly quick. That is the time from the time the judges get \nthe case to the time their decision is published. That is the only area \nof the nine areas in which this circuit does particularly well.\n  There is a reason for that: They do not write as many opinions. It is \nfairly easy once you decide the case to notify the litigants of the \ndecision if you do not have to write an opinion expressing your view. I \nsuspect that is the reason why that particular statistic is one in \nwhich the ninth circuit looks good. Otherwise, the ninth circuit is the \nslowest from filing of the last brief to the hearing or submission of a \ncase. It takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal compared to \nthe national median time. It is over 14.3 months, as I understand.\n\n  In the other indicia of speed, the court does not fare well compared \nto the other circuits. That is something that more judges would do \nsomething about. You have to wonder how many judges in number you get \nto for the court still to function adequately. At the hearing we held a \nfew months ago on the subject, judges from the nine-county circuit were \nasked that question, and they acknowledged there was a point at which, \nobviously, the court would have too many judges. It would be too big \nand have to be split. There was disagreement, as you might imagine, on \nexactly what the appropriate number is.\n  I mentioned the fact that there is inconsistency between the panels, \nwhich results from the fact that there are so many different possible \ncombinations in the ninth circuit. That is the thing that worries the \nattorneys for the litigants so much.\n  I also think it is instructive, Mr. President, to determine how the \nSupreme Court has dealt with the opinions from the lower circuits, from \nthe circuit courts in the lower courts. It may be some evidence of a \ncourt that is overburdened that it is reversed frequently, and in this \nregard it is interesting that the ninth circuit has one of highest \nreversible rates of any of the circuits. For example, last year in the \ncases that the U.S. Supreme Court decided in the term ending June 29, \n1995, according to the Court's records, 82 percent of the ninth circuit \ncases heard by the Court were reversed--82 percent. That is not a very \ngood standard of success, I suggest, Mr. President.\n  Now, lest people jump to the conclusion that this means that the \nninth circuit cannot get it right 82 percent of the time, let me hasten \nto note that this is of the cases that the Court takes. By definition, \nthe cases that the U.S. Supreme Court takes on review are the more \ndifficult, the more controversial cases. So we should not believe that \nbeing wrong 82 percent of the time represents the full caseload of the \ncourt. That is not the case. We are talking about the number of cases \nthat the court has been reversed in by the U.S. Supreme Court, of those \ncases taken by the Supreme Court. Again, by definition, those are going \nto be the more difficult cases. Still, being reversed 82 percent of the \ntime is not a particularly good record.\n\n  I suggest that an article recently appearing in the Wall Street \nJournal may indicate a reason why this is so. It may be that some \nmembers of some of the courts do not have the high regard for precedent \nthat we would like to see in our circuit court judges. It may also be, \nas I noted, that this court simply is particularly burdened.\n  Just a few day ago, last Friday, March 15, the Wall Street Journal \ncarried an article I found fascinating but also very troubling. The \nheadline of the story is, ``Bench Pressure: Federal Appeals Judge \nEmbraces Liberalism in Conservative Times,'' and a subheading, ``Ninth \nCircuit's Reinhardt Discovers New Rights That Appeal to the Left.''\n  The story, written by Paul Barrett of the Wall Street Journal, \ndiscusses a most recent ruling in which Judge Reinhardt was the author \nof a lengthy opinion, according to the Wall Street Journal, announcing \nthat the terminally ill now have a right to die with the help of a \ndoctor. According to the Wall Street Journal, ``The mammoth 109-page \nruling struck down a Washington State ban on assisted suicide--the \nfirst such action by a Federal appeals court.''\n  They quote the author of the opinion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt, as \nsaying, ``I think this may be my best ever.'' The article goes on to \ndiscuss the record and career of this very bright, very intellectual \nand, according to the article, very liberal lawyer-judge, who the \narticle says is widely respected by friend and foe as a crafty advocate \nfor his left-leaning views.\n  Mr. President, I do not know Judge Reinhardt or the degree to which \nhis views may inform his decisions, but one indication that the ninth \ncircuit might be overruled as often as it is could be reflected in the \nreported comments of Judge Reinhardt about the current U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and suggests that there is perhaps not enough respect for the \nprecedent coming from the U.S. Supreme Court. Remember, Mr. President, \nthat the judges on the circuit courts are supposed to be not making new \nlaw but simply applying the precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  According to this article, after discussing the fact that Judge \nReinhardt has been somewhat criticized by some of his opinions, he says \nit has happened many times that he has been reversed by the Supreme \nCourt, and then is quoted as saying, ``There's nothing I can do if that \ncourt is run by reactionaries.'' ``There's nothing I can do if that \ncourt''--meaning the U.S. Supreme Court--``is run by reactionaries.''\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that Judge Reinhardt was kidding if he is \nsuggesting that the U.S. Supreme Court is run by a bunch of \nreactionaries because those who have defended the current composition \nof the ninth circuit have correctly said that the circuit courts should \nnot reflect the attitude of just their own area. That is not really how \ncircuit judges should be selected because, after all, they are not \nsupposed\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\nto declare the law just for their area; they are supposed to be \ndeclaring the law of the United States as enunciated by the precedence \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, the Constitution of the United States, and \nthe laws of the United States. Those are not defined by any kind of \nregionalism. So they correctly note that the judges are supposed to be \ndeclaring the law, informed by those three sources.\n  Yet, here is a judge who at least is quoted in the Wall Street \nJournal last Friday as apparently referring to the current members of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court as ``a bunch of reactionaries.'' As I said, I \nhope he was kidding. It is probably not a very judicious thing for him \nto have said, and I hope that, in retrospect, he will reflect upon that \nand perhaps pronounce himself chagrined that that perhaps off-the-cuff \ncomment found its way into print. I hope that will be his reaction.\n  But, as I said, it might illustrate why this circuit has been \nreversed as many times as it has been. There are stories, which I \ncannot confirm, that many of the opinions from this particular judge in \nthis particular court are in some sense red-flagged for their review. \nThe high percentage of cases reversed from the ninth circuit may \nsuggest that that is true, and we may have a suggestion of why that is \nso.\n  Now, that does not suggest that the answer to this is the split in \nthe circuit. I do not make that claim here. But I do find it \ninteresting that the opinion written by Judge Reinhardt in this \nparticular matter, this right-to-die case, was written for an en banc \npanel which was hardly representative of the court as a whole--which \nillustrates the problem with an en banc hearing of less than the entire \nmembership of the court--unique to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nand only the case because the court is too big to have all of the \njudges sitting by themselves.\n  The calculations have been done here, and what we find is that in \nthis particular decision, the limited en banc panel was comprised of \nsix Democratic appointees and five Republican appointees. The ninth \ncircuit has 15 Republican appointees and 9 Democrat appointees. So the \nlimited en banc panel in the right-to-die case had 5 of the 15 \nRepublican appointees and 6 of the 9 Democratic appointees.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that being appointed by a \nDemocrat or a Republican President will dictate how you decide a case \neither. But I do suggest that of all of the indicators of how a case \nmight be decided--the State from which a judge comes, the age of the \njudge, the sex of the judge, the race of the judge, the color of hair \nof the judge, or whatever criteria you may want to look at--the party \nof the President appointing the judge probably has more to do with the \ndecisions of that judge, day in and day out, than any other single \nfactor.\n  Therefore, it is not irrelevant to look, in this particular case, at \nthe political composition of the panel. Again, I am not suggesting that \nthat is what caused the decision in this case. But it is a most \ncontroversial decision, the first of its kind ever, and, I suspect, the \nkind of case the Supreme Court will want to take a look at.\n\n  My point in all of this, Mr. President, is that a court that gets so \nbig that you cannot even have an en banc hearing of all of the judges, \nwhich can result in a skewed composition of en banc panels, can result \nin skewed decisions, can result in overruling in many, many cases. That \nis what we have found with respect to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. So it is not just the fact that we have not given them the 10 \nadditional judges they want that creates a problem with a court of this \nsize.\n  Let me dispel some of the other notions that have crept into this \ndebate so far. One is that this is going to be costly. I find it \ninteresting that a Congress that frequently spends money like it is \ngoing out of style is suddenly concerned about cost. But let us put \nthat in perspective. Justice, of course, should be one of the highest \npriorities of this Congress. I, for one, Mr. President, do not want to \nskimp when it comes to providing for justice. I have voted against a \nlot of appropriations bills since I have been in the Congress, but I \ncannot recall a bill that I voted against that funded the judiciary. I \nbelieve strongly in enforcing the laws of our country and ensuring the \njudiciary has what it needs.\n  The cost of this particular bill, according to the General Accounting \nOffice, for the construction of the new offices that would be \nnecessary, is $18 million--$18.1 million to be precise. That is just \n0.68 percent, which is less than 1 percent, slightly over half of 1 \npercent of the annual budget of the judiciary last year, about $2.5 \nbillion. Next year, we are looking at $3.1 billion. So in the year it \nwill occur, it will be much less than 1 percent of the budget. There \nwould be a small start-up cost of about $3 million, but that would be a \none-time-only cost.\n  It has been noted that the chambers in San Francisco and Pasadena \nhave recently been renovated and that they could accommodate more \njudges. The fact is that judges of the ninth circuit today sit in, have \nchambers in, and argue cases throughout the circuit--in Phoenix, in San \nFrancisco, in Pasadena, in Portland, in Seattle. That is the way it is \ndone today. I think it would be nice if the judges moved to the site of \nthe headquarters of the circuit and sat there and had their chambers \nthere, but they fly around the country today. That is why you only have \n5 chambers in San Francisco, even though it is the headquarters of the \ncircuit with 28 sitting judges, with 10 more requested. In addition, \nthere are eight offices in Pasadena, the other place of primary \nheadquarters of the circuit.\n  So you have a situation that could accommodate additional judges as \nthey are appointed, and, certainly, at least half of the 10 judges that \nhave been requested would have to be assigned to California. Apparently \nthe headquarters there could accommodate those judges.\n  It is also noted that the bar associations of most of the States, and \nthe Federal Bar Association itself, oppose the split of the circuit. \nThat is not surprising, although I note that in my State of Arizona, \nthere is very definitely a split. The so-called organized bar, the \npolitical organization, has written a letter in opposition. Of the \nlawyers and judges I have talked to, I find a real split, depending \nupon their point of view. I do not want to suggest that we should, \nhowever, simply follow the advice of the lawyers and the States on \nthis. While I have not taken a poll of all of the lawyers in Arizona--\nfor my sake anyway--I do not think that would be the determining \nfactor, in my view. I understand the point others have made that bar \nassociations may oppose it. I do not find that to be a persuasive \nreason to not support the amendment of the Senator from Montana.\n\n  Another question is that Phoenix is kind of out of the way. Those of \nus in Phoenix do not really think that. In any event, it is about $38 \nor $39 to fly from Las Vegas, NV, to Phoenix, the home of my colleague \nfrom Nevada. It is pretty cheap on at least three or four of the \nairlines to get to Phoenix. It does not take very long at all. The \npoint here, I think, is missed, and that is that cases are argued \nthroughout the circuit. That would remain the case whether the circuit \nis split or not.\n  It is also the case that the law would remain the same. I think the \nSenator from Nevada made a good point in noting that his own State did \nnot have a law school and that many of the lawyers there are educated \nin California. It is important that the law remain the same. It should \nbe noted here that when the fifth circuit was divided into the fifth \nand eleventh circuits, they made the decision, correctly, to keep the \nlaw of the previous circuit. That has been done. Our hearing indicated, \nand people who testified at our hearing indicated, that it worked very \nwell. Of course, that is the way it would be done here, as well. We \nwould not have to dictate that result. The judges on the circuit \nthemselves would correctly make the decision as a result, even though \nthe court would be split into two parts. The law that had been built up \nfrom the ninth circuit would, of course, continue to be the law \ngoverning the new twelfth circuit as well. That should not be a factor.\n  Mr. President, there are several other things I think we can say \nabout this. But let me simply conclude with this point. This is not \njudicial gerrymandering, because the amendment of the Senator from \nMontana would result in a division that just about evenly divides the \njudges on the court, and they could go wherever they wanted to\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nbetween the ninth circuit and the twelfth circuit. If you go by their \nState of origin, presumably half would go to California and the other \nhalf would remain or would go to the twelfth circuit in the States from \nwhich they come.\n  So you would have a division geographically that is almost identical \nto the division that you had today. And, by the way, for those who are \ninterested, the division politically would be almost identical as well. \nSo both circuits would end up with just as many Republicans and \nDemocrats and percentage as the court today has. And, in any event, as \nI said, this is not an effort to put all of the conservatives in one \ncourt and all of the liberals in another. I think that is illustrated \nby the fact that perhaps at least from public accounts one of the most \nconservative leaders on the ninth circuit and one of the most liberal \nleaders on the ninth circuit would both remain in California under the \ndivisions imposed here.\n  So there is not an effort at judicial gerrymandering. It is an effort \nto do finally what countless studies have suggested; that is, sooner or \nlater this circuit is going to have to be divided--going back well over \n20 years. I suppose we could have another study, and I am sure it would \nbe informative. But I question whether the Senate and the House would \nact on the study--at least would any time soon. And, therefore, at \nleast this legislation is an attempt to get the ball rolling and make \nsomething happen so we do not continue to have the circumstance we have \ntoday.\n  A study, by the way, is also I think prone to the same kind of thing \nthat has occurred in the past where you have people doing the studying \nthemselves. I would suggest that, if there is going to be a study, it \nshould not be done by the very people who are involved; that is to say, \nthe judges on the ninth circuit. There is a certain incestuousness that \ndevelops over time and a desire to do it the way we have been doing it, \nand liking the way it is done. It seems to me, if there is going to be \na fresh look at this, it ought to be done by people who can with some \nexpertise view the situation from some distance as well as relying upon \nthe expertise of those who are on the inside.\n  I think also that it should be composed of people who are not just \nthe judges by also litigants, members of the bar who practice before \nthe circuit, and perhaps people who have other expertise to bring to \nbear.\n  But in the end, as the Constitution requires, it is the U.S. Congress \nthat has the responsibility here to decide on the composition of the \nso-called lower courts. So it is our responsibility to make this \ndecision, Mr. President.\n  I simply want to conclude by complimenting the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, and also the Senator from Montana, Senator \nBurns, for bringing this matter to the attention of the Congress, and \nfor getting the bill through the Judiciary Committee. I urge our \ncolleagues to review the report of the committee. It is a good report, \na good description of the issue I think, and they can all benefit by \nreading that report and then determine whether additional study is \nnecessary, or whether it is time to take action now.\n  I hope that in the comments that I have made I have made two or three \nthings clear. No. 1, that I am not criticizing the court or its \nadministration. As I said about four times, it has done admirably well \nunder the circumstances. The circumstances are what bring the \ndifficulty. I am suggesting that adding more judges is not just the \nanswer to this problem. So we should not think that simply funding more \njudges will solve the problem here.\n  The problem here is the point at which any circuit becomes too large \nto function in the way intended. Virtually everybody who has talked \nabout this--opponents and proponents alike--agree that there is a point \nbeyond which the court is too large. Many have determined that that \npoint has now been reached. Others think it is around the corner a bit. \nBut in any event, we all understand that that is a problem which this \nCongress has to address. So whether it is done by this legislation, or \nwhether it is done by a committee, clearly one of the probable \nrecommendations has to be a division.\n\n  And the third and final point is that of all of the ways that have \nbeen considered to divide the court--dividing California in the middle, \ncutting off Arizona and sending it to the tenth circuit, allowing \nNevada, California, Hawaii, and the trust territories, and perhaps \nothers to constitute another circuit--a lot of different iterations \nhave been proposed. The only one that has made sense to the people with \nwhom I have discussed the issue in Arizona--judges, lawyers, and \nlitigants--is the proposal that the Senator from Montana has presented \nto us today. And it is, therefore, that proposal and only that proposal \nwhich I am willing to support, and urge my colleagues, therefore, to \nconsider that proposal as really the only viable alternative to the \nsituation that we have today.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3533\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President I would like to take a moment to outline what \nthe increases for EPA are in the Bond-Mikulski amendment which we will \nbe voting on tomorrow. The amendment is a complete substitute for the \npending Lautenberg amendment.\n  First, the amendment takes the $162 million of EPA addbacks included \nin title IV of the bill, removes their contingency status, and finds \noffsets for them. These four provisions are:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nSafe drinking water State revolving fund.............................50\nClean Water State revolving fund.....................................50\nEPA buildings and facilities.........................................50\nProgram & Management.................................................12\n\n  Second, the amendment then provides another $325 million for EPA in \nthe following manner, also fully offset:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nSafe Drinking water State revolving fund............................125\nClean water State revolving fund.....................................75\nSuperfund............................................................50\nOperating programs...................................................75\n\n  Thus the total new noncontingent funding for EPA is $487 million--all \nnow fully offset. The amendment attempts to continue our ongoing \nefforts to force the EPA to set priorities and to spend their resources \nin areas of greatest need. In particular--the unfunded mandates that \nthe State revolving funds are designed to address.\n  In the Bond-Mikulski amendment, of the additional $487 million, the \ntwo State revolving funds receive $300 million; Superfund is given $50 \nmillion; program management $87 million, and building and facilities \nthe remaining $50 million.\n  I believe this is a fair compromise and should be supported.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we are in the process of trying to clear \nsome other amendments which we have--11 amendments that we had \nclearance at one time, or agreement--and other intervening actions have \nnow made it impossible to adopt those amendments at this moment.\n  Mr. President, I also indicate that we were here 3 hours today \nwaiting for amendments, as we were most of Friday. I am very grateful \nto the Senators who have just completed the colloquy on this ninth \ncircuit subject for at least bringing up one of our amendments. Very \nfrankly, I have more important business pending in my office than I \nhave waiting for Senators to appear on the floor and offer their \namendments.\n  I have to also say, again in the context as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, that we are expected to create miracles \naround here by completing this omnibus package, going to conference \nwith the House of Representatives, getting that resolved, and getting \nthe conference reports adopted before midnight Friday this week. I am \nnot a miracle person. I cannot commit miracles. Others in history have. \nBut I am not such a person.\n  Also I note that the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Idaho, \nand myself as western Senators--and the Senator from Nevada--four \nwestern Senators find it increasingly difficult due to the plane \nschedules to get out to the West and back. And we all would like a 3-\nday workweek in order to do that. But we are here to do business. And I \nwould be highly tempted to do a bedcheck vote right now of how many \nSenators are in town to do business.\n  So I think it is imposing upon our time, and it is imposing upon the \ntime of the requirements with the conference of the House. Therefore, \nit is an imposition on the House as well for us to then say everybody \ncomes back to Washington and they will come running in here with their \namendments on Tuesday, and they have to all be acted upon by a certain \ntime on Tuesday. I\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\ncan see it now. They will come to Senator Byrd and myself where they do \nnot have time to debate their amendments, or get them acted upon, and \nthey will say, ``Include my amendment in the managers' package.''\n  I am going to look with great reservation on such requests because \nthat is not again the procedure by which we should enact some of these \nvery important amendments or dispose of them.\n  I stood here before with such pleas to my colleagues. Maybe I could \nget a going away present and have them all come immediately and we will \ncomplete this bill this afternoon because this is my last year to stand \nhere and manage an appropriations bill. But having been gentle in my \nremarks in so urging our colleagues, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 3499, 3510, 3518, 3529, 3549, and 3550, En Bloc, to \n                           Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have a group of amendments that have \nbeen cleared that I now send to the desk. I ask unanimous consent that \nthey be considered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I emphasize, Mr. President, that these are six amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment to \nchange the name of the Walla Walla Veterans Medical Center in Walla \nWalla, WA, to the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Center.\n  General Wainwright was born at Fort Walla Walla and was a member of \nthe 1st Cavalry after graduating from West Point. He served in France \nduring World War I and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in \n1945 by President Truman for his service in World War II. He spent \nnearly 4 years in a prisoner of war camp in the Philippines and was \nknown as the Hero of Bataan and Corregidor. General Wainwright was a \ntrue war hero and won the praise and respect of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, the people of Walla Walla, WA, want this name change \nto honor a war veteran and local hero. In May, they are dedicating a \nstatue in his honor and would like to dedicate the name change of the \nhospital at the same time. The entire Washington State congressional \ndelegation supports this change. And all of the veterans service \norganizations in Washington State support the change.\n  I urge my colleagues to support changing the name of the Walla Walla \nVeterans Medical Center to the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA \nMedical Center, and to allow this war hero the recognition he so \nrightly deserves.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in regard to the matter \nunder consideration, the appropriations bill, that this body is \nconsidering, and I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The situation we debate today concerning our inability \nas an institution to control spending is not a situation about \nallocating spending or the responsibility to pay for spending from one \ngroup in our society or culture to another. We are not talking about \nwhether the rich should pay for the spending or the poor should pay for \nthe spending. All too frequently, we find ourselves talking about the \ndisplacement of the costs which we incur from our current culture to \nthe culture of the future, to the next generation.\n  We literally, in so many cases, find ourselves debating about the \nexpenditure of the earnings of the next generation, because when we go \ninto debt, we break our responsibility to pay for that which we \nconsume. When we go into debt, we really ask the next generation to \npick up the tab.\n  No family in America finds its children encumbered by the debts of \ntheir parents. That is against the rules in our society. No parent, no \nmatter how irresponsible the parent is, can cause an enforceable \nobligation to fall upon the children. We just say that is \ninappropriate. However, when it comes to us collectively as a group of \nindividuals, we can spend as recklessly, apparently, as we like and \ncause the greatest of debts to fall upon the next generation.\n  I find that to be unwise and counterproductive, because it means that \ninstead of leaving them with assets, we are leaving the children with \ndebts. That is very bad for the future of the country. I find it to be \nimmoral to spend the money and resources of the next generation without \nthe consent of the next generation.\n  We have tried over and over again as a body here in the U.S. Senate \nto deal with this problem of recurring debt. We had the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings Act, the Gramm-Rudman Act II, then we had the budget deals of \n1990 and 1993. We have not been able to get one Senate to bind the next \nSenate successfully with discipline.\n  As a matter of fact, this past year we had a substantial debate about \nwhether or not we should have a balanced budget amendment. The occupier \nof the chair and I firmly agree we need a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution to bind, not only ourselves, but future Senates to the \ndiscipline of paying for that which we consume.\n  Unfortunately, there are enough Members of this body who resist that, \nsaying that we should not bind future Senates, that we should not bind \nfuture Congresses to live with the discipline of paying for that which \nis consumed. Equally unfortunate, as a matter of fact more \nunfortunately, is the willingness of those same people to bind future \ngenerations to debt.\n  So what we have is a Congress unwilling to bind itself to discipline \nbut which finds itself more than willing to bind the next generation in \ndebt. It is a kind of bondage which will restrain the next generation \nsubstantially in the way it consumes its resources and the way it \nallocates what spending it ought to have the right to allocate.\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n The next generation will end up allocating that spending to the \npayment of our debts.\n  It appears from this debate that we are not even able to successfully \nbind this Senate to the limits it set for itself. Every year the Senate \npasses a budget resolution to cap our spending. We passed a budget \nreconciliation act, the so-called Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1995.\n  That act would have saved enough money by slowing the increase of \nspending in Government to have enabled us to reach a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002, if the President had not vetoed it. We all know what \nhappened. President Clinton, after alleging compellingly and \nconsistently his desire for a balanced budget, had the opportunity, the \nfirst opportunity in a quarter century to sign one, and he vetoed it.\n  As introduced, the omnibus appropriations bill might have allowed us \nto achieve the first-year target for reducing the deficit set up by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, but it did not achieve that by reducing \nthe rate of Federal spending as we had intended.\n  Instead, this pending bill, it is my understanding, increases the \nrate of spending by displacing some of the overall savings which we had \nhoped to achieve over the next 7 years under the Balanced Budget Act. \nThat means we will no longer be able to count on these funds which were \ngathered from outyears, stolen, or taken from outyears, to help balance \nthe budget over the next 7 years.\n  This malady, or this pathology, this consistent way of doing business \nis not a stranger to the Congress, which has always been gathering to \nitself spending, deferring from itself savings, and displacing from \nitself the payment of its responsibility.\n  If that were not bad enough, look at what is happening now. I think \nit is time that we need to stand firm. It is time to prioritize \nprograms, and it is time to make tough choices, protect at least our \ndeficit target if not the target for slowing spending. We are somehow \nexperiencing in this body a collapse of will. We cannot allow that to \nhappen.\n  Each time we add more spending to this bill, we push ourselves \nfurther away from achieving a balanced budget that we had hoped to \nachieve under the Balanced Budget Act. We are throwing away the savings \nfrom slower spending which we had worked so hard to achieve and we cast \nvotes to achieve last year.\n  We should not be spending more of the taxpayers' money that is \nincluded in this bill. We should be spending less. Are the spending \nlimits really so onerous, are they so draconian, are these limits so \noppressive when this bill includes a couple hundred thousand dollars \nfor the expenses of the Commission for the Preservation of America's \nHeritage Abroad? Are these spending limits that we need to impose \nreally onerous in this bill when they provide for hundreds of thousands \nof dollars for the purchase of passenger cars for the International \nTrade Administration bureaucrats abroad at $30,000 per vehicle \ndesignation, as though that is an exercise in fiscal restraint?\n  During the first session of this Congress, in the deliberations \nconcerning the adoption of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, we frequently heard that there was no need for us to \namend the Constitution. Why amend the Constitution when we, as \nreasonable individuals sent here by voters who want a balanced budget, \nwhen we can exercise the restraint, it was said, in order to balance \nthe budget, in order to provide a stable fiscal therapy for the next \ngeneration instead of a malady for the next generation?\n  Let us just do the right thing. We do not have to have a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, we were told; there is authority \nfor the U.S. Congress to do what is right and to be able to live within \nour means and that we should do so immediately.\n  Frankly, it is not such authority that this Congress lacks. We do \nhave the authority. The truth of the matter is that we lack the \ndiscipline. We have not had the will, we have not had the courage. I \nsee it eroding as we amend this bill over and over to add spending, and \nwe do it from savings from the years in which we would need to exercise \nrestraint in order to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Money was and is the source of Government's basic power. The tale of \nhistory bears out this truth undeniably. The Magna Carta prescribed \nthat the king could not impose taxes except through the consent of the \nGreat Council. Charles I was executed because he tried to govern \nwithout seeking the consent of Parliament in spending public money. Let \nus not forget that the American Revolution itself was rooted in the \nrelationship between taxation and representation. Very frankly, the \ntaxes we are spending now are the taxes of the next generation, and \nthey are not represented in this Chamber.\n  Congress today does not have to vote to raise more revenue in order \nto spend more money. Unfortunately, our legislature takes the debtor's \npath of spend and beg, spend and plead, spend and borrow, and borrow \nagainst the future of the young people of America. Our current system \nof government lets the Government spend on credit and sign the next \ngeneration's name to the dotted line. When their credit card becomes \ndue, it is the American people who are confronted with the dilemma. \nThey can either send more money to Washington to pay the bill or \ndefault on the debt incurred in their name.\n  When the American people expressed the belief that Government is out \nof control, as they did in the November election of 1994, they indeed \nwere correct. For too long we have been out of control. This body has \nassembled to satisfy the appetites of narrow interests at the public's \nexpense. Protracted deficit spending empowers the central Government \nwith the means to undermine our basic liberties. The American people \nare understandably fed up with the Congress that spends the yet \nunearned wages of the next generation.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is not only a threat to our own \nprosperity here and now, but it undermines and threatens substantially \nour children's future. It is the method by which Washington's imperial \nelite has circumvented the public, the law, and the Constitution. \nDeficit spending allows beltway barons to run this country without \nregard for the people.\n  Whether it is pork projects or political payoffs, the Washington \nelite know how to play the game. The playing of the game must end. We \nmust develop the will, the intensity, and the capacity to enact a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, as a freshman Senator, I may have not yet mastered the \nrules of the Senate budget process to the same extent as many of my \nlearned colleagues, but as a former Governor who balanced budgets on a \nregular basis without raising taxes, I have more experience than most \nin this Chamber at achieving a balanced budget.\n  Something is wrong with the system when an amendment which increases \nspending by $3.1 billion can be brought forward for a vote while an \namendment proposed by the junior Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, \nto put the savings that we achieve into a deficit lockbox instead of \nspending it on other programs, is deemed to be a violation of the \nBudget Act. It is time for us to have our House in order. It is time \nfor us to have an order which allows us to be orderly in this House.\n  A good friend of mine says something which is undeniably true: Your \nsystem is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. It may \nnot be what you are wanting or intending, but the system is giving you \nwhat you are getting, and it is perfectly designed to do it or you \nwould not be getting that result.\n  What have we been getting? Instead of discipline, we have been \ngetting debt; instead of a restrained Government, we have been getting \nan intrusive Government. These are not outcomes that are lauded by \nanyone. We all know that these are outcomes which threaten not only our \nown existence, but they threaten the next generation's ability free \npeople. If we do not like the outcome, if we do not like what we are \ngetting from the system, it is time to change the system.\n  I think it is time for us to consider the kind of remedy which has \nbeen brought forward by the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from \nArizona, together, in the lockbox provision. If we do not like what we \nare getting--debt--and we need and want discipline, we should change \nour structure in favor of discipline, rather than a\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nstructure which favors debt and is prejudiced toward debt, being \ninstitutionalized and solidified over and over again.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak. \nI want to say that because I believe this omnibus appropriations bill \nwhich is now before the Senate will impair our ability to reach a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, I intend to vote against it. I intend \nto vote against it because I want to vote in favor of the next \ngeneration and their capacity to allocate their own resources. I want \nto vote in favor of discipline and against debt. I want us to have not \nonly the ability to put our House in order, I would like to have us \nenjoy the structure which would require us to keep our House in order.\n  I hope that other Members of this body will similarly review the \nevidence as I have and come to a similar conclusion; a conclusion that \nit is not time for us to additionally burden the next generation, but \nto exercise the kind of restraint and discipline which will provide for \nthem investment and opportunity, rather than debt.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2219-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING JEAN SCHRAG LAUVER\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I come to the floor in what you \nmight call a bittersweet mood, and that is to announce to my colleagues \nthe retirement of one of our most trusted Senate advisers, Ms. Jean \nLauver, who has served on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfor over 21 years.\n  Together with Senator Baucus, the ranking Democrat, and the entire \nmembership of the committee, I send a resolution to the desk to express \nthe gratitude of the committee and of the Senate to Jean Lauver for her \nyears of service to the U.S. Senate, and will later ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, Jean was born on a farm in Sioux Falls, SD, and \ngraduated from Goshen College in Indiana and later received a master's \ndegree in education from George Washington University. After serving as \na school teacher in Puerto Rico, Jean joined the Environment Committee \nstaff in 1974. Jean has been with us ever since.\n\n  Anyone who knows her also knows that she is the undisputed expert in \nthe Senate on Federal highway issues. Jean and the committee have been \nthrough scores of pieces of legislation over the past many years. There \nhave been some great successes: The Surface Transportation Act of 1987, \nthe so-called ISTEA bill of 1991, just to name two. There have been \nscores of tough battles, as well, on transportation safety issues, \ndemonstration projects, and billboards on our highways and byways. Over \nthe years, I have no doubt Jean has seen it all.\n  Yet, after all the hearings and all the bills, the meetings in room \n468 Dirksen and S-211 of the Capitol, what we will all remember most \nabout Jean is her unflappable professionalism, her extraordinary \nknowledge and memory, and her dedication to doing a good job for \nRepublicans and for Democrats alike.\n  Without question, Jean is one of the most extraordinary staffers that \nI have had the pleasure to work with. So it is with great admiration \nthat we wish Jean and her husband, Hesston, and their son, Jason, all \nthe best in their future endeavors. I might add that Jean and her \nfamily are off to a new challenge, and that is owning and operating a \nbed and breakfast in Goshen, IN. If Jean's service to the Senate is any \nindication, you can be sure that the Prairie Manner B in Goshen will \nbe top notch. I am tempted to give a telephone number of the new B, \nbut that might be considered advertisement. For anybody that is \ninterested, I have her telephone number for the B they are \nestablishing called the Prairie Manner in Goshen, IN.\n  I know all Senators join with me in wishing Jean good luck and \nthanking her for her dedicated service to the Senate and this Nation of \nours. Jean, we say thank you.\n  I urge the adoption of the resolution, and I ask unanimous consent \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated, beginning in \n     fiscal year 1997, such sums as necessary to carry out the \n     purposes of this subtitle.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have already debated the merits of the \nsecond-degree amendment, which establishes the commission to study the \nreorganization or the probable reorganization of the courts of appeals \nacross this Nation. But the real emphasis should be placed upon the \nfirst-degree amendment, which actually has something to do with the \nrestructuring of the ninth judicial circuit. We have already debated \nthe issue. Those who are opposed to the issue made their points, and \nmade them very well. But I think the most compelling reasons why we \nshould do this is that it is just a big, big circuit.\n  Under this proposal--that is, the first degree--to split the ninth \ncircuit, California, Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands \nwould form one 15-judge unit. That would be the ninth circuit. Alaska, \nArizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington would form the \nnew twelfth circuit of 13 judges. The caseload would be split, and the \nheavy end of it would still be with the California, Hawaii, or the old \nninth. They would still, under today's procedures, have 60 percent of \nthe caseload, while 40 percent would go into the new twelfth circuit.\n  The reasons are as compelling for those States that would remain in \nthe ninth after the newly formed twelfth went into full operation.\n  The circuit is just too big--9 States, 1.4 million square miles, 45 \nmillion people. It is, by far, the largest circuit of all of the 11. By \ncomparison, the sixth serves less than 29 million people, and every \nother circuit serves less than 24 million people. So, basically, this \nis the right thing to do.\n  The commission, too, should move forward and get their work done, as \nfar as the rest of the country. We have had studies and we have had \nrecommendations, and now it is time to start the wheels in motion.\n  Mr. President, we have already debated this. I have already made the \npoints. I think they are very convincing on why we should do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the first-\ndegree amendment is not relevant and should not be in order in the \nunanimous-consent agreement that is now on the Senate's calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and call \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the vote will be put off \nuntil tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have debated this issue at some length \nand because of a parliamentary situation that occurred earlier, the \nvote was not taken.\n  Mr. President, we are on very dangerous ground procedurally here. I \nsay to my colleagues, the reason we enter into unanimous-consent \nagreements--we, the minority--is so that we can proceed with business \nin the Senate. Virtually everything that is done in the U.S. Senate is \ndone by a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  This very important legislation that we are going to complete \ntomorrow, with its many amendments, is going to be completed by virtue \nof the fact that a unanimous-consent agreement was arrived at between \nthe minority and majority.\n  Always in unanimous-consent agreements--I should say with rare \nexception--there are amendments that are saved. The Senator from \nMinnesota, or the Senator from Montana, or the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, or the Senator from Nevada may feel that it is a complicated \nissue, and we might want to reserve an amendment. In order to get the \nunanimous-consent agreement adopted, we save what is called a relevant \namendment. That says it all--a relevant amendment.\n  The Parliamentarian of the U.S. Senate has ruled in this instance \nthat the amendment offered by my friend from Montana is not relevant. \nTherefore, it would set an extremely dangerous precedent if the Senate \nwould overrule the Parliamentarian of the Senate. The Parliamentarian \nhas a tremendous obligation to be fair and impartial and to rule by \nvirtue of the Senate precedence and traditions in the Senate. I believe \nthe Parliamentarian has clearly ruled in the right manner in this \ninstance.\n  Now, the reason I lay this foundation is that, if tomorrow, by virtue \nof partisan vote, the Parliamentarian is overruled, we would never, \never--the minority would never enter into another unanimous-consent \nrequest. Why? Because we would be put on notice that any unanimous-\nconsent agreement would not be subject to relevancy. Why would we enter \ninto an agreement to that effect? Any amendment, no matter what the \nsubject, could be brought and be in order. I think that is wrong.\n  I advise my colleagues, both in the majority and in the minority--\nespecially the majority party--that they should vote to sustain the \nParliamentarian. Why? Because if we do not, it is going to be a long \ntime before there is another unanimous-consent agreement adopted \nbecause we could not enter into one. How could we? It would mean that \nno matter what we agreed to, it could be changed by a simple majority. \nThat is not the way it should be. We lose our rights under the\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nSenate to protect ourselves with a filibuster, where it would take 60 \nvotes, or in a number of other parliamentary points that we reserve to \nourselves when there is not a unanimous-consent agreement that is \npending.\n\n  This amendment offered by my friend from Montana, which has been \nruled not relevant, would clearly be one of those measures. Here is a \nmatter that has had part of a day in a hearing, and we have had no \nstudies of the very complicated circuit since 1973. When that Hruska \nCommission reported, they said the State of California should be cut in \nthe middle. This amendment maintains the State of California as an isle \nunto itself. Everyone else that lives in the Western United States, \nexcept the State of Hawaii, is thrown into the so-called twelfth \ncircuit. California is left alone. That is wrong.\n  So what I say, Mr. President, is that the majority is the majority, \nand we well understand that. They have three more Senators than we \nhave. By virtue of that, we enter into unanimous-consent requests and \nagreements all the time, recognizing that you will be fair and \nimpartial as it relates to relevancy, because, otherwise, there would \nbe no reason when a unanimous-consent agreement is entered into, as we \nhave here.\n  On H.R. 3019, the matter now before the Senate, we have here a number \nof Senators who have reserved relevant amendments. That is what it \nsays, ``relevant.'' If it is not relevant, it has to fall. It would \ncertainly be wrong and set a very, very bad precedent, not only in this \nSenate, but in future Senates, if somebody could come in and say, sure, \nit is not relevant, but we are the majority and we will do whatever we \nwant.\n  It is wrong, by any connotation, to have the majority in effect ride \nroughshod over the rules of this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am part of the Senate leadership, and we meet every \nTuesday prior to our party conferences. We talk about what is going to \ngo on in the coming week, the best that we can. I know one of the \nsubjects of discussion tomorrow will be the terribly damaging precedent \nthat would be set if this relevancy point of order is overruled. I \nthink it will make for a very, very long congressional session, because \nthe Senate would not be what it is supposed to be.\n  It would mean that unanimous-consent requests, where the issue of \nrelevancy comes out, would mean absolutely nothing. Instead of having, \nas we have in the calendar here, Senator Simon having a relevant \namendment, we would just say ``Senator Simon amendment.'' You know that \nwe would never get any unanimous-consent request if Senator McCain has \ntwo relevant amendments, if it just said, ``Senator McCain amendment.'' \nWe know when we enter into unanimous-consent requests that we can \nexpect there to be relevancy. And, if it is not relevant, the \nParliamentarian, the bipartisan person who has to be in this body, will \nrule that it is not relevant. It is not only a protection for the \nminority. It is also a protection for the majority.\n  I would guarantee with all of the amendments here that to allow this \nunanimous-consent request to be offered--it would not have been \napproved if some of the Democrats on this--Wellstone, Simon, \nLautenberg--just said, ``We want to offer these amendments,'' the \nunanimous-consent request would never be approved. But that is where we \nwould be if this point of order is not upheld.\n  I suggest and recommend respectfully that this should be something \ndiscussed in some detail rather than it being something that would be a \nvictory for a short period of time. It would be a terrible defeat for \nthe procedures in this body.\n  The merits of the amendment we discussed at great length today. There \nhas been discussion that has gone on for some period of time--a matter \nof hours a day. The debate started around 3 o'clock. Here it is now \napproaching 6 o'clock, and most of the debate this afternoon has been \nrelated to this amendment.\n  So I think it is quite clear that to sustain the point of order is in \nthe best interest of the Senate. To overrule the point of order is not \nin the best interests of the Senate nor this country because with this \nelection year approaching--not approaching, it is here--it is difficult \nenough to get work done. It is difficult enough to get unanimous-\nconsent requests agreed to. I can tell you this does not mean there \nwill not be one agreed to someday or during the next 8 months. But they \nwill be few and far between. Because why would anyone want to enter \ninto a unanimous-consent request when it can be changed at the whim of \nany Senator?\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, we have talked about the merits of \nwhether or not the ninth circuit should be split. And there are \narguments for and against why the amendment should be split. To show \nhow this amendment is headed in the wrong direction, what this \nunderlying legislation does is split the ninth circuit without a \nhearing, without any commission, and then in the same breath says we \nare going to go ahead and split the ninth circuit but we are also going \nto order a commission that costs $3 million to study restructuring the \ncourts. This really seems somewhat unusual especially when the Federal \nGovernment has just spent $100 million refurbishing and restructuring \nthe ninth circuit court building because of the earthquake that \noccurred there. They did it keeping in mind the fact that the ninth \ncircuit administrative offices would be there.\n  We have another problem, of course--that this legislatively \ngerrymandered new twelfth circuit starts in Alaska and goes to the \ncoast of Mexico with the headquarters being in Phoenix, AZ, even though \nthe major cities in the area, of course, are Portland and Seattle.\n  I respectfully say that appealing the point of order violates the \nspirit of what we are trying to do here. By no stretch of the \nimagination can you consider this relevant. And by no stretch of the \nParliamentarian's imagination could he rule it irrelevant. He has ruled \nit not relevant, not once today but twice today. And now to even think \nthat the majority could come back and overrule the Parliamentarian \nwould leave a very bad taste in the mouths of many people.\n  I do not know how my colleague from California feels. But I think she \nwould agree with me there would never be for the remainder of this year \nanother unanimous-consent request that would be agreed to.\n  We need to study the circuit courts. Let us do so with hearings and \nlegislation--not through some kind of tricky parliamentary maneuver on \nan appropriations bill.\n  I again state that the procedure before this body is the fact that we \nare here today by virtue of a unanimous-consent request that allows us \nto go forward with very important legislation. What is that \nlegislation? To fund five appropriations bills so we will not have to \nhave another Government shutdown. But it is clear to me that this \nshould not pass. It is not relevant. But if it does, it is just another \nbasis to cloud up this legislation. No wonder the American people are \nwondering. ``What are you people doing back there? You spend $60 \nmillion in creating a new court because you do not like California? Do \nyou think California is too liberal, that California does not rule \nright?'' This court is not California's court. It is as much Nevada's \ncourt as it is California's. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is not \nCalifornia's. The headquarters of the ninth circuit is in San \nFrancisco. Most of the judges have been appointed by Republican \nPresidents.\n  The problem is not the size of the ninth circuit. The problem is we \nas legislators have not done enough to give the courts tools to move \ncases.\n  As I talked about earlier today, in the Federal District of Nevada 40 \npercent of the cases are filed by prisoners. Why do we not do something \nhere to stop that nonsense? Is it important that we have Federal judges \ndeciding whether they should have chunky or smooth peanut butter? The \nanswer is no. But we as legislators have not been willing to step \nforward and eliminate that. We do not want to stop prisoners from being \nable to file lawsuits. We just want them to be able to file lawsuits in \na temperate, reasonable manner. We need to do something to speed up the \ncriminal appeals process. That would help free a lot of the court's \ntime. But what do the Federal circuit courts hear? They hear endless \nappeals from criminals, especially those who have been convicted of \nmurder--appeal\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nafter appeal after appeal. That is not the fault of the court because \nit sits in San Francisco. They are obligated by law just as the other \ncourts that sit in Denver and wherever else they sit throughout the \nUnited States--the various circuits.\n\n  I ask the Senate to confirm and affirm what the Parliamentarian has \ndone in this instance; that is, rule that this is not relevant. And in \nso doing it will speed up the work of this Senate and this Congress. To \noverrule the Parliamentarian would bring about chaos in this body. \nPeople can say, ``Well, you know, the Senators from California and \nNevada they just feel this way. It is not important. We can overrule \nthem. It does not set a dangerous precedent.'' It sets a horrible \nprecedent.\n  I repeat. We simply will not be able to get anything done. Look how \nhard it was to get this unanimous-consent agreement agreed to \ninitially. It took days. It took lots of different pieces to get this \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  No. 9: ``Ordered that during the consideration of H.R. 3019, an act \nmaking appropriations for fiscal year 1996 to make a further \ndownpayment toward a balanced budget, and for other purposes, the \nfollowing amendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments, and \nthat they be subject to the relevant second-degree amendments.'' Here \nwe go, listing all of the amendments, time that the floor staff, the \nstaff of the Senator from Oregon, and the staff of the Senator from \nWest Virginia worked to arrive at this--25 or 30 different amendments \nwere agreed to, all having to be relevant unless mentioned otherwise. \nSo I say, it is important that the position of the Parliamentarian of \nthe Senate, where he said this amendment was not relevant, be upheld. \nTo do otherwise would be to state that unanimous-consent agreements \nwill no longer be part of the Senate's business.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the concerns of \nthe Senator from Nevada and to reiterate those concerns. Obviously, \nthis is an issue which is of predominant interest to my State, a State \nof 32 million people. In effect, it creates a very unbalanced \nsituation. We have tried to make some of those arguments in the \nChamber.\n  Even more importantly than that, I think it will destroy, certainly \nfor the rest of this session, what has been a measure of consensus on \nwhich this body essentially predicates its movement.\n  Let me tell you why I believe that. As Senator Reid pointed out, the \nnotation in the Executive Calendar is that, for everybody who submitted \nan amendment on the basis that it is relevant to the bill before it--we \ntake their word for it. We take their word for it, that they are not \ntrying to play a trick, they are not trying to put something that is \nnot relevant before this body.\n  In fact, there is a legitimate vehicle for this bill. Senator Burns' \nposition prevailed in the Judiciary Committee. There is a bill which \nwas passed out of the Judiciary Committee which is the proper vehicle \non which to discuss this. So I think the claim that to get action we \nhave to breach what is the word of a Member--a Member who has agreed \nthat an amendment is going to be relevant--is a bad claim. To proceed \nwith that amendment when it is found by the Chair on two occasions not \nto be relevant sets a dangerous precedent. To persist with that \namendment is something that in toto destroys the opportunity for \nconsensus in this body.\n  I would say there would be no reason for anyone on this side, after \nbeing treated in this manner, to agree to a unanimous-consent agreement \nfor the remainder of this session. We would be very foolish to do so, \nbecause clearly the precedent is being set that the rights of the \nminority are being abrogated right here and now, that it does not \nreally matter what the finding of the Chair is with respect to \nrelevancy, we are going to be overturned.\n  I find this very difficult, particularly when there is a legitimate \nvehicle on which to discuss this issue. The Senator from Montana knows \nthat. Every member of the Judiciary Committee knows that. The issue was \ndiscussed in committee. A bill was passed out of the committee. The \nchairman of the committee and the majority leader of the Senate can \ncertainly schedule that bill on this floor. That is, then, an \nappropriate vehicle on which to debate this.\n  So I am very puzzled as to why this has to be done in a precipitous \nmanner, at a time when most of the Members are not here, cannot hear \nthe arguments, and the results of which are going to cast a precedent \non the legal system of this Nation which is very large indeed, and \nshatter consensus making for this body--the kind of honesty, the kind \nof commitment that is necessary to achieve a unanimous-consent \nagreement.\n  There is no incentive, certainly, for me to ever agree to a \nunanimous-consent agreement for the rest of this session if something \nas important to the State of California as this is going to be dealt \nwith in this manner. Both Senator Reid and I have met with Senator \nBurns. We have indicated our agreement to proceed with a study. We have \nindicated that we would shorten the time of the study from the 2 years \nproposed.\n  I have an amendment for a study which is somewhat broader than \nSenator Burns' amendment. We have agreed to cut the time in half. We \nhave reached out in trying to solve this in the tradition of \nthe Senate, which I always thought involved a certain conviviality. But \nnow to find out that there is just simply going to be a partisan vote, \nwith no chance to debate it when all the Members are here, I think is a \nbig mistake.\n\n  We have tried earlier, Mr. President, to indicate the deficiencies of \nthe amendment. We have argued about its cost. This is cost that does \nnot have to be incurred. A building was rehabilitated in San Francisco \nwith 35 percent more space provided and $100 million spent in \nearthquake recovery funds to accommodate expansion and new judges for \nthe ninth circuit; $23 to $59 million will need to be spent for new \ncourthouse expansion and construction the Burns bill would require. I \nindicated earlier that at least $3 million of that is entirely \nduplicative. It is a duplication. At a time when we are scrambling for \nevery dollar, we are going to duplicate staff for a political proposal.\n  I pointed out that this is an unfair division. California, Hawaii, \nGuam, and the North Marianas would have 62 percent of the caseload, and \nAlaska, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana would \nhave only 38 percent of the caseload. The way the allocation of the \njudges is structured in this, it is an unfair, unbalanced allocation of \njudges. California, Guam, and the Marianas would not get 62 percent of \nthe judges to handle 62 percent of the caseload. They would get a \ngreatly reduced amount.\n  It is clearly a political proposal. To ram it through on an \nirrelevant amendment sticks in the craw. So it is unfair at best. It is \na disproportionate allocation of cases and of judges.\n  Third, there has never been a hearing on this proposal. This proposal \nwould restructure--with no public hearing--the largest circuit in the \nNation that hears about 8,000 cases a year. There was a hearing on a \nformer proposal by Senator Gorton. We understood that proposal. Then \nsuddenly a new proposal was made in the Judiciary Committee, and there \nwas no public hearing.\n  Fourth, we have argued that there is a need for a study. The last \ncomprehensive study was done in 1973, by the Hruska Commission. This \nwas before the ninth circuit instituted many changes in its methodology \nfor doing business and speeding up caseload. I believe, if you really \ndispassionately look at the facts, you will see that the ninth circuit \nis processing cases just as fast as the dominant majority of other \ncircuits, certainly faster than the fifth circuit that was split in \n1980 based on the Hruska Commission's recommendations.\n  So, we say take 2 years, have 12 members appointed in a dispassionate \nway by three different entities, and fund it with $500,000, to look at \nall the circuits, look at the workload across this Nation, and make \nsome decision.\n  I would like, if I might, to read from the minority report that was \nfiled by Senator Kennedy and myself in the Judiciary Committee on a \ncouple of points. One of these points that I would like to make is the \nimpact of having\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\none State predominate in the proposed new ninth circuit.\n\n       The majority acknowledged that California will undoubtedly \n     predominate in the new ninth circuit. But the majority also \n     insisted that this situation is not without precedent in the \n     court of appeals. The fact is that California would \n     predominate in the new Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to a \n     degree that is without precedent or parallel. According to \n     the majority's own figures on the other circuits dominated by \n     one State, New York contributes 87 percent of the caseload of \n     the second circuit; Texas contributes only 69 percent of the \n     fifth circuit's caseload. In the proposed new ninth circuit, \n     however, 94 percent of the caseload would come from \n     California.\n\n  That is an inordinate amount. It has never been done before in the \nhistory of this Nation. I would like to read one other section: ``To \ndivide circuits in order to accommodate regional interests''--which is \nclearly what we are doing here. Let us not pretend. Every press release \nindicates that this is the reason for the split--regional interests, \neconomic interests, criminal justice interests, the fact that a group \nof people do not like some decisions. I think that is true for \neverybody, for every appellate court decision that is made, there are \nsome people who do not like the decision.\n  Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, rejected such a premise for \ndividing circuits as completely unacceptable, in testimony about an \nearlier version of this legislation. Chief Justice Burger stated:\n\n       I find it is a very offensive statement to be made, that a \n     U.S. judge, having taken the oath of office, is going to be \n     biased because of the economic conditions of his own \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Judge Charles Wiggins, Reagan appointee and former Republican Member \nof Congress, recently wrote a letter criticizing the political \nmotivations behind the current proposal:\n\n       The majority report . . . contains the misleading statement \n     that the recommended division of the ninth circuit is not in \n     response to ideological differences between judges from \n     California and judges from elsewhere in the circuit. I \n     strongly disagree that such a motive does not, in fact, \n     underlie the proposal for the change. Such a regionalization \n     of the circuits in accordance with State interests is wrong. \n     There is one Federal law. It is enacted by the Congress, \n     signed by the President, and is to be respected in every \n     State in the Union. The law in Montana and Washington is the \n     same law as exists in Maine and Vermont. It is the mission of \n     the Supreme Court to maintain one consistent Federal law. I \n     do hope that you will challenge the supporters of the \n     revision to explain the reasons justifying their proposal.\n\n  So, we know that with no public hearing on this proposal, we have an \nunprecedented, unparalleled proposal to split a court, giving the big \nweight to one State in that court, over 90 percent, and to do a split \nin a way that the judges are not fairly allocated. California, Hawaii, \nGuam, and the Northern Marianas Islands, with 62 percent of the \ncaseload, will have far below the number of judges required to handle \nthat, and seven States with 38 percent of the caseload would have a \nbetter allocation of judges.\n  This is a very serious proposal and it is being done in a way that is \nof very deep concern to this Senator: In an amendment found twice to be \nunrelated to the legislation contemplated by this body at that time--in \na way that most certainly is going to create a problem in terms of the \npeople of this side ever agreeing to a unanimous consent-request again.\n  So, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, I hope there would be \ndue consideration given to these arguments. I think this is a very \nserious situation indeed, and I am hopeful that cooler heads will \nprevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \nindulgence while a make a brief statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2235-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLINTON POLICY FAILURE IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today at Fort Polk, President Clinton \nwelcomed our troops back from Haiti, and commended them for a job well \ndone. It was appropriate for the President to do so. As they always do, \nU.S. forces exhibited a high degree of professionalism and courage in \nthe performance of their mission.\n  However, it is quite another matter to suggest that the restoration \nof the Aristide regime was a worthwhile mission for U.S. forces to \nundertake in the first place. The Clinton administration has made Haiti \na test case for their foreign policy. But what its Haiti policy has \nclearly revealed is that the administration's foreign policy is based \non international social work, not on defending United States' \ninterests.\n  Dozens of political and extra-judicial killings occurred after \nAristide was returned to power, and are continuing under the Preval \nregime. There is credible information available to the President from \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State that \nindicates the involvement of officials in the Aristide and Preval \ngovernments in the planning, execution, and coverup of some of these \nmurders.\n  Last year, an amendment authored by Senator Dole passed Congress, \nrequiring the President to certify the Haitian Government's progress in \ninvestigating political murders before the United States provided Haiti \nwith anymore aid. But President Clinton could not certify that Haiti \nwas investigating political murders allegedly committed by members of \nthe Haitian Government for a very simple reason--the Haitian Government \nhas steadfastly declined to undertake such investigations.\n  Since he could not certify, President Clinton used his authority to \nwaive the Dole conditions, saying--disingenuously, I believe--that the \nwaiver was ``necessary to assure the safe and timely withdrawal of \nUnited States forces from Haiti.''\n  Earlier this month, at least seven more Haitian citizens were killed \napparently by members of the United States-hand picked, United States-\ntrained, and United States-equipped Haiti national police. The victims \nwere shot at point blank range. Witnesses report that they saw \npolicemen do the killings. Mr. President, 24 hours after the shootings, \nthe bodies had not been picked up, and no member of the Haiti judicial \nsystem had made an official report. The UN/OAS Mission has opened an \ninquiry into the killings, but not any member or agency of the \nGovernment of Haiti.\n  It is a sad commentary on the administration's policy that after the \nUnited States has spent $2 billion, and the men and women of the U.S. \nArmed Forces endured hardship and danger, the government they were sent \nto restore and protect has participated in death squads, and done so \nwith impunity.\n  As a final act of gratitude, President Aristide recognized the \ngovernment of the man who recently ordered the murder of American \ncitizens--Fidel Castro.\n  The Clinton administration's policy in Haiti is a failure. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2240-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2240-S2243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3551\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to discuss, again, the ruling \nof the Chair. The Parliamentarian has ruled that an amendment is not \nrelevant. A unanimous-consent request was entered allowing the calendar \nitem to go forward, as set forth on page 3 of Monday's Calendar of \nBusiness.\n  A number of relevant amendments were allowed to be offered under the \nconfines of the unanimous-consent request. Every Senator here agreed to \nthis. Every Senator said only relevant amendments could be offered.\n  It seems rather unusual now that in spite of a unanimous-consent \nagreement--that does not mean 99 percent of the Senators, that does not \nmean 99 Senators, that means every Senator agreed to this unanimous-\nconsent request--it seems rather unusual now we have some Senators who \nsay that the referee, the Parliamentarian, ruled that this amendment is \nnot relevant, ``But I'm going to do it my way anyway. I really didn't \nmean it when I agreed to that unanimous-consent request.''\n  For this body to rule otherwise--that is, to overrule the \nParliamentarian--would be putting not only the Senate but certainly the \nChair in a very, very awkward position, because it is clear that this \namendment is not in order.\n  Mr. President, if the Parliamentarian is overruled, it would be like \nplaying a\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\nbasketball game and you have Dennis Rodman as one of the players and \nyou do not have a referee. Or you decide before any game, ``Let's just \nnot have any referees. Let's just have a free-for-all.'' That is, in \neffect, what this will wind up doing. That is why we will never ever \nhave another unanimous-consent agreement this year.\n  I think the Senators, especially the majority, really have to look at \nwhat precedent this sets. Every Senator has agreed that amendments can \nonly be offered that are relevant. The referee, the Parliamentarian, \nthrough the Chair, has said an amendment is not relevant. To think now \nthat we could come back as a body and overrule the referee does not \nseem very fair to me, or I think to most everyone it does not seem \nfair. I think it is going to be real hard to get work done around here.\n  Mr. President, I do not know, but I would think that the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from \nOregon--although I do not know--I have to think he would vote to \nsustain the Parliamentarian. For the chairman to vote otherwise would \nput this bill certainly at jeopardy and the precedents of this body.\n  I almost guarantee, although I have not talked to him, that the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, would vote to sustain the Chair. I think those of us who \nhave not been in this body very long should follow these two great \nSenators.\n  There have been a number of statements made in the debate today, but \nlet me speak now as a Senator from Nevada. Nevada wants no part of this \nsplit. We share a border that is 1,000 miles with the State of \nCalifornia--a 1,000-mile border. We do not want to stop having legal \nintercourse with the State of California. That would be wrong.\n  Mr. President, if, in fact, there is a commission like the Senator \nfrom California has talked about establishing that would come back and \ngive reasons for why we should split off from the State of California \nin this circuit, I would be very strongly inclined to go along with \nthat, but right now we have nothing.\n\n  As we have established clearly in the debate today, more circuits \ndoes not mean we are going to handle more cases. Quite frankly, it \nmeans just the opposite.\n  I think, if we have a fair study of the circuits, I do not know what \ncan happen. We may want to combine circuits. We might wind up, instead \nof having 12 circuits, having 14 circuits, or instead of having 12 \ncircuits, we might wind up having 8 circuits. I do not know. But let us \nhave a good study by people appointed by the Chief Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, by the President, by the legislative body, having \nadequate staff so that they can work on this matter.\n  The majority party, the Chair included, I have heard on a number of \noccasions make statements about how important it is to balance this \nbudget. The Presiding Officer today may feel more strongly about other \nthings, but as far as I am concerned, having worked and served with the \nPresiding Officer, I do not know of a thing the Chair feels more \nstrongly about than balancing the budget, because I heard remarks made \non a continuing, repetitive basis from this floor about how important \nit is to get this Nation's financial house in order.\n  Using that as a foundation for what is important in this body, how \ncan we justify without a hearing, without a commission made up of \nacademics or judges or the private sector, how can we justify spending \nup to $60 million creating this new circuit with added expenses of \nmillions of dollars every year? You cannot justify that. This must be \nlaughable to the American public.\n  If the jury were the American public and we presented this to them, \nthey would return a verdict very quickly saying, ``Well, I'm not sure \nthere should be a split, but let's at least study the issue before that \ndecision is made.''\n  To spend $60 million after we have already spent $100 million just \nrenovating a building so that we can take care of this large ninth \ncircuit does not make a lot of sense. So instead of spending $100 \nmillion, we are going to spend $160 million, plus the yearly increase \nin cost. It does not make sense to the American public. It certainly \ndoes not make sense to this Senator.\n  My staff handed me something earlier today that says: ``Further \nInformation Relating to the Issue of Splitting the Ninth Circuit.'' I \nhave not had a chance to read all this, but neither has anyone else in \nthis body. We have had no hearings. There has been no commission set up \nto determine if we are doing the right thing, but there has been a lot \nsaid as to why we are doing the wrong thing: editorials, academics, \njudges. Just from this piece of paper that I have here, there are some \nthings that I think we should be aware of in this body.\n\n  The American Bar Association Appellate Practice Committee, \nSubcommittee To Study the Circuit Size. I read an excerpt from that \ntoday saying that they thought it was a bad idea.\n  Thomas Baker wrote in the Arizona, I assume this is the Law Review 22 \nAriz. S.L.J. 917 (1990) ``On Redrawing Circuit Boundaries--Why the \nProposal To Divide the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit Is Not Such a Good Idea.'' It is something of which we should \nbe aware.\n  Carl Tobias, Emory Law School Law Review, 1995. His is entitled ``The \nImpoverished Idea of Circuit Splitting.''\n  The Honorable Clifford J. Wallace, who for many years was the chief \njudge of the ninth circuit and now is retired, wrote an article saying: \n``The Ninth Circuit Should Not Be Split.''\n  There are a number of other references in this piece of paper \nindicating why the circuit should not be split.\n  But let us determine that from a basis rather than the seat of our \npants in the Senate. We should do it with congressional hearings, but \nif you do not want to go the congressional hearing route, I am willing \nto go along with the suggestion of the Senator from California that we \nhave a commission, because splitting the ninth circuit is a piecemeal \napproach, it is not the answer to a nationwide problem. We need to look \nat all the circuits. The 1996 legislation should not be based on a \nreport that is 23 years old.\n  I would not even feel as upset if this amendment had followed the \nHruska report that is 23 years old. They do not even do that. The \nHruska report said you should split the State of California in two. \nThey did not do that. They lumped California all together. As the \nSenator from California pointed out, there has never been anything done \nlike that before.\n  Creating a new circuit is a costly proposition. The bench and bar \noppose the ninth circuit split. Regionalism and ideology should play no \npart in the boundaries of circuits. The division of the fifth circuit \nprovides no precedent for dividing the ninth circuit. The Hruska report \nshows that a large circuit can operate effectively, as the ninth \ncircuit has done. The ninth circuit is doing a very good job.\n  But even on the merits, Mr. President, even if we are totally wrong \nand my friend from the State of Montana is totally right--that we are \nall wrong, assuming that for the purposes of this argument--we must \nsustain the point of order. The Parliamentarian has ruled this \namendment is not germane--I am sorry, not relevant. So we should uphold \nthe Chair. It is the only way we are going to have order in this body. \nTo have this Senate overrule the ruling of the Chair would set a \nprecedent that we would learn to regret. We would come to regret it.\n  So I hope that we will follow the recommendation, as I am confident \nwill be of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, and vote to uphold the ruling \nof the Chair and have this matter declared, once and for all, not \nrelevant.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I rise in strong opposition to the \nsecond-degree amendment introduced by the junior Senator from Montana \nto his original amendment to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhile also calling for a restructuring study of all the U.S. circuit \ncourts of appeal.\n  I commend the Chair's ruling on the two points of order brought by \nboth Senator Feinstein and Senator Reid earlier today to hold the Burns \namendment irrelevant to this omnibus appropriations bill.\n  This amendment is the fourth attempt to break up the ninth circuit \nsince 1983. These same drums have been\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nbeaten before--the circuit is too big--the cases are not decided in a \ntimely manner.\n  But this is, I fear, only a smokescreen for the real reason splitting \nthe ninth circuit is proposed from time to time.\n  Many simply do not like the decisions rendered by the circuit.\n  Surely not all of the decisions in the ninth circuit, or for that \nmatter, in any circuit come down the way all of us would like. I have \neven cosponsored legislation to reverse some ninth circuit decisions.\n  But I do not believe differences over the decisions rendered by the \nninth circuit are adequate grounds to split the circuit.\n  What kind of precedent would Congress then be setting? Would a \ncircuit court of appeals face possible reconfiguration, whenever \nCongress does not like the decisions being rendered? Does this Congress \nreally want to support what is essentially judicial gerrymandering? I \nthink not.\n  The ninth circuit serves nine western States, and has been one \ncircuit for over 100 years. Whenever the issue of splitting the circuit \nis put to a vote of the judges and lawyers in the circuit, the vote is \noverwhelming to retain the circuit as it is currently.\n  Who better than those judges whose decisions are appealed to, and \nthose lawyers who represent clients whose cases are heard by the ninth \ncircuit to determine whether the circuit is working or not? It has been \nmy experience that judges and lawyers have never been shy about stating \nan opinion when they think something needs to be changed.\n  The last study of the Federal circuit courts of appeal was the 1973 \nHruska Commission. A fellow Nevadan, the Honorable Charles Wiggins, a \nninth circuit court judge, served as a member of that Commission.\n  Judge Wiggins, a former Republican Congressman, originally supported \na split of the ninth circuit. In his recent letter to Senator \nFeinstein, however, he stated:\n\n       My understanding of the role of the circuit courts in our \n     system of federal justice has changed over the years from \n     that which I held when the Hruska Commission issued its final \n     report in 1973. At that time, I endorsed the recommendations \n     of the Commission calling for a division of the 5th and 9th \n     Circuits. I have grown wiser in the succeeding 22 years.''\n\n  We should heed Judge Wiggins experience--act wisely and not split the \nninth circuit.\n  The last time a circuit court of appeals was split was 1980, when the \nfifth circuit was divided. And it should be noted that the judges of \nthe fifth circuit unanimously requested the split --a situation we do \nnot have with the ninth circuit.\n  Judge Wiggins recently wrote me,\n\n       Circuit division is not the answer. It has not proved \n     effective in reducing delays. The former 5th Circuit ranked \n     sixth in case processing times just prior to its division \n     into the 5th and 11th Circuits. Since the division, the new \n     5th Circuit is still ranked sixth or seventh, while the new \n     11th circuit now ranks 12th, the slowest of all the circuits. \n     The 9th circuit Court of Appeals judges are the fastest in \n     the nation in disposing of cases once the panel receives the \n     case.\n\n  The ninth circuit has taken administrative steps to manage its \ncaseload through innovative ways that other circuits use as models. The \nninth circuit disposes of cases in 1.9 months from oral argument to \nrendering a decision.\n  This is 2 weeks less than the national average. This currently makes \nthe ninth circuit the second most efficient circuit. It is obvious the \ncircuit has recognized court management areas that needed improving, \nand has successfully addressed them.\n  I find it particularly ironic in this current political atmosphere \nwith extremely tight Federal budget restraints that a proposal is being \nmade to create a new circuit court. As my colleagues before me have \ndiscussed, it is estimated to cost $60 million to construct another \nFederal court house, and set up another circuit court. An additional $2 \nto $3 million is estimated to be needed to provide for the transition \nperiod. And thereafter, we would face the continuing costs of operating \nan additional circuit court. This makes no sense.\n  I reiterate my opposition to the proposal to split the ninth circuit. \nThis circuit has worked well for the nine western States it serves, and \nwill continue to do so into the future.\n  For those who believe the ninth circuit must be split, let the \nproposed commission to review all the U.S. circuit courts go forward. \nWhen the information necessary to determine whether any circuits need \ntheir geographical jurisdiction changed is available, we can then \ndebate this issue intelligently.\n  But let us not split the ninth circuit prematurely. To implement the \nninth circuit split at the same time as a commission is gathering the \ninformation to make that decision simply would make no sense.\n  This issue is simply too important to debate without all necessary \ninformation. I would hope my colleagues would join me tomorrow in \nvoting to uphold the Chair's rulings on the irrelevancy of the Burns \namendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3484, 3485, 3486, and 3487\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that I spoke \nabout at great length last week. I want to speak very briefly about the \namendments that I have put forward that are pending concerning the \ndisaster relief portion of this bill and the emergency spending \ndeclaration that was attached to those spending provisions.\n  I really want to focus on just sort of the broad outline of what I am \ntrying to accomplish in these amendments. There are really three \nsubjects that the amendments deal with. The first subject really is the \nimmediate subject, which is, are we going to offset the money that we \nspent here in the Senate bill with other spending reductions in the \nbill so we do not add to the deficit this year? That is the first \nissue.\n  The second issue is, do we get a bill out of conference that does not \nadd to the deficit?\n  Third, what do we do long term to deal with the issue of disaster \nrelief?\n  Let me address all three of those, if I can, and discuss the \namendments that I have to take those subjects on. First, the Senate \nbill. We had an amendment by the Senator from Texas and me. Senator \nGramm and I put forward an amendment to offset the spending with an \nacross-the-board cut in all the nondefense discretionary appropriations \naccounts. We had 45 votes on that, which I consider is a pretty good \nshowing, but not good enough.\n  We are continuing to look. I have three amendments filed, and, in \nfact, am working on a fourth with the Appropriations Committee and the \nleadership, to try to come up with a way where we can pass a bill here \nin the U.S. Senate that does not add to the deficit this year.\n  So I am hopeful that in the end, whether we do it with the amendments \nthat I have pending or whether we can come up with a modification to \none of those amendments to accomplish a deficit-neutral bill in this \nbill that we are working on, I am confident that we can make that \nhappen. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is the issue in conference. In the Senate, as I said before, I \nam hopeful we can get a bill that comes out of here that does not add \nto the deficit. The House has already put forward a bill that does \nnot--that does not--increase the deficit. So I have a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which would instruct the conferees to hold firm and \ncome out with a bill that is within the budget caps that we set in the \nbudget resolution last year, so we do not add additional red ink in \nthis round of trying to finish the appropriations process for the rest \nof this year. So we have something that clearly states the Senate is on \nrecord that we should pay for the disaster relief funds in this bill.\n\n  Third--and this gets to, I think, a very important issue, and I am \nhopeful we can get very broad support for this--is another sense-of-\nthe-Senate that the Congress and the relevant committees examine how we \ndeal with disaster relief. How we deal with disaster relief now is--\nactually, we do not. We appropriate a few hundred million dollars, very \nlittle money relative to the amount of disasters that we have in this \ncountry, that are eligible for Federal relief. We appropriate a few \nhundred million dollars a year to FEMA and then, as the disasters come \nalong, as they certainly do--whether they are earthquakes in California \nor whether they are fires in Texas or whether they are floods in \nPennsylvania or hurricanes in South Carolina, we\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nhave them--we have a Federal role to play in helping the people who \nhave been hurt, whether it is physically or whether it is their \nproperty or with the public roads or bridges, infrastructure.\n  There is a Federal role to play in assisting an area, a community, \nthat has been hit. So the question is, how do we pay for it? How do we \nbudget for it? And what we do right now is we do not budget for it, and \nwe pay for it by putting it on the next generation's credit card, so to \nspeak. The difference with the next generation's credit card is that \nunlike most credit cards we have to pay after 30 days--we get charged \ninterest, but eventually we pay it back--this credit card, we never pay \nit back, we just keep paying interest on it forever, and the future \ngenerations pay forever and ever and ever.\n  So what we ask is, look at a long-term solution. How can we, within \nthe budget, allocate resources as disasters come up, to make sure we \ncan be fiscally responsible, and at the same time provide the needed \nassistance for disasters as they occur across this country? That is the \nlast leg or last subject area that I am trying to address with these \namendments that I have on the floor.\n  I am hopeful we can get support for all three subjects, fixing the \nSenate bill, getting a bill out of conference and to the President's \ndesk that does not add to the deficit, and No. 3, coming up with a \nsuggestion to the Congress that the relevant committees do some good \nwork and determine how we can begin to pay for disasters within the \nbudget.\n  Senator Gramm and I mentioned last week when we were debating his \namendment that over the past 7 years, we have added $100 billion to the \ndeficit--$100 billion to the deficit--in disaster declarations. They \nhave been things from very serious, as I said before--floods, \nearthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, et cetera--to things such as \ndeclaring an emergency because we had a 6-percent rate of unemployment \nand we wanted to pay extended unemployment compensation benefits.\n\n  There really is a very loose standard of what is an emergency. In \nfact, there is no standard of what an emergency is. It is whatever the \nPresident declares, whatever the Congress declares. I think we need to \ndo a little better than that. I think we have to have some guidelines \nand we have to have some procedures by which we are going to declare \nemergencies and which would cause us to increase the deficit. That is \nan appropriate standard.\n  That is something, frankly, we should have done when we put together \nthe emergency provisions in the 1990 Budget Act in the first place, but \nwe did not. Those who argued for some sort of parameters to define an \nemergency hearkened back then that we were going to see everything that \nwas politically popular for the moment declared an emergency and thrown \non the deficit. I think their fears have been brought to fruition. We \nhave, as I said before, $100 billion of such spending.\n  I want to make it very clear that we have an obligation here to \nprovide emergency disaster relief for communities in States that are \nhit. I am for that. I want to make sure that we can do that and we do \nit properly, but I think we have to make sure we do it within the \nconfines of trying to get to a much more responsible fiscal policy here \nin Washington, to a balanced budget, to a better America and, again, \navoiding this knee-jerk reaction we have had in this town for a long, \nlong time, that if we have a problem, and we do not want to take money \nfrom some area of the budget that may have your name attached to a \nprogram, or whatever the case may be, and put it to where the emergency \nis, that instead we just add it to the deficit.\n  I think that is irresponsible behavior, and it is certainly not in \nkeeping with the changes that have occurred since the 1994 election. We \nfocused so much of our time and energy on trying to balance this \nbudget, but when an emergency comes along that we frankly should have \nbudgeted for but did not budget for, we are the first to run, even now, \nand talk about, well, we have just got to put it on the deficit. I \nthink it is talking out of both sides of your mouth and is not what we \nshould be doing here, or what the public expects us to be doing.\n\n  We are talking $1.2 billion out of $1.6 trillion that we will spend \nthis year. Somewhere around we can find some money in a lot of areas of \nGovernment to put where it should go, which is to pay for this \nemergency. The three things I am hoping to accomplish tomorrow, whether \nwe can do it, and I hope we can, by agreement or consent on both sides \nof the aisle, is something frankly that both Democrats and Republicans \nshould be for: Fiscal responsibility, a long-term solution, and more of \na structure to funding emergencies and standing up for the Senate not \nto be fiscally irresponsible and adding to the deficit in this \nappropriations process.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3551\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, not to belabor the point, but earlier \nI made the point about the duplicative costs of the ninth circuit split \nproposal, the inordinate costs of the proposal, the unnecessary costs \nof the proposal, the unfair division that the Burns bill presents.\n  I would like to just clarify what I said. What I said was that \nCalifornia, Hawaii, Guam, and Northern Marianas have currently 62 \npercent of the caseload; Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, \nIdaho, and Montana have 38 percent. In the Burns proposal, the group of \nStates with 62 percent of the cases get 15 judges, and the States with \nonly 38 percent of the caseload get 13 judges. The States with 62 \npercent of the cases end up getting proportionately fewer judges \nrelative to caseload. According to ninth circuit statistics for 1995, \nthe proposed new twelfth circuit would have only 765 filings per three-\njudge panel, whereas the ninth circuit would have 1,065 filings per \nthree-judge panel. How this huge caseload is going to be handled with a \ndisproportionately low number of judges should cause some concern \nbecause this will still remain a very large circuit. It will be unable \nto function due to a heavy backlog of cases.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2240-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten approval, authorization, and determination concerning\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nthe agreement, and the memorandum of the Director of the United States \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, \nwhich includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement and various \nother attachments, including agency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with the Argentine Republic has been \nnegotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \nby the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and as otherwise \namended. In my judgment, the proposed agreement meets all statutory \nrequirements and will advance the non-proliferation and other foreign \npolicy interests of the United States. The agreement provides a \ncomprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the \nUnited States and Argentina under appropriate conditions and controls \nreflecting a strong common commitment to nuclear non-proliferation \ngoals.\n  The proposed new agreement will replace an existing U.S.-Argentina \nagreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that entered into force on \nJuly 25, 1969, and by its terms would expire on July 25, 1999. The \nUnited States suspended cooperation with Argentina under the 1969 \nagreement in the late 1970s because Argentina did not satisfy a \nprovision of section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act (added by the NNPA) \nthat required full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nsafeguards in nonnuclear weapon states such as Argentina as a condition \nfor continued significant U.S. nuclear exports.\n  On December 13, 1991, Argentina, together with Brazil, the Argentine-\nBrazilian Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials \n(ABACC) and the IAEA signed a quadrilateral agreement calling for the \napplication of full-scope IAEA safeguards in Argentina and Brazil. This \nsafeguards agreement was brought into force in March 1994. Resumption \nof cooperation would be possible under the 1969 U.S.-Argentina \nagreement for cooperation. However, both the United States and \nArgentina believe it is preferable to launch a new era of cooperation \nwith a new agreement that reflect among other things:\n  --An updating of terms and conditions to take account of intervening \n    changes in the respective domestic legal and regulatory frameworks \n    of the parties in the area of peaceful nuclear cooperation:\n  --Reciprocity in the application of the terms and conditions of \n    cooperation between the parties; and\n  --Additional international non-proliferation commitments entered into \n    by the parties since 1969.\n  Over the past several years Argentina has made a definitive break \nwith earlier ambivalent nuclear policies and has embraced \nwholeheartedly a series of important steps demonstrating its firm \ncommitment to the exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In \naddition to its full-scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA, \nArgentina has made the following major non-proliferation commitments:\n  --It brought the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in \n    Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) into force \n    for itself on January 18, 1994;\n  --It became a full member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in April \n    1994; and\n  --It acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n    Weapons (NPT) on February 10, 1995.\n  Once Argentina's commitment to full-scope IAEA safeguards was clear, \nand in anticipation of the additional steps subsequently taken by \nArgentina to adopt responsible policies on nuclear non-proliferation, \nthe United States entered into negotiations with Argentina on a new \nagreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation and reached ad referendum \nagreement on a text on September 3, 1992. Further steps to conclude the \nagreement were interrupted, however, by delays (not all of them \nattributable to Argentina) in bringing the full-scope IAEA safeguards \nagreement into force, and by steps, recently completed, to resolve \nissues relating to Argentina's eligibility under section 129 of the \nU.S. Atomic Energy Act to receive U.S. nuclear exports. As the \nagreement text initialed with Argentina in 1992 continues to satisfy \ncurrent U.S. legal and policy requirements, no revision has been \nnecessary.\n  The proposed new agreement with Argentina permits the transfer of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It provides for U.S. \nconsent rights to retransfers, enrichment, and reprocessing as required \nby U.S. law. It does not permit transfers of any sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, restricted data, or sensitive nuclear facilities or major \ncritical components thereof. In the event of termination, key \nconditions and controls continue with respect to material and equipment \nsubject to the agreement.\n  From the U.S. perspective the proposed new agreement improves on the \n1969 agreement by the addition of a number of important provisions. \nThese include the provisions for full-scope safeguards; perpetuity of \nsafeguards; a ban on ``peaceful'' nuclear explosives; a right to \nrequire the return of exported nuclear items in certain circumstances; \na guarantee of adequate physical protection; and a consent right to \nenrichment of nuclear material subject to the agreement.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. The Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J.

The \nanalysis follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In previous correspondence dated \n     February 8, 1996, regarding The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     of 1995 (Public law 104-4), the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) included two lists of the legislation on the calendar \n     as of January 23, 1996. The lists assessed intergovernmental\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\n     mandates and private-sector mandates for legislation under \n     your committee's jurisdiction. The bills were grouped into \n     three categories: those that do not contain mandates as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4; those that contain mandates but \n     the direct costs are below the relevant thresholds; and \n     legislation that needed further review to make a \n     determination concerning mandates. CBO has completed its \n     analysis of those bills on the lists requiring further \n     review.\n       CBO finds that the following bills would impose no new \n     private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 104-4:\n       S. 92, Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations \n     Refinancing Act.\n       S. 363, Rio Puerco Watershed Act of 1995.\n       S. 444, An act to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act to authorize purchase of common stock of Cook Inlet \n     region.\n       S. 587, An act to amend the National Trails System Act to \n     designate the Old Spanish Trail for inclusion in the National \n     Trails System.\n       S. 852, Public Rangelands Management Act of 1995.\n       S. 884, Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995.\n       S. 907, A bill to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit \n     Act of 1986.\n       S. 1459, A bill to provide for uniform management of \n     livestock grazing on federal land.\n       H.R. 536, An act to prohibit the use of Highway 209 within \n     the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area by certain \n     commercial vehicles.\n       CBO also finds that the following bill would impose no new \n     intergovernmental mandates, as defined in Public law 104-4:\n       S. 92, Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations \n     Refinancing Act.\n       If you wish further details on this analysis, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO contacts are Patrice Gordon \n     (226-2940) for private-sector mandates and Marjorie Miller \n     (225-3220) for intergovernmental mandates.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

Mr. President, I had the pleasure of attending \nthe American Jewish Congress' Profiles in Courage Awards Dinner last \nSaturday night in New York City at which former Israeli President Chaim \nHerzog delivered a most memorable address.\n  I first met Chaim Herzog some 21 years ago when then-President Ford \nappointed me the Permanent Representative of the United States to the \nUnited Nations. He was the Israeli Ambassador to that body where a \nSoviet-led coalition wielded enormous power and used it in an assault \nagainst the democracies of the world. In that regard, I cite an \neditorial in the New Republic which recently said of the United \nNations, ``During the Cold War, the U.N. became a chamber of hypocrisy \nand proxy aggression.''\n  Proxy aggression in particular directed against the State of Israel, \nwhich became a metaphor for democracy under virtual siege at the United \nNations.\n  Those who failed to destroy Israel on the field of battle joined \nthose who wished to discredit all Western, democratic governments in an \nunprecedented, sustained attack on the very right of a U.N. member \nstate to exist within the family of nations.\n  The efforts in the 1970's to delegitimize Israel came in many forms, \nnone more insidious than the campaign to declare Zionism a form of \nracism.\n  With the collapse of the Soviet Union, both the Zionism resolution \nand the rejectionist Arab Front lost their major source of support.\n  On June 19, 1991, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a \ncoffee-hour for then-President-elect Yeltsin of the Russian Soviet \nFederative Socialist Republic. In the receiving line, one of the \nmembers of the Russian delegation asked if I remembered him. ``I was \nstationed at the United Nations when you were the U.S. Representative. \nYou did not think anyone was listening, did you? But we heard you.'' He \nwas, in fact, Andrei Kozyrev.\n  The very last vote that the Soviet Union cast in the General Assembly \nwas the vote on December 16, 1991, to repeal Resolution 3379. And the \nsame Andrei Kozyrev who served the Soviet Union at the United Nations \nin 1975, was, in his capacity as Foreign Minister of Russia, one of the \ntwo witnesses to the historic Oslo Accords, signed on the South Lawn of \nthe White House on September 13, 1993.\n  The same Andrei Kozyrev who monitored Leonard Garment's remarks \nbefore the Third Committee joined Warren Christopher in witnessing \nYasser Arafat's signature to a paper that three decades of Soviet \nforeign policy sought to prevent.\n  The Soviet Union has gone to its richly deserved place in the dustbin \nof history which it once promised would be the burial place of \ndemocratic society.\n  The Soviet Union may be gone. But events during the past few weeks \nmust remind us all that Israel remains very much a metaphor for \ndemocracy in the twilight struggle between the forces of \ntotalitarianism and the values of freedom.\n  The bombs that rocked London and the terrorist violence that \nshattered the peace of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv were attacks on all \ndemocracies. While the immediate victims of the recent bombings in \nIsrael may have been Israeli citizens of the Jewish, Moslem, and \nChristian faiths and visitors and pilgrims from other nations, those \nresponsible for these actions are simply at war with all civilized \nsocieties.\n  There can be no place in the family of nations for the murderous \ncowards who send others on suicide missions to slaughter civilians in \nthe name of any cause. President Clinton has taken important measures \nto help protect the people of Israel from a continuation of these \natrocities.\n  President Herzog spoke Saturday night of the appropriate response to \nthese terrorist atrocities. His message concerning the future of the \npeace process is an important one and I ask that his remarks be printed \nin the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n Address by President Chaim Herzog to the American Jewish Congress on \n   the Occasion of the Presentation of the Profiles in Courage Awards\n\n       Mr. Chairman: I am most grateful to you for your kind \n     words, and, indeed, to the American Jewish Congress for \n     having made this memorable award to me in such distinguished \n     company as former comrades-in-arms, Senator Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan and Leonard Garment.\n       As I stand here in this building I recall the years in \n     which I represented Israel--years in which we were treated by \n     so many as a pariah state, years in which the theater of the \n     absurd which was the United Nations at that time devoted so \n     much time, energy and resources to condemning the small State \n     of Israel while ignoring the evils that befell the world on \n     all sides. At that time, we were outnumbered by the automatic \n     majority comprised of an alliance of hatred based on the \n     Soviet bloc, the Arab bloc and the so-called Non-Aligned \n     group. If ever there was a misnomer, it was this, because \n     nobody was more aligned in those days than the so-called Non-\n     Aligned. They were aligned in hatred of Western democracy, \n     they were aligned in support of Communist hegemony, they were \n     aligned in the common lofty purpose of maligning Israel with \n     a view to leading to its delegitimization.\n       The battle began in October 1975 in the Third Committee, \n     the so-called Human Rights Committee, with a violent attack \n     against Israel and Zionism. The three great bulwarks of \n     democracy and freedom--Cuba, Somalia and Benin--had submitted \n     to the UN Third Committee, the Human Rights Committee, an \n     amendment proposing an addition to the existing resolution \n     attacking racism and apartheid. What they wanted to add was \n     an attack on Zionism, equating it with racism. This move was \n     particularly grave because it was the first attack in the \n     United Nations on an ``ism.'' Nobody had ever attempted to \n     attack Communism, Socialism or capitalism before. But now our \n     national liberation movement was becoming the center of \n     attack. In that debate, Leonard Garment, the U.S. \n     representative on the committee, attacked the resolution with \n     the dramatic words, ``This is an obscene act.''\n       On Friday evening, October 17th, the debate concluded in \n     the Third Committee, and it met to vote on it. In my remarks, \n     I thanked the delegations who had stood by our side, and said \n     that we would never forget those who voted to attack our \n     religion and our faith. I shouted out the last words, ``We \n     shall never forget.''\n       The resolution passed with a majority, and our enemies \n     seemed to be on the verge of a victory war dance. I saw Pat \n     Moynihan, the blood rushing to his head, livid, standing up. \n     He straightened his tie, pulled down and buttoned his jacket, \n     and crossed the floor to me. I rose to greet him and held out \n     my hand. He took it, pulled me to him and embraced me in \n     front of the entire hall. I shall never forget that gut \n     reaction of his, which spoke more than anything else. It was \n     not planned, it was not part of policy--that was just Pat \n     Moyniham behaving instinctively. I was very moved. He \n     whispered to me what we could do to our enemies.\n       I was perplexed and could not understand the absence of any \n     meaningful Jewish reaction to the vote at the time, and when \n     I addressed the Conference of Presidents of Major American \n     Jewish Organizations, I pulled no punches. As soon as my \n     remarks at the meeting were published, the reaction amongst \n     American Jewry was something that had to be seen to be \n     believed. Paul Johnson, the brilliant editor of ``The New\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n     Statesman,'' wrote an outstanding article which concluded \n     with his views that ``The melancholy truth, I fear, is that \n     the candles of civilization are burning low.''\n       In the General Assembly, I delivered the speech defending \n     Israel, and indeed the Jewish people, and at the conclusion \n     of my remarks I took the resolution in my hands and tore it \n     up in front of the Assembly. The effect of the debate and the \n     resolution on Jews all over the world was electrifying. The \n     fight had done more for Zionism than thousands of speeches by \n     Zionist leaders. It had clearly touched a nerve.\n       Nothing can demonstrate more vividly the change which has \n     occurred than the attitude to Israel in the United Nations \n     today. The resolution was rescinded by an overwhelming \n     majority in 1992. Our delegation is no longer the whipping \n     boy of the United Nations, and enjoys open and cordial \n     relations with many Arab delegations. The Soviet Union has \n     disappeared, and with it the hostility that it bred in the \n     Assembly. Perhaps few events can demonstrate the unbelievable \n     success of Israel in its efforts to achieve peace and break \n     down the barriers of hatred than the attitude towards Israel \n     in the General Assembly today.\n       I have come from Israel, which has been through some very \n     difficult experiences in the past months. Like many other \n     countries in the area, we are at war with Islamic \n     Fundamentalism. It is a bitter struggle, fuelled by deep \n     hatred and an approach by the Islamic Fundamentalists which \n     entertains no compromise.\n       The new type of terror which is being used by our enemies \n     is not easy to cope with, because here you have individuals \n     who have been promised that they go straight to heaven and \n     benefit from the priorities given to holy martyrs on their \n     arrival, if they blow themselves up. This is a very \n     difficult problem to deal with, and it is not always easy \n     to detect the individual bent on creating havoc and chaos \n     by detonating himself. It has been difficult to apply \n     emergency legislation, but every one of these would-be \n     suicide bombers now knows that an attack by them will \n     involve very severe official action against their \n     families, who will not have had the good fortune to reach \n     heaven with them.\n       I do not have to recall to you the scenes of horror and \n     devastation which filled the television screens of the world \n     and which you doubtless saw, but we can be proud of the fact \n     that the Opposition rallied behind the Government on the \n     occasion of these disasters, and of the leadership given by \n     Prime Minister Peres in these difficult and almost impossible \n     times.\n       We have been through very difficult periods in the past \n     when we had ranged against us the entire Palestinian people. \n     We are experiencing a very difficult period now. But there is \n     a difference: some 70% of the Palestinian people, represented \n     by the PLO and led by a leader who was elected by secret \n     ballot, has withdrawn from the circle of terror and has \n     ceased to use terror in the struggle against Israel. It has \n     been active in coordination with Israel against the \n     terrorists of the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, although we \n     have maintained, and continue to maintain, that its action \n     has not been as determined and as effective on occasions as \n     we would wish. But one thing is clear: 70% of the Palestinian \n     people have withdrawn from the circle of terror which \n     endangered us over the years and they no longer partake in \n     such activities.\n       We have to remember that the forces in conflict with us are \n     also in conflict with the government of Jordan; are engaged \n     in a life-and-death struggle in Algeria; and in Egypt, where \n     President Mubarak has been successfully curbing their \n     activities. The terrorists who have unleashed this recent \n     violence have the same goal as their predecessors during the \n     past fifty years: the destruction of Israel. They understand \n     that their ambition will never succeed if the peace process \n     succeeds and the Palestinians compromise. Those of us who \n     react to trauma by despairing that the peace process will \n     succeed are handing the terrorists a victory.\n       The arrangements under the Oslo Agreements have been moving \n     along fairly satisfactorily. The Palestinian elections gave a \n     convincing majority to those favoring the peace process, but \n     we face the danger of terrorism instigated by a comparatively \n     small minority. This is complicated by the new and very \n     serious phenomenon of suicide bombing. We have demanded from \n     the Palestinians to honor their commitments under the Oslo \n     Agreements, and above all, to join us in fighting this new \n     terrorism organized by the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. There \n     is daily cooperation, there are joint patrols everywhere, but \n     because of the complexities of Arab society we have not \n     been convinced that the Palestinian Authority has been \n     doing its utmost to combat the wave of terrorism. I \n     emphasize that it has done a great deal, and a large \n     number of what could have been tragic events were \n     prevented: but it is just not enough. The closure of the \n     territories and the creation of a dividing wall between \n     Israel and the Palestinians is having a very serious \n     economic effect on the Palestinian population. They will \n     thus have to reach painful decisions for they are entirely \n     dependent on Israel for their economic existence.\n       The phenomenal success of Israel's economy has placed \n     Israel in a dominant position, from an economic point of \n     view, in the area. Israel's annual gross national product is \n     going on 90 billion dollars and is more than the gross \n     national product of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians \n     together. The closure of Israel to labor from the Arab sector \n     will deprive the Palestinian Authority of an income of some \n     $700 million, but these facts do not influence the \n     Fundamentalist activities of the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad \n     who would create chaos throughout the area. The battle is \n     going on in each and every one of the countries against the \n     Fundamentalists, but so long as Iran is the home of terrorism \n     and the finance center of the terrorist activities in the \n     area, we have to adapt ourselves to a long struggle in many \n     countries around us.\n       Let us remember that Israel has been at war with Arab \n     terrorists throughout its history, and the terrorists who \n     have unleashed this present violence have the same goal as \n     their predecessors during the past hundred years--the \n     destruction of Israel.\n       We have always moved forward and pursued our national \n     interest in the face of violence and horror. Most Israelis \n     understand that Palestinian self-rule with security \n     guarantees for Israel is in our interest. This is no time to \n     throw up our hands and declare that the peace process is \n     finished. That would be an admission of defeat unlike any in \n     our history.\n       We did not back down in 1929, when hundreds of innocent \n     Jews were slaughtered by Arabs in Hebron. We did not back \n     down in 1947, when the UN resolution to partition Palestine \n     promoted mass murder and the ransacking of Jewish \n     neighborhoods in Aleppo, Syria, in Aden, Jerusalem, Haifa and \n     Jaffa. We buried our dead, rolled up our sleeves and created \n     a Jewish state.\n       We did not back down in 1948, as Arab armies blocked the \n     roads to Jerusalem and cut off food and weapons from its \n     inhabitants. I was in that city in a building when a bomb \n     destroyed it and nearly killed my wife. After I carried her \n     out of the charred ruins and rushed her to hospital, it never \n     occurred to us to surrender to those who wanted to destroy \n     us. That spirit was nearly universal in our small \n     population--one percent of which was killed in the War of \n     Independence; it animated most Israelis and our supporters \n     around the world in the decades--and wars--ahead.\n       We certainly did not back down under Labor, Likud and \n     national unity governments when hundreds of Israeli men, \n     women and children were killed by all manner of terrorist. We \n     fought against terror while emphasizing our commitment to \n     peace. Israel and the Jewish people need much more of that \n     spirit now.\n       In recent years, the sense of permanent siege that has \n     defined our national experience has begun to lift. But after \n     so many decades of being a pariah state, at times it is hard \n     for many to see that each and every Arab is no longer an \n     enemy. And that is precisely what Hamas wants. As their \n     popularity wanes in the West Bank and Gaza, their only hope \n     is to generate violent conflict by returning to the days when \n     to Israelis, all Arabs were indistinguishable from one \n     another.\n       That is why Hamas has created a new breed of desperate \n     fanatic with sophisticated explosives and the will to die. We \n     must not let them win, and that means not only stopping \n     murder, but also insisting that peace with legitimate \n     Palestinian partners remains our national goal.\n       The effect of the recent terrorist attacks in Israel has \n     been dramatic, leading to the joint initiative of President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Shimon Peres, together with King \n     Hussein and President Mubarak, to convene a summit conference \n     at Sharm el-Sheikh to set up a united international front \n     against the danger of terrorism. We can only be gratified \n     that finally the nations of the world seem to be awakening to \n     the inherent danger of the Terrorist International \n     threatening the free world. We can only hope and trust that \n     the resolutions reached at the summit conference will be \n     strictly adhered to, and what is most important of all, that \n     the organizational aspects of the international struggle \n     against terrorism will be implemented.\n       As I stand here in this building, I cannot but recall the \n     dramatic debate which took place here in July 1976 after the \n     unforgettable rescue by the Israel Defense Forces of the Jews \n     hijacked to Entebbe, Uganda, in an Air France plane. In the \n     course of my remarks in the debate in the Security Council in \n     this very building, I said: ``It has fallen to the lot of my \n     small country, embattled as we are, facing the problems which \n     we do, to demonstrate to the world that there is an \n     alternative to surrender to terrorism and blackmail.\n       ``It has fallen to our lot to prove to the world that this \n     scourge of international terror can be dealt with. It is now \n     for the nations of the world, regardless of political \n     differences which may divide them, to unite against this \n     common enemy which recognizes no authority, knows no \n     borders, respects no sovereignty, ignores all basic human \n     decencies, and places no limits on human bestiality.\n       ``. . . We are proud not only because we have saved the \n     lives of over 100 innocent people--men, women and children--\n     but because of the significance of our act for the cause of \n     human freedom.\n       ``We call on this body to declare war on international \n     terror, to outlaw it and eradicate it wherever it may be. We \n     call on this body, and above all we call on the Member States \n     and countries of the world, to unite in a common effort to \n     place these criminals outside the pale of human society, and \n     with\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\n     them to place any country which cooperates in any way in \n     their nefarious activities.''\n       Mr. Peres has done what an Israeli Prime Minister should do \n     by making it crystal clear that Israel will take stern and--\n     if necessary--unilateral measures to thwart these killers. \n     And he has told Arafat that the Palestinian Authority must \n     prove that it is a real partner by dismantling the terrorist \n     infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza, once and for all.\n       If Arafat does demonstrate the capacity to stop the \n     fanatics, Israel should not take the coward's way out by \n     capitulating to the rejectionists: it should do everything \n     possible to make sure that the Palestinian Authority fulfills \n     its obligations under the Oslo Agreements. It must insist \n     that our security comes first, even as we continue to mourn \n     our dead. That is the brave as well as the sensible thing to \n     do.\n       There is a debate in Israeli society about the advantages \n     or disadvantages of the peace process. When evaluating the \n     possibilities, one has to remember that we are now becoming \n     more and more an integral part of the Middle East. We have \n     relations with many Arab countries; trade with the Arab world \n     is booming; joint projects are being set up on all sides; \n     tens of thousands of Arab tourists are pouring in from Jordan \n     and now from Egypt too; our hospitals are flooded with Arab \n     patients from all over the Middle East. A new form of life is \n     developing which these terrorist organizations see as a great \n     danger to them.\n       When evaluating our reaction to the current events, we must \n     recall that the alternative to moving along the path of the \n     peace process would cause 70% of the Palestinian population \n     which had ceased to use terror as a weapon to return to a \n     tragic and dangerous situation. It would mean a return to the \n     `intifada,' with the terrible consequences of such an ongoing \n     struggle. It would mean, according to some, a return to the \n     alleyways and backyards of Gaza, with all that that \n     implies. The enemy says openly that its purpose is to \n     destroy the peace process, hence nothing could be more \n     counter-productive to our cause than giving in to the \n     terrorists and stopping the process.\n       I emphasize, of course, that we have to insist that our \n     Palestinian interlocutors honor all the obligations which \n     they have taken on themselves, otherwise they know full well \n     that we hold all the strong cards.\n       My friends, only five years have passed since the Gulf War, \n     during which Iraq attacked senselessly with Scud missiles the \n     civilian population of Israel. At that time, the grand \n     alliance organized by President Bush reacted and soundly beat \n     the Iraqi army. But at that time Israel could not convince \n     the alliance that it had a place in it. It is an indication \n     of the long distance we have covered since then and the \n     revolution which has occurred in the Middle East, that this \n     week the leaders of the Arab world and of the free world sat \n     together with the Prime Minister of Israel, who was treated \n     as a full and equal partner in this international struggle \n     against terrorism. This was followed by President Clinton's \n     third visit to Israel, in which a far-reaching agreement on a \n     joint effort to combat terror has reached between the United \n     States and Israel.\n       That is the measure of advance that has occurred in our \n     area, and the degree to which Israel has become an ally of, \n     among others, the leading Arab countries in the Middle East. \n     That is the measure of advance and positive change which we \n     have witnessed in the Middle East.\n       I am convinced that the international effort being made to \n     coordinate the struggle against terrorism will ultimately \n     bear fruit. In the meantime, Israel continues its impressive \n     march along the road to regional peace and economic \n     development, a road along which it is advancing in \n     partnership with the leading Arab countries of the area.\n       Let us not forget the intricate path along which we have \n     advanced; let us not forget the struggle conducted by many \n     others before me who received the award being given tonight; \n     let us not forget that many of our leaders of old would have \n     given their right hands just to see the revolutionary change \n     which has occurred to Israel in the Middle East. We in Israel \n     have lived through very trying and difficult times, but we \n     have always known that our cause is just. Our dedication to \n     that cause is what will advance us to new goals and a new and \n     promising era in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/18/senate-section/article/S2249-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2251-S2253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IMMIGRANTS AND JOBS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. I would like to alert my Senate colleagues to \ntoday's editorial by the Wall Street Journal on why the Congress should \nthink twice before cutting legal immigration.\n  As currently written, the legal immigration reform measures, H.R. \n2202 and S. 1394, would slash legal immigration by nearly half, largely \nthrough the elimination of whole categories of family-sponsored \nimmigration by U.S. citizens. In my judgment, the drastic cuts in legal \nimmigration contemplated in these bills would hurt U.S. economic \ngrowth, job creation; and competitiveness. The fact is that many \nimmigrants contribute to our economic well-being by inventing new \nproducts, starting new entrepreneurial businesses, and creating jobs \nfor Americans: A new study by immigration policy analyst Philip Peters \nfound that one in four patents in this country is created by immigrants \nalone or by immigrants collaborating with U.S. born coinventors. Four \nof the immigrants surveyed in Mr. Peter's study started their own \nbusinesses, generating over 1,600 jobs here in America.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to point out that not all these \ntalented immigrants and entrepreneurs came to America through the \nemployment-based immigration system; some of them, like the Intel \nCorp.'s founder Andrew Grove, arrived through the refugee system. \nOthers came through the family-sponsored system as minor children, \nadult children, and siblings. The bottom line is that restrictions on \nimmigration categories not labeled as ``economic'' will end up hurting \nour economy and our competitiveness.\n  Both the academic literature and empirical evidence strongly suggest \nthat legal immigrants make important positive contributions to American \nsociety. I would hope that my colleagues would keep this fact in mind \nas we debate the merits of the pending legal immigration reform bill. I \nask that the Wall Street Journal article and the study by Mr. Peters be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 18, 1996]\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                           scan the Congress\n\n       First, require all laws that apply to the rest of the \n     country also apply equally to the Congress.--Contract With \n     America, September 27, 1994.\n       Wise words, and we hope they apply to the immigration bill \n     being pushed on the House floor by Congressman Lamar Smith \n     (R., Texas) and up for a vote as early as Tuesday night. By \n     all means, set up a little office in the House gym and let \n     Congresspeople be the first to line up for their retina \n     scans.\n       Indeed, such an amendment was pondered by Colorado Democrat \n     Pat Schroeder, bless her palpitating heart, though it didn't \n     make the long list of amendments and resolutions available \n     Friday. While the Republican Contract also called for a \n     smaller government, Representative Smith's brainstorm would \n     move toward requiring all citizens to get verification from a \n     federal database before they are allowed to take a new job. \n     Like the Senate version of the bill, it would also pilot a \n     ``voluntary'' national ID system, although both sides, for \n     the moment, seem to be backing away from the sinister \n     biometric identifiers such as retina scans we heard about \n     earlier.\n       The ID system is an ornament, of course, on the bill \n     reducing legal immigration by nearly half, cutting family \n     reunions and slashing the intake of refugees. It at least has \n     the virtue of not hiding behind arguments about illegal \n     immigration; it is purely a mean-spirited outburst against \n     legal immigration. The horde of amendments and resolutions \n     try to separate ``good'' immigrants--former H'Mong soldiers, \n     for example, from ``bad'' immigrants--parents of citizens, \n     for example. All of this is to be decided by a Congress that \n     routinely deplores micromanagement from inside the Beltway; \n     proposals to vitiate the family unification principle for \n     immigration come from the same lips that deplore the decline \n     of family values.\n       The reality of the immigration contribution to American \n     society comes clear in a study by Philip Peters of the Alexis \n     de Tocqueville Institute. As a proxy for intellectual and \n     economic contribution, Mr. Peters looked at recent U.S. \n     patents. He found that one patent in four in this country is \n     created by immigrants or immigrants working with U.S.-born \n     engineers or investors. This is three times their presence in \n     our population (8.7%), so presumably immigrants are out there \n     doing more than their share to keep the U.S. competitive with \n     Japan.\n       Nor of course did all the patenters in the Tocqueville \n     study enter the country on skilled worker visas. Take \n     Alexander Owczarz (O-zarz), a product development engineer \n     who stopped counting after registering his 25th U.S. patent. \n     Mr. Owczarz reckons that one recent patent alone generated 20 \n     jobs at Semitool, the Kalispell, Montana, exporter where he \n     works. Mr. Owczarz is a citizen now, but he entered this \n     country on a tourist visa when he got sick of Communist \n     Poland. Nineteen-nineties restrictionists would expel people \n     like Mr. Owczarz when they overstay their visa.\n       Or how about refugees? Mr. Smith would cut them. \n     Tocqueville found Ernesto E. Blanco, a professor at MIT who \n     fled Havana in 1960 on a visa provided through a special \n     accelerated program to rescue Cubans from Castro. Mr. Blanco \n     has 13 patents, including a flexible arm that makes \n     endoscopic surgery easier. There are more famous examples: \n     Smith-Simpson-style legislation would bar the door to the \n     future equivalents of Intel's Hungarian refugee, Andrew \n     Grove. For that matter, another big job creator in Silicon \n     Valley, Borland International, was founded by an illegal \n     immigrant, Philippe Kahn.\n       In recent days we've seen growing recognition of these \n     points. On the Senate side, Spencer Abraham was able to \n     defeat the far\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\n     more senior Alan Simpson, and split the Senate legislation \n     into two bills, on legal and illegal immigration. On the \n     House side Congressmen Dick Chrysler (R., Michigan), Sam \n     Brownback (R., Kansas), Howard Berman (D., California) and \n     Phil Crane (R., Illinois) were able to squeeze an unfriendly \n     rules committee into letting them offer an amendment that \n     would remove all Mr. Smith's cutbacks on legal, family-\n     sponsored immigration. Steve Chabot, a freshman Republican, \n     and John Conyers, a Democrat, are offering an amendment to \n     strike the odious ID system.\n       For freshmen Republicans, this is an issue of heritage. Put \n     bluntly, are they children of Ronald Reagan and the House \n     Contract, or Pat Buchanan and his nativist campaign? Between \n     Senator Simpson and Representative Smith, all of the noxious \n     provisions are likely to come back with the conference \n     committee report. The best hope is that the bills will fall \n     on their own weight, like Hillary Clinton's health-care \n     boondoggle, and that the issue can be taken up by another \n     Congress where cooler heads prevail.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Made in the USA: Immigrants, Patents, and Jobs\n\n\n                           Executive summary\n\n       In an effort to quantify the contribution of immigrants to \n     U.S. technological innovation, the Alexis de Tocqueville \n     Institution performed a study of recent U.S. patents. Using a \n     random selection of 1988 and 1994 patents, we found:\n       Based on the responses to our survey, about one patent in \n     four (26.4%) is created by immigrants alone or by immigrants \n     collaborating with U.S.-born co-inventors.\n       Based on our entire sample (i.e. counting nonresponses as \n     nonimmigrant inventors), about one patent in five (19.2%) \n     involves immigrants as sole or co-inventors. That's a \n     conservative estimate with a 5% margin of error.\n       Immigrants account for about 8.7% of the U.S. population. \n     Hence, the study shows immigrants to be more than twice as \n     likely as the general population to generate patented \n     innovations.\n\n\n      overview: immigrants contribute twice their share of patents\n\n       Scores of anecdotes have created a poetic image of \n     immigrants who arrive as refugees, students, laborers or \n     professionals and go on to create products, companies and \n     even entire industries. But beyond the anecdotes, can the \n     contributions of immigrants to America's industrial cutting \n     edge be quantified?\n       The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) endeavored to \n     do this by using a well known indicator of technological \n     innovation--issuance of new patents--to measure immigrants' \n     inventiveness and spirit of enterprise.\n       Examining 250 recently issued U.S. patents chosen at \n     random, AdTI found that over 19% of the patents in our sample \n     (48 patents) were issued to immigrants alone or to immigrants \n     collaborating with U.S.-born co-inventors. This is over twice \n     immigrants' proportion of the U.S. population--8.7%. \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The immigrant inventors identified in our study include \n     researchers, executives, entrepreneurs and an MIT professor. \n     Four started their own businesses, generating over 1,600 \n     jobs. Their innovations include: A system that protects \n     Americans troops inside a front-line combat vehicle from \n     chemical, biological and nuclear contamination; 100 sensors \n     used on the space shuttle, all produced by a company founded \n     by an immigrant inventor, now employing 1500 people; \n     components of GE electric power generators that are exported \n     to Japan; a machine made by a Montana company that generated \n     $10 million in sales last year, and is expected to generate \n     $15 million in sales to both U.S. and export markets this \n     year.\n       The economic contributions of immigrant inventors are worth \n     considering at a time when Congress is debating legislation \n     to reduce all categories of legal immigration, including \n     specially skilled workers. American high-tech firms rely on \n     skilled foreign workers to meet particular needs. For \n     example, Microsoft software developers are about 95% U.S.-\n     born, yet the company finds it ``absolutely essential'' to \n     draw on the technical and cultural knowledge that foreign-\n     born employees can bring, according to Microsoft Chairman \n     Bill Gates. New restrictions on the entry of skilled foreign \n     workers or their families ``will really put pressure on us to \n     do a major portion of our software development outside the \n     United States,'' Gates says.\\2\\ A U.S.-born inventor \n     contacted in this study said immigrants are a ``very valuable \n     asset for American science and technology. . . . You need a \n     constant influx of new ideas and new points of view.'' \\3\\\n       Our findings seem to justify concerns long expressed by \n     foreign governments about the ``brain drain''--the economic \n     loss they suffer when highly skilled citizens emigrate to \n     pursue careers overseas. For example, nearly 2,000 \n     professional or semi-professional South African citizens \n     emigrated in 1994. As a result, some South Africans are \n     concerned that emigration means fewer jobs, a smaller \n     tax base and zero return on the state's investment in \n     educating physicians and other professionals. ``For every \n     emigrant--they are mostly highly qualified--at least ten \n     local people lose their jobs,'' said Karen Theron of South \n     Africa's Central Economics Advisory Services.\\4\\\n\n\n                      immigrant inventors' stories\n\n       As immigrant inventors were identified in the study, the \n     author conducted interviews with many of them. They described \n     their work and their motivations for coming to America, and \n     offered some thoughts as to why the United States attracts \n     inventive people and why they are productive in the U.S. work \n     environment. Some of the information gathered in those \n     interviews follows: The inventors' patent numbers are noted \n     in parentheses.\n       Fred Kavli is Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Kavlico \n     Corporation in Moore Park, California. Kavli immigrated from \n     Norway in 1956 with a physics degree in hand, and founded the \n     company on a shoestring two years later. ``This was the land \n     of opportunity--especially then,'' he told us. ``There was no \n     other country I could go to to do that.''\n       Kavlico makes sensors, primarily for aeronautical controls \n     and automotive pollution controls. One hundred Kavlico \n     sensors operate on the space shuttle.\n       Kyong Park is Kavlico's Vice President for Research and \n     Development. A physicist, he came to the U.S. from Korea in \n     1969 to pursue his education. Park joined Kavlico in 1977 and \n     holds 24 patents.\n       With Kavli's assistance, Park was able to stay in the \n     United States to pursue his career. He preferred to stay here \n     because Korea was under a ``corrupt'' military government in \n     the 1970's, where bribery was rife and ``only people with \n     connections had opportunity,'' he said. ``Here, if you work \n     hard you have opportunity. People from outside really \n     appreciate this society and this culture.''\n       According to Kavli, Kyong Park was ``instrumental'' in the \n     pressure sensor development that brought Kavlico into the \n     automotive pollution control market. This has helped to \n     propel Kavlico's growth from $4 million in sales and 120 \n     employees in 1977 to $150 million in sales and 1,500 \n     employees today.\n       Park was reticent to be interviewed, explaining that he \n     does not seek special recognition for his work. But he did \n     describe an experience at a recent company picnic. A \n     colleague pointed to the 3,000 employees and family members \n     and told Park, ``See, all these people are making a living \n     because of your hard work.'' ``I never thought of it that \n     way,'' Park said. ``I felt good that I have helped not just \n     my family, but many of those people too.'' (Kavli/Park joint \n     patent 1988/4735098)\n       Ram Labhaya Malik of San Jose, California immigrated from \n     India in 1971. An engineer, he is co-inventor of an air \n     purification system now in use in the Army's Bradley Fighting \n     Vehicle, a front-line troop carrier. The system protects \n     personnel inside from nuclear, chemical and biological \n     contamination. One of his co-inventors immigrated from the \n     Netherlands, the other is U.S.-born. (1988/4793832)\n       Richard Baker is founder and president of Membrane \n     Technologies of Menlo Park, California. A native of the \n     United Kingdom, he came to the U.S. to pursue post-doctoral \n     studies, was offered a job and immigrated in 1966. He holds a \n     Ph.D. in chemistry and has 57 patents. His company employs 30 \n     people. Membrane Technologies produces and sells air \n     purification systems and conducts scientific research under \n     government contract. (1944/5364629)\n       Aleksander Owczarz is a mechanical engineer at Semitool \n     Inc., a Kalispell, Montana company that makes capital \n     equipment for the semiconductor industry. Dissatisfied with \n     the system in Poland (``It was not my cup of tea''), he \n     emigrated in 1978 to seek new opportunity in the United \n     States. He stopped counting his patents when his 25th was \n     issued. His latest patent is for a precision cleaning machine \n     for wafer boxes and wafer carriers. Over 20 Semitool \n     employees work full-time manufacturing that machine. It is \n     sold in the U.S., Europe and Asia; sales were $10 million in \n     1995 and are projected to grow to $15 million this year. \n     ``It's not just bright people'' that lead to technological \n     innovation, he said. ``The combination of bright individuals \n     and the right environment is what makes people productive \n     here.'' (1944/5357991)\n       Ernest Blanco immigrated from Cuba in 1960 and teaches \n     engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He \n     holds thirteen patents. In our sample, we found a design for \n     a flexible arm for medical endoscopes (diagnostic and \n     surgical devices) that he and a student created for Johnson & \n     Johnson. Discussing the propensity of immigrants to work hard \n     in scientific and technological research, he said, ``It's the \n     environment here and the way we immigrants thing about the \n     United States as a land where great inventions are being \n     made. Immigrants feel the way to break the economic barrier \n     is to invent something that will be of use to large numbers \n     of Americans. We become worthy by using our brains.'' (1994/\n     5348259)\n       Anatoly Galperin, an engineer, came to the U.S. as a \n     refugee from Russia in 1989. He works for the Miller Edge \n     company in Concordville, Pennsylvania. In Russia, he worked \n     in telecommunications; here, his field is sensors, including \n     the invention found in our sample: a safety feature \n     (``sensing Edge'') of mechanical doors sold throughout the \n     U.S. and to some overseas customers. (1994/5299387)\n       Michael Pryor of Woodbridge, Connecticut immigrated from \n     England in 1953 with a doctorate in metallurgy. He holds 130 \n     U.S. patents, and become vice President for Metals\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\n     Research at the Olin Corporation in 1973. He is now retired. \n     At Olin, he calculated that the research department he \n     directed produced a three-to-one monetary return. Its \n     innovations include alloys, manufacturing processes, and the \n     process used to produce the metal composites needed to mint \n     quarters and dimes ever since the 90 percent silver-10 \n     percent copper blend was discontinued. Pryor recruited both \n     U.S.-born and immigrant scientists for his labs, and \n     expressed particular admiration for Indian and Asian \n     metallurgists. ``I didn't hire immigrants because I wanted \n     to,'' he said, ``there were just not enough U.S. citizens \n     graduating to fill up the ranks--there was too much \n     competition from other labs and universities.'' (1988/\n     4781050)\n       Angela Michaels of Elkhart, Indiana is a chemist who works \n     for the Bayer Corporation. She immigrated from Italy in 1962. \n     She holds six patents; all are in use in Bayer's products, \n     including ``dip and read'' urinalysis strips for kidney \n     disease detection. (1988/4717658)\n       Sung Kwon of Burnsville, Minnesota was among many investors \n     drawn to the United States for educational opportunity. After \n     completing his undergraduate work at the best university of \n     Korea, he came to the University of Minnesota in 1965 to \n     pursue the advanced engineering studies that was ``not \n     available in Korea.'' He is now employed at Thermo King \n     Corporation (a Westinghouse division) and holds seven US \n     patents. (1994/5288643)\n       Jacob Haller and his family immigrated to the United States \n     from the former Yugoslavia in 1955.

Emconn makes equipment for the electrical connector \n     industry; its customers are the major telecommunications \n     companies. After building the company up to 20 employees, \n     Haller sold the manufacturing operation and now works with \n     one other employee developing new products.

This study was performed by contacting inventors \n     whose inventions resulted in U.S. patents issued in 1988 and \n     1994. To generate a random sample of 250 patents approved in \n     1988 and 1994, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution created \n     a random list of patent numbers from those years, and drew \n     our sample from that list.\\5\\ This process generated patents \n     issued to both U.S. and foreign inventors. Excluding the \n     patents issued to inventors living overseas, we were left \n     with a sample of 122 1988 patents and 128 1994 patents.

Because we \n     effectively counted as non-immigrants those inventors who did \n     not respond or could not be reached, our finding of 19.2% \n     immigrant inventors is probably conservative.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     1. 1994 foreign-born population as a percentage of total U.S. \n     population, based on the Census Bureau's Current Population \n     Survey.\n     2.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the inclusion of the National Grasslands within the \n     National Forest System has prevented the Secretary of \n     Agriculture from effectively administering and promoting \n     grassland agriculture on National Grasslands as originally \n     intended under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act;\n       (2) the National Grasslands can be more effectively managed \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture if administered as a separate \n     entity outside of the National Forest System; and\n       (3) a grazing program on National Grasslands can be \n     responsibly carried out while protecting and preserving \n     recreational, environmental, and other multiple uses of the \n     National Grasslands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     improved management and more efficient administration of \n     grazing activities on National Grasslands while preserving \n     and protecting multiple uses of such lands, including but not \n     limited to preserving hunting, fishing, and recreational \n     activities, and protecting wildlife habitat in accordance \n     with applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 203.
