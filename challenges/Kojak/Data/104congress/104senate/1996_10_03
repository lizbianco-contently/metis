THOMAS, Chairman.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\n\nuntil 10 a.m. be equally divided between the proponents and opponents, \nmyself managing the legislation for this side, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, managing for the other side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, perhaps we could have information \nconcerning the division of that time. I would guess it is less than 1 \nhour equally divided. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To be exact, it is 56 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, since the Senator from Massachusetts is \nnot here, I will begin with an opening statement. I allow myself 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about this critical aviation bill for a \nfew minutes, and I want to begin with the most important part of it. \nThat is the section that has to do with aviation safety.\n  This bill has some very important and critical aviation safety items \nincluded in it. We all know how important and compelling a problem this \nis and a challenge for America and the world. We continue, \nunfortunately, to have serious airline accidents that continue to take \nplace not only in this country but around the world, including the \nlatest being another tragedy in Peru just in the last several hours. \nThere is no doubt that aviation safety is a vital and compelling issue \nand one on which I believe we have made important progress in this \nbill.\n\n  Specifically, this legislation eliminates the dual mandate and \nreiterates safety being the highest priority for the FAA. This \nlegislation facilitates the flow to the FAA of operational and safety \ninformation, and the FAA may withhold voluntarily submitted \ninformation.\n  It authorizes the FAA to establish standards for the certification of \nsmall airports so as to improve safety at such airports.\n  It mandates that the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, \nand the FAA must work together to improve the system for accident and \nsafety data classification so as to make it more accessible and \nconsumer friendly and then publish such accident data.\n  It requires pilot record sharing. It requires the sharing of a \npilot's employment records between former and prospective employers to \nassure marginally qualified pilots are not hired.\n  It also discourages attempts by child pilots to set records or \nperform other aeronautical feats.\n  Also, Mr. President, it requires that the Federal Aviation Agency and \nthe National Transportation Safety Board work together on this terrible \nissue, very difficult issue of notification of the next of kin. Every \ntime there is one of these crashes, there is a problem as far as the \nnotification of the loved ones, and it was an obligation of ours to \nwork this out. There have been a number of hearings following these \ntragedies, and we hear the compelling stories of the lack of \nnotification, wrongful notification, and lack of sensitivity in the \ncare and services provided to the family members. We have to clean this \nup and we do that in this bill.\n  As far as aviation security is concerned, Mr. President, it requires \nthe FAA to study and to report to Congress on whether some security \nresponsibilities should be transferred from the airlines to airports \nand/or the Federal Government. I do not think there is any of us today \nwho believe that security at airports is at the level we want it to be, \nand a very recent inspector general report clearly indicated that. We \nhave to do a much better job.\n  The FAA in this legislation is directed to certify companies \nproviding airport security screening.\n  It bolsters weapons and explosive detection technology by encouraging \nresearch and development. As you know, Mr. President, the only \navailable technology today is very expensive, very large, very slow and \nsometimes not completely mission fulfilling. I believe that there is \nthe technological capability out there in America and the world to \ndevelop the kind of weapons and explosive detection technology that we \ncan put in place in our airports in a short period of time.\n  This legislation requires that background and criminal history \nrecords checks be conducted on airport security screeners and their \nsupervisors.\n  It requires the FAA to facilitate interim deployment of currently \navailable explosive detection equipment.\n  It requires the FAA to audit the effectiveness of criminal history \nrecords checks.\n  It encourages the FAA to assist in the development of passenger \nprofiling systems.\n  It permits the Airport Improvement Program and Passenger Facility \nCharge funds to be used for aviation safety and security projects at \nairports.\n  The FAA and FBI must develop an aviation security liaison agreement.\n  The FAA and FBI must carry out joint threat assessments of high-risk \nairports.\n  It requires the periodic assessment of airport and air carrier \nsecurity systems.\n  And it requires a report to Congress on recommendations to enhance \nand supplement screening of air cargo.\n  Mr. President, there is more aviation safety and security benefits in \nthis bill which I will cover later this morning. There is a requirement \nto enhance airline and air traveler safety by requiring airlines to \nshare employment and performance records before hiring new pilots, as I \nmentioned before.\n  But most important, it provides for the thorough reform of the FAA, \nincluding the long-term funding reform of the FAA to secure the \nresources to ensure we continue to have the safest, most efficient air \ntransportation system in the world.\n  For a long period of time we worked on a bipartisan basis with the \nSecretary of Transportation, the Director and Deputy Director of the \nFAA, in trying to come up with ways to fund our national aviation \nsystem and its safety and security-related aspects. Right now the \nnational air transportation system is primarily funded by the airline \nticket tax, which accounts for more than $6 billion of the $9 billion \nthat is necessary to fund the FAA on an annual basis. Unfortunately, \nthe discretionary budget caps will simply not provide the budget \nflexibility to continue to fund today's service levels from the FAA, \nlet alone the funding necessary over the next several years to meet the \ncontinued growth anticipated in virtually every facet of aviation. We \nmust be able to fund the FAA and the national air transportation system \nin America through user fees. Those that use the system should be \nrequired to pay their fair share to provide a stable source of funding \nfor the FAA's critical safety and operational activities and not the \ngeneral taxpayer.\n  This bill sets up a 21-member commission which will make \nrecommendations which will be required to be acted on in a relatively \nshort period of time so we can come up with this very important, \nstable, and critical funding of the national air transportation system.\n  Again, I cannot help but mention one other aspect of this problem \nthat is a clear dereliction of duty on the part of the Congress, and \nthat is, on December 31, 1996, the airline ticket tax is going to lapse \nagain. At the present time the airline ticket tax, with the addition of \ngeneral taxpayer dollars, is the major method of funding aviation in \nAmerica. Congress let it lapse last Christmas and it lapsed for a long \nperiod of time--until just a few months ago. During that time, the \naviation trust fund was depleted by $5 billion. I think it will be a \nterrible thing, a terrible thing, to let this Congress go out of \nsession--which we probably will--without reinstating the ticket tax, \nwhich is going to expire on December 31, 1996.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues and I know my friend, Senator Ford \nof Kentucky, feels as strongly as I do, as does the chairman and \nranking member of the committee, Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings. \nWe are going to address this issue early in the 105th Congress in \nwhatever way we can. We cannot allow this fund to be depleted so we are \nunable to fund these much-needed aviation safety, airport security, and \nair traffic control modernization projects in America.\n  I am not going to point at specific committees or specific Members of \nthe Senate or the House. But to allow the airline ticket tax to lapse \nis a violation of our fundamental obligations to the American people, \nand that is to ensure their safety and security. We cannot do that \nwithout adequate and stable long-\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\nterm funding. So I want to again enter a plea, especially to the \nFinance Committee, that we address this issue as soon as possible early \nin the next Congress.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. Then I am going \nto yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, as we are gathered here this morning, I want to \nreiterate our position with regard to the FAA bill. Those of us who \noppose the addition of the special interest provision are in support of \nthe FAA conference report otherwise. We had indicated we were quite \nglad to put that whole conference report on the continuing resolution. \nWe could have done that on Monday and we would not be here today.\n\n  We would have taken an independent bill, a freestanding bill without \nthis provision, and passed it either Monday when the House was in or \nany other day in the belief the House would accept it.\n  So we do not yield to any of our colleagues in our interest in moving \nahead with the FAA conference report. But what we find unconscionable \nis the inclusion of this special interest provision which is going to \ndisadvantaged working men and women who are trying to play by the rules \nof the game and whose interests would effectively be compromised by \nthis particular provision.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as Senator Kennedy said, everyone is for \nthe FAA bill. The question is this amendment that was tacked on that \nwas neither in the House version nor in the Senate version. Let us just \ngo over what it does again. It benefits one company--one company. It \ninterferes in litigation. The Presiding Officer, Senator Thurmond, for \nwhom I have come to have great respect, has seen in the Judiciary \nCommittee that when we interfere in litigation, with rare exceptions we \nmake a mistake in the U.S. Congress.\n  Third, it interferes in a labor-management negotiation that is going \non. We should not be taking one side or another. I do not know who is \nright. All I know is Congress should not be deciding this.\n  We interfere also in a competitive situation. How does this affect \nUPS? How does it affect the Postal Service? How does it affect other \ncompetitors? No one knows. But people can sure guess.\n  Then, finally, the process is wrong. We have not had a hearing on \nthis. The committee of jurisdiction has not had a hearing on this very \ncomplicated and, obviously, controversial labor-management issue. It \nhas been rejected. Just a few weeks ago the Appropriations Committee \nrejected this very amendment. Yet we see it sliding in on a conference \ncommittee here.\n  What it does, in essence, is it says Federal Express and all its \nemployees are to fall under regulations that govern airlines. It so \nhappens Federal Express has about 35,000 truck drivers who, under this \nlegislation now, are going to be considered like airline pilots as far \nas labor-management relations. That is not the way to govern.\n  It may be this is very meritorious. Let us have a hearing. Let us go \nthrough the normal process. But it should not be stuck on in a \nconference when neither the House nor the Senate had it, when this has \nbeen rejected several times by both the House and the Senate.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will let the Senator from Louisiana get his own time \nhere.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I just was going to ask a question of the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. You may ask a very brief question.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Isn't the current situation that Federal Express in its \ntotal package is considered under the Railway Labor Act right now? Is \nthat not the current situation? Is it the current situation that \nFederal Express is considered to come under the Railway Labor Act now?\n  Mr. SIMON. It is a matter of controversy right now before the \nNational Labor Relations Board, as I understand it. What we are doing \nis we are moving in and making a decision. That is not the way we ought \nto operate here.\n  We ought to have a hearing. We ought to proceed in the normal way. \nThis is obviously a matter of controversy. This is not how you solve \ncontroversies and how you make good legislation.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts has 22 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 13 minutes.\n  Mr. President, regardless of the outcome of today's vote, this week \nof debate has already accomplished something very important for the \nAmerican people. It has placed a spotlight on a cynical Republican \nattempt to help one of their corporate friends at the expense of that \ncompany's employees.\n  They had hoped to carry out their scheme in the shadows, so that no \none would recognize the injustice that was being done. That part of the \nRepublican plan has already failed. The entire country now knows that \nthe Republican Congress is ending as it began, with an assault on \nworking men and women and their families. Key Republicans in Congress \nhave conspired with Federal Express to amend the Railway Labor Act in \norder to deprive Federal Express workers of their right to form a local \nunion. The company is bent on obtaining this unfair advantage before \nthe Republican Congress adjourns, because they know that a Democratic \nCongress will never approve this special interest provision.\n\n  Truck drivers employed by Federal Express in Pennsylvania began \norganizing a union several years ago, because they had not received a \nraise in more than 7 years. They were also worried about worker safety \nand about losing their jobs to subcontractors and seeing full-time jobs \ncut back to part time. It is unconscionable for the Senate to intervene \non the side of Federal Express management to deny those workers their \nbasic rights under the National Labor Relations Act.\n  Mr. President, this is not a technical correction. Rider proponents \nfalsely claim that this is a technical correction to an inadvertent \naction taken in the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of \n1995. This is substantive. The Congressional Research Service analyzed \nthe ICC Termination Act and found ``The deletion of express companies \nfrom section 1 of the RLA does not appear to have been inadvertent or \nmistaken.'' That is an independent judgment made by the Congressional \nResearch Service after reviewing the history, reviewing the conference \nitself and evaluating the various documents.\n  Second, the administration does not consider this to be technical. \nLet me, again, read the letter from the Office of Management and \nBudget, representing the position of the administration and the \nPresident:\n\n       The administration believes that the provision is not a \n     technical amendment in transportation law. In fact, it could \n     result in a significant shift of the relationship between \n     certain workers and management.\n\n  They recognize that it is not a technical correction.\n  The Democratic members of the House Aviation Subcommittee have also \nrecognized that this is not a technical correction. Read the debate \nover in the House of Representatives and you will see it. Every \nDemocratic member of the Aviation Subcommittee points out that this is \nnot a technical correction, and the Parliamentarian of the House of \nRepresentatives made a judgment that it was not a technical correction \nand required the House of Representatives to have an independent vote \non this measure.\n  Mr. President, the history of the FedEx rider in the House and Senate \nis out there for every Member of this body to understand. They never \nhad a hearing on a rider in the House Aviation Subcommittee or the full \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee; never had a hearing on the \nrider in the Senate Aviation Subcommittee or full Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\n  House Republicans tried to attach this to the fiscal 1996 omnibus \nappropriations bill and failed. House Republicans tried to attach it to \nthe National Transportation Safety Board Authorization Act, and it \nfailed. House Republicans tried to attach it to the Railroad \nUnemployment Act Amendments, and it failed.\n  Senate Republicans supported attaching it to the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill in the Appropriations Committee, and it failed. The \nrider was not on the FAA Reauthorization Act when it passed the House, \nand it wasn't when it passed the Senate. The rider was added in the \nreauthorization conference committee just before the end of this \nconference.\n  Mr. President, now that we know that it is not technical, now that we \nknow that this has been pursued constantly by the Republican leadership \nin the House of Representatives, supported overwhelmingly by the \nRepublican Members in the House of Representatives, with opposition by \nan overwhelming majority of Democrats in the House, we will see a \nsimilar reflection of that here later on this morning.\n  Mr. President, this issue is in litigation. The Federal Express truck \ndrivers started organizing in 1991. In December of 1991, the Federal \nExpress truck drivers filed a petition with the NLRB for an election to \ndecide whether a majority of them desire representation. This matter is \ncurrently in litigation. The number of the case is 4-RC-17968.\n  There are Members who say it is not in litigation. It is in \nlitigation, and it is before the NLRB and in active consideration at \nthis time. What we are doing by this action is wiping out the \nopportunity for that issue to be adjudicated by the NLRB. We are \nstacking the deck for one side. We are refusing to let the National \nLabor Relations Board make a judgment about the truck drivers.\n  The fact of the matter is, UPS has a situation almost exactly the \nsame as Federal Express: Those workers who are associated with the \nairlines are considered employees of air carriers, and thus covered by \nthe Railway Labor Act, while those who drive the trucks are under the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  Federal Express has been declared an air carrier, and they should be \nwith regard to their air operation. The question now is, what about the \ntruck drivers who drive for Federal Express? What about Federal \nExpress's proposed expansion, such that the principal part of their \noperation is going to be in trucks rather than in the air? That is a \nlegitimate issue. It is currently before the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  Supporters of this rider are saying that those grievances, those \nrights, those interests of working men and women are going to be \nvitiated because of the power of Federal Express, one single company. \nWe are legislating for one single company, make no mistake about it.\n  Mr. President, why do I call this Federal Express amendment a \nRepublican ploy? Let me show you the evidence, and it is overwhelming. \nIn the House, the key advocates of this amendment were Members of the \nRepublican leadership, and each and every time it was offered in the \nHouse, it was offered on behalf of the Republican leadership. They \nvoted in the House and closely followed party lines: of the 218 Members \nwho voted for it, 199 were Republicans. 198 Members of Congress opposed \nit; 168 of those voting no were Democrats.\n  On the cloture motion that we will be voting on shortly, nearly all \nRepublicans will vote to keep the amendment in the bill, and a solid \nmajority of Democrats will vote against cloture in order to remove the \noffensive Federal Express provision.\n  This antiworker amendment is clearly a Republican ploy for another \nreason. It is consistent with what they have done throughout this \nsession, whether it has been to eliminate the Davis-Bacon Act or to gut \nother worker protection laws. The average construction worker--may we \nhave order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have seen the Republican leadership \ntry to compromise the incomes of construction workers, the second most \ndangerous industry in the United States, with five times more accidents \nthan any other group of workers in this country. The average income of \na construction worker is $27,500 a year. Yet the Republicans made an \neffort time after time after time here in the Senate of the United \nStates and in the House of Representatives to undermine their income.\n  There was opposition to the increase in the minimum wage. The story \nis there and has been written. Republicans fought it every single step \nof the way, although hard-working families who are at the bottom rung \nof the economic ladder, who are our teachers' aides, who work in \nnursing homes as health care aides, who clean buildings for the \nAmerican free enterprise system--these are hard-working men and women \nwho have families, and we believe that hard work ought to be rewarded \nand that we should not deny those hard-working Americans a decent \nincome. The Republicans oppose that.\n  Whether it was on Davis-Bacon, the increase in the minimum wage, or \nthe earned-income tax credit, which benefits workers who earn less than \n$30,000, on each and every one of those issues involving workers' \nrights, the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate fought us \ntooth and nail. They fought us tooth and nail at the beginning of the \nCongress, and the last act of this Congress will be to undermine the \nlegitimate rights of working men and women who are only trying to play \nby the rules under the National Labor Relations Act.\n  The Federal Express workers may be able to persuade their coworkers \nto support organizing or they may not, but they shouldn't have the rug \npulled out from under them as Republicans have tried to do to other \nworkers over the period of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, if someone is watching this debate today, they might \nthink we are arguing about a labor bill. Mr. President, we are not \narguing about a labor bill. Whether Federal Express can have one union \nor six unions is not the purpose of this bill, nor should it be the \nfocus of this debate, nor should it have held up this Senate for the \nlast 4 days.\n  Because the issue here is whether we are going to reauthorize the FAA \nand give them the tools they need to keep our airlines and our airports \nsafe. That is the issue. That is the importance of sending this bill to \nthe President. Because if we get bottled up in other extraneous issues \nand procedures, Mr. President, what we are going to lose is the ability \nfor the FAA to immediately deploy certification of the detection \nequipment that is necessary to protect air traffic passengers, the \nprotection against terrorist bombs. That is what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  The detection equipment we have today was put in place when we had \nhijacking as a problem in this country. And since that equipment has \nbeen put in place, we have not had hijackings of airlines in America. \nBut that is not the same type of equipment you need to detect the \nsophisticated bombs that have been able to be put in buildings and \nairplanes around the world, or subway systems. So what we are trying to \ndo is protect the traveling public.\n  We are seeing smokescreens here about minute labor issues, and we are \nseeing procedural measures taken against a very important big-picture \nbill that will give the FAA the tools it needs. It will allow the FBI \nand the FAA to collaborate in every high-risk airport city. We need the \nFBI to work with the FAA because they have unique capabilities that are \nnot there in the FAA. So we need that to happen. It can start today. \nBaggage match, something that is done for foreign travel, will now be \nlooked at to see if we can do it domestically, so that if a passenger \ngets on a plane, we will know that that passenger is matched to bags in \nthe compartment beneath, and we will not have bags going on a plane \nwithout the passenger that checked that bag in.\n  We need to be able to allow the passenger facility charges and the \nfees\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\nthat go on the airline tickets to be used for antiterrorism and safety \nmeasures. That will be authorized in this bill.\n  Mr. President, we are not looking at deciding in Congress and \nspending 4 days of Congress' time to determine whether FedEx is going \nto have one union or six. Our purpose here today is to pass a bill that \nprotects every American and every visitor to our country who is \ntraveling in airports and on airplanes with the safety they deserve. We \ncan do it if we will keep our eye on the ball and do what is \nresponsible for the U.S. Senate. It would be irresponsible for us to \nallow some minor disagreement on a labor matter that does not have to \nbe decided by Congress to, in fact, hold up a bill that will provide \nsafety for flying passengers in America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you.\n  There has been some confusion in this body about whether this is a \nbig issue or little issue, technical issue or substantive issue. Well, \nI think the argument that this is somehow just a technical debate has \nbeen pretty well shredded by the reality of what has happened this \nweek.\n  Let me just quickly read again from the letter from the Office of the \nPresident, the administration, from Franklin Raines, of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, which says:\n\n       The administration believes that the provision is not a \n     ``technical amendment'' to transportation labor law. In fact, \n     it could result in a significant shift of the relationship \n     between certain workers and management. We hope Congress \n     will not jeopardize aviation safety, security, and \n     investment initiatives as it comes to closure on this \n     issue.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Texas just again tried the ploy of \nsaying this is a minor issue. She said, a ``minute'' labor issue. Well, \ndoes anyone believe, after the almost herculean effort to keep this \nprovision in, that this is a minor issue? This is a major, major issue \nto one very powerful corporation in this country.\n  Let us focus again on what this intense major debate is about. It is \nabout whether one powerful corporation is going to be able to get its \nway in the closing hours of this Congress and push through a special \ninterest provision aimed at only one thing --it is aimed at only one \nthing: protecting this powerful company from its workers trying to form \na union.\n  Mr. President, this apparently is not the only time that this \ncorporation, Federal Express, has used this type of procedure to \nbenefit its own interests. Let me say here, I do not think Federal \nExpress is a bad corporation. Obviously, it provides tremendously \nimportant services in our economy, as do other services, such as UPS. \nBut you cannot ignore the record.\n  Last night, I and other Members of the Senate received a letter from \nPublic Citizen, a nonpartisan public interest group. They express \nfrequently a direct interest in the way this body does business. This \nis what Public Citizen wrote about the effort to push FedEx's special \ninterest provision through in the FAA conference report. They said:\n\n       This is not the first time or the second time that Federal \n     Express has used last-minute tactics to gain passage of \n     controversial amendments to law. In the 1990 aviation \n     authorization bill, with no hearings, exemption from local \n     noise requirements for aircraft were pushed through. In the \n     1994 aviation authorization bill, Federal Express was \n     involved in getting preemption of State regulation of truck \n     prices, routes and services through the Congress with no \n     hearings in the Senate where the amendment was added to an \n     unrelated bill and only a last-minute hearing in the House \n     during the conference negotiations. State officials were \n     outraged at the way this was maneuvered. In 1995, motor \n     carrier safety standards were eliminated for Federal Express \n     type trucks in the National Highway System legislation. In \n     1996, the anti-labor provision Federal Express seeks to get \n     enacted in the aviation authority conference report is [just] \n     the most recent in a long string of such maneuvers.\n       These issues [they say] are major public policies that \n     deserve appropriate hearings and evaluation. The public is \n     already angry about the way wealthy business interests \n     dominate the congressional decision-making process. This \n     history of Federal Express sponsored legislation, combined \n     with the millions of dollars it spends each year lobbying, \n     campaign contributions, and providing air transportation \n     services to key members of Congress, undermines our \n     democratic system. Federal Express has a long history of \n     opposition to government regulations. But when they want to \n     block their employees' efforts to form a union and gain an \n     unfair advantage over their competitors, the sky's the limit \n     on money and political muscle they will use to get their own \n     customized regulatory protection made into law.\n\n  Those are words by Joan Claybrook from Public Citizen. And this is \nnot an isolated, innocent, or minor matter to the corporation pushing \nit.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat one phrase from this letter. This kind \nof activity ``undermines our democratic system.''\n  However anyone feels about the underlying merits of the issue, the \nprocess which is taking place is repugnant. As the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, [Mr. Simon] has said, if this corporation \nsucceeds, this will be a textbook example for years to come of how \nspecial interests have perverted the democratic process. I hope we will \ndo the right thing and just say no to this.\n  Mr. President, let me simply say, as a conclusion, I have heard \nspeakers all week, and especially this morning, say that we have to \npass this bill because of airline safety; we have to pass this bill \nbecause of the airline tax extension; we have to pass this bill because \nof airport aides. And I agree. We have to pass this bill. How can all \nof those things, how can all of those things be less important than \nthis one provision for Federal Express?\n  It seems inconceivable to me that those on the other side, given \ntheir commitment to those issues and those concerns, would not drop \nthis provision at this point and let the bill be passed today and be \nsigned by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I'll come right to the point, it is not \na question of one company succeeds. It is the question of one Congress \ncan succeed. Congress made the error, not Federal Express. Federal \nExpress had nothing to do with the dropping of the language when we \npassed the ICC termination bill last December. We made that mistake. We \nare on trial. And this distortion: coming in here and flyblowing a \nwonderful company-- ``antiworker,'' ``a Republican attack,'' ``slash \nMedicare,'' ``slash education''--none of that has anything to do with \nit.\n  Let us assume that Federal Express was antiworker. That would have \nnothing to do with this particular issue. What we did here with my \namendment--and incidentally, ``Republican,'' I have been a Democrat \nsince 1948. I think you were just learning to drive at that time. So \nyou can't define who is a Democrat, we will see how the Democrats vote.\n\n  At that particular time we came in here and we said, ``Wait a minute. \nWhen we left, we had a hearing. Been having a hearing quite regularly \nall over.'' Who is to be heard? Not the merits of workers' rights, the \nmerits of the truth. Find somebody, some Senator, some Congressman. I \nhave challenged him now for 3 days during this filibuster, find me \nanybody who says otherwise than that it was an honest mistake. It is \nour duty to try to correct it.\n  Every time we try, we go down the list, filibuster, filibuster, \nfilibuster. Yes, you have the political power. You have held the whole \nCongress up for 3 days. Every time we try to get it anywhere, you are \ngoing to filibuster, filibuster, filibuster, trying to take advantage \nof an honest mistake.\n  We have heard from all the Congressmen, Republican and Democrat, all \nthe Senators, Republican and Democrat, and we all agree that it was a \nmistake. You cannot find anybody who says it was not a mistake. To come \nin here trying to correct an honest mistake, and they flyblow a company \nwith antiworker/Medicare/Medicaid and all that extraneous garbage--they \nknow no shame. We are not going to filibuster. We are ready to vote. We \nare ready to vote and try to get a political division here today on \nwhat this Senator has been trying to clean up.\n  We tried to get the other side to look at the intent. I am looking at \nthe conference report by Mr. Shuster, the ICC\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\nTermination Act, last December 15. ``The enactment of the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage of \nemployees and employers by the Railway Labor Act.''\n  Now, that is exactly what was intended. That is the law. The Railway \nLabor Act is just exactly what truck drivers and pilots and Federal \nExpress have been under since 1973 when they started business.\n  I felt like Archimedes, who said, ``Eureka, I found it'' when the \nSenator from Massachusetts cited 4-RC-17698. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record excerpts of the final Board decision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Mediation Board,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 1995.\n     Re NMB File No. CJ-6463 (NLRB Case 4-RC-1698) Federal Express \n         Corporation.\n\n     Jeffrey D. Wedekind,\n     Acting Solicitor, National Labor Relations Board, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Wedekind: This responds to your request dated July \n     17, 1995, for the National Mediation Board's (Board's) \n     opinion as to whether Federal Express Corporation (Federal \n     Express or FedEx) and certain of its employees is subject to \n     the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. Sec. 151, et \n     seq. The Board's opinion, based upon the materials provided \n     by your office and the Board's investigation is that Federal \n     Express and all of its employees are subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   i.\n\n       This case arose as the result of a representation petition \n     filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by the \n     International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). The UAW \n     initially sought to represent a unit of Federal Express's \n     employees including ``all regular full and part-time hourly \n     ground service employees in the Liberty District.'' \\1\\ On \n     December 9, 1991, the UAW amended its petition to exclude \n     ``ramp agents, ramp agent/feeders, handlers, senior handlers, \n     heavyweight handlers, senior heavy weight handlers, checker \n     sorters, senior checker/sorters, shuttle drivers, shuttle \n     driver/handlers, office clerical employees, engineers, guards \n     and supervisors as defined in the Act [NLRA].'' The titles \n     remaining in the UAW's petition include: service agents, \n     senior service agents, international document agents, \n     couriers, courier/handlers, tractor-trailer drivers, \n     dispatchers, courier/non-drivers and operations agents.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express' Liberty District are employees subject to \n     the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The UAW acknowledges \n     that pilots and aircraft mechanics employed by Federal \n     Express are subject to the Railway Labor Act. However, the \n     UAW contends that the two-part test traditionally employed by \n     the Board to determine whether an entity is a carrier should \n     be applied to the unit of employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express' Liberty District. According to the UAW, the \n     employees it seeks to represent in the Liberty District do \n     not perform airline work and are not ``integral to Federal \n     Express' air transportation functions.''\n       Federal Express asserts that it is a carrier subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act and, as a carrier, all of its employees are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express notes that \n     the Board and the courts have repeatedly found it to be a \n     carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. According to \n     Federal Express, the job classifications remaining in the \n     petition are integrally related to Federal Express' air \n     transportation activities. Federal Express contends that it \n     is a ``unified operation with fully integrated air and ground \n     services.'' According to Federal Express, allowing some \n     employees to be covered by the National Labor Relations Act \n     and others to be subject to the Railway Labor Act would \n     result in employees being covered by different labor \n     relations statutes as they are promoted up the career ladder.\n       Federal Express contends that the two-part test suggested \n     by the UAW is not appropriate in this case. According to \n     Federal Express, the Board uses the two part test to \n     determine whether a company is a carrier, not to determine \n     whether specific employees of a carrier perform duties that \n     are covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express \n     cautions that adoption of the test suggested by the UAW \n     ``would drastically alter labor relations at every airline in \n     the country.'' According to Federal Express, under the UAW's \n     test, most categories of employees except pilots, flight \n     attendants and aircraft mechanics would be subject to the \n     NLRA.\n       The Board repeatedly has exercised jurisdiction over \n     Federal Express. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 (1995); \n     Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal Express \n     Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1993); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 126 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express \n     Corp., 19 NMB 297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 \n     (1989); Federal Express/Flying Tiger, 16 NMB 433 (1989); \n     Federal Express, 6 NMB 442 (1978). There is no dispute that \n     Federal Express is a carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act \n     with respect to certain Federal Express employees (i.e. \n     Pilots; Flight Attendants,\\3\\ Global Operation Control \n     Specialists; and Mechanics and Related Employees; Stock \n     Clerks; and Fleet Service Employees). However, the Board has \n     not addressed the issue raised by the UAW: whether or not \n     certain Federal Express employees are subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n       The NLRB initially requested the NMB's opinion as to \n     whether FedEx is subject to the RLA on July 1, 1992. However, \n     on that date, the NLRB granted the UAW's request to reopen \n     the record and the file was returned to the NLRB. The NLRB \n     renewed its request on July 17, 1995 and the NMB received the \n     record on July 31, 1995. The NMB received additional evidence \n     and argument from FedEx and the UAW on August 17, 1995 and \n     September 5, 1995.\n\n\n                                  II.\n\n       Federal Express, a Delaware corporation, is an air express \n     delivery service which provides worldwide express package \n     delivery. According to Chairman of the Board and Chief \n     Executive Officer Frederick Smith, Federal Express flies the \n     sixth largest jet aircraft fleet in the world.\n       Federal Express' jet aircraft fleet currently includes \n     Boeing 727-100's, Boeing 727-200's, Boeing 737's, Boeing 747-\n     100's, Boeing 747-200's, DC 10-10's, DC 10-30's and \n     McDonnell-Douglas MD-11's. Federal Express also operates \n     approximately 250 feeder aircraft, including Cessna 208's and \n     Fokker 27's. It has over 50 jet aircraft on order.\n       Federal Express currently serves the United States and \n     several countries in the Middle East, Europe, South America \n     and Asia, including Japan, Saudi Arabia and Russia. According \n     to Managing Director of Operations Research Joseph Hinson, \n     Federal Express does not transport freight that moves \n     exclusively by ground to or from the United States.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                            iii. discussion\n\n       The National Mediation Board has exercised jurisdiction \n     over Federal Express as a common carrier by air in numerous \n     published determinations. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 \n     (1995); Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal \n     Express Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 666 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 (1993); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1993); Federal Express \n     Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 126 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 19 NMB \n     297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 (1989); Federal \n     Express/Flying Tiger 16 NMB 433 (1989); Federal Express, 6 \n     NMB 442 (1978). In eight of those determinations, the Board \n     exercised jurisdiction over ground service employees of \n     Federal Express. The substantial record developed in this \n     proceeding provides no clear and convincing evidence to \n     support a different result.\n\n\n                                   a.\n\n       Section 181, which extends the Railway Labor Act's coverage \n     to air carriers, provides:\n       ``All of the provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter \n     except section 153 of this title are extended to and shall \n     cover every common carrier by air engaged in interstate or \n     foreign commerce, and every carrier by air transporting mail \n     for or under contract with the United States Government, and \n     every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an \n     employee or subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, \n     subject to its or their continuing authority to supervise and \n     direct the manner of rendition of his service, 45 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 181. (Emphasis added.)''\n       Federal Express is an air express delivery service which \n     holds itself out for hire to transport packages, both \n     domestically and internationally. Federal Express and the UAW \n     agree that Federal Express and its air operations employees, \n     such as pilots and aircraft mechanics, are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The disagreement arises over whether \n     Federal Express' remaining employees are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The UAW argues that the employees it \n     seeks to represent do not perform airline work and are not \n     ``integral to Federal Express' air transportation \n     functions.'' Federal Express asserts that all of the \n     employees sought by the UAW are integrally related to its \n     air express delivery service and are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act.\n       Since there is no dispute over whether Federal Express is a \n     common carrier by air, the Board focuses on whether the \n     employees sought by the UAW's petition before the NLRB are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. The Act's definition of an \n     employee of an air carrier includes, ``every air pilot or \n     other person who performs any work as an employee or \n     subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, subject to \n     its or their continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition of his service''. The Railway Labor Act \n     does not limit its coverage to air carrier employees who fly \n     or maintain aircraft. Rather, its coverage extends to \n     virtually all employees engaged in performing a service for \n     the carrier so that the carrier may transport passengers or \n     freight.\\9\\\n       In REA Express, Inc., 4 NMB 253, 269 (1965), the Board \n     found ``over-the-road'' drivers employed by REA subject to \n     the Act stating:\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\n       ``It has been the Board's consistent position that the fact \n     of employment by a `carrier' under the Act is determinative \n     of the status of all that carrier's employees as subject to \n     the Act. The effort to carve out or to separate the so-called \n     over-the-road drivers would be contrary to and do violence to \n     a long line of decisions by this Board which would embrace \n     the policy of refraining from setting up a multiplicity of \n     crafts or classes. As stated above, there is no question that \n     this particular group are employees of the carrier (Emphasis \n     in original).''\n       The limit on Section 181's coverage is that the carrier \n     must have ``continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition of * * * [an employee's] service. The \n     couriers, tractor-trailer drivers, operations agents and \n     other employees sought by the UAW are employed by Federal \n     Express directly. As the record amply demonstrates, these \n     employees, as part of Federal Express' air express delivery \n     system, are supervised by Federal Express employees. The \n     Board need not look further to find that all of Federal \n     Express' employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   B.\n\n       In the Board's judgment, the analysis of the jurisdictional \n     question could end here. However, Federal Express and the UAW \n     have directed substantial portions of their arguments to the \n     ``integrally related'' test. Specifically, the participants \n     discuss whether the employees the UAW seeks to represent are \n     ``integrally related'' to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions. The Board does not find consideration of the \n     ``integrally related'' test necessary to resolve the \n     jurisdictional issue, however, review of the relevance of \n     this test is appropriate.\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent are \n     not integrally related to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions and therefore are not subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act. Federal Express asserts that the NLRB and federal courts \n     have found its trucking operations integrally related to its \n     air operations.\\10\\\n       However, the Board does not apply the ``integrally \n     related'' test to the Federal Express employees sought by the \n     UAW. Where, as here, the company at issue is a common carrier \n     by air, the Act's jurisdiction does not depend upon whether \n     there is an integral relationship between its air carrier \n     activities and the functions performed by the carrier's \n     employees in question. The Board need not consider the \n     relationship between the work performed by employees of a \n     common carrier and the air carrier's mission, because section \n     181 encompasses ``every pilot or other person who performs \n     any work as an employee or subordinate official of such \n     carrier or carriers. . . .'' (Emphasis added).\n       Even if the Board were to assume arguendo that the \n     ``integrally related'' test applies to the facts in this \n     case, the Board would hold in concurrence with the recent \n     decision in Federal Express Corp. v. California PUC, supra, \n     at note 10, that the ``trucking operations of Federal Express \n     are integral to its operations as an air carrier.'' 936 F.2d \n     at 1078. Employees working in the other positions sought by \n     the UAW perform functions equally crucial to Federal Express' \n     mission as an integrated air express delivery service. As the \n     record demonstrates, without the functions performed by the \n     employees at issue, Federal Express could not provide the on-\n     time express delivery required of an air express delivery \n     service.\n       The Board has employed the ``integrally related'' test when \n     it has examined whether to apply the trucking exemption under \n     Sec. 151 of the Act. O/O Truck Sales, 21 NMB at 269; Florida \n     Express Carrier, Inc., 16 NMB 407 (1989). Specifically, the \n     Board has applied the ``integrally related'' test when it has \n     considered trucking operations conducted by a subsidiary of a \n     carrier or a company in the same corporate family with a \n     carrier. In Florida Express, supra, the Board found Florida \n     Express, a trucking company which is a wholly-owned \n     subsidiary of Florida East Coast Railroad, to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In O/O Truck Sales, \n     supra, the Board found O/O Truck Sales, a trucking and \n     fueling company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSXI \n     (which is commonly owned with CSXT), to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In contrast, Federal \n     Express directly employs truck drivers, couriers and all \n     other employees sought by the UAW's petition.\n\n\n                                   c.\n\n       The UAW argues that the Board should apply the two-part \n     test used by the Board in other factual settings for \n     determining whether an employer and its employees are subject \n     to the Railway Labor Act. See, for example, Miami Aircraft \n     Support, 21 NMB 78 (1993); AMR Services, Corp., 18 NMB 348 \n     (1991). The Board does not apply the two-part test where the \n     company at issue is engaged in common carriage by air or \n     rail. The Board applies the two-part test where the company \n     in question is a separate corporate entity such as a \n     subsidiary or a derivative carrier which provides a service \n     for another carrier. In those situations where the Board \n     applies the two-part test, it determines: 1) whether the \n     company at issue is directly or indirectly owned or \n     controlled by a common carrier or carriers; and 2) whether \n     the functions it performs are traditionally performed by \n     employees of air or rail carriers. Under this test, both \n     elements must be satisfied for a company to be subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. Federal Express is an admitted carrier and \n     the employees at issue are employed directly by Federal \n     Express. Accordingly, the two-part test does not apply to \n     this proceeding.\n       Even if the two-part test were applicable, the employees at \n     issue here would be covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal \n     Express, as a common carrier, has direct control over the \n     positions sought by the UAW. In addition, the Board has found \n     that virtually all of the work performed by employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition is work traditionally performed by \n     employees in the airline industry. For example: couriers, Air \n     Cargo Transport, Inc., 15 NMB 202 (1988); Crew Transit, Inc., \n     10 NMB 64 (1982); truck drivers; Florida Express, Inc., 16 \n     NMB 407 (1989); customer service agents; Trans World \n     International Airlines, Inc., 6 NMB 703 (1979).\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Based upon the entire record in this case and for all of \n     the reasons stated above, the Board is of the opinion that \n     Federal Express Corporation and all of its employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition are subject to the Railway Labor Act. \n     This finding may be cited as Federal Express Corporation, 23 \n     NMB 32 (1995).

This particular decision on page 2 covers every kind of \ndriver you can think of--shuttle drivers, tractor-trailer drivers, \ndispatchers, courier nondrivers, courier drivers, and right on down, \nand I want to read to you in this limited time the final decision: \n``The Board is of the opinion that Federal Express Corporation and all \nof its employees sought by the UAW's petition are subject to the \nRailway Labor Act.'' Signed, Stephen E. Crable, the chief of staff, and \nas a unanimous decision by the other members.\n  That was filed on November 22, 1995, almost a year ago. This is the \ninitiative to try to change it. The opponents are the ones trying to \npull the rug out from under that decision because it was at the NLRB--\nthey know and we all know in 50 years and 100 decisions the NLRB has \nnever reversed a decision that was unanimous by the National Mediation \nBoard.\n  To talk about litigation, for 5 years they had wonderful lawyers. The \nemployees were there with all kinds of hearings and everything else, \nbut they act like what we are trying to do is change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. We are trying to correct a mistake.\n  Mr. President, there is no question in my mind this is an outstanding \ncompany. I have ``The 100 Best Companies,'' and I could read it. But, \nsimply stated, the Senator from Illinois is totally out of order with \nrespect to this issue of the way to govern; one people, one Congress. \nWe are the ones who made the mistake, not Federal Express. This is the \nway to try to correct it. We know we faced a filibuster at every \nparticular turn you could possibly think of. We know this is partisan \nonslaught. We know this nonsense about working people and working \nfamilies and slashing education.\n  Under the Railway Labor Act, you have every right and interest to \norganize, and in fact 65 percent of the workers under the Railway Labor \nAct are organized. Under the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, \nonly 11 percent are organized. So they are wrong when they act like we \nare trying to change the rules. We are trying to get it back to exactly \nwhere the parties were. We are here now because they have the legal \npower to delay us for 3 days, intimidate and terrorize.\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the bill before us today, H.R. \n3539, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1996, is \nimportant legislation. It reauthorizes the Airport Improvement Program, \nproviding needed grants to States and to airports for airway \nimprovements, helps to improve safety and airport security, and makes a \nnumber of other important contributions to aviation.\n  In Illinois, O'Hare airport in Chicago could expect more than $8.5 \nmillion next year. The Peoria airport could receive $860,000. The \nairport in my State's capitol, Springfield, should receive more than \n$660,000 if this legislation is enacted. The Southern Illinois Airport \nAuthority, which operates an airport in Carbondale, expects more than \n$1.5 million if this bill becomes law.\n  These grants are important to these and other airports in Illinois, \nand to airports across the country. They are what keep our airports \nfunctional and safe, and help maintain the air transportation \ninfrastructure of our country that fuels our economy. Congress can \nhardly afford to adjourn without the passage of this legislation.\n  This bill even includes a provision that I worked very hard on, along \nwith my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, that will allow \ncommunities to participate in the process of improving safety at their \nrailroad crossings. Under a 1994 law, communities did not have this \noption. They were essentially directed to install extremely expensive \nsafety devices, or their locally imposed whistle ban would be revoked. \nI am delighted that we were able to work out an amendment to this 1994 \nlaw that gives communities the flexibility they need to improve safety \nfrom the local level, and not just by Federal dictate.\n  It is therefore very disheartening that, despite the obvious merits \nof this legislation, despite the fact that this is a good, bipartisan \nbill, and despite the fact that it will allow communities to \nparticipate in the process of improving railroad crossing safety, I am \nforced to vote against this entire bill because of one sentence that \nwas inserted by the conference committee and dubiously labeled a \nclarifying amendment.\n  Mr. President, supporters of this one sentence argue that it is, in \nfact, a technical correction--a clarifying amendment--and that it \ncorrects a mistake that occurred when the Congress drafted and approved \nthe legislation eliminating the Interstate Commerce Commission. I am \nnot on the Commerce Committee, and I am not familiar enough with the \ndetails of the legislative language that was used when Congress \neliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission to evaluate the merits of \nthat claim.\n  I do know, however, that a technical correction does not provoke the \nkind of controversy that this one sentence amendment has provoked. \nTechnical corrections are, by definition, noncontroversial. They change \ndetails of legislation or of law in ways that do not have substantive \naffects on policy.\n  Technical corrections do not result in my staff being bombarded by \ncalls, faxes, and letters--which is exactly what has happened since \nthis sentence was discovered in the FAA Authorization Conference \nReport.\n  Technical corrections do not prompt Senators to demand a full reading \nof the text of legislation. Yet the other night we listened while the \nbill clerks diligently read the text of almost the entire FAA bill for \n3\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Technical corrections do not lead to filibusters, and Mr. President, \nI believe that is exactly where we are today, in the midst of a \nfilibuster over a supposed clarifying amendment.\n  Technical corrections do not tie the Senate in knots and hold the \n104th Congress in legislative session for several days after we were \nscheduled to adjourn sine die.\n  Technical corrections do not motivate press conferences, where \nworkers express their fears that this provision will allow their \ncompany to trample their employment rights. Regardless of the \nsubstantive merit of this claim, or the claims of either side in this \ndebate, a provision that is this controversial is not a technical \ncorrection.\n  Technical corrections do not require five or six attempts to be \ninserted into legislation. That is the history, however, of this \nsentence. Attempts were made to attach the provision to fiscal year \n1996 appropriations legislation. Those attempts failed. An attempt was \nmade to attach it to the NTSB reauthorization. That attempt failed. \nMembers tried to attach it to the Railroad Unemployment Act amendments, \nand failed. An attempt was made to attach it to this year's Department \nof Transportation appropriations bill. That attempt failed. Another \nattempt was made to attach it to the fiscal year 1997 omnibus \nappropriations legislation. That attempt failed as well. This is not \nthe legislative history of a technical correction.\n  This is the history of a highly contentious provision that many \npeople believe will directly affect their lives. This is the \nlegislative history of a provision that one company believes will give \nit the upper hand in negotiations with some of its employees. This is \nthe legislative history of a provision that should be the subject of a \nhearing--but it has never been the subject of a hearing, in either the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  This provision has never even been debated in either the House or the \nSenate. It had never passed either body--and yet it found its way into \nthe conference report on this important legislation reauthorizing the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n  It is deeply unfortunate that this highly controversial sentence has \nbeen attached to such a valuable piece of legislation. It is deeply \ntroubling that this provision has never been the subject of a hearing \nor been debated on its merits. I deeply regret that I must oppose this \nlegislation, because in the 11th-hour, a highly controversial provision \nhas been attached to the bill under the guise of a clarifying \namendment.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will be able to clean up this FAA bill \nand act on it immediately, before the end of the 104th Congress. This \nbill is too important for airports, our transportation infrastructure, \nand our economy, to let it be derailed by one controversial, 11th-hour \namendment.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against cloture, and support a \nclean alternative to this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the pending conference report is a very \nimportant piece of legislation that means nearly $4.6 billion in grants \nto airports across America the next 2 years and as much as $75 million \nin entitlement and apportionment funding this year to airports in my \nState of California. It also authorizes funds over the next 2 years for \noperations, equipment, and research of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  And, in a very important change in public policy, the bill ends the \nFAA's dual mandate of regulation of civil aviation and promotion of air \ntravel. After this bill becomes law, the primary mission of the FAA \nwill be to ensure the safety of the flying public.\n  The bill also contains important provisions that will increase \nsecurity at the nation's airports and begin implementation of the Gore \nCommission recommendations to enhance security. This bill will \nimmediately authorize heightened airport employee screening checks and \ncriminal background checks and will facilitate sharing of information \non pilot records.\n  As far as I know, not one single senator opposes this FAA \nauthorization bill. So why are we still here?\n  We are still here because of an unusual parliamentary move in the \nconference on this bill last week, in which a provision that was not in \neither the Senate-passed bill or the House-passed bill was added in \nconference. That move is what triggered the fierce debate we have had \non this issue since last Saturday.\n  Had that provision--relating to labor organizing rules for employees \nof Federal Express--not been added in conference, the Senate would most \nlikely have adjourned several days ago.\n  Those who oppose the provision have exercised their rights to debate \nit at length. So today there will be a cloture vote on the conference \nreport. And while I support the FAA reauthorization bill, I will vote \nagainst cloture on this conference report for two reasons:\n  First, I strongly object to the procedure that was used to add this \nprovision to the bill in conference. I understand that under the rules, \nthe conferees had the right to do what they did. However, what is legal \nis not necessarily prudent and constructive.\n  Given the facts--that the underlying bill is noncontroversial and a \nvery important and necessary measure to pass\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\nthis year, that we are now at the end of this session of Congress, and \nthat the new provision is quite controversial--adding such a provision \nin conference was bound to cause great turmoil. The conferees should \nhave anticipated that it might endanger, or at the least, delay, \npassage of the underlying bill.\n\n  I wish that the conferees had acted with greater prudence in the \ninterest of passing the important FAA Reauthorization legislation.\n  Second, I strongly oppose the labor provision itself. I am not an \nexpert on labor law or transportation law. But after reviewing the law \nin question and the facts of this case, I conclude that the provision \nthat was added is in fact a special exemption from applicable labor \norganizing rules for one company.\n  The provision's supporters argue that it is merely a ``technical \ncorrection'' to the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of \n1995. They claim that Federal Express is an ``express carrier'', not a \n``motor carrier'' for purposes of labor organizing rules.\n  Why is this classification so important?\n  For the working people, the employees of Federal Express, it makes \nall the difference--between being able to organize like other employees \nof other companies across the country, on a local basis, or having to \norganize nationally, drastically reducing their ability to organize.\n  According to the Surface Transportation Board, the agency that \nassumed regulatory responsiblities of the ICC when it was terminated by \nCongress, in a June 14, 1996 letter from Chairman Linda Morgan, Federal \nExpress was never considered to be an ``express carrier'' by the ICC.\n  Chairman Morgan states in that letter that Federal Express, has \nalways been classified as a ``motor carrier'', not an ``express \ncarrier''.\n  I believe the law and the facts are clear. Federal Express is and \nalways has been a ``motor carrier'', subject to the labor organizing \nrules of the National Labor Relations Act, which allows employees to \norganize locally.\n  The provision that was inserted in the conference report is a special \nexemption from the labor organizing rules that apply to ``motor \ncarriers'' such as Federal Express.\n  If the proponents of such an exemption wish to debate this proposal, \nthey have every right to introduce legislation, hold hearings on it, \nand try to move it through Congress. But I believe that it is \ninappropriate and imprudent to attempt to push it through in a \nconference report in the last hours of this session.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report now before us \nincludes language which would restore the express carrier \nclassification within the Railway Labor Act. This rider was not \nincluded in the FAA reauthorization bill as passed by either the House \nor the Senate. It was inserted into the legislation in the conference. \nThis is not the right way to legislate.\n  The language that was inserted by the Conference Committee into the \nFAA Reauthorization Act was deleted by the ICC Termination Act of 1995 \n(Public Law 104-88), a law passed by Congress. That deletion was \nincluded in the legislation when it was before the House and when it \nwas before the Senate and was a part of the conference report as \nadopted by both Houses. It was not a modification made in the \nenrollment process, as has been suggested.\n  Concerns have been expressed that removal of this provision from the \nFAA reauthorization would greatly delay or kill this bill. That is not \naccurate. I support the FAA reauthorization. It is important for \nAmerica and for Michigan. Virtually all Members of the Senate support \nthis bill. There is a bill at the desk in the Senate which contains all \nof the language of the FAA reauthorization bill now before us with the \nsingle exception that it does not contain the provision causing so much \ncontroversy. The bill at the desk could be taken up and passed \nimmediately. Regardless of the outcome of this cloture vote, the FAA \nreauthorization is virtually certain to be enacted before this Congress \nadjourns sine die, as it must be.\n  It is now amply clear that issue involved in the provision added in \nconference is a significant one. It can and should be the subject of \nhearings and full consideration by the appropriate committees of \njurisdiction. It can and should be considered early in the 105th \nCongress.\n  For these reasons, I will oppose the motion to invoke cloture. I will \nvote in favor of final passage of the FAA reauthorization bill which I \nstrongly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12217-5", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12225-S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CLOTURE VOTE ON FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on the cloture vote, which was one of the \nlast votes--if not the last--I cast in this body, I departed from my \ncustomary practice of supporting cloture. I have cast some 350 votes \nfor cloture during my 36 years in the Senate, often at variance with my \nown party and usually irrespective of the issues, except in \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  The vote today was one of those extraordinary cases. At issue was a \nprovision that would grant an exclusive benefit to the management of \none corporate entity, at the expense of long established principles of \nfair labor relations. Moreover, the provision was added in \ncircumstances that were at variance with customary legislative practice \nand rules. So, in my view, the only proper course was to oppose the \ncloture motion in order to allow for consideration of alternative \naction.\n  As I leave the Senate, I continue to believe that cloture is a \nvaluable tool to prevent legislative deadlock. I recognize that in its \nmore recent usage, it has become simply a test of supermajority \nstrength on the one hand, and on the other, a defensive weapon for a \nminority. But in overall terms, the Senate does need a mechanism that \nwill assure reasonable continuity of action and I am proud of my record \nof cloture votes in that regard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the side of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthere is 7 minutes, and 8 minutes on the opposing side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we all know what is going on here. Make no mistake \nabout it. We all know what is going on here. This provision that is \nbeing put in is not a technical amendment, meant to correct an \ninadvertent drafting change. The Congressional Research Service, the \nPresident, and the House Members who spoke on the floor explained that \nthis is not a technical correction. Any fair evaluation of history \nwould demonstrate that.\n  This rider is being added to the FAA bill for Federal Express, now \nand for the future. Federal Express is expanding its trucking \noperations. Where UPS is concerned, the air carriers are under the \nRailway Act and the truck drivers are under the National Labor \nRelations Act. Initially, all of UPS was under the National Labor \nRelations Act because they used only trucks. When they added aircraft, \nthe decision was made that UPS air carriers would be considered under \nthe Railway Labor Act.\n  That is the same situation we have here. Federal Express started out \njust as an air carrier and now it wants to go into trucks. This is a \npreemptive strike to make sure that workers at the local level will not \nbe able to have the same kind of justification for National Labor \nRelations Act coverage as they have at UPS or other companies. They are \ntrying to manipulate the whole process and fix the game.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, they are moving now, as their principal \nofficers point out, they are now expanding. In the future, according to \nFederal Express, only overnight packages traveling more than 400 miles \nwill be flown; all others will travel on the road. The question is, are \nall of these trucks on the road going to be considered air carriers? \nThat is the logic. That is the logic that is being presented here.\n  All we are trying to say is, let the National Labor Relations Board \ndecide whether Federal Express's truck drivers should be under the \nNational Labor Relations Act. If the workers can convince other workers \nto form a union, let them vote for a union. If they cannot, then they \nwill vote against a union. But why have a legislative interruption that \nstrips them of their right to vote?\n  I come back to the fact, Mr. President, with all respect to my \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\nand friend from South Carolina, this was attempted five times by the \nRepublican leadership over in the House of Representatives. I do not \nquestion that there will be some Democrats here who will support it. \nBut there was virtually unanimous rejection by Democrats in the House \nof Representatives of this rider because it is special-interest \nlegislation to undermine the rights of working families, and a majority \nof Democrats in the Senate this morning will vote likewise.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again my distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts has misquoted the matter of truck drivers' rights. We \nhave been saying this for 3 days. They say a man convinced against his \nwill is of the same opinion still, but all I can do is put in the \nentire decision. It is that all of the truck drivers--and they are not \nunder the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act. They are under the \nRailway Labor Act and have been, and decision after decision after \ndecision we put in, all the decisions found them under the Labor \nRailway Act; none of the decisions have found them under the NLRA.\n  That is how they organized. Mr. President, 90 percent of their \ncarrier is by air; 90 percent of UPS is on the surface, on the ground. \nThat is the difference. We even had the lawyer of the Teamsters Union \nin a hearing here earlier this year use the expression, the difference \nbetween these companies is night and day, but here you get a political \njambalaya to fit into this silly filibuster.\n  How can you get the truth out of everybody? Isn't their any pride and \nconscience in this body? A mistake was made. Everybody knows it was a \nmistake. We are trying to correct the mistake. We are not changing the \nrights of any parties whatever. But they are trying to make a Federal \ncase out of workers' rights, slashing opportunities, and everything \nelse that they have put on the billboards. I would be ashamed to put \nthat thing up behind me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield one minute to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am not going to discuss whether there was \na mistake or not. I think that has been bandied around quite a bit. I \nwould like to discuss the company itself.\n  I have heard many of our colleagues, or heard about many of my \ncolleagues, talking about this being an antiworker company, or this \nbeing an antiworker cause that we are debating on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Mr. President, I would challenge any colleague of ours in the \nU.S. Senate to go out around this town, or around this country, and \nwhen they see a Federal Express worker I would challenge my colleagues \nto ask that person, that employee of Federal Express, what they think \nof that company. I say that because it is not only one of the hundred \nbest companies in our country, but they have a scholarship program, and \nthey are going to say this works wonderfully for our families. They \nhave a reimbursement program for tuition. They have extended health \ncare. And they have many other programs that makes the morale of this \ncompany I think second to none.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope that the Senator from Massachusetts \nwould extend the courtesy to me as sponsor of the bill to make a final \nstatement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to. I had Senator Murray who is coming \nto the floor. I was trying to permit her 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to note, if I could, that I intend to \nuse leader time after all of the statements have been completed at \napproximately 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes, \nand the Senator from Arizona has 4 minutes and 49 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would just say really in conclusion to my friend \nfrom Arkansas and others that we had a series of workers that came \nyesterday and commented. They have worked for Federal Express over a \nlong period of time. Every one of those workers has a deep sense of \npride in their company. But every one of them wonders why we are \nchanging the rules of the game because they believe that they ought to \nbe able to have a vote on whether they should be able to organize or \nnot organize.\n  The fact remains that, if the situation is as described by the \nSenator from South Carolina, these truck drivers are all working under \nthe Railway Act, and there really is no necessity. If this decision has \nalready been made, there is no necessity to pursue this particular \nlegislation. But the facts belie that, and the facts belie it \nindependent of the Senator from Massachusetts and the Congressional \nResearch Service; independent of the Senator from South Carolina or \nmyself; and, Mr. President, the administration has made that same \nfinding independent of the Senator from South Carolina or myself.\n  This is more than a technical change. He can say it and repeat it. I \ncan say it and say that it isn't. But let us take the independent \nevaluation.\n  Mr. President, this special interest provision is going to be of \nenormous value and gain to one company--Federal Express--and to the \ndisadvantage of working families.\n  The point that I am making and have repeated is that attitude with \nregard to working families has been exemplified here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate by Republican leadership, the same Republican \nleadership that advanced this in the House of Representatives. Five \ndifferent times that were rejected. That is the same leadership that \nfought the minimum wage and fought working people on the earned income \ntax credit; who fought working families with regard to the Davis-Bacon; \nhave fought working families' interests with regard to education, and \nMr. President, pension reform. Those interests have cut back on the \nlife blood of working families in order to have tax breaks for the \nwealthiest individuals and corporations.\n\n  That is the record of this attempt by the Republican leadership in \nthe House and the Senate. It is a similar kind of attitude that we are \nseeing now reflected toward those workers who have legitimate \ngrievances and are entitled to have that worked out by the National \nLabor Relations Board.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute \nand 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I take it then the Senator from Massachusetts does not \nintend to allow me to make a final statement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my colleague and friend, as I indicated before, \nthe Senator from Washington, and I would like to be able to yield to \nher for a minute and a half. I will do that at this time, if the \nSenator would indulge. I always intended to let the Senator make it. I \nwanted to also extend the courtesy to my colleague from Washington.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Washington has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and others, in telling us to slow \ndown and take a look at what we are doing in our rush to get out of \ntown.\n  To me this is an issue of fairness. I have listened carefully to the \ndebate over the last 4 days. It is an issue of fairness for thousands \nof working families across this country, whether or not they will have \nthe right to make sure that they can pay for their families' food on \nthe table, send their children to college, to have working conditions \nthat are fair and reached in fair agreement.\n  I know we all want to leave town. We want to leave quickly. Everyone \nwants to get home. But let us not leave a legacy of giving special \ntreatment to one company and leaving thousands of workers for many \nyears to come without fair treatment in their employment.\n\n[[Page S12227]]\n\n  I thank the President.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will use my remaining time.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will invoke cloture and pass this important \nlegislation.\n  This conference report is the product of 2 long years of hard work \nand negotiations. All was done in the open. And over that period, \nChairman Pressler, ranking member Hollings, Senator Ford, Senator \nStevens, and I have heard from countless interests. We all worked hard \nto balance the competing views. I believe this bill represents a \nthoughtful, balanced approach to this subject.\n  I will not repeat all that this bill would do. The conference report \nwas not only read. But we have now debated it for over 3 days.\n  Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on whether or not to invoke \ncloture on the FAA Reauthorization Act. I want to emphasize the \nimportance of this vote.\n  A vote for cloture is a vote for airport and airline safety, for \nairport security, for airport construction, and for jobs. Make no \nmistake. This is much, much more than a vote about one provision in the \nbill. We must invoke cloture on this bill. It must be passed.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that some of my colleagues, especially those on \nthe other side of the aisle, have already left town and don't want to \nreturn. While I sympathize with their plight, I want the Record to note \nthat not voting on this very important legislation because of vacation \nplans, or campaign activities, is not a valid excuse. Vacations and \ncampaigns can wait. They cannot and should not take precedence over the \nsafety of the flying public.\n  We have all missed votes. But this is not just any vote. This is the \nlast issue this Congress will deal with. This is an issue involving the \nsafety of air travel in this country. This is an issue of job creation. \nThis is an issue of helping the families who have lost loved ones in \nair disasters. This is an issue of improving our airports.\n  Simply, this is an issue that cannot be delayed until next year.\n  Mr. President, according to experts at the Finance Committee, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, and the Congressional Budget Office, money \ncannot be spent on these needs unless this bill is enacted into law. We \ncannot wait until next year. Such a wait may result in months upon \nmonths of delay.\n  For the safety of the flying public, I appeal to my colleagues to \nsupport cloture and to support this bill.\n  I want to note that this debate should be a debate about aviation \nissues. It is not a partisan debate. It is certainly not a debate about \none company. Those charges that this bill contains a special interest \nprovision is simply spurious.\n  Yesterday, and today, the senior Senator from Massachusetts displayed \na poster on the floor of this Senate entitled ``Republican Attacks on \nthe Middle Class.'' Mr. President, this is not a partisan debate. \nDemocrats and Republicans are all equally responsible for this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on whether or not to invoke \ncloture on the FAA reauthorization bill. I want to emphasize to my \ncolleagues the importance of this vote. A vote for cloture is not, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts would have you believe, a vote against \nlabor. A vote for cloture on this bill is an affirmative vote. It is a \nvote for airplane safety, for airport security, and for much-needed \nairport construction. It is a vote for jobs--many thousands of jobs.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts would like to use this bill in yet \nanother attempt to turn the upcoming election into class warfare--using \none small provision in this bill to accuse Republicans who support this \ncritically important legislation of abandoning working men and women. \nYet, as we all know, the provision which the Senator finds so \nobjectionable was sponsored by a Democrat Member of the Senate, and \nenjoys the support of a number of other Senators from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. President, the election will be here soon enough.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes of leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the election will be here soon enough. I \nthink the American people have heard all of our political arguments \nalready. Little is to be gained by using the last piece of legislation \nin the 104th Congress to underscore campaign slogans one more time at \nthe cost of the security of the American people; at the cost, Mr. \nPresident, of the safety of the air travel in the United States; at the \ncost, Mr. President, of thousands and thousands of jobs. Is this really \nnecessary so the Senator from Massachusetts can make one last attack on \nRepublicans before we adjourn?\n  Is one last bit of disingenuous, transparent politicking really worth \nrisking public safety? Is it really worth the cost of jobs and costs to \nour communities?\n  Mr. President, the FAA Reauthorization Act had, up until the last few \ndays, represented what works in Washington. It is a completely \nbipartisan bill drafted with the close cooperation of the \nadministration. Republicans and Democrats worked constructively in both \nHouses of Congress without any partisan rancor or gamesmanship to do \nwhat is in the best interests of public safety and to do what is in the \nbest interests of our communities. We have done what the American \npeople so obviously want us to do and what they believe we too seldom \ndo--put their interests before our own.\n  Why must we now, at this late date, turn this sound, bipartisan, \nnecessary, urgent and well-intended legislation into one last occasion \nto score points off each other? The people are profoundly disappointed, \nif not surprised, that we have done so.\n  The time has come, now that we have all had our fun, to interrupt our \npolitical posturing for just a moment and free the FAA bill from the \n1996 election campaign. Let us at last do what the people expected us \nto do when they sent us to Washington--to take care of their welfare, \nlook after their interests, protect them when they travel, and help \nprovide their communities with the infrastructure necessary for their \ncommunities to grow.\n  This should not be a hard vote for any Member of the Senate. A vote \nfor cloture should be an easy vote for us all. It is an easy vote \nbecause it is the right vote even if we must relinquish some small \npolitical advantage that might be gained in casting the wrong vote. \nWhatever that advantage be, its value cannot compare to the value this \nbill holds for all our States and for all our constituents. Let us act \nin the best interests of all Americans, for that is in our own best \ninterests as well.\n  I urge my colleagues, all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nto join with Senator Ford and I, with Senator Hollings and Senator \nPressler, with all the Democrats and Republicans in both Houses of \nCongress, with administration officials and the leadership of Congress, \nwith all of us who abandoned partisanship for the sake of the public \nand vote for cloture. Let us finish the work of the 104th Congress and \ngo home with pride, Republican and Democrat alike, in working together \nto improve our country in that we have made Washington work for the \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield myself as much leader time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized under leader \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. First I want to emphasize, Mr. President, this has been a \nbipartisan effort. I did not know the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina was in the Republican leadership yet, but he has been accused \nof that, I guess, this morning because, in fact, it was his amendment \nthat included this provision in the bill, and Senator Pryor from \nArkansas is supportive of this legislation and Senator Moynihan, \nSenators McCain and Stevens. It has truly been bipartisan. There is no \nquestion about that. I think we should proceed from that standpoint.\n  This morning, I am thinking about the families of victims of airline \nincidents and accidents that have to be still horrified at what they \nhave been through and horrified at what we have been doing for the last \n3 days. We have been delaying this very important FAA\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\nreauthorization conference report, and as a result of that delay we \nhave threats to radar, air traffic control equipment, navigation \nequipment, landing systems equipment that remedies air traffic control \noutages, Doppler radar for wind shear, research and development, \nadvancement of explosive detection systems, human factor research, \naging aircraft.\n  This is big. This is important legislation, and it is, over 2 years, \n$19 billion for infrastructure security and safety.\n\n  This would be a senseless roll of the dice, if we did not invoke \ncloture this morning, bring this filibuster to a conclusion and move \nthis legislation on through.\n  I remind my colleagues the House has already acted responsibly, \noverwhelmingly moved this legislation, and they are gone. What would be \nthe situation if we did not bring this filibuster to a conclusion this \nmorning? We would not have any legislation, or if we had legislation \nthat made changes it would go back to the House and there is great \nconcern about when or if they would be able to get action on this \nlegislation. We should act together this morning and end this \nfilibuster and pass this legislation.\n  Now, one other point. I do not understand the attacks on Federal \nExpress. This is an outstanding company headed by an outstanding \nindividual. They are providing services that 30 years ago we could not \neven comprehend. They are doing a great job, and yet they are being \nattacked as if they are some sort of villain. It is absolutely wrong, \nthe rhetoric we have had to listen to over the past 3 days on a \ntechnical point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of what is \ninvolved in this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Highlights of FAA Reauthorization Conference Report (H.R. 3539)\n\n       Reauthorization of FAA--FY 1997, $9.7 billion; FY 1998, \n     $9.9 billion.\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Fiscal year-- \n                                                       -----------------\n                                                          1997     1998 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAirport grants........................................     $2.3     $2.4\nRadar, air traffic control equipment, navigation                        \n equipment, landing systems [ILS] equipment that                        \n remedies air traffic control outages doppler radar                     \n for wind shear.......................................      2.1      2.2\nOperations............................................      5.2      5.4\nResearch and development, advancement of explosive                      \n detection systems, human factor research, aging                        \n aircraft, air traffic control safety issues..........

I also ask unanimous consent that an explanation of the \nfact that this is a technical point be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Fact Sheet--Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 3539, the Federal \n                     Aviation Authorization of 1996\n\n       A provision is contained in the Conference Report to \n     accompany H.R. 3539 which makes a technical correction to a \n     drafting error which was contained in the Interstate Commerce \n     Commission Termination Act of 1995.\n       The following outlines the problem, the facts and the \n     solution:\n\n\n                                PROBLEM\n\n       A drafting error in the Interstate Commerce Commission \n     Termination Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-88) created an ambiguity \n     affecting the status of express carriers under the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n       One provision (Sec. 10501) states the intent of Congress: \n     ``the enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall \n     neither expand or contract coverage of the employees and \n     employers by the Railway Labor Act. . .''\n       However, a second provision drops ``express carriers'' \n     under the Railway Labor Act. This was clearly inadvertent and \n     in contradiction to the stated intent of Congress.\n\n\n                                 FACTS\n\n       Since the inception of the Railway Labor Act, ``express \n     carriers'' have come under the law's jurisdiction.\n       The Railway Labor Act is designed to protect the interests \n     of employees covered by that Act and is not an ``anti-labor'' \n     law.\n       For 62 years, employers and employees have been \n     successfully governed by the provisions of the Railway Labor \n     Act.\n\n\n                                SOLUTION\n\n       A provision in the Conference Report to accompany H.R. \n     3539, the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1995, states \n     that if an express company was under the Railway Labor Act \n     prior to the enactment of the ICC Termination Act, then that \n     express company shall remain under the purview of the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It is a small point. It reaffirms what has been the law for \n62 years. This is not a grab. This is not an effort to stomp somebody. \nThis is an effort to be fair, to correct a clear oversight; a mistake \nwas made. We are trying to correct that. That is all.\n  This is so important. We should this morning act together to stop the \nfilibuster, pass this legislation and go home for the sake of the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues, let us vote together. Let us \ninvoke cloture and pass the legislation in an expeditious manner.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to advise the distinguish \nleader that under rule XXII the yeas and nays are automatic.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I understand that if a point of order were \nraised that the pending FAA conference report exceeds the scope of the \nconference committee, that the Chair would rule that the conferees did \nexceed the scope with respect to the so-called Federal Express \nprovision. If the point of order is raised and sustained, the \nconference report would then fall.\n  This would mean, as we pointed out earlier, billions of dollars lost \nin construction funds, hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, and a \nsignificant reduction in air traffic safety. That would be jeopardized.\n  Needless to say, the Senate should not let this vital piece of \nlegislation be killed on this point of order, and having just had a \nvote of 66 to 31 to cut off the filibuster. In order to facilitate the \nvote, I raise a point of order that the conference report exceeds the \nscope of the conference committee and ask unanimous consent that there \nnow be 20 minutes for debate prior to the Chair's ruling, to be equally \ndivided between Senators Kennedy and Stevens. Senator McCain will \nparticipate in that. I have discussed this with Senator Kennedy. He \nunderstands that I would make this point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Reserving.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not intend to object. I want to point out that the \nrejection of the conference report does not mean the loss of money or \njobs or safety. If the report is rejected, the Senate can quickly and \nunanimously pass the bill that is at the desk, enacting the FAA bill \nwithout the Federal Express provision. The House is still in session to \nreceive and pass that bill. Having made that point of order, I have no \nobjection to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry. I understand there would be the \ndebate time which would be followed by a ruling from the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, I have 10 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor a period not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are moving toward the conclusion of \nthis issue. But this is an extremely important issue, and I would \ninvite our colleagues' attention.\n  Mr. President, in just a few moments the Chair will rule whether this \nparticular provision is inside the scope or outside the scope of the \nconference. I have every expectation that the Chair will rule that it \nwas outside the scope of the conference. Then we are going to be asked \nwhether we are going to sustain the Chair or overrule the Chair. I \nwould like to address that issue and what it means in terms of the \nfuture of this institution and the future of various conference \nreports.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues of the long-term \nsignificance of a vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair on this \nimportant point. Last year the junior Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, offered an amendment regarding the Endangered Species Act to \nan appropriations bill. The Chair ruled that the amendment would \nconstitute legislation on an appropriations bill, but the body \noverturned the ruling of the Chair.\n\n  That vote set a precedent. As a result of that vote, a point of order \nthat an amendment constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill is \nno longer available to Senators. To pass that single amendment, the \nSenate gave up an important aspect of our rules, one that has served to \nprotect the rights of all Members of this body. The point of order \nbefore us right now provides an even more important protection to all \nMembers.\n  The rule that a conference committee cannot include extraneous matter \nis central to the way that the Senate conducts its business. When we \nsend a bill to conference we do so knowing that the conference \ncommittee's work is likely to become law. Conference reports are \nprivileged. Motions to proceed to them cannot be debated, and such \nreports cannot be amended.\n  So conference committees are already very powerful. But if conference \ncommittees are permitted to add completely extraneous matters in \nconference, that is, if the point of order against such conduct becomes \na dead letter, conferees will acquire unprecedented power. They will \nacquire the power to legislate in a privileged, unreviewable fashion on \nvirtually any subject. They will be able to completely bypass the \ndeliberative process of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, this is a highly dangerous situation. It will make all \nof us less willing to send bills to conference and leave all of us \nvulnerable to passage of controversial, extraneous legislation any time \na bill goes to conference.\n  I hope the Senate will not go down this road. Today the narrow issue \nis the status of one corporation under the labor laws. But tomorrow the \nissue might be civil rights, States' rights, health care, education, or \nanything else. It might be a matter much more sweeping than the labor \nlaw issue that is before us today.\n  So for this vital institutional reason, I strongly urge the Senate to \nuphold the ruling of the Chair on the point of order. This vote is not \nabout the FAA, and it is not even about Federal Express; it is a vote \nabout whether this body is going to be governed by a neutral set of \nrules that protect the rights of all Members, and by extension, the \nrights of all Americans. If the rules of the Senate can be twisted and \nbroke and overridden to achieve a momentary legislative goal we will \nhave diminished the institution itself.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a rather difficult situation. We \nhave just passed, recently, a Defense appropriations bill. I was the \nchairman of that conference. Before it was over, we had a whole series \nof other bills, a series of legislative items. It was not necessary to \nraise a point of order. Everybody knew we exceeded the scope of the \nconference.\n  I ask any chairman of a conference if he or she has ever really been \ntotally restricted by this rule? This is an extraordinary time where we \nare in the last hours of this Congress. When the leader became aware \nthat Senator Kennedy was going to raise this point of order, the leader \ndetermined to raise it himself. I take it that having done that, there \nis no question this is a rather significant occasion. I hope it will be \na rather narrow precedent.\n  I point out to the Senate that this provision is not the only matter \nthat exceeds the scope of the conference. We had to include, at the \nadministration's request, special authority for the executive branch to \npurchase and deploy explosive detection devices. We put in here the \nprovisions that pertain to the rights of survivors of victims of air \ncrashes. We put in provisions requiring passenger screening companies \nto be certified by the FAA. That is not required under any existing \nlaw. We put\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\nin restrictions on underage pilots, following the one disaster that \ninvolved a young girl who was a pilot. We put in a provision requiring \nthe FAA to deal with structures that interfere with air commerce.\n  My point is, as we get to the end of a session, we, of necessity, \ninclude in a bill extraneous matters totally beyond the scope. We know \nthey are beyond the scope. As the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Committee, I knew all those items we brought to the \nfloor earlier this week were beyond the scope of the conference, but we \ndid not anticipate anyone would raise a point of order.\n  Anticipating that Senator Kennedy would bring this point of order \nbefore the Senate, the leader made this point of order. I ask the \nSenate to keep in mind this will be a rather limited precedent, in my \nopinion. I do not know whether the Chair will agree with me, but \nclearly when you get to the end of a Congress some things have to be \ndone. We did not have time to take up separate bills. We held a hearing \non the bill in the Senate Commerce Committee dealing with the rights of \nvictim-survivors of air disasters. They pleaded with us to include that \nbill in this legislation. We have done so.\n  In other words, this point of order is not only valid, in my \njudgment, against the amendment offered by Senator Hollings, but \nagainst the other provisions where we have exceeded the scope in \nvarious matters on this bill. I ask the Senate, when the time comes to \nvote, to overrule the Chair. It will not be debatable, but I clearly \nexpect a ruling from the Chair that this report does exceed the scope \nof the conference under the rules and, in these circumstances, I ask \nthat the ruling of the Chair be overturned.\n  I yield to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield such time as remains to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to this particular point of \norder, it would not set any precedent relative to anything dealing with \nthe merits of the matter. It is dealing, once again, basically with a \nfundamental mistake made in the drafting of a measure that was caught \nsome 2 months later, never discussed, never voted on and, of course, \nthere were no hearings, or what have you.\n  So what we have done is taken this opportunity on a very germane \nmatter, Federal Express is the sixth largest airline in the country, \nand brought in this particular correction. It has nothing to do with \nthe merits of anything and no precedent will be set when we overrule \nthis Chair.\n\n  Mr. President, I can tell you categorically, if this kind of a point \nof order was made on Monday, we would have had to close down the \nGovernment. You can go down and list the various things--$249.8 million \nemergency appropriations for counterterrorism that was not in the bill \nor in the conference. The measure under discussion here was at least in \nthe conference. The FBI with $60 million, the Prevention Council, \nvarious appropriations for the EDA, the SBA, I could go down the list.\n  I am confident I can get support now when I remind the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts--the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research \nInstitute, I am constantly getting a little card from my distinguished \nfriend, and I love to do it. He said, you have to take care of me up \nthere in Boston, and I said, I am glad to do it. It was not in either \nthe House or the Senate, but I think we can get it in. We do that. I \nhope he can vote with me on this particular overriding of the Chair's \nruling.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on another matter, I announce we will \nhave a Governmental Affairs Committee meeting as soon as this vote \nstarts in S-128 to consider reporting a nomination at the request of \nthe administration, for the Administrator of the General Service \nAdministration, and other nominations. I ask unanimous consent that be \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will not delay the resolution of this \nissue, but the issue is not germaneness. That is not the issue, whether \nthis is germane. The issue is whether this material is outside the \nscope of what was sent to the Congress in the House and the Senate. \nThat is the issue.\n  Today, it is a labor provision. Tomorrow, it may be water in the \nWest, it may be land in the West, it may be civil rights, it may be \nhealth care, it may be any other issues which Members have some \ninterest in. There is no such thing as a narrow precedent. We have had \nthe precedent that was established about legislation on an \nappropriation by Kay Bailey Hutchison. That has changed.\n  Certainly, the rules that govern this institution for the better part \nof my service in the U.S. Senate--now we are talking about a very \nsignificant and important difference--whether these matters are outside \nthe scope. That is the issue, not whether it is germane or not germane, \nbut whether it is outside the scope. The House Parliamentarian ruled it \nwas outside the scope, and that is why the House of Representatives had \nto have a separate vote.\n  Now we are going to have a judgment about whether it is inside the \nscope or outside the scope. If the judgment is made that it is inside, \nI hope that would support the Chair. If it was made that it was \noutside, that we would support the Chair as well. It reflects, and will \nreflect for years to come, the whole basic institutional integrity of \nthis body and how it will consider conference reports into the future. \nIt is very important, significant, and powerful.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as the Senator may consume.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want a moment to say a word about the point-of-order \nissue. A point was made by the Senator from South Carolina, I believe, \nthat the same type of point of order could have been raised with regard \nto the continuing resolution earlier this week. I have not examined the \nissue closely, but I imagine that is true. But we should reflect a \nmoment on the concept of what that was about versus the willingness of \nthis body, perhaps, to overturn its own rules on something that is so \nspecific to one corporation that it seems almost astonishing.\n  To what extent are we going to go as a body in the future in changing \nour rules, undoing our rules, overruling a point of order, to \naccommodate one provision that only has to do with one matter? I think \nthere is a huge difference. I am not even sure it was appropriate with \nregard to the continuing resolution. I happen to have voted against it \nin part for that reason.\n  Surely, for us to start engaging in overruling points of order to \nbenefit the needs of one corporation to try to overturn what is a \ncontinuing litigation or to affect the results of continuing litigation \nis a very troubling precedent for this body, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts has indicated.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12229-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12230-S12232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RULE 28 CHALLENGE TO THE FAA CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Senate soon will be voting on the \nmotion to overrule the decision of the Chair with respect to the ruling \nthat section 1223 of the conference report pending before the Senate \nviolates rule 28 of the Senate by exceeding the scope of the authority \nof the conference committee. As chairman not only of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation which is the committee of \njurisdiction in the Senate, but also as chairman of the conference \ncommittee that produced this report, I rise to ask my colleagues to \noverturn the ruling of the Chair in this matter.\n  Do I do so because I believe the provision was, in fact, within the \nscope of the conference? No, Mr. President, I admit this section, added \nby an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, was not contained in the legislation as initially passed by \neither the House or the Senate. I am also fully aware that Rule 28.2 of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate clearly states a conference committee \n``shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by \neither House.''\n  However, Mr. President, those on the opposite side of the issue know \nfull well that this is done with some frequency when a particular \nsituation necessitates such action. Those Members also know that as a \nresult, sections in\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\nmany, if not most of the conference reports considered in this body \nwould be subject to this same point of order. Do we raise such points \nof order? No, Mr. President, we do not. Why? Because all Members know \nfull well that this is how we conduct our business and have done so \nthroughout our history.\n  Indeed, in this very conference report, if we are to fully and fairly \nadopt the line of reasoning that section 1223 exceeds the scope of the \nconference, we need to look at several other sections of the report \nadded by the conference committee I chaired that were in neither the \nHouse nor Senate passed versions of the underlying legislation. Let me \ngive a few examples.\n  Section 302 of the conference report directs the Administrator of the \nFederal Aviation Administration to certify companies providing security \nscreening and to improve the training and testing of security screeners \nthrough development of uniform performance standards. Mr. President, \nthis provision appears in neither the House nor the Senate bill. It was \nadded in conference after it was made as one of the recommendations of \nVice President Gore's Commission on Aviation Security, of which I am \nproud to be a member. It was included by the conferees because it was \ndetermined to be important enough for this Nation's airline security \nthat Congress should not wait until next year to enact the \nrecommendation.\n  For similar security reasons, the conference included Section 305(b) \ngiving the FAA Administrator authority to deploy Government purchased \nexplosive detection devices. Mr. President, I would point out that this \nprovision was considered by the conferees at the request of the \nadministration. Both the administration and members of the conference \nknew it was an important part of efforts to improve aviation security \nin this country. I have to admit, Mr. President, as such not much \nthought was given to whether it was technically within the authority of \nthe conference committee to act.\n\n  As final examples I would cite section 503 concerning studies of \nminimum standards for pilot qualifications and of pay for training and \nsection 1220 concerning structures interfering with air commerce. \nAgain, neither was in the House or Senate bills. Again, the conference \nacted because it was important that Congress deal with the matters.\n  Mr. President, no Member has risen to raise a rule 28 point of order \nagainst these provisions. Why? Because none has become so unfairly \npoliticized as section 1223. Indeed, the fact that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has raised the scope issue only against this one section \nof the report seems to indicate he may be less interested in the \nsanctity of the Senate rules than he is in making a political \nstatement. I certainly will not waste the Senate's time by rehashing \nthe arguments made over the last 3 days. Lord knows we have wasted far \ntoo much time already on this point.\n  I will simply summarize what I have already said. This is not about \nunfairly granting a special interest provision to a single large \ncorporation. Interestingly, none of the Members that have raised that \npoint on the floor of the Senate over the last 3 days served on the ICC \nconference last December that started all this. Thus, they simply are \nnot in a position to know the facts.\n  Who does know the facts, Mr. President? Those of us who actually \nserved on the ICC conference. Those of us who were actually in the \nroom. Those of us who actually wrote the conference agreement. I was \nthere, Mr. President. I know what did and did not happen and what was \nand was not agreed to. The Senator from South Carolina was there, Mr. \nPresident. He too, knows what we were about. We made a mistake. We \ninadvertently changed a section of Federal law we never voted to \nchange. That is why Senator Hollings offered this amendment in \nconference and why we included section 1223 in the conference report. \nWe needed to correct our mistake. It starts there and it ends there Mr. \nPresident. We were doing nothing more or less than fixing an unfair \nsituation we created in another bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, those supporting the ruling of the Chair warn \nus that we are setting a very dangerous precedent if we overrule the \nChair on this point of order. We are warned this will only be the \nbeginning. That soon we will be faced with conference reports changing \ncivil rights laws and making major revisions to health care. Mr. \nPresident, I prefer to give my colleagues more credit than that. \nObviously, if, for example, a conference committee on a Commerce \nCommittee bill like this one produces a report that rewrites our civil \nrights laws a point of order surely will be raised. Just as obviously, \nsuch a point of order would likely be sustained by a huge majority of \nthe Members of this body. But that is not what we are talking about. \nWhat we are voting on today is whether to allow this Conference \nCommittee to fix an honest mistake. It is that simple. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair.\n\n  Mr. President, let me also take just a moment to thank those \nindividuals who have been so instrumental to the passage of this \ncritical legislation. As has already been said, this process has taken \nthe better part of the last 2 years. It would not have been possible \nwithout a great deal of dedication and hard work on the part of many of \nmy colleagues and some very talented staff work.\n  My good friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, has been a driving force \nbehind this legislation. Senator McCain skillfully managed this \nlegislation and his outstanding work and leadership helped make this \nsignificant legislative accomplishment possible. I also want to commend \nmy good friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, whose legislative skill \nand leadership contributed greatly to this legislation. Senator \nStevens' dedication to improving aviation safety and improving the \ntreatment of families of aviation disaster victims is exemplary.\n  Let me also commend and thank my good friend from South Carolina, the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee Senator Hollings, who provided \nimportant leadership on this bipartisan legislation. Also, let me \nacknowledge the efforts of Senator Ford, the ranking member of the \nAviation Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge the \noutstanding contribution staff from the Commerce Committee and personal \noffices made in this process. For the past 2 years, staff has worked \nliterally thousands of hours on this legislation. From the Commerce \nCommittee, I wish to commend the outstanding efforts of Paddy Link, Tom \nHohenthaner, Mike Reynolds, and Mike Korens from the majority staff and \nKevin Curtin and Sam Whitehorn from the minority staff. I also want to \ncommend the outstanding efforts of Chris Paul of Senator McCain's \nstaff, Mitch Rose and Earl Comstock of Senator Stevens' staff, Amy \nHenderson of Senator Hutchison's staff and Tom Zoeller of Senator \nFord's staff.\n  I thank them all for all the professionalism, dedication and hard \nwork during both good times and bad. I think the final bill embodies \nthe true spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation that is the \nmark of excellence in the legislative process. All involved should be \nproud.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to inform the Senate that the \nSenator from Alaska has 3 minutes 37 seconds; the Senator from \nMassachussets has 2 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are prepared to yield back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded, it is the \nopinion of the Chair that the conference report exceeds the scope, and \nthe point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the Senate? On this question, the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. A ``yea'' vote is \nto sustain the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to bring to my colleagues attention a \nvery grave situation involving the illegal diversion of revenues at Los \nAngeles International Airport. As I understand it, the Mayor of Los \nAngeles transferred $31 million from the airport treasury to city \ncoffers last week. Senator McCain and I have worked together on \nlegislation to prevent illegal revenue diversion. During our \ndeliberations, we were very aware of the City of Los Angeles' efforts. \nI want to make clear that the action taken last week is clearly \nillegal. The amount paid is apparently based on an age-old dispute over \nhow much the airport owes the city. I understand that the debt has \nalready been repaid to the city once.\n  The Secretary of Transportation must recognize that he has the tools \nto enforce the law against illegal revenue diversion. First, he has the \npower to withhold grants for other, nonaviation purposes. The Federal \nAviation Reauthorization Act contains even broader discretion for the \nSecretary and I urge him to send the message, loud and clear, that \nrevenue diversion will not be tolerated. Under our bill, the Secretary \nmay withhold grants and apportionments from any airport sponsor, or any \nmultimodal transportation agency to which the sponsor is a member, if \nthe sponsor diverts revenue illegally off of the airport. Furthermore, \nthe Secretary is empowered to redeposit that money with the airport. \nThe Secretary should exercise this authority and restore the money to \nLAX so that the important safety and security work needed on the \nairport can move forward.\n  Finally, I want to state that H.R. 3539 contains a pilot program for \nfive airports. It would allow the Secretary to approve a long-term \nlease, which would include permitting revenue diversion. The conferees \nwere very concerned about the ability to divert revenues under a \nprivatization scheme. However, Los Angeles was the real concern. As a \nresult, we limited the number and type of airports eligible for the \npilot program. The Secretary should be aware that a large airport that \ncontinually frustrated the clear intent of Congress would clearly not \nmeet the criteria for privatization contained in H.R. 3539.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nconference report before the Senate which will help improve the safety \nand security of air travel in this country. I wish to commend Senator \nPressler, Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and Senator McCain, \nChairman of the Aviation Subcommittee for their diligent work in \nbringing this bill to completion prior to the adjournment of the 104th \nCongress.\n  In the past 5 months, the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] has \ncome under intense scrutiny. After ValuJet flight 592 was swallowed by \nthe silt and tall grass of the Everglades in May, the issue of FAA's \nability to ensure the safety of the traveling public was brought into \nquestion. On July 17, the explosion of TWA flight 800 minutes after \nleaving New York's Kennedy Airport heightened public concern over not \nonly the safety of our airplanes but the security of our airports as \nwell.\n  This conference report cannot answer all of the questions surrounding \nthese two devastating tragedies, but it does give the FAA the guidance \nand many of the tools it needs to regain the public's trust. And it \nreaffirms the commitment of the Congress to end that status quo at the \nagency.\n  First and foremost this bill will once and for all eliminate the \nquestion of the FAA's mission. On June 18, the Secretary of \nTransportation, Federico Pena, called on Congress to ``* * *change the \nFAA charter to give it a single primary mission: safety and only \nsafety.'' By removing the ``dual and dueling missions'' of safety and \nair carrier promotion, both the FAA and the public will know that \nsafety is the sole mission of the agency. I introduced S. 1960 earlier \nthis year with Chairman Pressler to carry out the Secretary's request, \nand the Senate-passed version of this bill included provisions I \nauthored that established a process for elimination of the mandate. I \nam pleased that the conference report will lay this issue to rest, once \nand for all by allowing the FAA to focus solely and deliberately on \nassuring the safety of air travel.\n  Another important aspect of this bill addresses an area that has been \ntragically overlooked--the needs of the families of crash victims. The \nloss of a loved one in any accident is devastating. But this loss \nshould not be compounded by the careless treatment of their family, and \nwe have all heard heartbreaking stories of family members who learned \nof the death of their loved one from CNN because the airline could not \nor would not verify that they were on the plane. I believe that we can \nand must change the way families of plane crashes are treated. This \nbill will take some very important steps--such as requiring airlines to \nhave a disaster plan in place, putting the National Transportation \nSafety Board [NTSB] in charge of overseeing family advocacy and \nrequiring that airlines have adequate toll-free phone lines available \nfor families in order to ensure they can get through when emergencies \noccur. We still need to do more, but these provisions are a necessary \nfirst step.\n  Regardless of the outcome of the investigation into the causes of the \ncrash of TWA flight 800, the fact that it could have been downed by a \nbomb shocked us all. The conference report returns our attention to the \nneed to address the serious issue of security at our airports. Again, \nit is only a first step, and the 105th Congress will be tasked with \nfollowing through on the guidelines we have laid down in this bill, as \nthere is much that needs to be done and many questions the FAA still \nhas to answer about why we do not have one explosive detection device \nready for installation at our airports--despite the provisions of the \n1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act which required their \ninstallation by 1993.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \npassage of the FAA reauthorization conference report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senate Commerce Committee and its \nAviation Subcommittee have worked hard to put together the Federal \nAviation Authorization bill. The conference report on H.R. 3539 \nrepresents a fair compromise on many issues. My colleagues, Senator \nMcCain and Senator\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\nFord, have spent a lot of time and effort to develop the legislation. \nIt is a complex bill that seeks to provide a future foundation for the \nFederal Aviation Administration [FAA], for air service to small \ncommunities, and for our Nation's airports. The bill addresses the \nfundamental needs to the national air travel system. Passengers must be \nsure that safety is the FAA's primary mission, that security measures \nare improved, that we have enough safety inspectors with the tools to \ndo their job, and that our Nation's airports have the money to remain \nsafe. This bill does that. The bill also establishes a series of task \nforces to determine the best way to fund the agency.\n  Key provisions in the bill will make the FAA a more autonomous \nagency--with the ability to make its own decisions concerning \nregulations, personnel, and procurement. The bill changes the funding \nformulas for the Airport Improvement Program, providing more money for \nthose airports most in need of Federal help. The beneficiaries, mainly \nsmaller airports, will receive higher entitlements. In South Carolina, \nsome airport projects are underway and need funding to continue. Other \nworthy projects in my State cannot begin without money from the Airport \nImprovement Program. Security, a critical issue, also is addressed. The \nbill for example, requires that security screening companies be \ncertified by the FAA. The bill will facilitate the installation of \nexplosive detection equipment.\n  There is one section in the bill on privatization that the conferees \nspent a good deal of time discussing. The provision continues to \ntrouble me. Under the legislation, an airport can be privatized and \nstill receive a Federal grant. If the private sector believes it can \nsuddenly revitalize airports with claims of new money, why does the \nFederal Government have to provide corporate welfare? The Federal \nGovernment has a clear interest in our Nation's airports. We have \nhelped design them, have provided all sorts of equipment to make them \nsafe, and have funded them. The U.S. Government and U.S. taxpayers have \nan investment in them. The provision that allows airport privatization \npermits airports to be turned over to a private company. The Federal \nGovernment does not get a dime back, while a private company can make a \nprofit partly from the Federal investment. This is wrong.\n  H.R. 3539 incorporates much of the text of S. 1994, the FAA reform \nbill, reported by the Commerce Committee last June. Those provisions \ncall for an independent review of the precise needs of the FAA, \nfollowed by the submission of a funding proposal to finance the agency. \nWe know that the Federal budget will continue to be cut, but some \nprograms must be funded--like the FAA. The financing reform sought by \nthe bill will help us figure out a better way to provide needed \nfunding--whether it is by placing it off budget, by fees, or by taxes. \nThe goal is to make sure money collected from passengers on air \ncarriers goes to the FAA.\n\n\n                           Aviation Security\n\n  Aviation security is an extremely complex issue. It involves \ntechnology, personnel, intelligence information, national security, and \na recognition that there are people willing to commit heinous crimes \naimed at our Government and our citizens. The bill provides for a \nsafety commission. I want to make clear that the commission is intended \nto complete the work of the Vice President's task force.\n  Investigators in New York have not yet identified the cause of the \ncrash of TWA flight 800, and numerous options are being considered. We \nhave to let the investigators complete their mission. The National \nTransportation Safety Board, the Navy, the FBI, and State and local \npersonnel are working hard to determine the cause of the accident. We \ndo know this, however--the public deserves the best technology operated \nby the best trained individuals, to reduce the risks of a terrorist \nattack.\n  Another thing is clear--security is going to be costly. The FAA has \nestimated that it will cost as much as $2.2 billion to install up to \n1,800 machines at 75 airports. Today, there are approximately 14,000-\n18,000 screeners, paid an average of $10,000 to $15,000 per year. These \nscreeners are one line of defense, but a critical one in the fight \nagainst terrorism. They need training, and they need to be paid in \naccordance with their responsibilities. The present turnover rate among \nthese employees is extremely high. Unless we change the way we provide \nsecurity, we cannot upgrade it. All the technology in the world still \nrequires a person to watch a screen, listen to alarms, and be able to \nrecognize materials that should not go on board an aircraft.\n  No matter what we do, safety comes first. Nothing should go onto an \naircraft without being screened. Cargo, company material, and baggage \nall should be subject to inspection.\n  Security changes may require a fundamental alteration in the way air \ncarriers provide services. Longer lines can be expected. Unfortunately, \nit is a price we must pay to deal with people in this world willing to \nstop at nothing.\n  Mr. President, let me thank our Commerce Committee Democratic staff--\nSam Whitehorn, Clyde Hart, Jim Drewry, Kevin Curtin, Becky K. and \nSylvia Cikins for all their hard work in the resolution of these \nissues.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not wish to delay adjournment of the \nSenate nor hold up passage of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nauthorization bill. Absent the provision we have been discussing these \npast few days, the FAA bill could pass the Senate with near unanimous, \nif not unanimous, support. However, I cannot acquiesce in this ploy to \ncircumvent normal Senate procedure, and thus will vote against cloture \nat this time. There have been no hearings on the so-called express \ncarrier provision. Until it was presented to us as a non-germane \nprovision in an unamendable conference report, it was never debated on \nthe floor of the Senate. The provision was not included in either the \nHouse or the Senate version of the FAA authorization bill, nor had it \nbeen approved as part of any other legislation passed by the House or \nthe Senate. Hence I believe it was most irregular for the conference \ncommittee to even have taken up this issue, much less to have inserted \nit into this conference report.\n  If the debate on the Senate floor these past few days has told us \nanything, it has told us quite clearly that this rider is anything but \na noncontroversial technical issue. Hearings should be held, the \nramifications of this change in the law should be fully explored, \ninterested parties should be given an opportunity to express their \nviews, and Members of Congress should be able to offer amendments.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that there has been no \ndesignated express carrier operating for some 20 years and that Federal \nExpress was not when the ICC existed, and is not now, an express \ncarrier. Hence the action of the Congress in deleting this obsolete \ndesignation, in the course of terminating the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, last year still seems entirely appropriate. If there is a \ncase to be made for the resurrection of this outdated designation, then \nlet us see a separate piece of legislation, let us see some hearings, \nlet the normal legislative process make the case for why the change is \nneeded. The very process by which this matter is finally presented to \nthe Senate--in a conference report at the very end of the session--\nmakes me suspect that the issue deserves a much closer look than we are \nable to give it in this setting.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Ford, the \nranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, and Senator \nMcCain, the chairman of that committee, for all the time and effort \nthat they have put into the FAA reauthorization bill. The fact that the \nSenate unanimously approved the bill last month is a testament to their \nability to work together with the common goal of improving the safety \nand security of our air transportation system.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I question whether the Federal Express \nprovision should be included in the FAA reauthorization bill. I think \nthis controversial issue merits further consideration at another time. \nWhen the 105th Congress convenes next year, I am hopeful that the \nSenate Labor Committee will hold hearings on this matter.\n  But the facts are these: We cannot remove this provision without \nkilling\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\nthe FAA reauthorization bill. We must pass this bill before we adjourn \nfor the year. And the FAA's ability to enhance safety and security at \nour Nation's airports is contingent upon enactment of this important \nlegislation.\n  The House has already passed the conference report to the FAA \nreauthorization bill as well as the omnibus appropriations bill. For \nall practical purposes, the other Chamber has closed its doors for the \nremainder of the year. There should be no misunderstanding. Our House \ncolleagues have no intention of returning to Washington to consider \nadditional legislation. Any change that we make to the FAA \nreauthorization bill at this point would most certainly require \nunanimous consent in the House. Needless to say, convincing the House \nto give unanimous consent to amending the conference report to the FAA \nreauthorization bill is simply not possible.\n  Whether we agree with the Federal Express provision or not, we must \npass the conference report to the FAA reauthorization bill. At the \nlatest, the Senate should have been passed this legislation on Monday, \nand we cannot delay passage of this bill any longer.\n  Our colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee have worked for more \nthan 2 years on this bill. The committee cannot and should not be \nforced to start that process all over again in a new Congress. We must \nfinish our work today and provide the FAA with the tools it needs to \nimprove the safety and security of our air transportation system.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill includes several safety provisions that \nshould have been authorized earlier this week. Among those, the bill \nauthorizes $2.28 billion in fiscal year 1997 and $2.3 billion in fiscal \nyear 1998 for the Airport Improvement Program. As my colleagues well \nknow, this critical funding allows airports throughout the country to \nmake much-needed safety improvements. Without authorization, however, \nconstruction on these important projects will remain idle.\n  The bill also allows the FAA to respond directly and more promptly to \nsafety problems without needless bureaucratic delay or second-guessing. \nThe bill also establishes a framework for airlines to obtain background \ninformation on a pilot's previous employer. The National Transportation \nSafety Board recommended these background checks as a result of a \nnumber of airplane accidents that were caused in part by pilots with \npoor performance records. Again, without authorization, these important \nsafety provisions will not be implemented.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill also includes a number of important \nsecurity provisions proposed by the Senate Commerce Committee, Vice \nPresident Al Gore's commission on aviation safety, and many other \nMembers of the Senate. For instance, the bill gives the FAA the \nauthority to permit criminal background checks on baggage screeners at \nour Nation's airports.\n  The bill also gives the FAA the authority to facilitate the interim \ndeployment of advance aviation security technology including explosives \ndetection equipment. And the legislation calls for an evaluation by the \nNational Academy of Sciences on explosives detection and aircraft \nhardening technology. Furthermore, the bill would authorize the FAA to \nconduct vulnerability assessments of individual airports and permit \nairlines to conduct improved passenger profiling. Again, without \nauthorization, these critical security measures will not be \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes several provisions that are \nparticularly important to rural America. Perhaps most importantly, the \nbill authorizes the FAA to tax foreign airlines that fly over the \nUnited States and designates half of that revenue, estimated at $100 \nmillion annually for the Essential Air Service [EAS] program. EAS is \ncrucial to the economic stability of small communities in South Dakota \nand across the country. Unfortunately, EAS funding has been reduced in \nrecent years, and service to EAS recipients has suffered accordingly. \nEnactment of the overflight tax will provide a much-needed new funding \nmechanism for the EAS program.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a \nstudy of fares charged by commercial air carriers traveling into non-\nhub airports in small communities. This study is critical to \ndetermining whether passengers in rural areas pay a disproportionately \ngreater price for air service than passengers who fly between urban \nareas. Like my colleague, Senator Dorgan, I believe they do, and I look \nforward to the results of that study so we can focus on ways to improve \nairline service to rural communities. Again, without authorization, \nneither the EAS provision or the rural air fare study will move \nforward.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that we must pass the conference \nreport to the FAA reauthorization bill. Whether we agree with the \nFederal Express provision or not, we must pass this important bill \ntoday. We cannot wait any longer. We must pass this bill so that the \nFAA has the ability to enhance safety and security at our nation's \nairports. We must pass this bill to ensure that rural America receives \nthe kind of air service it rightfully deserves. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the passage of the conference report on the FAA reauthorization \nbill.\n  Mr. KERRY. H.R. 3539, the FAA Reauthorization conference agreement, \nis, primarily, a good bill--a very good bill--and one whose contents \nare of great importance to the people of this country. Several Senators \nincluding Senator Hollings, Senator Pressler, Senator Ford, and Senator \nMcCain have worked for many months to craft this important legislation. \nThey deserve great credit for shepherding the bill through the Commerce \nCommittee and then obtaining passage with a vote of 99-0 on the Senate \nfloor. These Senators and their fine staffs--specifically, I would like \nto recognize the work of Sam Whitehorn on the minority side--produced a \nnon-controversial, sensible bill that addresses a critical need of our \nNation.\n  We need to pass an FAA Reauthorization bill because of the pivotal \nrole that the FAA plays in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. \nWe ask the FAA each year to ensure the safety of all civil aviation and \nto oversee the continued development of our national system of \nairports. Through a comprehensive program that includes a vast air \ntraffic control network, and thousands of maintenance inspections of \nour Nation's civilian airlines, the FAA carries out the important task \nof ensuring the safety of the millions of Americans that utilize air \ntravel each year. Significantly, this conference agreement provides to \nthe FAA the necessary tools to carry out these important tasks. It \nprovides $9.54 billion in total budget authority for the FAA for fiscal \nyear 1997 including $5.16 billion for operations, $2.28 billion for the \nAirport Improvement Program, and $2.1 billion for facilities and \nequipment. This total figure represents an increase of $1.39 billion \nover the FAA's total budget authority for fiscal year 1996 and an \nincrease of $1.33 billion over the administration's budget request.\n  In addition, Massachusetts needs Congress to pass an FAA \nreauthorization bill because we rely so heavily on air transport for \nboth people and cargo and because the Airport Improvement Program is so \ncrucial to our State. From Logan Airport in Boston to the smaller \nairports located in Nantucket, Hyannis, Martha's Vineyard, Worcester, \nNew Bedford and Provincetown, airports and air transport are critical \nto the economic and social travel needs of the people of Massachusetts. \nThis legislation is good for the people of Massachusetts. It contains \nadditional AIP funding for Massachusetts airports in fiscal year 1997 \nbeyond the amounts these airports are entitled to receive under current \nlaw. And it also increases the amount of discretionary funding that the \nState of Massachusetts can distribute to airports and related projects.\n  This conference agreement also contains an important provision to \nimprove the security of our Nation's airports that will result in \ngreater safety for commercial flights originating at U.S. airports. I \nhave been pushing the FAA for several years to begin to use existing \nadvanced technologies, far more capable than x rays and metal \ndetectors, to screen passenger baggage for explosives before it is \nplaced on aircraft. The conference agreement instructs the FAA to move \nforward in this respect. Rather than awaiting the advent of a new \nsensor technology that can meet all desired sensor standards perfectly \nor nearly perfectly, the FAA is instructed to procure and implement\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\nuse of the best currently available technology--which is the approach \ntaken by virtually all major European airports. There is simply no \nreason of which I am aware for the United States not to take this \nimportant step.\n\n  Unfortunately, this important legislation, which is strongly \nsupported by Senator Kennedy, Senator Simon, Senator Feingold, and all \nothers in this Chamber, became mired in a dispute over a four-line \nprovision--tacked on to the bill in conference--that is unrelated to \nthe otherwise important and bipartisan task of reauthorizing the FAA. \nThis provision amends the Railway Labor Act to make it substantially \nmore difficult for certain Federal Express employees to organize. I do \nnot support this provision which amends labor law in a controversial \nway on a bill that is totally unrelated to labor law, and, because of \nthe addition of that provision, I voted against the cloture motion to \nend debate on the FAA conference agreement. I hoped the Senate would \nreject cloture, confident that if cloture was not invoked, this FAA \nlegislation would have been brought back to the floor without the \ncontroversial provision, and passed by unanimous consent. That is what \nI believe the Senate should have done.\n  Now that cloture has been invoked, and another effort to remove the \nprovision because it was outside the scope of the conference committee \nwas rejected by the Senate, we confront the great importance of passing \nan FAA reauthorization bill before this Congress adjourns. Once again, \nI compliment those who led the Senate in assembling the aviation \nprovisions of this bill. It is a good bill that will contribute much to \nour Nation. I will vote for it.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of passage of \nthe conference report to H.R. 3539, Federal Aviation Authorization Act \nof 1996. This conference report contains provisions crucial for the \nsafe and efficient operation of our Nation's airports. This \nauthorization will enable vital funds to be allocated to our airports \nunder the Airport Improvement Program for the construction of necessary \nrunways and taxiways, installation of navigational aids, and \nacquisition of land for noise abatement measures. The bill also permits \nfunds to be used for essential enhancements of airport facilities and \nequipment, and supports substantial Federal Administration [FAA] \noperations.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these authorizations to improve our \nairports infrastructure and language to improve aviation security, this \nconference report contains provisions which seek to resolve an \nimportant question as to the status of the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority [MWAA]. The Airport Authority, created by Congress \nin 1987, has been successfully fulfilling its obligations of maximizing \nthe development of Washington Dulles International Airport, while fully \nutilizing the resources at Washington National Airport.\n  However, Mr. President, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the \nAirport Authority's congressional review board is unconstitutional. \nWithout Congress eliminating this unconstitutional review board, the \nAirport Authority would not be able to continue to exercise its vital \nfunctions such as adopting an annual budget, awarding contracts, and \nissuing bonds. This conference report eliminates that unconstitutional \nboard, and therefore enables the Airport Authority to move forward.\n  I am pleased that this provision was included, while not interfering \nwith the perimeter rule, which allows nonstop flights into and out of \nWashington National only if the flight is 1,250 miles or less. This \nrule is critical in helping maintain the delicate balance between \nWashington National and Dulles International Airports. Retaining this \nperimeter rule will maximize the almost $2 billion of capital \nimprovements underway at these two airports. And I appreciate the \nassistance of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hollings and their staff \nin ensuring that this perimeter rule was preserved.\n  Mr. President, this FAA conference report is filled with provisions \nthat not only benefit the metropolitan Washington area, but airports, \nlarge and small, throughout the nation. I am pleased with the \noverwhelming support the conference report has received and I'm looking \nforward to the benefits of this bill in Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I expect we will vote momentarily on the \nfinal passage. I want, just before that, first of all, to thank all the \nMembers for their indulgence during the period of these past days. This \nissue is really not about the FAA and the conference report, outside of \nthis very special provision. I expect to support the conference report \nin just a few moments.\n  I thank all the Members for their courtesies over the period of the \nlast days, those colleagues of mine who supported a common position, \nand our worthy opponents who carried the day. I believe this particular \nprovision would not have carried in a Democratically controlled \nCongress of the House and Senate, but the Senate has spoken now. The \nissue of workers' rights is going to very much be the issue on November \n5. We have one vote today and another vote on November 5. I just hope \nthey will understand who is on their side.\n  I again thank all of those in the Senate for their attention and for \ntheir courtesies on this matter. I hope at the earliest time we will go \nto a final vote on the FAA conference report. I intend to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now that we are going to a final vote, I would like to \nmake just a 60-second comment.\n  I thank Senator Pressler, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nwhose leadership in FAA reform has been steady and tireless. I thank \nSenator Hollings, the ranking member of the committee, and Senator \nFord, who worked from the beginning, 2 years ago, to bring meaningful \nreform to the FAA and provide for the critical long-term and stable \nfunding which is so necessary for modernizing the air traffic control \nsystem, and hopefully putting an end to the more than 420 power outages \nlast year.\n  I also thank my friend, the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who \nworked with me and Senator Ford to craft the compromise we are voting \non today.\n  Finally, let me thank the countless number of General Accounting \nOffice staff, the administration, Secretary Pena, the Secretary of \nTransportation, David Hinson, the FAA Administrator, and especially \nLinda Daschle, who worked tirelessly, literally hundreds and hundreds \nof hours, through late nights and many weekends, to build a better FAA \nthrough major reform, I am especially grateful for her outstanding \nwork.\n  Mr. President, others who are very deserving of recognition, \nincluding aviation expert Dr. Jack Fearnsides, Ken Mead of the General \nAccounting Office, Katherine Archuleta, Secretary Pena's Chief of \nStaff, Bert Randall, Assistant Chief Counsel of FAA, Paul Feldman, \nSpecial Assistant to the Deputy Administrator of FAA. And, of course, \nSam Whitehorn of Senator Hollings' staff, Tom Zoeller of Senator Ford's \nstaff, Mitch Rose and Earl Comstock of Senator Stevens' staff, Mike \nReynolds, Lloyd Ator, Mike Korens, Tom Hohenthaner and Paddy Link of \nSenator Pressler's staff.\n  I would like to personally thank the tireless efforts of those on my \nstaff, Chris Paul and Mark Buse, who have worked so hard to make this \nbill a reality, and many others who have contributed so much.\n  Again, I want to pay special thanks to my dear friend, Senator Ford \nof Kentucky, who realized from the beginning, along with me and others, \nthat the only way you pass this kind of legislation, this kind of \nfundamental reform, is through a bipartisan effort and in partnership \nwith the administration, in whichever party alignment that may be.\n  I cannot help but express my appreciation to him for the many years \nof cooperation that we have had together, especially on this issue--it \nhas characterized our relationship now for more than 10 years.\n  Mr. FORD. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We may do more things together in the future, but I am \nnot sure we will ever do anything this significant.\n  I understand the yeas and nays will be asked for. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, in bringing this conference report before the Senate.\n  Let me also join with him in paying compliments to our staff and to \nthe many individuals who have assisted us. As Senator McCain has said, \nwe have worked long and hard for 2 years now. It has been a bipartisan \neffort. We have had our disagreements, but we have not been \ndisagreeable. We have pushed and pulled, and finally we have come to \nthe point now where this bill is about to be passed.\n  The conference report before us today reauthorizes various programs \nof the Federal Aviation Administration, namely the Airport Improvement \nProgram [AIP]. The AIP program provides the necessary Federal funds for \nthe continued investment in our airport and airways infrastructure.\n  The current authorization for the AIP program expires on September \n30. Without this reauthorization bill, the FAA would be unable to fund \nmany worthy aviation infrastructure projects. We cannot let that \nhappen. As we prepare to enter into a new fiscal year, the FAA needs \nthis reauthorization in order to move ahead with the funding of many \nimportant airport improvement projects. AIP projects include \nconstruction and maintenance of airport facilities, including runways; \nconstruction of control towers; the installation of radar equipment and \nconstruction of radar facilities; and the acquisition and installation \nof navigational devices.\n  Mr. President, investment in our aviation infrastructure is at a \ncritical point. The FAA's forecasts for the aviation industry project \ntremendous growth by the turn of the century. Those forecasts project \nan average increase of 3.7 percent in domestic passenger traffic by the \nyear 2007. One of the big growth areas will most likely be in the \nregional and commuter industry. In 1995, regional and commuter air \ncarriers carried 53.7 million passengers. By the year 2007, the FAA \nprojects these same carriers to carry 96.9 million passengers--an \nannual growth of 5.4 percent.\n  Today, our airports are at or near capacity. Many are struggling just \nto keep up with today's demands. With these growth projections for the \nnext 10 years, the Nation s entire aviation system will face even more \nchallenges on an already heavily burdened system.\n  The problems posed by the growth of air traffic will be further \nburdened as aircraft manufacturers move toward the development of even \nlarger wide body jets. Recently, both Boeing and Airbus Industries \nannounced plans to introduce new airliners capable of carrying over 600 \npassengers. The introduction of these aircraft will require major \nimprovements at our Nation's airports just to accommodate the size of \nthese aircraft.\n  These are just a few of the many reasons that we need to pass this \nconference report. We cannot let the AIP program lapse. We must \ncontinue to support many worthy airport construction and improvement \nprojects that will help to sustain and support the growing demand for \nair carrier services, both passenger and cargo.\n  During the Senate s consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, I \nargued that we should keep our reauthorization simple and short. That \nis, we should not undertake any change in the formulas for entitlement \nand discretionary grants and that we should have a one year \nreauthorization. Part of the reasoning for this was my belief that we \nneed to examine the best means by which to reform the FAA.\n  The Senate bill included provisions which would establish an \nindependent assessment of the funding needs for the FAA. Under the \nterms of the Senate bill, the independent assessment would study the \nfunding needs of the FAA within one year and report to the Congress. At \nthat time, the Congress would have recommendations and options for the \nlong-term financing solutions of the FAA. Then, with the \nreauthorization of the FAA and the AIP program, we would be able to \ncreate a better funding system for the AIP program.\n  However, given the late date at which we are considering this bill, \nwe recognized that our efforts to try and have an independent \nassessment on the FAA s financing could not be accomplished prior to \nthe expiration of the AIP authorization. We have compromised with the \nHouse, which had a three-year authorization, and have decided that we \nwill have a two year authorization.\n  With a 2-year authorization, we have accepted the provisions of the \nHouse that will modify the funding formulas of the AIP program. Under \nthe provisions of the conference report, this bill will provide more \nentitlement funds for airports throughout the country. Each airport \nunder the AIP program is entitled to Federal funding, based on the \nnumber of passenger emplanements. The bill eliminates a number of \ndiscretionary funds and redistributes those funds to the airports as \nentitlements. In addition, under existing law, there is a $325 million \npure discretionary fund. The FAA has the ability to use those funds to \nput together larger projects for airports of all sizes. This bill will \nreduce that pure discretionary fund to $300 million. I would note that \nI am somewhat concerned that the amount of money set aside for noise \nhas been reduced from $164 million to $134 million. However, I \nrecognize that some of the discretionary monies may be used for that \npurpose.\n  I am pleased that this conference report also includes the FAA \nreforms which were included in the Senate bill.\n  As I mentioned, the increased demands on the air transportation \nsystem require the Congress to re-examine the way in which the FAA is \nmanaged and funded. The FAA is predominantly funded through the airport \nand airway trust fund. The monies which are in the trust fund are \ndistributed among specific programs and functions, including the FAA s \noperations account, the facilities and equipment account, research, the \nengineering and development account, as well as the Airport Improvement \nProgram.\n\n  The trust fund is supported solely through revenue derived by a 10 \npercent passenger ticket tax, interest paid on Treasury certificates, \nand other taxes associated with air travel and aviation. However, on \nJanuary 1, 1996, the aviation excise taxes lapsed. That lapse in taxes \nresulted in a loss of $500 million a month in trust fund revenues. With \nthe enactment of the minimum wage and small business tax credits act, \nthe aviation excise taxes were reinstated, but only to the end of this \ncalendar year.\n  This experience has highlighted some problems and concerns with the \nFAA. Without a steady and reliable source of revenue, the FAA cannot \nfulfill its mission to promote a safe and reliable aviation system.\n  Both the Senate and the House bills had separate panels to examine \nthe issues of safety and security in the National air transportation \nsystem and the financing of the FAA. The conference report adopts both \ntask forces to separately examine these issues.\n  The conference report adopts the Senate provisions which creates an \n11-member panel to conduct an independent assessment of the FAA \nfinancing and cost allocations through 2002. This independent panel \nshall include individuals who have expertise in the aviation industry \nand who are able, collectively, to represent a balanced view of the \nissues which are important to all segments of the aviation industry, \nincluding: general aviation, major air carriers, air cargo carriers, \nregional air carriers, business aviation, airports, aircraft \nmanufacturers, the financial community, aviation industry workers, and \nairline passengers.\n  This independent assessment is required to complete its work within \n12 months. At which time, the panel will make a report to the Secretary \nof Transportation. The Senate bill included some provisions for \nexpedited consideration of these recommendations. However, during the \nSenate's consideration, at the request of the Finance Committee, those \nprovisions for expedited consideration were modified to provide for an \nautomatic sequential referral to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The Senate bill also included similar expedited procedures for the \nHouse. Unfortunately, during our conference, the House conferees \nobjected to the inclusion of any expedited procedure for the House. \nConsequently, the provisions included in the Senate bill for expedited \nprocedures in the House are not included in this conference report.\n  I will admit that I am somewhat reluctant to include provisions in a \nbill that bind only one House of the Congress. The expedited procedures \nthat\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\nwere originally included in S. 1994 as reported by the Commerce \nCommittee were designed to make the Congress act quickly to address the \ncrucial funding needs of the FAA and our aviation infrastructure. \nWithout these expedited procedures, I am concerned that in 2 years \ntime, we may find ourselves in the same position we are in today. \nDuring the conference, our House counterparts gave us their assurance \nthat the House would act expeditiously in considering the funding \nrecommendations of the independent panel.\n\n  I appreciate the commitments from our House colleagues. I can assure \nthe Members of the Senate that when we get to the point that a \ncomprehensive FAA financing reform package is presented to the \nCongress, I will be equally dedicated to the expeditious consideration \nof that proposal.\n  Mr. President, this funding study will build upon personnel and \nprocurement reforms already in place at the FAA, which were included in \nthe Transportation Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996.\n  In addition to the independent study on funding solutions for the \nFAA, the bill also includes provisions for the creation of a Management \nAdvisory Council. Mr. President, I think we all acknowledge that the \nFAA has been an agency with its problems. Some of that criticism is \nwell-deserved. But, I think that most Members will also acknowledge, \nthat under the current leadership of Administrator David Hinson and \nDeputy Administrator Linda Daschle, the FAA is beginning to respond to \nthe challenges. We want to build on these improvements and we want to \nenable the FAA to improve its management so that it is prepared to face \nthe challenges of the 21st Century.\n  The Management Advisory Council [MAC] will be composed of 15 members \nto provide the Administrator with input from the aviation industry and \ncommunity. Membership on the MAC will include representatives from all \ngovernment and all segments of the aviation industry; all of whom will \nbe appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. Members of the MAC should be selected from individuals who are \nexperts in disciplines relevant to the aviation community and who are \ncollectively able to represent a balanced view of the issues before the \nFAA. It is important to note that selection for MAC membership is not \nrequired to be based on political affiliation or other partisan \nconsiderations.\n  Among the issues that we expect that the MAC to examine are: air \ntraffic control modernization; FAA acquisition management; rulemakings \nand cost-benefit analysis; review the process by which the FAA \ndetermines to use advisory circulars and service bulletins; and a \nreview of old rules, including FAR part 145.\n  The conference report also includes the Senate bill's provisions on \nimproving safety and security in our air transportation system.\n  The tragedy of TWA flight 800 has forced us to once again re-examine \nour aviation security measures. As we all know, following the TWA \ntragedy, President Clinton created the White House Commission on \nAviation Safety and Security and asked that Vice President Gore head \nthis commission.\n  The President should be commended for the swiftness of his actions \nand his determination to improve our aviation security and safety. The \nPresident moved quickly to reassure the traveling public and the \nNation, that we continue to have the safest air transportation system \nin the world. I appreciate and applaud the efforts of the President and \nthe Vice President on this issue.\n  The so-called Gore Commission issued an initial report to the \nPresident on September 9. That report made a number of recommendations \nincluding the purchase of explosive detection equipment; the placing of \nsecurity equipment at our major airports; increasing the use of \npassenger profiling through the use of existing data bases and air \ncarrier computer reservation systems; criminal background checks and \nFBI fingerprint checks for all security screeners and other airport and \nairline personnel with access to secure areas; increasing funding to be \nused to facilitate a greater role for the U.S. Customs Service and \nother law enforcement agencies; designate the National Transportation \nSafety Board to deal with the families and relatives of crash victims; \nand provide additional funds for the training of airport security \nscreeners.\n  The conference report adopts a number of the recommendations of the \nGore Commission which required legislative action. I am pleased to say \nthat within our conference, there was unanimous support for the Senate \ns provisions on safety and security.\n  Title III of the conference substitute includes legislative language \nthat will give the FAA the legal authority to undertake and implement \nthe recommendations of the Gore Commission.\n  These provisions include the following:\n  A report by the Administrator of the FAA to the Congress on how to \ntransfer certain security responsibilities of the air carriers to the \nFederal Government. Under current Federal law, air carriers are \nresponsible for the security and screening procedures at airports. The \nGore Commission and other experts believe that aviation security is a \nnational security issue. As the Federal Government will be asked to \nassume more responsibility, we believe it is prudent to have a careful \nstudy of this issue to examine how and to what extent the Federal \nGovernment should assume these duties. This report will be due to the \nCongress within 90 days of enactment of this bill.\n\n  The FAA will certify companies that provide security screening at our \nNation's airports to ensure uniformity and consistency in screening \noperations. The certification process is intended to improve the \ntraining and testing of security screeners through the development of \nuniform performance standards.\n  It will accomplish many things:\n  A study on the detection of weapons and explosives conducted by the \nFAA and the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Require criminal background checks on all individuals who will be \nresponsible for the screening of passengers and property as well as any \nother individual who exercises a security function associated with \nbaggage or cargo. In addition, this bill directs the FAA to conduct \nperiodic audits on the effectiveness of these criminal record checks.\n  Direct the FAA to require the interim deployment of commercially \navailable explosive detection equipment.\n  Direct the FAA to work with the intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunities to assist the air carriers in developing a computer-\nassisted passenger profiling program.\n  Report to the Congress on a pilot baggage match program if such a \nprogram is undertaken as a result of the Gore Commission.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that the Gore \nCommission has not completed its work. In fact, the review of aviation \nsecurity and safety is a dynamic and evolving process. While we have \nattempted to include security provisions within this bill, it is \nanticipated that the Congress will be considering further security \nrecommendations and enhancements as the Gore Commission continues its \nwork.\n  In addition to the provisions included in this bill, the conferees \nadopted a House provision which establishes an aviation safety task \nforce. This task force will be required to submit a report to the FAA \nwhich sets forth a comprehensive analysis of aviation safety. This task \nforce is not intended to duplicate the work of the Gore Commission. \nRather, it is intended and anticipated that the safety study will build \nupon the experience and recommendations of the Gore Commission.\n  As this bill includes provisions relating to improving security \nsystems throughout our air transportation system, it also includes \nprovisions which ensure that the FAA's highest priority is air safety. \nFollowing the ValuJet tragedy, there was intense scrutiny of the FAA's \nmission in promoting air safety. Much of that attention focused on the \nso-called dual mandate of the FAA to promote air commerce and air \nsafety. Both the Senate and House bills included provisions which would \nclarify that the FAA's highest priority is the promotion of a safe \nand secure air transportation system. This provision does not require \nany changes to the management, organization, or functions of the FAA. \nRather, it corrects any public misconceptions that might\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\nexist that the promotion of air commerce by the FAA would create a \nconflict of interest with the FAA's safety mandate.\n\n  In addition, this bill includes provisions to assist the FAA in its \nsafety mission by clarifying the way in which safety and accident \ninformation is classified by the National Transportation Safety Board. \nUnder the provisions of the bill, the NTSB will develop a \nclassification of accident and safety data in a manner that will \nprovide clearer descriptions of accidents with air transportation. In \naddition, the NTSB is directed to widely disseminate this information. \nAs we note in the conference report, one way in which this information \ncould be widely publicized by the NTSB is through the Internet. I hope \nthat once the NTSB develops the new classification system, it will \nconsider placing its reports on the NTSB web page.\n  The conference report also includes provisions which direct the NTSB \nto take the lead in assisting the families of victims of air disasters. \nRecent experiences have demonstrated that it is of tremendous comfort \nfor the families of victims to have someone addressing their concerns \nand needs. While the Senate bill included a provision on family \nassistance, the House bill did not. However, the House did consider and \npass a separate bill, H.R. 3923. The conference report has adopted that \nbill as the basis for the provisions of the conference report. This \nsection not only requires that the NTSB establish a program to provide \nfamily advocacy services, but also directs that all domestic air \ncarriers submit their disaster plans to the NTSB. The NTSB will develop \nguidelines for such plans which are intended to serve as a guide to \nother air carriers.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is an omnibus aviation bill. In \naddition to the FAA reform provisions and reauthorization of the AIP \nprogram, it includes provisions on the sharing of pilot records; \nprovisions on child pilot safety; strong provisions prohibiting airport \nrevenue diversion; provisions relating to the Metropolitan Washington \nAirport Authority; and provisions which support and enhance the \nEssential Air Service Program.\n  There is one provision included in this conference report which \nconcerns me and that relates to the creation of a pilot program for the \nprivatization of airports. When we considered the FAA bill in the \nSenate, I expressed my strong reservations and objections to the \nprivatization of airports. I am a strong opponent to the privatization \nof airports because I believe that it will result in the diversion of \nairport revenue and will harm air carriers and general aviation. In \naddition, many of these airports were built with substantial Federal \nfunds. Despite my strong objections to privatization--and I might add, \nthe strong objections of the Senator from Arizona--the conference \nreport includes a pilot program for privatization. It is important to \nnote that this is a pilot program for 5 airports.\n\n  At the insistence of the Senate, the pilot program includes a number \nof provisions which address the concerns about revenue diversion.\n  The pilot program will only permit long-term leases of commercial \nairports. The Secretary of Transportation must agree to the \nprivatization plan and at least 65 percent of the air carriers must \nagree to the plan. This protects other air carriers at commercial \nairports where a dominant carrier may control 65 percent of the landed \nweight. That means that a dominant carrier cannot control the fate of \nan airport. While the pilot program permits AIP grants, it requires a \n60-percent match of private money. The Secretary of Transportation can \ndisapprove a plan if he finds that privatization would result in \nanticompetitive or unfair and deceptive practices.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that the inclusion of a pilot program \nfor privatization in this conference report does not mean that this \nSenator's opposition to privatization has been lessened. We have made \nan accommodation to our House colleagues who strongly support this \nidea. We have compromised on this issue. That is what a conference \ncommittee is supposed to do--to fashion acceptable compromises so that \nlegislation can be enacted. And in making those compromises, you have \nto give a little. And sometimes you have to accept things with which \nyou may have opposed. Compromise is hard. As Henry Clay used to say, \n``Compromise is mutual sacrifice.'' Well, Mr. President, I may be \nsomewhat bruised and hurt by this compromise, but this bill is too \nimportant to fail because of my opposition to privatization.\n  We have created a 2-year pilot program with many protections. We will \nhave the opportunity to review whether this program truly brings new \ninvestment and capital from the private sector as the supporters of \nprivatization claim. I want to assure my colleagues that I will be \nvigilant in my attention to the developments of this pilot program.\n  Overall, Mr. President, I believe that this conference report is an \nexcellent bill for the FAA and for the entire aviation community. This \nconference report represents the bipartisan efforts on the part of the \nHouse and Senate, between Members and staff. Many long hours were spent \nto create this conference report. That hard work has produced a \nconference report that I am proud to support. I am proud of the work of \nour staff for their dedication to produce this conference report.\n  On a personal note, this is somewhat of a bittersweet moment for me. \nAs many of my colleagues know, a year ago, my longtime aide and \naviation expert, Martha Moloney, passed away after a very courageous \nbattle with breast cancer. Many of the provisions of this bill include \nproposals that Martha and I considered and proposed for many years. I \nknow that many of us miss her and her experience and advice. I am sure \nthat she would be equally proud of the efforts that we have made today.\n\n  And if I may, I would like to dedicate this bill to her memory.\n  Mr. President, this bill truly is a must pass piece of legislation. \nIt is a comprehensive and bipartisan bill that deserves the support of \nthe Senate. In addition, the administration has been intimately \ninvolved in the development of this bill and strongly supports its \nprovisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting adoption of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, I want to add a personal note to the discussion on the \nFAA bill. Yesterday, Senator Stevens expressed his gratitude to David \nHinson for all of his work at the FAA. David has worked hard to bring \nus a new FAA. He has worked hard to correct many of the past mistakes. \nNew equipment is being installed and the system is being modernized. \nWithout his thoughtfulness and devotion to aviation, many of the \nchanges at the FAA would not have occurred.\n  I also want to thank Linda Daschle, the Deputy Administrator. Linda \nhas spent her career in the aviation field, and the FAA has benefited \nfrom her experiences. There were many long nights and heated debates \nover this aviation bill. Throughout those negotiations, Linda kept \npushing all of us forward. I may not have always agreed with her, but \nin the end, her strength and conviction wore us all out. Without her \nefforts, this bill would not be before this body today.\n  The staff of the FAA and DOT also must be thanked for all of their \nefforts. David and Linda are keenly aware of the dedication of the FAA \nstaff. Steve Palmer and the DOT staff watched over us constantly, to \nmake sure that all issues were address appropriately.\n  The Vice President's efforts also cannot go unmentioned. The \nPresident and Vice President are extremely interested in ensuring that \nthe air traffic control system is modernized and that the system is as \nsafe and secure as possible. We have worked with the President's and \nVice President's staff throughout this process, and I appreciate the \naid and advice provided.\n  Finally, I want to thank my House colleagues, who worked with us for \nmany long nights to craft a compromise on critical Aviation issues. Mr. \nShuster, Mr. Duncun, Mr. Oberstar, and Mr. Lipinski, and their staffs, \nare to be congratulated for a good aviation bill. I also want to note \nthat Congressman Oberstar and I have waged a few wars together on the \naviation front over the years. This time, but for one or two \nprovisions, we had another good meeting of the minds.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Members of the Senate for\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\ntaking this extraordinary step to make certain this important \nlegislation passes and goes to the President. As I said many times, \nthis is probably the most important bill to my State that we have \nconsidered in this Congress.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky just stated, I believe that we are \nindebted to the Administrator of the FAA, David Hinson, for constant, \ntireless work on this matter.\n  As a result of what we are doing, I announce to the Senate, in my \noffice right now are the safety people who are going to carry out this \nnew law and try to find a way to reopen the airport at my capital city \nof Juneau. There are many other airports that are going to be open \nbecause of the action we have taken and, above all, Mr. President, I \nthink we can say to the American people that the skies will be safer. \nThere will be competent people in charge of disasters, should they, God \nforbid, occur again, and we will have a way to deal with people who are \nsurvivors of victims of air crashes in the manner that the coalition of \nsurvivors has recommended to the Congress.\n  This is responsive legislation, and it is responsible legislation. I \nam grateful to the two managers of the bill, my good friend from \nArizona, Senator McCain and Senator Ford and, of course, to the \nchairman, Senator Pressler, and the ranking member, Senator Hollings, \nfor their constant commitment to see to it that this Congress passes \nthis landmark legislation for aviation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 3539, the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe three votes which we have had today, and to express my very deep \nconcern about the precedents which the Senate has established in \nattaching to a conference report a highly controversial provision which \nwas not subjected to hearings, or analysis, or the legislative process, \nand which was rammed through here today without real due process or a \nreal legislative process.\n  What has happened here--this is somewhat esoteric for someone who may \nbe watching on C-SPAN II--is that the Federal Aviation Administration \nbill was passed by the House and Senate, and then it went to \nconference. In the conference there was an addition of a provision to \ndetermine which Federal labor agency would have jurisdiction over \nexpress companies. That provision was added into the conference report \nwithout having been considered by either the House or the Senate. It \nwas not considered in hearings, it was not considered in debate, and it \nwas not voted on, but it was in effect rammed through, and has become \nlaw because it was attached to a bill which has some $8 billion of \nFederal airport expenditures--a matter of enormous importance for \nAmerica generally, and a matter of enormous importance for my home \nState, Pennsylvania--which has so many airports involved with this \nnecessary funding that comes out of the aviation trust fund.\n  It does not add to the deficit. It does not come out of general \nrevenues. It is paid for out of an airport trust fund. But what we have \ndone today, I would suggest, is a very, very serious perversion of \nSenate procedures. What can happen in the future is that under the \noverruling of the ruling of the Chair, any measure can be added in any \nconference report at any time, and if the conference report overall \ntouches a subject of sufficient importance it will outweigh a provision \nwhich has been added without appropriate consideration.\n  I voted against cloture--that is, I voted against cutting off debate \non the underlying bill--because it seemed to me that provision required \nanalysis, consideration, and debate. It affects thousands of jobs in \nPennsylvania because it could determine which agency will govern the \nissue of labor matters and labor certification, and which \nrepresentation will be in effect.\n  It was represented that it was a mistake that it was left out before. \nI am skeptical about that, Mr. President because we have that \nrepresentation made all the time. It was represented that it would only \napply to one company. Well, that may be one company too many, if it is \na bad provision not subjected to analysis, debate, nor hearings in our \nregular legislative process. But on the face of that provision, it is \nentirely likely and highly probable that the provision will apply to \nmany companies. And, therefore, I voted against cutting off debate.\n  Then on the issue of overruling the Chair, the Chair ruled that this \nprovision should not have been in the bill under Senate rules. The \nSenate overruled the Chair by a vote of 56 to 39. There is talk that we \ncan change the rule. But any time we have set a precedent in this body \non allowing an extraneous measure to come in on a conference report, \nthat is a precedent of overwhelming importance. Any time 51 Members \nthink that the matter is so important that it ought to be passed to \ndisregard the rules and the procedure, there is a precedent which has \nbeen established.\n  It is very important to proceed in a principled way, and we have not \ndone that here.\n  I feel so strongly about that, Mr. President, that I voted against \nthe\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\noverall bill. Only two Senators voted against the measure on final \npassage--Senator Simon and Arlen Specter. If we do not follow the rules \nand don't proceed in a principled way, we are doing serious damage to \nthe institutions and procedures which are set up not for one special \ncase but to govern our conduct generally.\n  I think it is especially important because this breach of our rules \ncomes within 3 days of our passage of the omnibus appropriations bill \nwhere again we breached the rules. The Constitution calls for a \nseparation of powers. It calls for the Congress to legislate on \nappropriations, and submit appropriations bills to the President for \nhis consideration. If he signs it, it is law. If he vetoes it, the \nCongress can override the veto by a two-thirds vote. But that wasn't \ndone on the omnibus appropriations bill.\n\n  The President's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, sat in on the \ndeliberations and negotiations with the Congress, which is a serious \nconstitutional breach. The President had delegated to the Chief of \nStaff authority to act for the President. What Chief of Staff Panetta \nsaid became the President's conclusion, but the President does not have \nthe authority to delegate his responsibility under the United States \nConstitution.\n  In the end, that was an important bill. It had provisions for funding \nfor education, which I supported; provisions for funding for Health and \nHuman Services, which I supported; provisions for funding workplace \nsafety, which I supported--all of which come under the jurisdiction of \nthe subcommittee which I chair, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and \nHuman Services.\n  I think, Mr. President, as we rush to leave Washington that we are \nsetting some very bad precedents and creating some very bad rules. I \nwas one of, I think, 14 Senators to vote against the omnibus \nappropriations bill because I thought we were doing violence to the \nU.S. Constitution. We did that because we couldn't move through the \nlegislative process in due course. Extraneous amounts were added, \nsomething I spoke to at length last Saturday and on Monday. So I shall \nnot repeat it here. There are other colleagues waiting to speak. But \nthese rules are established.\n  I believe that the most precious gift America has is the U.S. \nConstitution. That sets the framework for our Government. Then we \nestablish rules for our courts--our civil courts and our criminal \ncourts. And we establish rules for the Congress. They are established \nin order to give due process. They are established in order to have a \nmeasure introduced, analyzed, and subjected to hearings where people \ncan come in on both sides, testify. Then we can make an informed \njudgment. But when that is not done and when we violate those rules, we \nput our entire system at jeopardy. And that is wrong.\n  That is why I was one of the few Senators voting against the omnibus \nappropriations bill, and one of only two Senators voting against this \nFederal Aviation Administration bill, recognizing the importance to my \nhome State of Pennsylvania and to the entire country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12239-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate now has a few other items that must be considered prior to the \nadjournment sine die.

I \nunderstand that there is no Senator that now has requested a vote on \neither of those, either the Presidio parks bill or the adjournment \nresolution.\n  With that in mind, there will be no further votes for the remainder \nof the 104th Congress. We hear some celebration on that.\n  I want to thank Senators who have been involved in that parks \nlegislation, and the Senator from Alaska, particularly. He is very \nanxious to get that completed. He has worked hard at it. It has not \nbeen easy for him. He has made major concessions. But we were able to \nreach an agreement this morning that he can accept and the \nadministration can accept, and that all Senators are comfortable with.\n  I thank the distinguished assistant majority leader, Don Nickles, for \nhis effort and time in this.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, this coming Sunday, the eyes of 75 to 80 \nmillion Americans will be squarely focused on the city of Hartford and \nthe State of Connecticut as they host the first Presidential debate of \nthe 1996 campaign between President Clinton and Senator Dole.\n  For Hartford and the people of my home State of Connecticut the \nunique opportunity to host this debate is both a great honor and a \nsignificant economic and cultural shot in the arm. I salute all those \nin the Hartford community who have played integral roles in bringing \nthe Presidential candidates to our capital city.\n  In particular, I want to commend the Bank of Boston, Phoenix Home \nLife Mutual Insurance, Trinity College, and Southern New England \nTelephone played critical roles as the four founding sponsors of the \ndebate.\n  In addition, Daniel Papermaster, who has labored tirelessly to bring \na Presidential debate to Hartford, deserves\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n\nspecial praise. Without his persistent efforts, this debate would never \nhave become a reality.\n  For Hartford, the Presidential debate provides a remarkable \nopportunity to give the city a much needed boost of civic and community \npride.\n  Certainly, no one would disagree that our city has seen rough times \nof late. And, the debate's impact on our community will be sizable.\n  It's estimated that the event may pump as much as 4 to 5 million \ndollars into the local economy.\n  What's more, 2,500 journalists from around the world will be \ndescending on Hartford and will, in many cases, have their first \nopportunity to see the sights, meet the people, and experience the \nhospitality of our Connecticut and Hartford.\n  Most of all though, the coming Presidential debate is sparking a \nrenewed sense of community spirit that will live on long after our \nvisitors have said goodbye Sunday night or Monday morning when they \nleave the State.\n  But, as proud a moment as this is for the people of Connecticut it is \nalso a critically important one for our Nation's future and our \npolitical process.\n  In our political process, there are few events as singular and unique \nas Presidential, and Vice-Presidential, debates.\n  Since these are the only two elected offices on which all 265 million \nAmericans cast their ballot, Presidential and Vice-Presidential debates \nprovide the American people a platform and context for choosing not \njust a political leader, but a governing philosophy for America's \nfuture.\n  Now, as every Member of this body knows, our Nation has a long and \nproud history of political debate.\n  More than 200 years ago, our founding fathers gathered in \nPhiladelphia to debate, discuss and finally establish what they \nbelieved to be a ``more perfect union.'' Some 80 years later our \nNation's greatest leaders gathered for some of the most storied and \nsignificant oration in American history.\n  From the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 to the famous Breckinridge/\nBaker Senate debate of 1861, which one commentator called ``perhaps the \nmost dramatic scene that ever took place in the Senate Chamber'' \nAmerican leaders intensely pondered the issue of slavery and the future \nof a divided nation.\n  In 1960, this proud legacy entered the TV age with the Nixon/Kennedy \ndebates which set the stage for one of the most closely contested \nelections in our Nation's history and for the past 20 years, \nPresidential debates have become an autumnal tradition--an opportunity \nfor voters to not only listen to the views of the Presidential \ncandidates, but to come together as a nation and as a people, \nparticipating in America's vibrant political discourse.\n  Debates are so enshrined in our political process that for a \nsignificant portion of the American electorate they are the most \nimportant source of information for making their decisions on election \nday.\n  The events of this Sunday will be no different. If anything, they may \nbe even more significant.\n  President Clinton and Senator Dole meet in Hartford against the \nbackdrop of great technological and social change in our Nation. What's \nmore, both men come to this debate with very different proposals and \ndivergent beliefs for the future.\n  On Sunday night, when the American people gather around their \ntelevisions, they will witness not simply a competition of candidates, \nbut a contest of ideas.\n  That contest of ideas will be waged by two men who may be among the \nmost skilled debaters in American politics.\n  I have heard a great deal of talk in the past few weeks about our \nformer colleague's supposed lack of rhetorical skill. Even the \ncandidate himself has intimated that he lacks the oratorical ability to \nbe on the same stage with President Clinton and that by just showing up \nin Hartford he would in fact be the victor.\n  Mr. President, I served in this Chamber for 16 years with Bob Dole. I \nhave great admiration for him as a person and as a public official, and \nI have even higher admiration for his debating skills. Republicans are \ncertainly not talking about someone I am familiar with when they \nsuggest that Bob Dole lacks the ability to debate an opponent. In my \ntime here as a Member of this body, I have never ceased to be impressed \nby Bob Dole's debating skills. He is a smart and experienced debater, \nwho understands public policy issues as well, as any Member that I have \nencountered in public life. What is more, he has been a candidate for \nnational office four times, once for the Vice Presidency and three \ntimes for President. He weathered a difficult and trying debate season \nin the Republican primaries. All told, he has held 13 debates with \nother candidates for national office.\n  I should also point out he was the chairman of the Republican \nNational Committee back in 1972. Having held a similar position in my \nown party these past 2 years, I know how difficult that job can be, \nbecause of the numerous times that you must debate your opponents. In \nfact, one might wonder if it is Bob Dole and not Bill Clinton who has \nthe advantage coming into Sunday's debate given the tremendous \nexperience that our former colleague, who served in Congress for 35 \nyears and for many years as minority and majority leader, has in \nrhetorical skills.\n  If anything, the American people should be extremely grateful to \nwitness a debate between two candidates with such evenly matched \ndebating skills and a similar understanding of the issues.\n  Not for a second do I doubt Senator Dole's ability to debate on a \nlevel playing field with President Clinton. If anything, I think his \ntroubles will come more from trying to defend his economic policies and \nhis votes against the Brady bill, family leave, and in support of \ncutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. But that is \nanother story. Certainly all of us look forward to the world tuning \ninto Hartford, CT, on Sunday night to witness the first Presidential \ndebate of the season, and we wish both of our candidates well in that \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12240-7", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12241-S12242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we approach the end of this Congress, I \nwanted to take a moment to say a few words about one colleague in \nparticular, and I will add to these comments later and say a few words \nabout a number of our other retiring colleagues. I will lead off my \ntribute to those who retire saying a few words about one of the U.S. \nSenate's finest members, and that is the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Pell.\n  I have had the honor of serving with Senator Pell on the Foreign \nRelations Committee more than 12 years that I have been here, and I \nhave been impressed by his extraordinary breadth of knowledge about \ninternational affairs, but more than that by the special demeanor of \nthis colleague of ours. He is a man who is deeply committed to the \ndevelopment of a bipartisan foreign policy, one which promotes not only \nAmerica's needs and interests but also Democratic values and \nhumanitarian traditions. He has been both chairman and ranking minority \nmember, and Senator Pell has always been courteous, solicitous of views \nof other members, determined to work toward a policy that we all could \nsupport even when the differences were extremely deep. He never \nabandoned his gentlemanly manner and often he succeeded in following \nthe dictum that he used to give his staff throughout the years, which \nwas, ``The best way is to let the other fellow have your way.''\n  Senator Pell's accomplishments in the areas of foreign policy are \nmany and far-reaching. I will highlight just a couple of them. He was \npresent at the creation of the United Nations, having served on the \nInternational Secretariat at the San Francisco conference which drew up \nthe U.N. Charter. His commitment to the United Nations was really \nsymbolized by the fact that he always carried the U.N. Charter in his \npocket, though he really did not need to because he could tell anybody \nwhat it said.\n  Senator Pell's belief in the United Nations reflects his long-held \nbelief, part of which came from his exposure in the Foreign Service, \nboth through his father as well as his own service in the Foreign \nService, that problems\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\nought to be resolved through diplomacy and negotiation rather than \nthrough the barrel of a gun.\n  When I came before the Foreign Relations Committee 25 years ago this \nyear to testify against our involvement in Vietnam, he gave me much \nwelcomed support at that time and even then invited me to join him in \nthe Senate. It was my first invitation and probably the best I ever \nreceived. I will always appreciate the fact that he was on the dais \nthat day and that he understood and shared our views about the war.\n  In view of Senator Pell's steadfast opposition to armed conflict as a \nmeans of achieving our national interests, it is not surprising that he \nhas always been one the Senate's foremost arms control advocates. He \nhas been instrumental in negotiating several arms control agreements, \nincluding the Environmental Modification Treaty and the Seabed Arms \nControl Treaty. He was at the forefront of the effort to create the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency, and in 1994 he authored \nlegislation to strengthen and revitalize that agency to meet the \ngrowing challenges in arms control and nonproliferation. He led the \nfight in the Senate's passage of treaties such as the Intermediate \nRange Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, the \nPeaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, and START I and II. He shepherded \nthese treaties successfully through the Senate and today the United \nStates is party to all of them.\n  Senator Pell's achievements in the realm of foreign affairs are \nparalleled by numerous accomplishments in the domestic area. He left \nhis mark on the arts, particularly through his sponsorship of \nlegislation to establish the National Endowment for the Arts and the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, on the area of high-speed \ntransportation and on the environment. Besides his many years of work \non the law of the sea, he was also the Senate author of the National \nSeagrant College and Land Act, legislation which brought much needed \nmoney not only to the University of Rhode Island but also to \nuniversities in other coastal States such as my own. He was the driving \nforce behind the Federal legislation to help crack down on drunk \ndriving.\n  Thanks to Claiborne Pell, thousands of young Americans today go to \ncollege on Pell grants. His love of education and of those seeking to \nbe educated are epitomized by the annual picnic that he holds at his \nhome for all the students from Rhode Island who are here at college, \nand come rain or shine or votes on the Senate floor, Senator Pell and \nhis wife, Nuala, are always there to greet the students and show them a \nlittle bit of the friendly hometown side of Washington. Senator Pell \nhas always had his personal and committee staffs present so that \nstudents could learn from them.\n  Throughout his years in the Senate, Mr. President, Claiborne Pell has \nserved the people of Rhode Island ably and diligently, and I think all \nof our colleagues have been deeply impressed by the personal affection \nthat so many Rhode Islanders have shown to Senator Pell. That is not \nonly reciprocation for the affection he has clearly shown for them but \nit reflects his longstanding tradition of never closing his door to any \nRhode Islander who wished to meet with him.\n  Senator Pell has now decided that the time has come to leave the \nSenate and undertake new challenges. I for one will miss him, as I know \nmany of my colleagues will. He brought great grace and charm to \nwhatever he did here, and I know that everyone believes we have lost a \ntrue gentleman whose accomplishments are in the highest tradition of \nthe Senate.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12241-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12242-S12243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE OF SENATOR MARK O. HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have decided to wait until the end of the \nsession to take a few moments to talk about the extraordinary service \nof our senior Senator, Mark O. Hatfield, because in a very real sense, \nit is almost impossible for citizens in our State to imagine that Mark \nO. Hatfield is not involved in a public way in service to our State.\n  His career has been truly extraordinary. I was 2 years old when \nSenator Hatfield began his remarkable service to the people of our \nState. At that time he was a State legislator. He moved quickly through \nleadership positions in our State--State senator, secretary of state, \nGovernor--and his career has been marked by several qualities that I \nthink have been so important in public service and that he will always \nbe remembered for, not just by the people of our State but by the \npeople of our country.\n  When Senator Hatfield ran in his first campaign for the Senate, it \nwas after there had been a great debate among the citizens of our \ncountry and the Governors. Senator Hatfield was the lone voice of \ndissent in his party with respect to the Vietnam war. When he ran for \nthe Senate, billboards were put up at that time with just one word, and \nthat word was ``courage.'' If there has been anything which has marked \nSenator Hatfield's service to the public, it has been courage; not just \non issues with respect to peace, but, again and again, Senator Hatfield \nwas the one who would tell both political parties, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, ``You are not going at it the right way. There is a better \napproach.'' That is true, whether it was national service or the motor \nvoter program--just a couple of examples of recent vintage where he has \nbucked the tide in his party--or numerous other instances. It is always \npossible to see that courage in Mark O. Hatfield. We know that courage \nis always a trait that will be important to the people of our country \nand to the people of Oregon.\n  In addition to those special votes and public acts that showed great \ncourage, Senator Hatfield is also known for his effort to bring \ncivility to politics. Maybe we call it the second ``C'' in terms of \nwhat is important for politics in the next century. Courage is \nimportant, but so is civility.\n  In our State as well as in the Halls of Congress, it is well \nunderstood that when there is a serious problem and tempers are short, \nSenator Hatfield has been the one who has been able to bring parties \ntogether, been able to find common ground and find a solution simply \nbecause he refused to lose his temper, refused to yield to the \npressures of the moment. I hope others will try to emulate those \nspecial qualities of civility that Senator Hatfield has brought to his \nservice.\n  There are several substantive areas that I would like to mention \nbecause they are important to the people of the Northwest, but I think \nthey are important to our country as well. The first is that, as we \nseek to balance the budget--and we all understand that, as citizens at \nhome have to balance their budgets, they have made it crystal clear \nthey want the Federal Government to balance its budget--we still have \nto figure out a way to make a handful of key investments in our future \nwhile we still move to balance the budget. That is what Senator \nHatfield's service on the Senate Appropriations Committee has been all \nabout. It is to try to figure out ways to keep the deficit down, to get \nus to a balanced budget, while at the same time making that small \nnumber of key investments in transportation, in education, in \ncommunications that really will pay great dividends for our country. \nThe spirit of the West and the history of the West has been that \nprivate investment has always followed those well-targeted public \ninvestments, and that is what Senator Hatfield has tried to do in his \nservice on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Let me also add that he has brought an approach in that service to \ntry to reward imagination and creativity in government. We are \nespecially proud of the pioneering work that we have done in our work \non the environment and with our Oregon health plan. This session, \nSenator Hatfield led the effort to get our innovative welfare reform \nproposal approved. I think it is important to stress that, in his \nservice on the Appropriations Committee, what he has always tried to \nhighlight is the importance of rewarding States, private citizens, and \ncommunities that are willing, as has been the Oregon tradition, to get \nout in front, to take a bold approach, to try to break out of the old \nways of doing business. I think it is especially important that this \nSenate follow that approach in the days ahead.\n\n  Let me say in concluding, in his departure from the U.S. Senate, Mark \nO.\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nHatfield leaves a lasting and inspirational model for all citizens, \nregardless of party, who aspire to public service. I am going to miss \nhis advice and counsel. His service is going to be greatly missed by \nthe people of Oregon and by the country.\n  We wish him and his wife Antoinette the best for the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Missouri, observes the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12242-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12243-S12244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE RETIREMENT OF MANY GOOD FRIENDS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate to make some \ncomments on a sad occasion, as I witness the retirement of many good \nfriends.\n  For instance, Senator Mark Hatfield came to the Senate just 2 years \nprior to my arrival. We served in World War II during the same period, \n1943-1946.\n  As a matter of fact, at one time we compared notes and we decided \njointly he was probably the commander of a Navy vessel that was in \nTsingtao Bay, China, when I flew into Tsingtao at the end of the war.\n  After the war, Mark became a college professor who displayed a great \ndeal of independence. I have a photograph that I gave him a copy of the \nother day which was of Mark Hatfield, when he was Governor of Oregon, \nJohn Tower, when he was just a new Senator from Texas, and I when I was \na candidate for the Senate. It was when we met up at a conference \nformer President Eisenhower held in Gettysburg. We have shared a great \nmany concerns as Senators from Western States, and Senator Hatfield has \nbeen very helpful to me over the years I have served as one of Alaska's \nfirst Senators.\n  I was actually the third Senator to represent my State and as a \nWestern Senator and former Governor, he has been very helpful to me \nthroughout the time we have served together. We went to the \nAppropriations Committee on the same day, and I have served with him as \nhe has been chairman of that committee during the eighties and, again, \nduring this Congress.\n  It has been a great privilege to serve with him. I have had the role \non the defense side of the Appropriations Committee, and he has been \nvery kind to me in allocating the funds necessary to fulfill that \nresponsibility.\n  He was the author of a compromise in 1980 of great importance to my \nState on the issue of subsistence for rural people in Alaska. It has \nbeen a very controversial compromise, but without that compromise, the \nbill that allowed Alaska and Alaska Natives to go forward with the \nselection of their lands would not have passed. It was a difficult \nsituation through the 7 years of debate on what we call the D-2 \nlegislation, and Senator Hatfield was on the Interior and Insular \nAffairs Committee at that time and served as an Alaska surrogate, \nreally, in many ways.\n  I have cherished my relationship with Senator Hatfield and his wife, \nAntoinette. We have really shared many private occasions together and \nvisited each other's homes. It is the kind of friendship that is hard \nto witness coming to an end.\n  Now it is my hope that I will become chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee next year. He has left a great mark on the Senate in his \nterms as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and also when he was \nthe ranking member.\n  I know that the Senate joins this Senator in wishing Mark and \nAntoinette Hatfield farewell as they return to their native State, and \nwe hope they have many fine years there.\n  I am certain Mark Hatfield is not going to retire. We will hear from \nhim again and again as he pursues his former career as a professor and \nis involved in educating the people of his State, particularly in \nsharing with them the knowledge he has gained in the Senate.\n  Another Senator I find it hard to say goodbye to is Senator Sam Nunn. \nSam came to the Senate in 1972. He had been a member of the U.S. Coast \nGuard prior to becoming a Senator. He has had a consistent commitment \nto our military forces and to a strong national defense. We have \ntraveled together on many occasions throughout the world attending NATO \nmeetings and, in particular, I remember the trips that we took into the \nPersian Gulf during the Persian Gulf war.\n  Actually, we have not talked too much about it, but Senator Nunn, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Warner and myself were in the Israeli defense \nministry one night when it was subject to attack by Scud missiles from \nIraq. It was a very memorable occasion.\n  The next morning, we went out to look and see what happened to that \nScud, and it had fallen short of coming into the center of Tel Aviv. We \nwere fortunate. Those who lived in the homes where it fell were not \nthat fortunate. But we both remembered the Patriot missile system and \nits deployment to Israel. Had it not been there, I am confident Senator \nNunn and I would have departed the Senate much earlier.\n  I also thank he and Senator Hatfield for the many wonderful mornings \nwe have had together at the Senate prayer breakfast. And like my \nfriendship with Senator Hatfield, my wife, and I have had a wonderful \nrelationship with Colleen Nunn and Sam, and have also joined them at \ntheir home for private occasions. It has been the kind of relationship, \nas I said, that is very difficult to see come to an end. I spoke to \nSenator Nunn as he was leaving here, and I know we will see him again \nand again.\n\n  Senator Kassebaum has decided to retire. She brought to the Senate a \nlegacy established by her father who had been a candidate for President \nin the thirties.\n  After coming to the Senate, Senator Kassebaum became the first woman \nSenator to chair a major Senate committee. Senator Margaret Chase Smith \nchaired a special committee back in the fifties, but Nancy Kassebaum \nwas the first to chair a permanent committee, and demonstrated to the \nSenate the real skill and capabilities of a woman Senator as she \nchaired her committee and used her soft-spoken approach. I find that \nher approach works very well, particularly since we know her as a very \ntough, resilient negotiator. Whether she is an opponent or ally, \ndepending upon the issue at hand, she is well known for her skills as a \nmediator, and we all admire her very much.\n  As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, she brought \nto us on a bipartisan basis the best possible health care insurance \nlegislation we could have, and she was very effective as part of the \nRepublican health care task force as we studied for over 3 years the \nproblem of our health care and health insurance systems.\n  I know her deep interest in education legislation, and she has \nrepeatedly helped us in Alaska with the various problems we face \nbecause of the rural nature of our State and the real demands on our \nState and local governments for job training programs.\n  I recall very pleasantly Nancy Kassebaum's trip to Alaska, and we \nhope that she will return and visit us again and again.\n  Her deep interest in aviation product liability legislation brought \nus changes in that area of the law so that we hope we will, once again, \nstart having small planes constructed in the United States of the type \nthat we very much need in Alaska.\n  I know that she has indicated she is leaving to spend more time with \nher five grandchildren. I have to tell the Senate, I think we will see \nher most in airports, because one of her grandchildren lives in South \nCarolina, three live in Connecticut and one lives in Kansas. Our great \nlady Senator has a good reason in her grandchildren to travel the \ncountry, Mr. President.\n  She has been a good friend, and Catherine and I are sad to see her \nleave, also.\n  Senator Exon came in 1978, a year that I also was candidate for \nreelection, and in that year we also had the disastrous air crash that \nthe Senate knows of in which I lost my first wife.\n\n  It was following that time that Senator Exon, having served in the \nArmy in World War II and in the Army Reserve for many years, became one \nof\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nmy traveling companions, in the early 1980's, as I was chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, and we went to many different \nmeetings that related to the defense of our country and with the \ndefense establishments of other nations.\n  I have to say, however, Senator Exon's fame in my State was \novershadowed by his wife, Pat, who is a much better fisherman, I mean \nfisherwoman; in my State we say ``fisherperson'' now. When they came to \nAlaska we enjoyed having them with us. I note, now that he is leaving \nthe Senate, he may be able to come up and meet the challenge and be \nable to leave a little bit better record and surpass the records \nestablished by his wife when she was fishing with us in Alaska.\n  In terms of a Senator whom I have known for many years, Senator Alan \nSimpson--I actually met him before he came to the Senate, as the son of \nthe late Senator Milward Simpson. He was very active in Wyoming \naffairs, and prior to being here in the Senate, I remember meeting him \nat a Republican event in Wyoming. I have gotten to know him very well \nsince he has been in the Senate.\n  Senator Alan Simpson has served the Senate as the Republican whip \nlonger than any Senator in our history. He served 10 years. As a \nwesterner with particular understanding of the problems that are \nexperienced by those of us who come from the West, he represented us \nvery well with his knowledge of small population, public land States. \nWith his very quick wit and his pithy observations of the circumstances \nthat we face, he has always been able to find a solution that was \nacceptable to the Senate on issues that affected our Western States. He \nhas generated a bipartisan solution in many instances when many of us \nthought there was no way out. It has taken real courage on his part in \nmany instances to find that bipartisan solution.\n  The Senate has witnessed that just recently in the immigration issue. \nKnowing his departure was coming upon us, many of us have worked with \nhim long and hard to try to help him achieve his goal of the passage of \nsound legislation in the immigration field.\n  We wish him and Ann, his lovely wife, the very best as they now \nreturn to Wyoming and to other endeavors. Alan Simpson is also a person \nwe are going to hear more about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that the \nSenator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I continue \nuntil someone comes. There is another Senator here. I will continue my \ncomments later. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12243-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12244-S12252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SENATOR BRADLEY'S SPEECHES\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the Senate floor is a place where \nspeeches are made, sometimes longer than they should be, sometimes \nshorter than they should be. I have made my share of speeches on the \nSenate floor in the last 18 years. But a Senator is also called upon to \nspeak off the Senate floor in gatherings in his or her State and in \nsites across the country.\n  I have often thought of the Senate speech as a form of communication, \nas a way of educating, as a way of leading. I have tried to do that on \nthe Senate floor. In the last 2 years, we have had a number of \nrestrictions that have made this kind of speech that I would give, \nwhich would be a very lengthy speech, more difficult in morning \nbusiness as we have 10-minute time limits. For that reason, in the last \n2 years I have given a number of speeches that have not been reflected \nin the Record but have been given at other forums across the country.\n\n  I believe that these were speeches that I worked on as a Senator. \nThese were speeches that I thought about as a Senator and delivered as \na Senator. Therefore, I believe that it is important that I share them \nwith the Senate and for the Record. I see the Chair twitching a little \nbit. He need not worry that I am going to deliver all these speeches at \nthis moment.\n  I would like to submit for the Record a speech called ``America's \nChallenge: Revitalizing Our National Community,'' ``After the \nRevolution: Rethinking U.S.-Russia Relations,'' ``Race Relations in \nAmerica: The Best and Worst of Times,'' ``Harry Truman: Public Power \nand the New Economy,'' and the speech to the National Association of \nRadio Talk Show Hosts on the occasion of the Freedom of Speech Awards \nGala Dinner. I ask unanimous consent that all of these speeches be \nprinted in the Record and that they be my last official act as a U.S. \nSenator on the floor of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        America's Challenge: Revitalizing Our National Community\n\n                       (By Senator Bill Bradley)\n\n       Two nights ago I attended a dinner in St. Louis, Missouri \n     to honor former U.S. Senator Jack Danforth. Fifteen Senators \n     from both parties attended along with several thousand \n     Missourians. Nearly a million dollars was raised for an \n     organization called Interact, to which Jack Danforth will \n     dedicate much of his post-Senate energies. The organization's \n     charter is to coordinate efforts by the religious community \n     in St. Louis to support programs which will improve the life \n     chances of inner-city, predominately African children.\n       When I left Missouri for college back in 1961 the number of \n     children in St. Louis born to a single parent was 13%; now it \n     is 68%. Among black children it is 86%. Senator Pat Moynihan \n     points out that this social crisis is taking place across the \n     North Atlantic world (English out-of-wedlock births are 31%, \n     and in France, 33%) and Jack Danforth has waded into this \n     crisis in hope of developing a strategy that can turn these \n     tragic numbers around.\n       I begin with this story because Jack has chosen to leave \n     government to tackle one of the nation's most intractable \n     problems and he has chosen to do it through institutions of \n     religious faith. His efforts may offer us a fresh perspective \n     on our commitment to address not only single parenthood in \n     poor neighborhoods, but what is happening to our sense of \n     family and community in suburbs, cities and small towns \n     across America.\n       Never in American history has a new vision begun in \n     Washington. Never has it been the sole property of either \n     political party. In fact, to initiate a frank discussion of \n     our current American condition requires us to throw off many \n     of the barnacle-encrusted categories with which we are \n     accustomed to talking about this nation's problems. This \n     could seriously disrupt the respective moral allegiances and \n     political turfs of both the Democrats and Republican parties. \n     I would like to start making that disruption happen, for out \n     of such ferment might emerge the fresh ideas of a better \n     American future.\n       Our contemporary political debate has settled into two \n     painfully familiar ruts. Republicans, as we know, are \n     infatuated with the magic of the ``private sector'', and \n     reflexively criticize government as the enemy of freedom. \n     Human needs and the common good are best served through the \n     marketplace, goes their mantra.\n       At the other extreme, Democrats tend to distrust the \n     market, seeing it as synonymous with greed and exploitation, \n     the domain of Jay Gould and Michael Milkens. Ever confident \n     in the powers of government to solve problems, Democrats \n     instinctively turn to the bureaucratic state to regulate the \n     economy and to solve social problems. Democrats generally \n     prefer the bureaucrat they know to the consumer they can't \n     control. Of course, both parties are somewhat disingenuous. \n     Neither is above making self-serving exceptions. For example, \n     Republicans say they are for the market, but they support \n     market-distorting tax loopholes and wasteful subsidies for \n     special interests as diverse as water, wheat, and wine. Then \n     there are the Democrats who say that they want an activist \n     government but won't raise the taxes to fund it or describe \n     clearly its limits or its necessity. Still, these twin poles \n     of political debate--crudely put, government action versus \n     the free market--utterly dominate our sense of the possible, \n     our sense of what is relevant and meaningful in public \n     affairs. Yet, the issues that most concern Americans today \n     seem to have little direct connection with either the market \n     or government. Consider the plague of violence, guns, and \n     drugs; the racial tensions that afflict so many communities; \n     the turmoil in public education; the deterioration of \n     America's families.\n       Today I will suggest that any prescription for America must \n     understand the advantages and limits of both the market and \n     government, but more importantly, how neither is equipped to \n     solve America's central problems; the deterioration of our \n     civil society and the need to revitalize our democratic \n     process.\n       Civil society is the place where Americans make their home, \n     sustain their marriages, raise their families, hand out with \n     their friends, meet their neighbors, educate their children, \n     worship their god. It is the churches, schools, fraternities, \n     community centers, labor unions, synagogues, sports leagues, \n     PTAs, libraries and barber shops. It is where opinions are \n     expressed and refined, where views are exchanged and \n     agreements made, where a sense of common purpose and \n     consensus are forged. It lies apart from the realms of the \n     market and the government, and possesses a different ethic. \n     The market is governed by the logic of economic self-\n     interest, while government is the domain of laws with all \n     their coercive authority. Civil\n\n[[Page S12245]]\n\n     society, on the other hand, is the sphere of our most basic \n     humanity--the personal, everyday realm that is governed by \n     values such as responsibility, trust, fraternity, solidarity \n     and love. In a democratic civil society such as ours we also \n     put a special premium on social equality--the conviction that \n     men and women should be measured by the quality of their \n     character and not the color of their skin, the shape of their \n     eyes, the size of their bank account, the religion of their \n     family, or the happenstance of their gender.\n       What both Democrats and Republicans fail to see is that the \n     government and the market are not enough to make a \n     civilization. There must also be healthy, robust civic \n     sector--a space in which the bonds of community can flourish. \n     Government and the market are similar to two legs on a three-\n     legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society, the \n     stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital \n     America.\n       Today the fragile ecology of our social environment is as \n     threatened as that of our natural environment. Like fish \n     floating on the surface of a polluted river, the network of \n     voluntary associations in America seem to be dying. For \n     example, PTA participation has fallen. So have Boy Scout and \n     Red Cross volunteers. So have labor unions and civic clubs \n     such as the Lions and Elks. In the recent ``Mood of America'' \n     poll taken by the Gannett News Service, 76 percent of those \n     surveyed agreed that ``there is less concern for others \n     than there once was.'' All across America, people are \n     choosing not to join with each other in communal \n     activities. One recent college graduate even volunteered \n     sadly that her suburban Philadelphia neighbors ``don't \n     even wave.''\n       Every day the news brings another account of Americans \n     being disconnected from each other. Sometimes the stories \n     seem comical, such as that of the married couple in \n     Rochester, New York who unexpectedly ran into one another on \n     the same airplane as they departed for separate business \n     trips and discovered that each had, unbeknownst to the other, \n     hired a different babysitter to care for their young \n     daughter. Often the stories are less amusing, such as that of \n     the suburban Chicago couple who, unbeknownst to their \n     indifferent neighbors, left their two little girls home alone \n     while they vacationed in Mexico. Or the story in New York \n     City of the murder of a young woman in a running suit whose \n     body went unidentified, unclaimed, and apparently unwanted \n     for a week before she was identified by her fingerprints as a \n     New Jersey woman wholly estranged from her family.\n       It is tempting to dismiss these stories as isolated cases. \n     But I think they have a grip on our imaginations precisely \n     because they speak to our real fears. They are ugly reminders \n     of the erosion of love, trust, and mutual obligation. They \n     are testimony to a profound human disconnectedness that cuts \n     across most conventional lines of class, race and geography.\n       That is one reason, perhaps, that we love the television \n     show, ``Cheers.'' It is the bar ``where everyone knows your \n     name.'' How many of us are blessed with such a place in our \n     lives? How many of us know the names, much less the life \n     stories of all the neighbors in our section of town or even \n     on several floors of our apartment building?\n       To the sophisticates of national politics, it all sounds \n     too painfully small-time, even corny to focus on these \n     things. After all, voluntary local associations and community \n     connection seem so peripheral to both the market and \n     government; both the market and the government have far more \n     raw power. Government and business are national and \n     international in scope. They're on TV. They talk casually \n     about billions of dollars. In many ways the worlds of \n     politics and business have de-legitimized the local, the \n     social, the cultural, the spiritual. Yet upon these things \n     lie the whole edifice of our national well-being.\n       Alongside the decline of civil society, it is a sad truth \n     that the exercise of democratic citizenship plays, at best, a \n     very minor role in the lives of most American adults. Only \n     39% of the eligible voters actually voted in 1994. The role \n     formerly played by party organizations with face to face \n     associations has been yielded to the media, where local TV \n     news follows the dual credos, ``If it bleeds, it leads, and \n     if it thinks, it stinks,'' and paid media politics remains \n     beyond the reach of most Americans. Whey only the rich, such \n     as Ross Perot, can get their views across on TV, political \n     equality suffers. The rich have a loudspeaker and everyone \n     else gets a megaphone. Make no mistake about it, money talks \n     in American politics today as never before, and no revival of \n     our democratic culture can occur until citizens feel that \n     their participation is more meaningful than the money \n     lavished by PACs and big donors.\n       Then, there are the campaigns that we politicians run which \n     short-circuit deliberative judgment. People sit at home as \n     spectators, wait to be entertained by us in 30-second pre-\n     polled, pre-tested emotional appeals and then render a thumbs \n     up or a thumbs down almost on a whim. Outside the campaign \n     season, we, the elected leaders, too often let focus groups \n     do our thinking for us. Public opinion does not result from \n     reasoned dialogue, but from polls that solicit knee-jerk \n     responses from individuals who have seldom had the \n     opportunity to reflect on Bosnia, GATT, property taxes or \n     public education in the company of their fellow citizens.\n       From the Long House of the Iroquois to the general store of \n     de Tocqueville's America to the Chautauquas of the late 19th \n     Century, to the Jaycee's, Lions, PTA's and political clubs of \n     the early '60s, Americans have always had places where they \n     could come together and deliberate about their common future. \n     Today there are fewer and fewer forums where people actually \n     listen to each other. It's as if everyone wants to spout his \n     opinion or her criticism and then move on.\n       So what does all this imply for public policy?\n       First, we need to strengthen the crucible of civil society, \n     the American family. Given the startling increase in the \n     number of children growing up with one parent and paltry \n     resources, we need to recouple sex and parental \n     responsibility. Rolling back irresponsible sexual behavior \n     (sex without thought for its consequences), is best done by \n     holding men equally accountable for such irresponsibility. \n     Policy should send a very clear message--if you have sex with \n     someone and she becomes pregnant, be prepared to have 15% of \n     your wages for 18 years go to support the mother and child. \n     Such a message might force young men to pause before they act \n     and to recognize that fatherhood is a lifetime commitment \n     that takes time and money.\n       And, given that 40% of American children now live in homes \n     where both parents work, we have only four options if we \n     believe our rhetoric about the importance of child-rearing: \n     higher compensation for one spouse so that the other can stay \n     home permanently; a loving relative in the neighborhood; more \n     taxes or higher salaries to pay for more daycare programs; \n     or, parental leave measured in years, not weeks, and \n     available for a mother and a father at different times in a \n     career. The only given is that someone has to care for the \n     children.\n       Secondly, we need to create more quality civic space. The \n     most underutilized resource in most of our communities is the \n     public school, which too often closes at 4:00 pm only to see \n     children in suburbs return to empty homes with television as \n     their babysitter or, in cities, to the street corners where \n     gangs make them an offer they can't refuse. Keeping the \n     schools open on weekdays after hours, and on weekends, with \n     supervision coming from the community, would give some kids a \n     place to study until their parents picked them up or at least \n     would provide a safe haven from the war zone outside.\n       Thirdly, we need a more civic-minded media. At a time when \n     harassed parents spend less time with their children, they \n     have ceded to television more and more of the all-important \n     role of story-telling which is essential to the formation of \n     moral education that sustains a civil society. But too often \n     TV producers and music executives and video game \n     manufacturers feed young people a menu of violence without \n     context and sex without attachment, and both with no \n     consequences or judgement. The market acts blindly to sell \n     and to make money, never pausing to ask whether it furthers \n     citizenship or decency. Too often those who trash government \n     as the enemy of freedom and a destroyer of families are \n     strangely silent about the market's corrosive effects on \n     those very same values in civil society. The answer is not \n     censorship, but more citizenship in the corporate boardroom \n     and more active families who will turn off the trash, boycott \n     the sponsors and tell the executive that you hold them \n     personally responsible for making money from glorifying \n     violence and human degradation.\n       Fourth, in an effort to revitalize the democratic process, \n     we have to take financing of elections out of the hands of \n     the special interests and turn it over to the people by \n     taking two simple steps. Allow taxpayers to check off on \n     their tax returns above their tax liability up to $200 for \n     political campaigns for federal office in their state. Prior \n     to the general election, divide the fund between Democrat, \n     Republican or qualified independent candidates. No other \n     money would be legal--no PACs, no bundles, no big \n     contributions, no party conduits--even the bankroll of a \n     millionaire candidate would be off-limits. If the people of a \n     state choose to give little, then they will be less informed, \n     but this would be the citizens' choice. If there was less \n     money involved, the process would adjust. Who knows, maybe \n     attack ads would go and public discourse would grow.\n       Public policy, as these suggestions illustrate, can help \n     facilitate the revitalization of democracy and civil society, \n     but it cannot create civil society. We can insist that \n     fathers support their children financially, but fathers have \n     to see the importance of spending time with their children. \n     We can figure out ways, such as parental leave, to provide \n     parents with more time with their children, but parents have \n     to use that time to raise their children. We can create \n     community schools, but communities have to use them. We can \n     provide mothers and fathers with the tools they need to \n     influence the storytelling of the mass media, but they \n     ultimately must exercise that control. We can take special \n     interests out of elections, but only people can vote. We can \n     provide opportunities for a more deliberative citizenship at \n     both the national and the local level, but citizens have to \n     seize those opportunities and take individual responsibility.\n       We also have to give the distinctive moral language of \n     civil society a more permanent place in our public \n     conversation. The language of the marketplace says, ``get as \n     much as you can for yourself.'' The language of government \n     says, ``legislate for others what is good for them.'' But the \n     language of community, family and citizenship at its core is\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\n     about receiving undeserved gifts. What this nation needs to \n     promote is the spirit of giving something freely, without \n     measuring it out precisely or demanding something in return.\n       At a minimum, the language of mutual obligation has to be \n     given equal time with the language of rights that dominates \n     our culture. Rights talk properly supports an individual's \n     status and dignity within a community. It has done much to \n     protect the less powerful in our society and should not be \n     abandoned. The problem comes in the adversarial dynamic that \n     rights talk sets up in which people assert themselves through \n     confrontation, championing one right to the exclusion of \n     another. Instead of working together to improve our \n     collective situation, we fight with each other over who has \n     superior rights. Americans are too often given to speaking of \n     America as a country in which you have the right to do \n     whatever you want. On reflection, most of us will admit that \n     no country could long survive that lived by such a principle. \n     And this talk is deeply at odds with the best interests of \n     civil society.\n       Forrest Gump and Rush Limbaugh are the surprise stars of \n     the first half of the '90s because they poke fun at hypocrisy \n     and the inadequacy of what we have today. But they are not \n     builders. The builders are those in localities across America \n     who are constructing bridges of cooperation and dialogue in \n     face to face meetings with their supporters and their \n     adversaries. Alarmed at the decline of civil society, they \n     know how to understand the legitimate point of view of those \n     with whom they disagree. Here in Washington, action too often \n     surrounds only competition for power. With the media's help, \n     words are used to polarize and to destroy people. In cities \n     across America where citizens are working together, words are \n     tools to build bridges between people. For example, at New \n     Communities Corporation in Newark, New Jersey, people are too \n     busy doing things to spend energy figuring out how to tear \n     down. In these places there are more barn-raisers than there \n     are barn-burners. Connecting their idealism with national \n     policy offers us our greatest hope and our biggest challenge.\n       Above all, we need to understand that a true civil society \n     in which citizens interact on a regular basis to grapple with \n     common problems will not occur because of the arrival of a \n     hero. Rebuilding civil society requires people talking and \n     listening to each other, not blindly following a hero.\n       I was reminded a few weeks ago of the temptation offered by \n     the ``knight in shining armor'' when the cover of a national \n     magazine had General Colin Powell's picture on it with a \n     caption something like, ``Will he be the answer to our \n     problems?'' If the problem is a deteriorating civic culture, \n     then a charismatic leader, be he the President or a General, \n     is not the answer. He or she might make us feel better \n     momentarily but then if we are only spectators thrilled by \n     the performance, how have we progressed collectively? A \n     character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo says, ``Pity the nation \n     that has no heroes,'' to which Galileo responds, ``Pity the \n     nation that needs them.'' All of us have to go out in the \n     public square and all of us have to assume our citizenship \n     responsibilities. For me that means trying to tell the truth \n     as I see it to both parties and to the American people \n     without regard for consequences. In a vibrant civil society, \n     real leadership at the top is made possible by the \n     understanding and evolution of leaders of awareness at the \n     bottom and in the middle, that is, citizens engaged in a \n     deliberative discussion about our common future. Jack \n     Danforth knows that, and so do thousands of other Americans \n     who have assumed their responsibility. That's a discussion \n     that I want to be a part of. The more open our public \n     dialogue, the larger the number of Americans who join our \n     deliberation, the greater chance we have to build a better \n     country and a better world.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         Race Relations in America: The Best and Worst of Times\n\n                       (By Senator Bill Bradley)\n\n       Slavery was America's original sin, and race remains its \n     unresolved dilemma. For the last year, three Black males have \n     dominated the nation's focus on race. They are OJ Simpson, \n     Louis Farrakhan and Colin Powell. Each in his own way fed \n     America's appetite to live vicariously and to shrink from \n     confronting our racial reality. Each said something different \n     about the state of race relations in America. They allowed \n     White Americans to either ridicule, demonize, or idealize \n     Black Americans. The OJ case conveyed an almost irrevocable \n     division between Blacks and Whites with the same disparate \n     percentages of Blacks and Whites feeling he was guilty before \n     and after the trial. Louis Farrakhan allowed Whites to attack \n     the messenger rather than confront the part of his message \n     about the desperate conditions in much of Black America. \n     Colin Powell permitted White America to fantasize that an \n     answer to our racial divisions amounted to no more than, ``We \n     like you; you do it for us.''\n       Any person, Black or White, touched by the media becomes \n     bigger than life so that, as with the latest athletic \n     virtuoso, the rest of us become spectators. Little of the \n     media attention on these men recognized the kind of work \n     necessary for individual Americans, Black and White, to \n     bridge the racial divide. In each of their stories, the \n     media, with its need to oversimplify, was crucial in building \n     them up or tearing them down or both in sequence. Each of \n     them became more a symbol than a human being.\n       The real heroes, however, are not the ones that the media \n     churns up and then discards. The real heroes are the parents \n     who lead every day in their homes (as Barbara Bush said. \n     ``What happens in your house is more important than what \n     happens in the White House''), and the citizens and community \n     leaders who are not courting fame, but producing results, who \n     give of themselves because they hold certain values about \n     people in America.\n       For example, there were other African Americans this year--\n     Anna Deavere Smith, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Kimberle Crenshaw and \n     Harlon Dalton--who hardly made a ripple in our mass culture. \n     If you know their names, raise your hand. Yet, each in his or \n     her own way through art, government, writing and the law was \n     confronting the hard facts of our reality and raising the \n     deeper questions of race related to identity and to our \n     common humanity. Anna Deavere Smith, a professor and \n     playwright, was writing and acting the voices of Jews and \n     Blacks in Crown Heights, New York and, in the work called \n     Twilight: Los Angeles, finding rich strains of diversity in \n     Black America itself as well as the words of White Americans \n     who are part of the racial dialogue. L.A. city councilman, \n     Mark Ridley-Thomas was conceiving, organizing and carrying \n     out racial dialogues during some of the tensest race moments \n     in Los Angeles' history. Law professor, Kim Crenshaw, through \n     an analysis of the legal history of civil rights, was \n     brilliantly revealing the attitudinal antecedent to today's \n     White backlash against affirmative action and in so doing, \n     asking us all if we really want to head down that road again. \n     Finally, Harlon Dalton, author, singer, and professor, was \n     challenging people of good will in both races to risk candor \n     and build a new political vision that could dry up the fear \n     and heal the wounds of racial division.\n       What each of them was saying in different ways was that the \n     issue of race can never be a Black issue alone--not only \n     because America is blessed by an abundance of Asian \n     Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Americans, but \n     because a racial dialogue cannot take place without White \n     Americans becoming full participants. White Americans have a \n     race too. Black separatists flourish where Whites shut their \n     doors to dialogue and assume no responsibility for their own \n     stakes in racial healing.\n       As America heads into a presidential election year and \n     California confronts affirmative action in one of its ballot \n     initiatives, the racial landscape of America seems full of \n     land mines. Yet it is precisely at such moments of heightened \n     awareness that we can make the greatest progress because it \n     is at those moments that the necessary pain of candor can be \n     endured and then transcended. So let us ask people who run \n     for president to give us their pedigrees on race, including \n     the real life experiences that led them to their present \n     understanding. Let us urge them to step up to the subject \n     regularly, not just when there is a racial explosion \n     somewhere in America. Let us urge Republicans not to play the \n     race card and Democrats to do more than the minimum to ensure \n     a strong Black voter turnout. Above all, let both parties \n     stop demagoguing the tragic issue of welfare, and start \n     digging deeper into themselves about America's racial future. \n     To expect less is to admit that our politics has failed us on \n     one of America's most important issues.\n       So what is the state of Black-White relations in America? \n     Both Black and White America are caught in a traumatic \n     economic transformation in which millions of Americans feel \n     insecure about their future and for good reason. There are \n     130 million jobs in America and 90 million of them involve \n     repetitive tasks, which means that a computer can displace \n     any of those jobs. In a world where credit departments of 300 \n     people are routinely displaced by 10 computer workstations, \n     more and more Americans will lose good paying jobs along with \n     their health insurance and often their pensions, so that \n     corporate profits can rise and productivity increase.\n       During the first six months of 1993, the Clinton \n     Administration announced that 1.3 million jobs had been \n     created, to which a TWA machinist replied, ``Yeah, my wife \n     and I have four of them.'' And indeed, over half of the newly \n     created jobs were part-time.\n       If you're African American, you've seen it before. In the \n     1940s the cotton gin pushed Black field hands off the farms \n     of the South and to the cities of the North. Labor-intensive \n     manufacturing jobs seemed to be the Promised Land. Then \n     automation arrived and the last hired were the first fired \n     and millions of unskilled Black workers lost their jobs. \n     Still, many hung on in the manufacturing sector. Then, \n     with the advent of information technology and foreign \n     competition, labor unions, such as the multiracial \n     steelworkers saw their membership plummet from 750,000 in \n     1979 to 374,000 in 1990. Finally, in the 1960s and '70s, \n     government began to employ African Americans in sizable \n     numbers, but in the 1980s and 1990s, with the fiscal \n     crunch in full progress, government employees were let go. \n     In the midst of the information revolution, just as in the \n     midst of any recession, tough economic winds become a \n     hurricane for African Americans.\n       Many White Americans who have been caught in the cold winds \n     for the first time feel disoriented. Many become easy prey \n     for politicians who want to explain deteriorating standards \n     of living by stigmatizing Black Americans. ``You have lost \n     your job,'' these\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\n     mischief makers say, ``because of affirmative action or \n     because of the money government spends to help the poor.'' \n     Instead of seeing the demographic reality-that only as all \n     Americans advance will White Americans advance--they often \n     fall into the scapegoating trap. It's an old story.\n       In California, a white-collar worker named Ron Smith who \n     lost his job at McDonnell-Douglas two years ago, told a \n     journalist how his sense that he was ``starting to lose my \n     grip'' feeds into the divisiveness that is tearing our \n     country apart: ``I get angry, and a lot of anger is coming \n     out,'' he said. ``I'm blaming everyone--minorities, aliens \n     coming across the border. I don't know how much truth there \n     is to it. I mean, I don't think there are any planners and \n     engineers coming across the border. But it hurts when you go \n     to an interview and you know damn well you can do the job, \n     and you know they are looking at you and thinking, `Forget \n     it.' ''\n       The fact is that, economically, Black America is in the \n     best and worst of times. Roughly a third of Black America can \n     now be called middle class. Black Americans distinguish \n     themselves in virtually every field of endeavor. But more \n     than 30% of Black Americans live in grinding poverty. Many \n     can't find a job, can't get credit to buy a house or start a \n     business, and increasingly can't make ends meet for \n     necessities, much less save for the future. Indeed, the \n     unemployment rate for Blacks is routinely twice that for \n     Whites. Also, the earnings of Black college-educated men have \n     only recently reached parity with those of White men with \n     high school diplomas. Of greater significance is the fact \n     that 46% of Black children live below the poverty line, \n     compared with 17% of White youngsters.\n       Without question, disintegrating family structure \n     contributes to Black poverty. The average income for a two-\n     parent Black family is three times the income of a single-\n     parent White family. But poverty is more than a Black \n     problem. It is a broad national systemic issue flowing from \n     inadequate economic growth unfairly shared. Indeed, there are \n     16 million more White Americans in poverty than there are \n     Black Americans in poverty. But many Whites feel it is \n     primarily a Black problem. Because of lingering racial \n     attitudes and stereotypes, marshaling resources to cope with \n     it becomes more difficult. In that sense, racism contributes \n     to Black poverty and to White poverty, too.\n       The conflict between generations in the Black community is \n     real and the primary responsibility for bridging it rests \n     with the Black community. There is a breakdown in \n     communication and a breakdown in values. When I left Missouri \n     for college in 1961, the number of children in St. Louis born \n     to a single parent was 13%; now it is 68%. Among Black \n     children it is 86%. In some cities, such as Baltimore, 55% of \n     the African American males between the ages of 18 and 34 are \n     either in jail, on probation, or awaiting trial. The \n     idealistic call of Martin Luther King, Jr. or the disciplined \n     march of Muslims who have declared war on Black self-\n     destruction, can't compete with the latest gangsta rapper who \n     from the TV screen calls young people to a life of crime, \n     violence, White hate, and female abuse. Increasingly, a \n     generation with little to lose pulls the trigger without \n     remorse, risks nothing for their neighbor and invests little \n     in their own futures. They live for today, some because \n     that's all they have ever done and others because they \n     believe that their tomorrow will only be worse.\n       Is the plight of this element of young Black America an \n     isolated cancer, or a harbinger of all our futures? Is the \n     message of these young black Americans pathological or \n     prophetic? Will the rest of America respond or turn its back?\n       White Americans seem to have ignored the devastation in \n     many American cities. Both government and the private sector \n     have proven inadequate to the task of urban rejuvenation. \n     It's almost as if the kids with AIDS, the gang members with \n     guns, the teenagers lost to crack cocaine, the young rape \n     victim whose only self-respect comes from having another \n     child, don't exist for most White Americans. That is why the \n     Million Man March was so important. Although it was based on \n     the premise that White Americans won't help, it was itself I \n     think a remarkable moment in American history. First, in a \n     country where murder is the number one cause of death among \n     young African American males, and where single-parenthood \n     continues to rise, and where drugs and dealing drugs are \n     sometimes the profession of choice for the young as opposed \n     to teaching or becoming a minister of any faith, it is \n     enormously positive to have a million African American men \n     come together and say, We're going to take individual \n     responsibility to change these circumstances. But, similar to \n     Promise Keeper, a group of the Christian community that \n     gathers 50,000 predominantly White middle-class men in a \n     stadium where they pledge to be good fathers and husbands, \n     the hard part is living the pledge every day. The test will \n     be whether the million men return to their communities, \n     reduce the violence and drugs and become meaningful figures \n     in the lives of fatherless children.\n       My Senate office legal counsel, who is African American, \n     attended the Million Man March on the National Mall. He told \n     me that the atmosphere was electric and that it reflected \n     great diversity. For example, a Korean American woman was \n     selling soda and ice-cream and at one point during the day, \n     up came a Black man to purchase a drink. Another Black man \n     was standing nearby with his arms folded, and he said, ``No, \n     not today brother; today you buy from a brother, not from \n     her.'' Another one came up and said, ``Not today brother; \n     today you buy from a brother, not from her.'' A third guy \n     came up and said the same thing, but the third guy replied, \n     ``What do you mean, `I buy from the brother'? Don't you \n     realize you're doing the same thing to her that was done to \n     us for 200 years. I'm buying from her!'' And he does. \n     Another one came up, the same experience, an argument: \n     ``I'm buying from her because why should we discriminate \n     against her the way we've been discriminated against?'' \n     The Million Man March was not of one mind; it was a \n     million minds whose faces happened to be Black.\n       Minister Louis Farrakhan has said things that are on many \n     levels despicable. But more importantly, in practical terms, \n     his separatist message is a dead end. If he succeeds in \n     countering self-destructive behavior while also separating \n     the Black community from the White community, what he will \n     have created is the equivalent of many a segregated \n     neighborhood prior to the civil rights revolution. \n     Ultimately, the question is not only how do we counter the \n     poverty, violence and family disintegration, but how do we \n     all live together?\n       Although some Black Americans resent it, White Americans \n     also have a view on how we can resolve the problem of race. \n     Although some White Americans resent it, Black Americans can \n     challenge us to reflect on our own race. Among other things, \n     that means that we have to recognize that the flip side of \n     racial discrimination is racial privilege, which consists of \n     all those things that come to White Americans in the normal \n     course of living; all the things they take for granted that a \n     Black person must never take for granted. Race privilege is a \n     harder concept to grasp than racial discrimination, \n     especially for Whites, because it is more subtle. It is \n     rooted in assumptions about every day, yet there is no \n     denying it. For example, if I'm looking to buy a house and \n     I'm White, I never fear someone will say no to me because of \n     my race, but if I`m Black, I constantly make assessments \n     about what is possible, problematic or impossible. That \n     freedom from fear is a White skin privilege. If I'm White, I \n     know that if I meet the economic criteria I'll get the loan. \n     If I'm Black, I know I might not. Skin privilege means that I \n     don't have to worry that my behavior will reflect positively \n     or negatively on my race; it will reflect only on me and on \n     my family. Skin privilege means that I can relate to a \n     stranger without first having to put them at ease about my \n     race. I know Black males who walk the street whistling \n     classical music to let Whites know they're not dangerous.\n       As long as White America remains blind to its own racial \n     privilege, Black Americans will feel that the focus falls too \n     heavily on them. I never thought much about my skin privilege \n     until I became a professional basketball player. That was a \n     time when pundits asserted that the reason some teams drew \n     sparse crowds was because they had five Black starters. \n     Suddenly, in my first year, I began to receive offers to do \n     commercial endorsements. I felt that they were coming to me \n     instead of my Black teammates not because I was the best \n     player; I wasn't. No, they were coming because of skin \n     privilege, because I was me and I was White and marketers \n     still believed, like the teams that hesitated to start the \n     five best players because they might be Black, that a White \n     public would never buy from a Black salesman. Some companies \n     still believe that. That's why Bill Cosby's Jell-O ads were \n     so important and why Michael Jordan must never forget who \n     paved the way.\n       As long as White America believes that the race problem is \n     primarily a Black problem of meeting White standards to gain \n     admittance to White society, things will never stabilize and \n     endure. But the flip side of White skin privilege is negative \n     Black attitudes--reflected in even small things, such as \n     coldness in daily interactions at work, slowdowns in \n     providing services to Whites, or gathering at separate tables \n     in cafeterias--that cast any attempts by Whites at racial \n     dialogue as disingenuous and illegitimate. African Americans \n     have to open up their worlds to Whites just as Whites have to \n     open up their worlds to Blacks. Without that kind of candor, \n     the dialogue will be phoney. Without that kind of mutual \n     interest, the ties will not bind. Without that kind of mutual \n     commitment, racial hierarchy will persist.\n       I believe most White Americans are not racist. Mark Fuhrman \n     is, thank God, the exception, not the rule. Most White \n     Americans easily reject the crude stereotyping and violent \n     race hate of a Fuhrman. We are no longer living in a time \n     where a group of German prisoners of war could be served at a \n     Kansas lunch counter, while the Black soldiers guarding them \n     could not sit next to them. We are no longer living at a time \n     when in Washington, D.C. a priest refused to continue his \n     sermon until a Black worshiper moved to the back of the \n     church. Today there is something much more subtle afoot in \n     America. As Harlon Dalton writes of the African American \n     experience:\n       Instead of having doors slammed in our faces, we are \n     cordially invited to come on in. Instead of being denied an \n     application, we are encouraged to fill one out. Instead of \n     failing to make the first cut, we make it to the final round. \n     And when the rejection letter finally arrives, it has a \n     pretty bow tied around it, (Something like: ``We were not \n     able to make you an offer at this time, but we really enjoyed \n     having the chance to get\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\n     to know you.'') Similarly, we hardly ever run into Bull \n     Connor or even David Duke anymore. Instead, we encounter \n     people who are ostensibly on our side and who seek to protect \n     us from the stigma of affirmative action and the dependency \n     created by too much government support. Instead of \n     confronting nasty people intent on using our color against \n     us, we are surrounded by perfectly nice people who embrace \n     the colorblind ideal with a vengeance.\n       All of this poses a question I raised in 1992 at the \n     Democratic Convention. The silence of good people in the face \n     of continuing racism is often as harmful as the actions of \n     bad people. While most people aren't racist, there are some \n     White and Black people in America who do remain racists, \n     spewing hostility toward another person simply because of his \n     or her race. There are White politicians who play the ``race \n     card'' and there are Black politicians who play the ``racist \n     card.'' But the word racist is over used. Most people aren't \n     brimming over with race hatred. To say that someone who \n     opposes affirmative action is racist denies the possibility \n     that the person may just be ignorant or unknowledgeable. If \n     one hurls the epithet, ``racist'' a meaningful dialogue is \n     unlikely to follow and it is only out of candid conversations \n     that Whites will discover skin privilege, Blacks will accept \n     constructive criticism from Whites and progress will come \n     steadily.\n       But let us not abandon the quest to end racism. Let us root \n     out what Harlon Dalton calls those ``culturally accepted \n     beliefs that defend social advantage based on race.'' To \n     do that however, takes individual initiative and \n     involvement. That begins with a President and doesn't end \n     until all of us as individuals become engaged. Ronald \n     Reagan denied that there was any discrimination in \n     America, much less racism. George Bush was a little \n     better, but then he appointed Clarence Thomas to the \n     Supreme Court who, in an odd twist, turned the clock back \n     on the whole issue. And now Bill Clinton says, Yes, there \n     is racism; yes we need affirmative action; and yes, I'll \n     give my own pedigree in terms of my own experience. I \n     believe he is strongest when he talks about conviction \n     related to race because I do think he has that conviction. \n     But the question we need to hear him answer is, What are \n     we going to do about it? One would like to see him talk \n     about it more, to remind people of our history, to educate \n     Americans about why it's important that we get beyond \n     these stupid divisions that diminish our possibilities as \n     individuals and as a nation.\n       Affirmative action takes on such a disproportionate place \n     in our national politics because many Whites cannot conceive \n     of White skin privilege and because discrimination, when it \n     occurs, remains largely unaddressed. Why not deal with the \n     underlying issue which is discrimination and facilitate \n     remedies for discrimination? Affirmative action is a response \n     to a discriminatory pattern over many years in institutions \n     run by individuals who are confident that they don't have to \n     change. To the extent that you don't remedy individual \n     discrimination early and forcefully, then you are going to \n     have thousands of judges around this country making broad \n     brush rulings that often seem unfair to Whites. And then \n     you're going to have other self-interested groups in the name \n     of affirmative action asking for things that are not \n     affirmative action. It's beyond me for example, how giving a \n     group of investors who have an African American participant a \n     tax subsidy in the purchase of a radio or television station \n     is affirmative action; it's not. But it's easier to say no if \n     you can say yes to facilitating the battle against \n     discrimination. You cant say no unless you realize that in \n     some place affirmative action is the only way we can balance \n     White skin privilege. For example, the US military, even \n     after President Truman's desegregation order, remained a \n     bastion of White, often Southern, officers. It took Jimmy \n     Carter and his African American secretary of the Army, \n     Clifford Alexander, to change the way promotions were granted \n     so that Black officers had a chance to become generals. In \n     other words, without Cliff Alexander, there would be no Colin \n     Powell. If you don't believe me, ask Colin Powell. If you \n     believe that that was then and this is now, and that there is \n     no need to look at other institutions, I refer you to the \n     report of the Glass Ceiling Commission. I ask you only to \n     answer why there are no Black CEOs of major corporations and \n     why major New York law firms still have only a minuscule \n     number of Black partners.\n       To understand what needs to be done requires knowing a \n     little history. The issue arose during the consideration of \n     the 1964 Civil Rights Act: Do we put an administrative \n     enforcement mechanism in the law to remedy discrimination in \n     employment? The Republicans in the Senate said they would \n     join the Southern Democrats and filibuster the bill if \n     President Johnson gave the soon-to-be-created EEOC an \n     administrative enforcement mechanism, so he dropped it out. \n     Now, if there is an act of discrimination, what you do is \n     file a petition with the EEOC. But there is no way to bring \n     the issue to a conclusion. So, the case languishes \n     indefinitely. There are now 97,000 cases backlogged at the \n     EEOC. Imagine you're a competent mid-level clerk in a company \n     that has promoted Whites, but rarely a Black, or you're the \n     25th African American who's applied for a job with a police \n     department in a city that is overwhelmingly African American, \n     and not one has ever been accepted and so you decide to bring \n     a case at the EEOC. After five years you get no remedy. So \n     then you go to court for another five years, at the end of \n     which you may or may not get a remedy, which means for people \n     of modest means, you don't have a remedy for discrimination \n     because you can't afford a lawyer for ten years in order to \n     get your promotion from a $30,000 to $40,000 a year job.\n       The EEOC should have the same power that the National Labor \n     Relations Board has, which is cease and desist authority, the \n     ability to bring a case to a conclusion and say, Yes, there \n     was discrimination and this is a remedy, or say, no, there \n     was no discrimination, this is frivolous. With a more \n     streamlined procedure for resolving charges of \n     discrimination, companies would pay less to lawyers defending \n     them against frivolous cases and individuals who have a \n     legitimate claim would get a more timely resolution to the \n     problem of discrimination. But once given real power, the \n     EEOC has to resist ridiculous interventions that allow \n     Americans who don't want to fight discrimination an excuse to \n     discredit the whole EEOC effort. Self-indulgence at the EEOC \n     breeds disrespect for what should be a mechanism of our \n     national self-respect.\n       Finally, when it comes to attacks on affirmative action, it \n     is important to see how similar they are to the legal \n     justification for segregation in the 19th Century. As \n     Kimberle Crenshaw points out in a brilliant paper, treasured \n     American values such as autonomy, freedom, individualism, and \n     federalism were deployed in support of discrimination. For \n     example, the Supreme Court ruled that a White person deciding \n     to prohibit a Black person from riding in a certain train car \n     was exercising his individual freedom of contract. Decades \n     later, Thurgood Marshall and other freedom fighters argued \n     before the court that even though the acts of individual \n     discrimination might be protected as private rights of \n     contract, the discriminatory practices were so widespread \n     that they acted as an impediment to interstate commerce for \n     Black people as a group. Individual freedom yielded to group \n     remedy for group discrimination. Thus, the interests of the \n     national community to prevent racial discrimination took \n     precedence over the individual right to bar Black Americans \n     from enjoying the benefits of full citizenship.\n       Today, many of the people who oppose affirmative action and \n     state a preference for color blindness and justify their \n     position by reference to the American tradition of \n     considering individuals equal before the law are often the \n     same people who seldom have Black friends and who will choose \n     the White teacher for their children every time. when people \n     shout reverse discrimination they ignore our history, the \n     continuation of subtle White skin privilege, and the fact \n     that more White people lost their jobs in the 1982 recession \n     than blacks have gained jobs from court-ordered affirmative \n     action since its inception. When people diminish real, not \n     imagined, Black contributions to our society as if they were \n     a threat to our historical canon, they diminish their own \n     understanding of themselves and their country. What is at \n     work here is the attempt to again distort traditional \n     American values to slow down progress on race.\n       During the civil rights era, the message was that Black \n     Americans wanted to make something of themselves through hard \n     work, religious devotion, political activism and educational \n     attainment. White America had only to do what was in its own \n     long-term interests anyway and remove the architecture of \n     racial oppression. The movement had the high moral ground. \n     Today, with murder, AIDS and drugs running rampant through \n     the black community, with many blacks unwilling to accept \n     some of the responsibility for their predicament, White \n     Americans seem more and more unwilling to make sacrifices to \n     change the abysmal physical conditions. When black \n     separatists come across more like Governor Wallace than \n     Martin Luther King, they give those Whites who are only \n     marginally interested in Black folks in the first place a \n     reason to turn off.\n       To counter the human devastation in parts of urban America, \n     chronicled so vividly by Jonathan Kozal in Amazing Grace and \n     Savage Inequalities, will take an heroic effort by thousands \n     in the Black and White communities working together. It will \n     take police departments that do their jobs conscientiously \n     and with adequate resources. It will take schools that are \n     teaching institutions, not simply warehouses for storing our \n     children. It will take surrogate families who will express \n     some small love for a kid without parents. It might even take \n     boarding schools for kids that can't make it in the \n     neighborhood. Above all, it will take a new biracial \n     political vision that acts, because to fail to act will stain \n     our ideals, diminish our chances for long-term prosperity, \n     and shortchange our children--all our children.\n       In the 1960s the Civil Rights movement thrived on the \n     assumption that an America without racism would be a \n     spiritually transformed America. That, after all, is what \n     affirmative action affirms--that America can get over its \n     racial nightmare; that few in America should be poor or dumb, \n     or violent because the rest of us have cared too little for \n     them; that no one in America should have a racial limit set \n     on where their talents can take them; and that the process of \n     seeing beyond skin color and eye shape allows us not to \n     ignore race but to elevate the individual. A new political \n     vision requires people to engage each other, endure the pain \n     of candor, learn from each other's history, absorb each \n     other's humanity and move on to higher ground. Such is the \n     task of those who care\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\n     about racial healing. It won't happen overnight nor will one \n     person bring it, however illustrative his career, nor will \n     one person destroy it, however heinous his crime or poisonous \n     his rhetoric. It can never be just about numbers. It must \n     ultimately always be about the human spirit. What will be \n     built has its foundation in the individual interactions of \n     individual Americans of different races who dialogue and then \n     act together to do something so that like a team, a platoon, \n     a group building a home or cleaning up a park, something is \n     transformed because of the common effort. Slowly, with acts \n     of brotherhood transforming physical circumstances even as \n     they bind the ties among the participants, we can say that \n     racial progress has ceased retreating and is once again on \n     the advance. In other words, only together can we chart a \n     brighter future.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Harry Truman: Public Power and the New Economy\n\n                       (By Senator Bill Bradley)\n\n       I understand that I am getting this award because the \n     Truman Award Commission felt that I exemplify at least some \n     of the traits of President Harry S. Truman. I came up with \n     three that I know both he and I share: We were both born in \n     Missouri of Scotch Irish heritage; neither of us were \n     considered natural public speakers; and, occasionally, we \n     could be considered just a little bit stubborn. As Bess \n     Truman would point out if she were here today, some of these \n     traits are shared with old Missouri mules, except that a mule \n     might have given a better keynote speech that I did at the \n     1992 Democratic National Convention.\n       That I should receive the Truman Award is a great honor \n     because I have been long been an admirer and a student of his \n     political career. Truman's come from behind Senate re-\n     election campaign in 1940, which in many ways was a precursor \n     to the 1948 presidential race, was the subject of my \n     Princeton senior thesis, entitled ``On That Record I Stand.'' \n     I had wanted to read my entire 140-page senior thesis today \n     but fortunately for all of you, there isn't the time.\n       Some thirty years after I wrote my college thesis, I found \n     myself again thinking about the 33rd president and \n     remembering a conversation I had with a couple of ``good ole \n     boys'' from North Carolina. They had told me how they didn't \n     like Jesse Jackson, whom they considered a ``rabble-rouser,'' \n     nor Jesse Helms, whom they considered ``a disgrace to the \n     state.'' So, I asked them for their favorite president. \n     ``Harry Truman,'' one shot back, ``because he was one of the \n     people, and when he spoke we could understand him. Just \n     because some is President, you know, doesn't make him better \n     than me.''\n       There it was. To be a leader that good old boys related to, \n     you had to have a fierce egalitarian spirit, the spirit that \n     made Harry Truman ``the man of the people.'' Truman's view \n     was that a person should be judged without regard to material \n     possessions or social position. Each individual has an \n     inherent and independent worth, regardless of knowledge or \n     wealth. Nobody has a monopoly on morality or wisdom. No \n     American should be expendable. Each man and woman in our \n     democracy should have a voice in charting our collective \n     future.\n       I, too, believe in these values and have tried to infuse \n     them in my pubic service. But Harry Truman was not the first \n     person to preach these ideals; they come directly from the \n     Declaration of Independence, which to me is our most \n     important historical document. Times have changed since July \n     4, 1776, but the idea that all people are equally imbued with \n     the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and \n     that no individual is more important than another remains at \n     the heart of what makes America special. And, indeed, \n     national government is constituted in part to guarantee this \n     individual right through the exercise of public power.\n       In further reflection on Truman's career, characteristics \n     other than his ``common touch'' also stand out. He sent \n     comprehensive civil rights legislation to Congress when it \n     was supported by only 6% of the national public, according to \n     one Gallup Poll. He acted on his own authority to desegregate \n     the armed forces. Speaking as the first President to address \n     the NAACP, he declared that all Americans were entitled to, \n     not only civil rights, but decent housing, education, and \n     medical care. Such political courage is all too rare.\n       Today, people have become so cynical about politics that \n     they think all elected officials are controlled--by special \n     interests who give them campaign money, by pollsters who tell \n     them that thought is not as important as focus group phrases, \n     by political parties which often stifle their independent \n     judgment, and by their own ambition which rarely permits them \n     to call things like they really see them, for fear of \n     angering a constituency group that will be needed for a \n     future election. While most politicians do not knowingly say \n     something false, they tend to emphasize the issue that the \n     group to which they are speaking agrees with. That is \n     commonly referred to as ``good politics,'' but it is the \n     exact opposite of the Truman way of ``telling it like it \n     is.''\n       But perhaps Truman's most important characteristic was that \n     he stood up for the working American in a way few politicians \n     have. In 1947 and 1948, Truman issued dozens of vetoes on \n     legislation passed by a reactionary Republican congress not \n     unlike the one we have today. In mid-1947, Truman vetoed two \n     popular Republican tax cut proposals because they would have \n     favored the right and penalized the middle-class through \n     higher inflation.\n       Truman's most famous veto of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley \n     Act, was overridden by a Congress responding to polls that \n     showed most Americans believed the unions--then representing \n     24% of the workforce--had become too powerful and needed to \n     be restrained. Truman felt that Taft-Hartley went too far and \n     would, he said, ``take fundamental rights away from our \n     working people.'' He did not flinch. He acted as a truly \n     progressive president, unafraid to use public power.\n       At the end of World War II, Harry Truman needed to find a \n     way to cushion the effects of the armed forces \n     demobilization. War contracts would be canceled, price \n     controls would be ended, war-time labor agreements would \n     expire, and millions of service men and women would come home \n     looking for jobs. Some predicted a return of the Depression.\n       His solution was a 21-point program offering economic \n     security to every American citizen. Truman's reconversion \n     plan urged an extension of unemployment compensation, an \n     increase in the minimum wage, expansion of social security, \n     extension of the GI Bill, universal health insurance, and \n     what he called ``full-employment'' legislation that would \n     guarantee a job to every able-bodied American willing to \n     work. Parts of the program were considered radical even in \n     the era just after the New Deal. And while many of Truman's \n     proposals never became law, the breadth of his approach \n     showed that he was thinking of the well-being of all classes \n     in America. And indeed, all classes shared in the boom: \n     Unemployment all but disappeared. Real living standards were \n     higher when he left office than when he took over from \n     F.D.R.\n       I believe that America is at a similar economic crossroads \n     today as we move into the information age and that we again \n     need approaches of breadth and innovation to assure the \n     American dream for our people. They start with a \n     reinvigoration of public power--our power.\n       The use of public power still has a valid role to play in \n     ensuring fairness and economic security for all Americans. We \n     need to use our collective power to help individuals cope \n     with changing economic times, to ensure competition among \n     market participants and to prevent harm to the general \n     welfare. There is simply no other way to check the excesses \n     of private power except through public power.\n       Such a willing use of public power disputes the Republican \n     notion that the private sector has all the answers and will \n     automatically relieve the fears of working Americans. It is \n     also different from the belief that to every social problem \n     in America there is an answer which has as its centerpiece a \n     federal bureaucracy delivering services through regional and \n     state bureaucracies. For example, there are 58 federal \n     programs for poverty and 154 federal programs for job \n     training. Yet, worker retraining without new jobs being \n     available leads nowhere.\n       Idealism without resources is impotent. Just ask anyone who \n     thought that charitable giving could end poverty. Idealism \n     without accountability wastes money. Just ask anyone who \n     thought that HUD was sufficient to stabilize the decline of \n     urban America.\n       I start with the belief that the market is the most \n     efficient allocator of resources and frequently the most \n     powerful undefined force in American life. It rewards those \n     with the highest skills, best processes and most desired \n     products. An ideal market would deliver the best quality at \n     the lowest price in the shortest time. But the market is \n     impartial and can be cruel in its verdicts, with the result \n     that many people get hurt. To cushion the impact of the \n     market is not easy to do and remain fair. Usually those who \n     escape the judgment of the market in our current political \n     system are not broad classes of similarly situated \n     individuals, but rather companies or individuals with the \n     best-connected lobbyist. Such is the inequality of the \n     administrative state, full of rules and exceptions, \n     definitions and effective dates. How to benefit from the \n     market's dynamism while protecting against the dislocation \n     that it sometimes causes remains our dilemma.\n       I have always believed that the message of America is that \n     if you work hard you can get ahead economically, if you get \n     involved, you can change things politically and if you reason \n     patiently enough you can extend quality to all races and both \n     genders. Today, many Americans doubt these basic American \n     precepts. In the information economy, four computer \n     workstations replace 300 people in a credit department no \n     matter how hard they work. In our political dialogue, money \n     drowns out the voices of the people. In our social \n     interactions, few risk candor to create racial harmony.\n       For nearly 20 years, the rhetoric of economic conservatives \n     has demonized government. Without making the distinction \n     between federal programs and public power, they labeled \n     government programs as waste and government rules as \n     limitations on freedom. The result has been that millions of \n     Americans concluded that government took their money in taxes \n     but worked for someone other than them. What most people have \n     missed is that, while government can be distant and \n     ineffective, public power can speak to people where they live \n     their lives.\n       Public power isn't labor intensive; it doesn't require \n     massive decentralized programs delivering services to \n     millions of people; it won't guarantee full employment. But\n\n[[Page S12250]]\n\n     applied in the right way at the right time in the right \n     place, it can balance private power. Public power works only \n     if individuals are better off when it is exercised; only if \n     it enhances an individual's prospects for life, liberty and \n     the pursuit of happiness. Public power often means preventing \n     the ethos of the market from dominating other equally \n     important ethics--democratic, environmental, human, \n     spiritual. Public power can never replace the memories, \n     places and stories of these other ethics, but it can prevent \n     the cacophony of modern life from drowning out their voices. \n     Public power must always focus on the long-term; it must \n     always be accountable; it must never be exercised arrogantly; \n     it must always be a balancing force so that life can be whole \n     and market economic forces, while giving us low prices and \n     high quality, do not control our beings or destroy our \n     humanity.\n       Workers caught in the midst of wage stagnation and economic \n     downsizing need public power to balance private power. \n     Millions of Americans are one or two paychecks away from \n     falling out of middle-class status and are never able to put \n     away enough so they feel comfortable. During the first six \n     months of 1993, the Clinton Administration announced that 1.3 \n     million jobs had been created, to which a TWA machinist \n     replied, ``Yeah, my wife and I have four of them.''\n       The heavy footsteps of relocation, part-time jobs, temp \n     jobs, middle age without health care and retirement without a \n     pension have made their way to the doorsteps of too many \n     American families. Millions of Americans no longer look to \n     the single workplace of the family's main breadwinner as the \n     site where their standard of living will improve. Wages have \n     been stagnant for too long. Too many good jobs have \n     disappeared. Too many expectations have been shattered.\n       Who can an individual turn to for help when caught in this \n     economic trauma? The Church doesn't have resources or \n     temporal power; the unions now represent only 11% of the \n     workforce. The same man who things his deteriorating economic \n     circumstance is caused by government finds that only \n     government has the power to counter corporate power. When the \n     AT worker loses his job (as 7,000 have in New Jersey during \n     the past three months), his rugged individualism is no match \n     for the company's power. When a downsized IBM engineer who \n     formerly earned $60,000 takes a job for $45,000, a $300 tax \n     cut is a poor substitute. To work hard, play by the rules and \n     take your reward without worrying about your fellow workers \n     sounds fine until the rules change and the pink slip arrives. \n     Only then does the solitary individual sense his \n     powerlessness.\n       Only public power can reduce the trauma for people being \n     thrown out of work without pensions, health care, or a chance \n     of getting another job at equal pay. People need an economic \n     security platform that will allow them to ride the rapids of \n     this economic transformation. That platform should consist of \n     the following: a year of company-paid health care for the \n     family of the downsized worker who has been employed by a \n     company of at least one hundred workers for at least ten \n     years. If you have a pension, it ought to be portable. Why \n     should a person who worked 22 years in one place still be \n     unable to have a pension simply because the place was owned \n     by three separate companies in those 22 years, and he vested \n     in none of them.\n       In addition to health care and pensions, people \n     increasingly need educational opportunity throughout their \n     working lives. Professor Albert Einstein once monitored a \n     graduate physics exam and a student ran up to him and said, \n     ``Professor, these questions are the same as those on the \n     test that was given last year,'' to which Einstein replied, \n     ``Well, that's okay, because this year the answers are \n     different.'' In the information age, the answers are going to \n     be different every year and unless you have lifetime \n     education, you're not going to be able to come up with them.\n       But issues of public power--the collective expression of \n     the people's power--extend to areas beyond the need for an \n     economic security platform in the midst of economic turmoil. \n     Take for example America's public lands--the one third of the \n     land mass of America that is owned by the federal government. \n     It belongs to all of us; it is our patrimony. The miners, \n     ranchers, loggers and corporate farmers of irrigated land do \n     not own it. From the beautiful Red Rock wilderness of Utah to \n     the majestic peaks of Alaska's Brooks range, there are places \n     that mankind has not yet altered. They are as they have been \n     for thousands of years. And if we want our children to \n     experience them in their pristine form, we must, as the \n     Iroquois did, think of the effect of our actions seven \n     generations ahead. The only way to prohibit the natural \n     resource industries from forcing the timeless expanses of \n     wilderness to fit a calendar of quarterly earnings is for \n     public power to say ``no,'' acting in behalf of all of us and \n     for the generations to come.\n       Another example of public power lies in our ability to \n     reduce the role of money in our democratic process and to \n     better inform the voters so they can shape our collective \n     future. Today, candidates, in order to get their story \n     across, collect campaign contributions from special interests \n     and the wealthy and then give the money to local TV stations \n     to run campaign TV ads that often malign the character, \n     distort the record or overwhelm the prospects of a hapless \n     opponent with less money. Yet if one were only to think about \n     it, the solution to this national embarrassment is \n     commonsensical. TV largely comes over the airwaves. The \n     public--all of us--own the airwaves. They don't belong to \n     local network affiliates. We have the power to require time \n     to be available to political candidates for president and the \n     Senate. If democracy suffers from inadequately informed \n     citizens and citizens are disdainful of politics in part \n     because of campaign money then public power should require \n     local TV stations to give a specific amount of free time to \n     Senate candidates to make their case. The public airwaves are \n     not private property.\n       Even on the issue of race, there is a role for public \n     power. Some institutions resist change. Some companies deny \n     white skin privilege. Even some governmental institutions \n     have needed additional pressure to level the playing field. \n     Yet there is no timely enforcement mechanism for the civil \n     rights laws that declare discrimination in job promotions \n     illegal. Because individuals are being hurt by discrimination \n     only public power can counter it. That is why the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission should be given cease and \n     desist authority to being discrimination cases to a close.\n       In all these areas--the guarantee of an economic security \n     platform for individuals caught in the turmoil of economic \n     transformation; the protection of pristine public lands for \n     generations of individuals to enjoy as our forefathers did; \n     the requirement to devote some of the public airwaves to the \n     dialogue of democracy; the ability of public entities to \n     determine if discrimination exists and to rectify it--you do \n     not need government programs and vast service-delivery \n     bureaucracies. You simply need what Harry Truman never shied \n     away from--a willingness to use public power for those with \n     relatively less power and to do so in the name of the people, \n     so that each individual will have a better chance for the \n     realization of his or her inalienable right to life, liberty \n     and the pursuit of happiness.\n       One final area where the American people have latent power \n     concerns the American corporation itself. The American \n     corporation exists because the people gave it status and \n     limited liability. Such a grant was thought to be in the \n     public interest. Yet we measure the performance of a \n     corporation narrowly, by the financial balance sheet, even \n     though we all know that the corporation affects all of us in \n     many ways apart from the financial balance sheet.\n       As we are entering the information age, it is important to \n     find a way to report not only financial data but information \n     on the impact of the corporation on its workers, its \n     community, and on the environment. We need something similar \n     to the form of the financial balance sheet developed by the \n     Financial Accounting Standards Board, but for the worker, the \n     community, and the environment. The requirement that \n     corporations adhere to standards for the full disclosure of \n     financial information has made U.S. capital markets the most \n     vibrant in the world and has given every investor equal \n     access to the same information. Full disclosure of the \n     corporate impact on workers, communities and the environment \n     will create unforseen pressures and innovations. The result \n     may well be not only a country with more long-term growth in \n     its economy, but also with more security and self-fulfillment \n     for its citizens.\n       If information is available to the broadest number of \n     people, the market can often produce the result we want \n     without the heavy-handed intervention of government. By the \n     year 2000 there will be one billion users of the Internet, up \n     from today's 50 million users. There will be more global \n     traffic on the Internet in the year 2000 than is now on \n     telephone lines. With corporate information beyond the \n     financial balance sheet flowing to users indiscriminately, \n     many more people will be empowered. Hierarchy will give way \n     as power shifts down to pension fund managers who think about \n     the daily lives of workers as well as the highest return on \n     investment, to churches who want to measure a company's \n     profession of values against their real-world performance, to \n     small investors who want to follow ``green'' investments or \n     champion community responsibility at the same time they want \n     to maximize profit. With newly available information, groups \n     such as these can create a culture of accountability that \n     will lead to a more stable and humane American society.\n       Power will also flow down to the knowledge worker. Wealth \n     will come less from natural resources or even capital, \n     because capital will follow knowledge. Microsoft--whoever \n     heard of it ten years ago? Now it's one of the biggest \n     companies in the world.\n       In such an economy, the knowledge workers--those who write \n     the software programs, design the hardware, anticipate the \n     new linkages of information networks--have enormous \n     opportunity to effect change. If the brightest talent recoils \n     from working for a corporation that pollutes, ignores it \n     community or mistreats its laid-off employees, then the \n     corporation will suffer because it won't attract the \n     knowledge talent that it needs to raise the capital for its \n     growth. As a group, knowledge workers potentially possess \n     more power than industrial robber barons, natural resource \n     magnates or international financiers of previous eras.\n       In a way, this offers the potential for a creative use of \n     market power. If public policy objectives--clean environment, \n     a diverse workforce, more sensitivity to the human needs of \n     longtime employees--can be carried out by the market, results \n     will be longer lasting. People can then do well economically \n     and do good socially at the same time.\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\n     In my own Senate career, tax reform, which eliminated \n     loopholes for the few while lowering rates for all Americans, \n     allowed equal incomes to pay about equal tax at the same time \n     the market functioned better. Reducing the subsidy for \n     irrigated agriculture in California benefitted urban and \n     environmental users by making them, given the functioning of \n     a more open water market, more likely to obtain water for \n     California's long-range non-agricultural needs. In both \n     cases, it was a matter not of subsidizing a desired objective \n     but of removing the subsidy for the activity that had come to \n     have a distorting impact on the whole community. Central to \n     achieving a better world through the market is removing \n     subsidies from everything except those ways of thinking which \n     are themselves not susceptible to economic calculation. How \n     much is wilderness worth? How do we determine the economic \n     value of a health democracy or racial harmony? How long will \n     the hard pressed middle class believe in the American dream? \n     These are the areas where public power, not the market, play \n     the decisive role.\n       Again, I thank you for this award. Harry Truman was a \n     leader of candor and courage with a common touch and a \n     determination to serve all the people. The challenge to our \n     future is to recognize, as Truman did, that well-exercised \n     public power can benefit individuals and, as I sense, that in \n     the new economy, information can be a tool that allows the \n     market to serve ethics other than just the economic. This \n     combination of the use of public power and the understanding \n     that a market can do good socially at the same time it does \n     well economically can build a more stable, more prosperous, \n     more humane, more democratic America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          The Subject of Race\n\n                       (by Senator Bill Bradley)\n\n       Tonight, I want to talk about an issue of American \n     political life about which there is endless talk dealing with \n     surfaces, and very little movement deep down in the body \n     politic. Unless faced, it will prevent us from realizing our \n     potential as a pluralistic democracy with a growing economy \n     and instead it will foster a poisonous resentment, even a \n     hatred that kills much of life's joy. The subject is race.\n       Frequently, we Americans have been unable to see deeper \n     than skin color or eye shape to the heart and individuality \n     of all our fellow Americans. There were times when we allowed \n     destructive impulses to triumph over our deeper awareness \n     that we are all God's children. Occasionally, the violence of \n     the few elicited the fears and seething anger of the many and \n     prevented the possibility of racial harmony. It's an old \n     story, and a sad one, too. Let me tell you a story.\n       In 1963, four young African American girls in white dresses \n     were talking prior to Sunday services in the ladies lounge of \n     the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. \n     Suddenly, the church was ripped apart by a bomb which killed \n     the young girls instantly. There had been other bombings in \n     Birmingham aimed at halting blacks' progress toward racial \n     equality but they had not penetrated the national \n     consciousness. After that Sunday's explosion, people of all \n     races and all political persuasions throughout the country \n     were sickened in spirit. Coming eighteen days after Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr. had shared his dream for America from \n     the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the bombing was a stark \n     reminder of how violently some Americans resisted racial \n     healing. Yet the sense of multiracial outrage and solidarity \n     that came out of this tragedy, combined with the seminal \n     leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, led to the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, and to the hope that the search for \n     racial equality could lead to the emergence of a spiritually \n     transformed America.\n       In the summer of 1964 I was a student intern in Washington. \n     I remember being in the Senate chamber the night the Civil \n     Rights bill passed, the one that de-segregated restaurants, \n     hotels, and other accommodations. I watched the vote and \n     thought, Something happened in the chamber tonight that makes \n     America a better place. To be honest, that was the night that \n     the idea of being a U.S. Senator first occurred to me. I \n     thought, Maybe someday I can be in the U.S. Senate too and \n     make America a better place.\n       As I recently recalled that summer of 1964, I was reminded \n     that slavery was our original sin. Race remains our \n     unresolved dilemma, and today, the bombers are back. From an \n     urban church in Knoxville, Tennessee, to countless rural \n     churches in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Texas, North \n     Carolina, and Alabama, the flames of arson and the hatreds of \n     racism burn again.\n       On the narrow subject of burning churches, there has been \n     rare bipartisan outrage. Conservative Republican Senator \n     Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina said last week on the \n     Senate floor that, ``if we in Congress cannot agree that \n     church burning is a despicable crime, what can we agree on? \n     It's not a matter of liberals, conservatives, blacks, whites; \n     it is about justice, faith, right, wrong.'' And he and \n     Senator Ted Kennedy introduced a bill to toughen the laws \n     against church arson.\n       Well-meaning whites have also stepped forward to help \n     rebuild churches. The National Council of Churches and the \n     Anti-Defamation League have established national rebuilding \n     funds. Eight foundations have announced grants totaling $2.5 \n     million to the National Council of Churches burned churches \n     fund. Habitat for Humanity is coordinating the labor of \n     volunteers who want to rebuild. Teams of Mennonites and \n     Quakers are rebuilding churches in Alabama. Raytheon, E-\n     Systems and AT have pledged $50,000 each to rebuild burned \n     churches in Greenville, Texas. Friendship Baptist Church and \n     Canaan AME in Columbia, Tennessee were repaired so quickly, \n     with the aid of local whites, that no services were missed. \n     Hundreds of callers to a Dallas radio station spontaneously \n     offered money to help. The conservative Christian Coalition, \n     which met with African American church leaders on Wednesday, \n     pledged to raise $1 million to help rebuild. It is also \n     making money available for motion detectors, alarms, \n     floodlights, and smoke detectors for rural churches that are \n     most vulnerable to arson attacks. The National Trust for \n     Historic Preservation has announced a campaign to provide \n     financial and technical support to more than two dozen \n     African American churches hit by arson attacks. Nations Bank \n     posted a $500,000 reward for information leading to the \n     arrest and conviction of people responsible for the attacks. \n     The Southern Baptists pledged $300,000 at their annual \n     convention last week to assist in the rebuilding effort. On \n     Wednesday, the Laborers' International Union of North America \n     announced that it will rebuild Sweet Home Baptist Church in \n     Baker, Louisiana.\n       But beyond deploring, rebuilding, toughening laws and \n     rewarding informants, what can you do? Well, you can look \n     deeper into the soul of America. You can be aware of the \n     context in which these acts are taking place. You can be \n     alert to emerging connections among white supremacist groups \n     dedicated to racial violence. You can ponder whether you see \n     your own reflection in the pool of indifference that has \n     surrounded racial healing for much of the last 15 years in \n     America.\n       Let's start with who is committing the burnings. The \n     Washington Post has said that the perpetrators are \n     disproportionately young white males who, although some come \n     from the right side of the tracks, are more often \n     economically marginalized and poorly educated. These are the \n     children of the economic transformation and the products of a \n     television culture surfeited with instant gratification and \n     quick thrill violence. They are the sons of families who have \n     forgotten the power of love.\n       For twenty years, wages have been stagnant for 70 percent \n     of the workers in America. In 1973, production, non-\n     supervisory wages were $315 per week; by 1994 they fell to \n     $256, which confirms what most Americans know: They're \n     working harder for less, living two paychecks away from \n     falling out of the middle class. No matter how many jobs they \n     work, they can never put away enough to guarantee their \n     children a college education. With less in wages, both \n     parents have to work. Forty percent of the kids live in homes \n     in which both parents work. Add to that the 25% of the kids \n     who live with a single parent and that means that for 65% of \n     the kids there are often resource and time deficits between \n     parent and child.\n       Now comes economic downsizing where hundreds of thousands, \n     no matter how hard they work, have lost their jobs. The \n     economic transformation has made them redundant. Three \n     hundred people in a credit department are replaced by four \n     computer workstations; two hundred people in Accounts \n     Receivable are bumped by two computer workstations. The heavy \n     footsteps of downsizing, relocation, part-time jobs, temp \n     jobs, middle age without health care and retirement without a \n     pension may be near or still distant, but they are heard in \n     every home. And for the children of families that have lived \n     through stagnant wages and downsizing, their future seems \n     even more uncertain. A decade ago they were called latch-key \n     kids, and now too many of them call themselves skinheads. The \n     idea that working hard can lead to a secure future, a chance \n     to provide for a better life for their children and an \n     adequate retirement, is slipping away. In its place comes the \n     quick fix of drugs and the quick thrill of violence. Add to \n     this the need for a high quality education in order to get \n     good jobs in the future and the absence of parental savings \n     to pay for that education, and for many millions of young \n     people, their future seems bleak.\n       Racism breeds among the poorly educated and economically \n     marginalized. They don't see the deeper forces at work in the \n     economy. They don't sense the self-interest in greater \n     tolerance. They can't see the joy in brotherhood and can't \n     escape the prison of ingrained racial attitudes. Instead, \n     they focus on a scapegoat as the cause of the predicament. \n     ``It's aways the other guy's fault,'' becomes their theme \n     song, and the scapegoat often becomes the ``the other''--\n     someone who looks different from them. In a world where \n     politics doesn't adequately address the economic \n     realities, fears can accelerate and demagogues can arise \n     to manipulate those fears for their own ends.\n       Take affirmative action. Whether you're for it or against \n     it, keep the numbers in mind. More white Americans lost their \n     jobs in the 1982 recession because of terrible national \n     economic mismanagement than lost their jobs to all the court-\n     ordered affirmative action since its inception. The young \n     white who feels that every time he doesn't get a job it's \n     been taken by a black simply doesn't know the numbers. And \n     politicians or talk show hosts who perpetrate and promote \n     that overreaction are similar to the person who throws a \n     match on a pile of oily rags.\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\n       Likewise, take poverty. There are thirty-six million people \n     in poverty in America: Ten million are black; twenty-six \n     million are white. But many young whites oppose government \n     helping the poor because it means government helping blacks, \n     not realizing that, given their education levels and job \n     prospects, their opposition is often self-destructive.\n       In a world where people don't see the underlying forces--\n     the economic transformation, the TV culture, the marginal \n     numbers affected by affirmative action, the racial structure \n     of poverty--too many people take aim at blacks or immigrants \n     as the cause of their economic distress. But the seven \n     thousand downsized workers at AT who've lost their jobs in \n     the last six months in New Jersey did not lose their jobs \n     because of immigrants or because of blacks, but because the \n     company, acting rationally in a time of rapid change, could \n     maximize profits by letting them go. When people feel \n     desperate, they reach for the extremes that in good times \n     they would steer away from. And when they live in the \n     extremes, violence can be an action of first resort.\n       What can we do about the context of church burnings beyond \n     having more economic growth more fairly shared and an \n     education system that teaches tolerance as well as \n     trigonometry?\n       Let's start with what politicians can do. Too often, white \n     politicians have played the ``race card'' to get votes but, \n     to be honest, too often, black politicians have played the \n     ``racist'' card for the same reason. What has suffered is \n     honest dialogue and common action. We need more candor and \n     more voice from elected leaders who will choose to challenge \n     their constituents morally as well as challenge their \n     contributors financially. But without engagement you can't \n     have candor, and without candor you can't have progress. When \n     was the last time you talked about race with someone of a \n     different race? Although I'm leaving the Senate, I'm not \n     leaving public life and I intend to continue to speak out on \n     the need for racial healing. I'll look constantly for ways to \n     move the dialogue about race to a deeper level, as yet \n     unattained. For example, at the Democratic political \n     convention, I'll seek to demonstrate what is possible, and \n     I'll call on good people in both parties to step forward in \n     this time of confusion and rising tensions. Politicians have \n     the obligation to play to our higher aspirations as LBJ did \n     back in 1964.\n       Talk show hosts also have some responsibility. While some \n     of you can be divisive, and maybe even racist, most of you \n     are not. My appeal is only to remember the paradox of free \n     speech: it can be the nutrient that allows the tree of \n     democracy to grow strong, but if misused, it can burn the \n     roots and deform the tree in ways no one ever expected. \n     Civility is the key and avoidance of the easy appeal to \n     stereotypes should be what you strive for. Remember there was \n     once a time in America when an audience laughed simply at the \n     appearance of a white actor in black face. Now we recognize \n     that we are a better people than that. The potential of \n     confusion is too great for those with the microphones not to \n     promote a deeper dialogue on race. The misunderstandings are \n     too deep for you not to search the heart as well as find the \n     pulse of your audience. I know it's asking a lot, but then so \n     do the ideals of our founders.\n       As a way of thinking about our responsibilities to each \n     other let me close by asking you first to imagine that you \n     are a black parent of a nine year-old girl, and then imagine \n     that you are a white parent of a nine year-old son. A church \n     bombing has occurred in your church or in your town. What \n     does one say?\n       What answer does a church member give to his 9 year old \n     African American daughter when she asks, ``Daddy, why did \n     this happen?'' What can one say to a daughter who has written \n     her school paper on Colin Powell, taken pride in American \n     having a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, grown up eating \n     Jell-O because of Bill Cosby and watched Michael Jordan \n     become a worldwide marketing phenomenon. In a world where so \n     much progress had been made, how could one explain the \n     phenomenon of burning churches?\n       And what about the white parent? What does he say to his 9 \n     year-old son? How can he explain the phenomenon of the \n     skinheads, bold Ku Klux Klanners or the new Nazi SS clubs in \n     high schools? How can he explain why blacks and whites can't \n     get along in life like they appear to get along on the \n     Chicago Bulls. What does he say about the burnings?\n       I imagine the black parent saying something like this to \n     his daughter: ``There is evil in the world, and there are \n     some people who, because of the color of your skin, do not \n     view you as an equal member of society. These people have a \n     problem, and the problem is called racism. There were black \n     and white people who, decades ago, died so that black people \n     could enjoy equal opportunities with white people in America. \n     America is a much better place with respect to the way that \n     black people and white people interact than it was black when \n     brave Americans suffered to bring about equality.\n       ``Racism is an evil and a sickness. You have the physical \n     and intellectual capacities to achieve whatever you want to \n     achieve, to be the best you can be. Look at Colin Powell, \n     Toni Morrison, Cornel West. The people who burned this church \n     are afraid of you; they are afraid to learn about you and \n     interact with you. You must not be afraid of them. You must \n     pray for them and ask God to forgive them. You must use your \n     talents to achieve greatness in life, and you must work in \n     your lifetime to help bridge the racial divide.\n       ``Finally, try to understand what a great African-American \n     writer James Baldwin once said in 1957 to his young nephew \n     who was afraid of racial violence during the civil rights \n     demonstrations of the early `60s--He said, `it was intended \n     that you should perish in the ghetto, perish by never being \n     allowed to go behind the white man's definitions, by never \n     being allowed to spell your proper name. You have and many of \n     us have defeated this intention; and, by a terrible law, a \n     terrible paradox, those innocents who believed that your \n     imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp on \n     reality. But these men are your brothers--your lost, younger \n     brothers. And if the word ``integration'' means anything, \n     this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our \n     brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from \n     reality and begin to change it. For this is your home, my \n     friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great \n     things here, and will again, and we can make America what \n     America must become.'''\n       And what should a white parent tell his 9-year-old son \n     about these church burnings? I imagine he would say something \n     like this: ``The burning of the African American church \n     outside our town is a product of racism and hatred. Racism \n     occurs when people of one race feel themselves to be superior \n     to those of another race for no other reason than the color \n     of the skin. I know that sounds like a stupid thing to do, \n     but this country has had a sad history of doing it. African \n     Americans, Native Americans and Asian Americans, among \n     others, have suffered because of it. It is important for you \n     to know that racism is everyone's problem, both white and \n     black. It's the kind of problem that no one else can solve \n     for you. Like any other illness, you have to get over it \n     yourself with your own resources as a good human being \n     fighting it off. Racism is something that a person learns; it \n     is not something that people are born with. That's why I \n     punished you the first time you came home from school \n     disparaging someone because of their race. Where racism \n     exists, both black people and white people are harmed. Where \n     it exists, white people cannot develop their full potential \n     as individuals. To harbor racism in your heart is to deny \n     yourself the experience of learning from someone a little \n     different from you. And it makes you unable to share the joy \n     of our common humanity.\n       ``A the church burnings reveal, just as they revealed in \n     the story I once told you about the four young girls in \n     Birmingham in 1963, racism is ugly and evil, and God does not \n     like evil. Sometimes, racism comes from black people who call \n     us devils and deny our individuality as much as some white \n     people deny theirs. Whether it comes from white or black it \n     is wrong, and violen is never acceptable. Remember what Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr. said, `Returning violence for \n     violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a \n     night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out \n     darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; \n     only love can do that.'\n       ``I am going to volunteer to go and help rebuild the church \n     that was burned. I want you to come with me. I want you to \n     bring Charlie, one of your black friends from school. I want \n     you to work side by side with Charlie, with me, and with \n     other blacks and whites who want to build a country that is \n     compassionate and that treats all of its people with dignity \n     and respect. I want you to treat everyone with respect, and I \n     want you to work in your lifetime to bridge the racial \n     divide.\n       ``A Russian writer named Leo Tolstoy once said, ``many \n     people want to change the world; only a few people want to \n     change themselves,'' but with race you can't change the world \n     unless you change yourself.''\n       And, I might add, that's as true for politicians as for \n     talk show hosts. And when enough Americans change themselves, \n     we will have true racial healing and then the result will be \n     a spiritually transformed America.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed in morning business for 15 minutes. I see other Senators are \non the floor here, and if that is inconvenient to them, I will ask for \na shorter period of time. Let me just place the unanimous-consent \nrequest, and they can feel free to state a problem, if they have it.

Mr. President, it is time to say farewell to a number of \nour colleagues and friends. These are not easy good byes. I have served \nwith many of our departing colleagues since I first came to the Senate \nin 1978. We were freshmen together, had to learn the ropes as new kids \non the block together. That process of learning and\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\ngrowing together builds friendships and bonds that are deep and \nenduring.\n  The Senators who are retiring, Mr. President, are each individuals \nwho have given a significant portion of their lives to public service. \nCynicism has grown about Congress as an institution. Many, perhaps \nmost, believe that Members of Congress act out of selfish motives. \nThese departing Senators are a testament to the error of that belief.\n  I do not believe one of these Members, Mr. President, would prefer a \nreception on the Hill to an evening at home or an opportunity to read \nto their grandchild or shoot hoops with their teenagers or take a walk \nin a park with a friend. Most Members would rather have a homemade pot \nroast than fancy hors d'oeuvres at a reception. Why do they do what \nthey do? Why do they work the long hours, take the redeye flights, miss \nthe family celebrations? Because it is part of being available to our \nconstituents, it is part of being a representative of the people of our \nStates, and it is part of being a public servant. It is part of being a \nU.S. Senator.\n  Every one of these departing Members has worked long hours, has \nmissed special family occasions, has flown when they have been so tired \nthat they have had to rely on their schedule to tell them where they \nare and where they are supposed to go. Every one of them has had to \npush themselves at times to go to that one additional meeting, to take \nthat one additional phone call, to read one more report in order to get \na bill passed or an amendment adopted. They have worked to make America \nstronger, our people free, keep Government working at a better rate and \na more efficient rate and at less cost. They have had different paths \nto that end, but their goals, like all of our goals, are fundamentally \nthe same.\n  It is with a sense of real kinship and of great loss that I say \nfarewell, as we all do, then to Senators Pryor, Exon, Simpson, Simon, \nKassebaum, Heflin, Pell, Bradley, Johnston, Brown, Frahm, and last but \nnot least, Senator Hatfield.\n  About a week ago I gave separate remarks about my ranking member and \nmy chairman both, Senator Bill Cohen of Maine.\n\n\n                             Senator Pryor\n\n  David Pryor and I both came to the Senate in 1978 and served for most \nof the time on the Governmental Affairs Committee. During that service \non the committee, Dave Pryor aggressively and perceptively challenged \nthe Department of Defense on some of its questionable weapons systems \nand procurement practices. He dogged the Federal agencies to stop the \nexcessive use of consultants at taxpayer expense and he diligently \noversaw the workings of the Postal Service and the Federal work force.\n  He and I worked in our early years on a taxpayers' bill of rights to \nfinally give taxpayers, who were being audited, hounded by the IRS, \nnotice of what their rights were as American citizens.\n  His persistence paid off and that bill of rights is now law, mainly \nbecause of David Pryor.\n  As chairman of the Aging Committee, he fought price gouging by the \npharmaceutical companies and pushed legislation to make drug companies \ngive their most favorable prices to Medicare and Medicaid recipients.\n  David did all of this with grace and charm. He made this institution \na better place because of his presence. He is a man of common sense and \nthe common touch. He was able to stay on an even keel despite the \npersonalities and the pressures. He continually reminded us of our \npurpose and place and gently helped to keep our egos in check.\n  Perhaps the most telling characteristic of David Pryor is his genuine \ncommitment to average men and women with whom he deals and works. He \nknows the name of everyone, from the Capitol Police who protect the \nCapitol and its occupants, to the men and women who serve us lunch on \nTuesday. His connection to average people is not a political statement. \nIt is personal, genuine human behavior.\n  He exudes kindness and decency whether he's asking about a personal \nfamily member who might have been sick or remembers an incident in \nsomeone's life that may have caused pain. He does so not from political \ncalculation or from a computer disk which has stored information, but \nbecause that is the way David Pryor is.\n  His wife, Barbara, has been a source of inestimable strength. Barbara \nPryor, my wife Barbara, David and I have become genuine friends over \nthe years and we look forward being with them many, many times in the \nyears ahead.\n  David Pryor has served the people of Arkansas and this great Nation \nwith extraordinary distinction. He will leave a large void \nprofessionally and personally. May his spirit continue to soar and he \nand his family be in good health as he returns to his beloved Arkansas.\n\n\n                              SENATOR EXON\n\n  Mr. President, I have sat next to Senator Jim Exon on the Armed \nServices Committee for 18 years. Another member of the class of 1978, \nJim has become one of my truly dear friends. We have shared more than \nadjoining seats. We have been comrades-in-arms even in those instances \nwhen we were on different sides of an issue. He is a straight-from-the-\nshoulder, tell-it-like-if-is kind of guy who uses plain talk but no \nmalice, although he was at times frustrated by endless twists and turns \nand minutiae of the legislative process.\n  As a former governor of Nebraska, Jim demonstrated a knack of stating \nissues simply and directly. His conservative approach to the budget was \napplied consistently, and he was willing to take difficult stands on \nspending issues because of the genuineness of his beliefs.\n  These 18 years have been marked by true personal kindness to me and \ndeep mutual friendship. He is famous for dropping a friendly or \nhumorous note to colleagues to reduce the tension and keep us on track. \nHe has a raucous, wonderful laugh which frequently fill, committee \nrooms with a reminder of our own humanity. And he would often bring us \ndown to earth with an irreverent, but totally appropriate comment.\n  Jim Exon seems totally content to return to his beloved Pat, his \nchildren and grandchildren, and he has a right to be content after \nthree notable terms in the Senate.\n\n\n                            SENATOR SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. President, Al Simpson also came to the Senate with me in 1978 and \nimmediately Al and Ann, his wife, became two of Barbara's and my best \nfriends in the Senate. Simply stated, he has one of the best sense of \nhumor in the Senate. I often thing he's such a special Senator because \nhe spent 1 year, before entering college, at Cranbrook School in \nMichigan. He claims, however, it's all the other years he spent in the \ncowboy State of Wyoming.\n  Whatever the reason, Al Simpson has applied the principles that he \nlives by with tremendous integrity and consistency, even when \npolitically unwise or risky. He has taken on some of the strongest \ninterest groups in the Nation and he has done so without fear. He has \ntaken on some of the toughest issues with his work on immigration and \nentitlement programs.\n  He has a deep sense of the limitations and fallibility that we \nnecessarily bring to the legislative process. He punctures balloons and \nskewers egos; but he is the first to apologize when he thinks he has \noverdone it.\n  You can listen to Al Simpson tell a story for the 20th time, and like \nwine, it gets better each time. He too has mellowed a bit over the \nyears, but his sharp wit and genuine, love for his colleagues has \nremained undiminished.\n  For his beloved state of Wyoming, Al Simpson has been a dedicated \npublic servant. He is a big and wide open as Wyoming. He is full of \nlife and full of fun. He is a giant of a man, and a giant of a Senator, \nand a giant of a friend.\n\n\n                             senator simon\n\n  Mr. President, another gentle and positive force in this body will be \nleaving us with retirement of Senator Paul Simon. Paul and Jean, his \nwife, reflect the best values of this Nation. Their public service over \nthe decades has made our country a better place.\n  Education has been one of Paul's keen interests, and he has thrown \nhimself into the creation of education opportunity for all Americans. \nHe was a lead sponsor of the 1994 education bill which established the \nimportant school-to-work program for non-college bound high school \nstudents. He was the moving force in the Senate for direct student \nloans. He has been a leader in\n\n[[Page S12254]]\n\nfighting violence on television and in the movies.\n  Paul is invariably decent and kind and a real gentleman. His manner \nof debate and his personal relationships have lifted the tone of the \nSenate and helped to preserve its decoum, often in the face of great \nodds. When Paul Simon comes to the floor to speak on a subject, people \nlisten because of the simple, direct, and honest way he makes his case.\n  He is slow to anger and quick to understand, and he is as considerate \nas they come. The people of Illinois and this Nation have been well-\nserved by Paul's presence in this body. May he never run out of bow \nties.\n\n\n                           senator kassebaum\n\n  Mr. President, it is with real regret that I say goodbye to our dear \ncolleague from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. Another member of the class of \n1978, Nancy has made her mark in both foreign affairs and on the Labor \nand Education Committee. Nancy doesn't fit into anybody's mold or \nlabel. She is one of a kind.\n  She was a leader in the fight for economic sanctions against South \nAfrica and was prescient in her opposition to $700 million in credit \nguarantees for Iraq before the Persian Gulf war. She has wrestled with \ninnovative ways to make Federal programs more efficient and effective, \nand whether or not you agree or disagree with her on an issue, you \nrespect her motives and her commitment.\n  She has been able to bridge differences of party and ideology to \ndevelop bipartisan approaches to solving problems. Her major \naccomplishment this year with the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum \nhealth-care bill epitomizes her ability to do what it takes to help \npeople better lives.\n  Nancy's gentle, kind demeanor has been so important to her \nachievements and to the daily life of the Senate family. Kansas has \nbeen lucky to have her as their Representative in the Senate and the \nmillions of workers now with portable health care were lucky she cared \nso deeply about their lives.\n\n\n                             senator heflin\n\n  Mr. President, another member of the class of 1978 is Howell Heflin. \nLooking ever the part of the ``country judge'', Howell has played an \nimportant role in the life of the Senate. His careful attention to the \nfacts, his thoughtful analysis, his methodical to an issue, have been \nthe very elements needed in this body we all should like to remain the \nworld's most deliberative body. He has taken on some of the more \nthankless tasks in the Senate, including the arcane issues involving \nbankruptcy and administrative practice. We will all miss his expertise \nand diligence.\n  Senator Heflin leaves behind a distinguished career as a public \nservant--serving 6 years as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court \nand 18 years as a U.S. Senator. He has proudly and diligently \nrepresented the people of Alabama--calling the shots as he sees them \nand doing what he thinks is about for his constituents. We need the \njudicial, detailed approach of Howell Heflin in the Senate. My wife, \nBarbara, and I have enjoyed our friendship with Howell and his wife, \nMike. We wish him well in his retirement. It is well-deserved, for a \nvery, very, special Member of this body.\n\n\n                            senator bradley\n\n  Mr. President, about 15 years ago, I was riding in Bill Bradley's car \ncoming back from a speaking engagement in Baltimore. Surprisingly, the \ncar was a small, compact car. I say surprisingly, because the car was \nBradley's and he is not a small person. But cramped in this small car, \nwe were chatting about various issues we were working on and Bill \nmentioned the tax system. I was struck by the size of the problem he \nwas willing to tackle, the thoughtfulness of his comments, and the \nambition of his plan. That was the first I had heard of what later was \nto become the 1986 tax reform legislation. That's part of the legacy \nthat Senator Bradley leaves behind--tackling issues head-on regardless \nof size and asking the big questions.\n  Bill Bradley has addressed some of the most pressing issues of our \ntime--racial disparity, urban decay, how to achieve a civil society. If \nthis were Plato's Republic, Bill Bradley would be one of the \nphilosopher kings.\n  Another member of the class of 1978, we will miss his clear and \noriginal thinking, his willingness to take on the big issues, his \ncommitment to building bridges among the diverse ethnic and interest \ngroups in this country. I hope Bill stays in the political dialogue so \nwe can benefit from his thoughts and ideas.\n  He and his wife, Ernestine, will both be missed by my wife and me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12252-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12254-S12256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Sam Nunn leaves this institution, he is \ngoing to be leaving a very, very large hole. He is a person of special \nintegrity, intelligence, and independence.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1979, I was assigned to the same three \ncommittees on which Sam Nunn served, and I have been with him on those \nthree committees ever since: Armed Services, Governmental Affairs, and \nSmall Business.\n  In Sam Nunn's 24 years of public service as a Senator, he has \ncompiled an extraordinary legislative record. He has had a major \ninfluence on national security issues, he has cast over 10,000 votes, \nand he has established a rock-solid standard for bipartisanship that is \nthe envy of his colleagues.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sam was a passionate \nadvocate for a bipartisan approach to foreign policy, and as a Senator \nfrom Michigan, I can see the spirit of one of Michigan's great \nSenators, Arthur Vandenberg, reflected in Sam Nunn's approach.\n  Mr. President, I want to describe a few of the key defense and \nforeign policy issues on which Sam Nunn was the leader, and for which \nhe will undoubtedly be remembered. He was the godfather of the \nDepartment of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, more often known as \n``Goldwater-Nichols''. This seminal piece of legislation helped the \nPentagon to organize our military forces in a very effective manner \nthat emphasizes the central role of the theater commanders--the \ncommanders who actually command our forces in war--as well as the \ncritical need for our military services to work together jointly as a \nsingle team to accomplish their missions.\n  Our military has often been commended for their extraordinary \nperformance in the Persian Gulf war, and rightly so. But we should also \nrecognize that it was the Goldwater-Nichols legislation that Sam Nunn \nhelped put in place which assured our military was properly organized \nand prepared for that war. Sam Nunn has worked tirelessly to assure \nthat the idea of joint cooperation that makes our military so effective \nis now ingrained as a core value throughout the military. For this, our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude.\n  Sam Nunn took a deep interest in United States-Soviet relations and \nNATO-Warsaw Pact relations during the last decade of the cold war, and \nhelped to ensure that this dangerous ideological confrontation ended \npeacefully. He recognized the unique opportunity to turn this moment of \nhistory into a positive benefit for United States and international \nsecurity.\n  After the end of the cold war, Sam Nunn saw clearly that our security \nwas enhanced by the political developments in Eastern Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union. He helped assure that we seized the opportunity to \nhelp the emerging democracies in Europe, and to foster democratization \nand stability. Perhaps the most concrete evidence of his efforts is the \nNunn-Lugar program for cooperative threat reduction. This landmark \nlegislation took advantage of the opening in United States-Russian \nrelations and has advanced our security in a major way.\n  Sam Nunn helped put into practice what now seems common sense: It is \neasier, cheaper, and more effective to cooperate with the former Soviet \nUnion to reduce threats to each other than it is to seek security by \nmutual threat. The Nunn-Lugar program has permitted the elimination of \nhundreds of former Soviet nuclear weapons that used to be pointed at \nus, and has been instrumental in helping make three former Soviet \nRepublics nuclear-free. That is a real, tangible reduction to the \nthreat from former Soviet nuclear weapons. The Nunn-Lugar program is \nstill in progress and still improving our security.\n\n[[Page S12255]]\n\n  Sam Nunn has also been an unequalled leader on preserving the \nsecurity benefits of the United States-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile \n[ABM] Treaty, which has permitted the United States and former Soviet \nUnion to reduce our nuclear forces significantly since the mid-1980's, \nincluding the START I and START II Treaties. When fully implemented, \nthese two treaties will reduce former Soviet nuclear weapons by two-\nthirds from the level at the beginning of the 1990's. Thousands of \nnuclear weapons are being dismantled and will never threaten the United \nStates again.\n  So it is crucial that we not undermine the ABM Treaty, because that \nwas, and still is, the foundation upon which these critical nuclear \nweapon reductions are taking place. Sam has had to defend and preserve \nthe ABM Treaty against many opponents, whether they sought to \nreinterpret its provisions, to undermine it or to kill it outright. \nFortunately for our Nation, he has done an extraordinary job.\n  Sam Nunn has focused on the future threats to our Nation, as well as \nthe cold war threats he helped to reduce so effectively, and has come \nup with very pragmatic and constructive steps to address those threats. \nStarting last year, he led the Governmental Affairs Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations on a rigorous examination of the threat \nof chemical, biological and nuclear terrorism, and our national \npreparedness to meet that threat.\n  He chaired a series of more than five hearings that demonstrated the \nseriousness of the threat of terrorists using weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the fact that we are simply not prepared to handle \nsuch a crisis. Imagine if the World Trade Center bombing had been a \nchemical weapon attack.\n  Taking the chilling evidence from these hearings, Senator Nunn \ninitiated new legislation designed to reduce the risk of such terrorism \nand to improve our defenses against such potential attacks. He joined \nforces with Senator Lugar again, his partner from the original Nunn-\nLugar program, and Senator Domenici to sponsor legislation that was \nsupported without a single opposing vote in the Senate. That is the \nkind of bipartisan support that Sam Nunn commands. This legislation is \na badly needed step toward reducing the threat of terrorists using \nweapons of mass destruction against our Nation.\n  And finally, Mr. President, we should remember that when the \nsituation in Haiti was reaching a crisis point, and the military \nleaders were reluctant to step down, it was Sam Nunn who personally \nwent to Haiti, with Jimmy Carter and Colin Powell, to convince the \nHaitian military leaders to turn over power peacefully to Aristide. And \nalthough he succeeded in his mission, it was at some personal risk \nbecause while he was still negotiating with the Haitian military, our \nmilitary planes were already on their way to Haiti to launch a military \noperation to force the military to step aside and return Aristide to \npower.\n  There was no guarantee that Senator Nunn would not be caught in the \nmiddle of a fight and, along with former President Carter and \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, be exposed \nto the risk of violence and chaos. So in the interest of pursuing \nstability and a peaceful transition of Government in Haiti, Sam Nunn \nwas willing to put himself at considerable personal risk. In the end, \nhe helped avert the need for a forceable U.S. military operation, which \nundoubtedly saved lives of U.S. military personnel.\n\n  Although not every Member agreed with him--or each other--on every \nissue, he was the undisputed master at bringing us together in \nagreement on bipartisan Defense bills.\n  As my colleagues on the committee will recount, this was rarely an \neasy feat. We were wrestling with some of the most controversial, \nconsequential, and complicated legislation of the last decade. And yet, \nthrough it all, year after year, Sam Nunn crafted bipartisan Defense \nauthorization bills that promoted our Nation's security and our Armed \nForces.\n  It is often difficult to stand up against the majority of one's own \nparty, but Sam Nunn did this when he felt it was necessary to advance \nthe cause of American security. He stood in the same shoes that Richard \nRussell filled so well. And were Richard Russell here today, he would \nsay to Sam Nunn, ``Well done, American patriot. You have faithfully \nserved your country, America is stronger and the world is safer because \nyou came along.''\n  I also want to thank Senator Nunn for his very kind words the other \nday about our service together on the Armed Services Committee and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. In his remarks he referred to the times \nin conference on the DOD bill when he would deputize me to resolve a \nHouse-Senate dispute. He was complimenting me on usually getting a \nreasonable outcome for the Senate position. What he was too modest to \nreveal, was that it wasn't my talent that got results. I would go into \nthose meetings at Nunn's request and when the going got rough, I would \nforce the agreement by threatening to bring in Sam.\n  I also had the good fortune to work with Senator Nunn on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. As chairman and ranking Democrat on the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Sam Nunn has left his stamp \non major investigations. Under Nunn's leadership PSI, as we call it, \ndisclosed massive management problems and wasteful spending in health \ninsurance companies; the serious and unresolved threats to our Nation \nas a result of insecure computer systems in DOD, other Federal agencies \nand private companies; the threats of black market trading of nuclear \nmaterials; vulnerabilities of our student loan programs, and a host of \nlaw enforcement challenges and problems. He has been a dogged \ninvestigator.\n  Sam and his wife, Colleen, will now begin a new chapter in their \nlives and hopefully will get some well-deserved time to themselves and \nwith their family. All of us have come to rely on him on so many \nnational security issues. We will surely miss the opportunity, when we \ncome to the floor to vote on an amendment related to foreign policy or \nnational security to look for Sam to find out what his position is on \nthe issue. His strong legacy will require us in the future to consider \nthe factors he would have weighed, were he still with us, before we \nvote on issues that are important to the security of our Nation.\n\n\n                              senator pell\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Pell leaves us this year after 36 \nyears of service in the U.S. Senate. Only Senator Strom Thurmond and \nSenator Robert Byrd have served longer. Senator Pell has served with \ndistinction on both the Foreign Relations Committee and the Labor \nCommittee. Thousands of young people are in his debt as they move \nthrough college because of the availability of Pell grants.\n  In this current culture of negativism and attack ads, Senator Pell \nstands out as a man of civility and gentleness. He has a wonderful \ninability to say anything unkind or negative about a fellow human \nbeing. He is determined to be positive about his own views and never to \nattack another Member. He has helped to maintain the Senate as a family \ninstitution with bipartisanship, particularly in foreign policy, as an \noverriding goal.\n  I have also been able to personally observe his belief in and support \nfor multinational organizations as a way to move to a more peaceful \nworld and as a way to avoid America's becoming the world's policeman.\n  I have had the privilege of traveling with Senator Pell to the \nfarthest reaches of the world--including Tibet. And I know him to be a \nthoughtful, spiritual, caring man. His kindness and gentle ways will be \ndeeply missed by this body as he and Nuala take a well-deserved rest.\n\n\n                            senator johnston\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate will lose an intelligent, \ncapable, shrewd--and I use that term with respect and admiration--\nMember with the retirement of Bennett Johnston. I have been with \nBennett and opposed to Bennett and I can tell you it's much more \ncomfortable to be with Bennett.\n  Twenty-four years of service in the Senate have made Bennett one of \nthe most experienced legislators in this body. He is a man of can-do \nspirit and one who approaches every problem with a how-to-fix-it \nattitude. I had the opportunity to work with Bennett this Congress on \nregulatory reform. He sat on the floor day after day while that \nlegislation was pending taking on every problem, delving into every \nissue, trying to craft solutions to get\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\nthe legislation moving. He was dedicated to his task and willing to put \nin whatever time and effort it required. His ability to work long and \nhard was exceptional.\n  We didn't succeed on that legislation, but it wasn't for want of \neffort. The stars weren't aligned right to reach a final product. But \nin working with Bennett Johnston on that legislation and several \nCongress' ago on similar legislation which was called the Johnston \namendment, I was and continue to be impressed with Bennett's \nwillingness to listen to ideas and concerns and work as hard as anyone \nto address the problem. He's been a notable addition to the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n\n                             senator brown\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Hank Brown would be a welcome member in any \norganization or effort. He is thoughtful, kind, and honest. He is \nearnest in his concern for a Government that works, and he takes on the \nissues in which he believes.\n  To bridge the differences between the parties and develop bipartisan \napproaches to difficult problems, the Senate needs more Members like \nHank Brown. He leaves the Senate after only one term. A strong \nsupporter of term limits, Hank has lived by his creed. He has done so \nin many other ways and leaves with the respect of every Member of this \nbody.\n\n\n                          senator sheila frahm\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have had a very short time to come to \nknow Senator Sheila Frahm. Just this past June, she was appointed by \nGovernor Bill Graves of Kansas to serve the remainder of Senator Dole's \nterm. Joining the Senate in midterm is a very difficult thing to do. \nCommittees are in the midst of their work, the Senate is considering \nbills every day which have already had hearings and been reported by \nthe various committees, and the requirements of representing a State, \nits interests, and most importantly, its citizens in the U.S. Senate is \na big job which cannot await on-the-job training. Senator Frahm quickly \nimpressed all of her colleagues with her seriousness of purpose, her \nenergy, and her grace in meeting this difficult task.\n  I served with Senator Frahm on the Armed Services Committee where she \nwas attentive to the complex issues of national security. She \nestablished herself immediately as a hard worker who recognizes the \nimportance of our Nation's defense and the well-being of our Armed \nForces.\n  Although we have just begun to know Sheila Frahm, I know my \ncolleagues join me in saying that we will miss her friendly smile and \nher commonsense approach to the issues before us.\n\n\n                            senator hatfield\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, finally, it is with a mixed heart that I \nsay goodbye to Senator Mark Hatfield--mixed, because I am sad for the \nloss to the Senate and the people of this Nation but glad for Mark as \nhe approaches a time of much-deserved rest and rejuvenation.\n  As one of the most powerful Members of the Senate, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield has set a standard of \nhumility and decency that few have matched. He has been able to wield \ngreat power without vanity. Indeed, he has shown us that power can be \nexercised with grace and genuine compassion.\n  A World War II veteran, one who fought at Iwo Jima and entered \nHiroshima shortly after the bomb, Senator Hatfield has dedicated his \nlife to peace. His legacy is that of a legislative hero--bringing an \nend to nuclear weapons testing, protecting the valuable wilderness \nareas of his home State of Oregon, fighting for refugees across the \nglobe, and opposing needless but expensive weapons like the MX missile.\n  I've had two opportunities to work with Senator Hatfield in the last \nfew years. We have both had the privilege to serve on the FDR Memorial \nCommission, and we have worked together on legislation to allow for \ngreater flexibility in the implementation of Federal categorical grant \nprograms. In both cases, Mr. President, I have been able to observe \nSenator Hatfield's skill in and commitment to achieving bipartisan \nsolutions to problems. His role on the FDR Commission has been so \nvaluable that we were able to amend the statute creating the Commission \nin order to allow him to continue to serve in the year after he leaves \nthe Senate and so he can be present at the dedication next year as \ncochairman of the Commission. But for him and Dan Inouye, our other \ncochairman, the FDR Memorial would still be in the planning stage.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hatfield has been a fighter for the \nunderrepresented, for the compassionate use of the power of the Federal \nGovernment, and for greater efficiency and effectiveness. I \ncongratulate him on his most distinguished record of public service. We \nwill deeply miss his good judgment, his expertise, his decades of \nexperience, his wisdom, and his commitment to making Government work \nfor all the people, but most of all, his gentle manner.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12254-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12256-S12257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPENDENTS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly about the \nsigning into law this morning of the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents \nAssistance Act of 1996.\n  This is legislation to provide education and job training benefits to \nwidows or spouses of Federal law enforcement officers killed or \nrendered totally and permanently disabled--and their children--in the \nline of duty.\n  I introduced the legislation in the Senate following my chairing of \nthe Ruby Ridge hearings which resulted in the tragic death of Marshal \nDegan.\n  I am proud to wear today the U.S. Marshal's badge of Bill Degan which \nwas handed out at the signing ceremonies this morning.\n  Ruby Ridge was a great tragedy.\n  It involved the loss of three lives, all very valuable, and it cost \nthe life of Bill Degan. I have had the opportunity to sit and visit \nwith Mrs. Degan, his widow, and their two young sons, Bill, Jr., and \nBrian. Our meetings focused attention on the issue so that legislation \ncould be passed.\n  On the House side, companion legislation was introduced by my \ndistinguished colleagues, Congressman Jon Fox, from suburban \nPhiladelphia, and Congressman Gerry Studds, from Massachusetts. It \napplies to many law enforcement officers who have been tragically \nkilled, one of whom is FBI agent Chuck Reid, who was gunned down on \nMarch 22, 1996, just a few months ago, in arresting a drug suspect in \nPhiladelphia. It tells Federal law enforcement officers and their \nfamilies that the Government stands behind them, and if they are killed \nor totally and permanently disabled in the line of duty, we will \nprotect their spouses and their children. As we consider this matter \nfurther, it may be that similar benefits ought to be structured for law \nenforcement officers generally, for they represent the thin blue line \nwhich stands between the citizenry and violence in our streets, \nsomething in which I have had extensive experience as district attorney \nof Philadelphia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record \nfrom the Federal Investigators Association and Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association commending the Congress for this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Federal Investigators' Association,\n\n                              Carle Place, NY, September 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: As president of the Federal \n     Investigators' Association (FIA), a professional and \n     fraternal organization representing federal law enforcement \n     agents throughout the United States, I wish to thank you, on \n     behalf of our membership, for sponsoring Senate resolution \n     2101. Our Washington Director, Don Baldwin, happily reported \n     to me last week that the bill has passed both houses of \n     congress and is now awaiting the President's signature. We \n     understand that there is no opposition and that the bill will \n     be signed into law.\n       The Act will provide ``educational assistance to the \n     dependents of federal law enforcement officers killed or \n     disabled in the performance of their duties.'' We applaud\n\n[[Page S12257]]\n\n     your actions in the aid to federal officers, who can no \n     longer provide financial support to their families because of \n     injury or death resultant from tragedies occurring in their \n     work. The Act will relieve much of the stress which federal \n     law enforcement officers' families deal with because a brave \n     officer has lost his or her life or become disabled in the \n     line of duty.\n       I understand that you acted immediately upon learning of \n     the sad loss of federal officers at Ruby Ridge. You have done \n     a great service for our federal law enforcement officers and \n     their families, I am sure this will go a long way toward \n     boosting the morale of all agents.\n       I am sure that I speak for the thousands of federal law \n     enforcement officers and their dependents in thanking you for \n     the sponsorship of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  J.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the over 12,000 members \n     of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), \n     the largest association representing Federal criminal \n     investigators in the nation, I am pleased to inform you that \n     we fully support S. 1243, the ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Dependents Assistance Act of 1966.'' I Also want to thank you \n     for proposing this fine piece of legislation.\n       As you may already know, many states and local \n     municipalities currently have legislation which ensures that \n     the dependents of local officers killed or disabled in the \n     line of duty receive assistance towards education or job \n     training. Also, many local police agencies provide for the \n     continuing education of survivors under the same \n     circumstances. None of this exists at the Federal level. S. \n     1234 will correct this oversight regarding Federal law \n     enforcement officers.\n       If you or your staff wish to contact me please call 212-\n     637-6543.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Victor Oboyski,\n                                               National President.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, there are a number of items that are \nstill pending before the 104th Congress, one of which is legislation \nthat could combat the surge of what is characterized as date rape drugs \nin the United States.\n  I have been working on this matter for the better part of a year. \nThis scourge is growing in its use, particularly in the Southwest and \nEast--Louisiana, Texas, Florida. It is an evil threat to the young \npeople of America.\n  The legislation that has been winding its way through this 104th \nCongress makes the use of this drug or any drug as a weapon a Federal \ncrime. With the help of Senator Hatch, it was expanded to create \npenalties for possession or distribution of this type drug. It \nultimately came back to us in the House bill which included minimum \nsentencing, and the other side of the aisle took exception to that. But \nover the last several days, in working together, it appears that we are \nabout to come to terms on it, and, in fact, this piece of legislation \nwill become law. It is very important.\n  This is a weapon that cannot be seen, obviously cannot be heard. You \ncannot taste it. You cannot smell it. So the unsuspecting victim is \nsubjected to a period for which they lose consciousness and memory, \nwhich makes it even more difficult for prosecutors to pursue the case.\n  I think by moving in swiftly, we are putting people on notice, we are \nwarning potential victims, and we are setting the stage for prosecutors \nto take charge of anybody who would use this new drug in such an evil \nway.\n  I am standing here today encouraging all of those who are dealing \nwith the remainder of these negotiations to get on with it and certify \nthat, indeed, this becomes the law of the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12257-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMNIBUS PARKS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, the Senate has in its possession the \nHouse-passed omnibus parks bill, and everybody within the sound of my \nvoice in this Chamber has heard about the parks bill. I am very hopeful \nwe can bring this legislation to a successful conclusion.\n  There are two very important features that affect our State. One is \nmaking a heritage trail out of a 150-year-old canal built in Augusta to \nprovide power to the textile industry of that era. It is still \nproviding power, and it is a beautiful stretch of unspoiled land that \nis a national heritage and a national treasure, and legislating its \nprotection and development in such a way to enhance it is exceedingly \nimportant to that region of our State and that city of our State.\n  Further, it deals with Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military \nPark Highway, which has been in contention for a long time and is \nsomething which must be resolved in order to deal with issues in the \nnortheastern or northwestern part of our State.\n  So I guess I am just saying, here is another Senator who has not left \nWashington and will stay here until we put the omnibus parks bill to \nbed, hopefully successfully, because, as we have all said, it affects \nso many of our States in the Union. It is something we really need to \nget done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12257-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAREWELL TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In closing, Madam President, I once again bid farewell \nto one of the outstanding Members of this Senate, and that is my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Sam Nunn. We are from different \nparties, different sides of the aisle. We have known each other as \nGeorgia citizens for well over a quarter century.\n  I think he has made an exemplary contribution to his State and to his \nNation. I believe he will be missed, and the authority that he brings \nto issues with regard to national defense and the security of our \nNation will long be remembered in this Senate. I bid him adieu and safe \njourneys wherever his life takes him. I know we will be able to reach \nout and call on him on issues of national importance in the days to \ncome. Even though he will be accessible in that way, I know this Senate \nis going to greatly miss the wisdom and wise ways of my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Sam Nunn.\n  Madam President, I yield back whatever of the 10 minutes I may have.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, other colleagues have come to the floor \nto discuss the departure of those with whom we have served who are \nleaving this Congress. In the Senate, we will see Senator Bill Bradley \nleaving the Senate, Senator Hank Brown, Senator Bill Cohen, Senator \nJames Exon, Senator Mark Hatfield, Senator Howell Heflin, Senator \nBennett Johnston, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Senator Sam Nunn, Senator \nClaiborne Pell, Senator David Pryor, Senator Paul Simon, and Senator \nAlan Simpson.\n  When you read that list, it is quite a substantial list of experience \nthat the\n\n[[Page S12258]]\n\nSenate will lose. Rather than say a lot about each of them, I just want \nto make some observations and take a look at those folks who are \nleaving the Senate this year. What they have contributed to this \ncountry is so at odds with what so many Americans think of politicians \nand perhaps even of the U.S. Senate these days.\n  There has been a public sport in the last decade or so in the \nnegative politics of today that I suppose serves some interest. There \nare those who are trying to diminish or hurt this institution by \nsuggesting that somehow the U.S. Senate, as an institution, is an \nunworthy place, that Members who serve in it are slothful, indolent \nfolks who sleep till noon and perhaps then go to the club and maybe \nwork an hour in the afternoon before they take a nap, and go home \nshortly after the nap.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The U.S. Senate is an \nextraordinary place, and the people who serve here are extraordinary \npeople. I have never in my life had the privilege of serving with so \nmany wonderful people, who are smart, dedicated, tough, honest, and \nhard-working people. They are on both sides of the aisle, Republican \nand Democrat.\n  When I look at this list of names, I think of the people here who \nwork day and night, in many cases 7 days a week, including traveling in \ntheir States. You see them here early in the morning, you see them here \nlate at night, always working. That is more the rule in the U.S. Senate \nwith most all Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  But when I look at the people who are leaving at the end of this \nCongress, there are those who have been here a good number of years, \nand have substantial experience. They are going to be hard to replace. \nOh, they will be replaced. There is no question about that. Yet it is \nhard to replace the kind of experience that comes with the service of \nSam Nunn from Georgia or Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas, and I could go \nthrough the list of others as well.\n  I think it is interesting that in this age of discussion about term \nlimits comes the suggestion by some that what is wrong with our country \nis that there are those who have too much experience. I have said it \nbefore, and I will say it again because I think it bears repeating. I \nwouldn't have traded one Bob Dole for all 73 freshmen House Republicans \nin terms of experience and service. What Senator Dole gave to this \nSenate for so many decades is an extraordinary commitment to public \nservice. Now, I am not supporting him for President, and I am quick to \npoint that out to my colleagues. But, I have a deep admiration for the \nextended service given our country by some of the great legislators in \nthis country's history.\n\n  To suggest somehow that we should not have had the experience of \nBarry Goldwater or Hubert Humphrey, we should not have had the \nexperience of Calhoun or Clay or Webster, the experience they gave us \nover so many years, really does not make much sense to me.\n  But, I did not come here to debate term limits. I came here to say \nthat those who depart this Senate and who have contributed enormously \nto this country by their service in this Senate, demonstrate, the \nsubstantial commitment that so many people over two centuries have made \nto this country by serving in the U.S. Senate.\n  This service, for me, has been the greatest privilege of my life. I \ncome from a town of 300 people and a high school class of 9. I never \nexpected to be sworn in to the U.S. Senate. It is an extraordinary \nprivilege, and I know that all of those who are leaving believe it to \nbe so.\n  I add my voice to so many others who have, by name and person to \nperson, described those who have been here and what they have \ncontributed in the U.S. Senate. This is a remarkable group of \nRepublicans and Democrats who have contributed greatly to our country, \nand I salute all of them, and I wish them well in their travels and all \nof their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12257-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRANSFER OF SMALL BUSINESS AND FAMILY FARMS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to mention two quick pieces of \nbusiness. I have introduced a piece of legislation at the end of this \nCongress, intending to take it up in January again when a new Congress \nconvenes, dealing with the estate taxes that we now have in our \ncountry. My piece of legislation deals specifically with the transfer \nof small businesses and family farms from parents to children.\n  The economy in this country is a kind of an interesting economy. We \nhave large corporations which are given life only because we have given \nthem life by law. We have said, by law, we will allow there to be \ncreated artificial people. They can sue and be sued, contract and be \ncontracted with, even have names, but they are artificial. They don't \nlive. They don't give blood. They don't have a beating heart. It is an \nartificial person. A corporation is recognized in law as artificial.\n  The interesting thing about the corporation is that it doesn't die. \nGeneral Motors might get long in the tooth, but General Motors isn't \ngoing to die. It isn't going to have kidney failure or have heart \ndisease. General Motors won't die. But a small business run by a \nhusband and wife or a family is different. The husband and wife who \nstart the business and run the business, they die.\n  So what happens when a family farm or a family business finds itself \nin a circumstance where the mother and the father who started that \nbusiness and were running that business pass away. What happens when \nthey want to transfer that business to the son or daughter?\n  Well, what happens too often is the son and daughter end up owning \nthe business, plus a $300,000 or $400,000 tax bill from an estate tax \nburden that they must pay in order to run the business that their \nfather and mother started. That does not make much sense to me.\n  Our incentive ought to be to try to say to the children, ``You want \nto continue to run the family business? We want to help you do that. \nIt's in our interest to help you do that.'' It is in our interest to \ncontinue those jobs and to see that businesses continue, as a family \nfarmer or family business.\n  I have proposed a piece of legislation which would provide for up to \n$1.5 million of transferred assets to the children without an estate \ntax obligation. Those children can then inherit a business and be able \nto run the business, providing they want to run it.\n  If they do not want to run the family business, as far as I am \nconcerned, whatever the current estate tax is, that is the tax imposed. \nIf they want to continue to run that business for the next 10 years, I \nwant that family farmer or business to operate without a crushing \nburden of estate taxes. And my legislation will accomplish that.\n  The estate tax was originally conceived during the Civil War to \nfinance the Civil War. It has had fits and starts and various turns \nsince then. We ought to make certain the estate tax, as a revenue \ndevice, does not interrupt the continuity of a family business or \nfamily farm in which the children wish to continue as a viable family \nbusiness or family farm.\n  That was the intent of the legislation I have introduced at the end \nof this session. Of course, without an opportunity for action on it, I \nwill have to, in January or February, in the new Congress, turn to it \nagain and see if we can make some progress on it. I expect there will \nbe bipartisan support for legislation of this type, and I hope that we \nwill see some success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12258-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12258-S12261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Finally, while I will not characterize this Congress, \nbecause it would take too long, I do want to say that one of the pieces \nof unfinished business in the Congress deals with trade. I want to just \ndiscuss that for a moment.\n  There are failures in this Congress and successes; and we can point \nto both. The 104th Congress is one of the strangest Congresses I have \never seen operate. It had more twists and turns than a road in hilly \ncountry.\n  It just started out with the kind of bizarre circumstance of people \nsaying, ``Well, we have no experience, and we're new here, and we don't \nintend to compromise. We got here because we bragged we have no \nexperience, and we intend to prove we don't have any in the first 90 \ndays. We don't intend to compromise on anything. And if you\n\n[[Page S12259]]\n\ndon't like it, we'll shut the Government down.'' And it went on and on, \nand it was a mess.\n  The American people, I think, did not like it much. The first year of \nthis Congress was not a very productive year. The second year of this \nCongress, I think, was a productive year, especially the last 6 months. \nProgress was made on a health care reform bill, on the minimum wage, on \nimmigration reform, on welfare reform, and on a range of issues that I \nthink are important to this country. I think the credit for that can be \ngiven to a bipartisan spirit of cooperation in the waning months of \nthis Congress.\n  But the one issue that was not dealt with, and has never been dealt \nwith by this Congress, is an issue dealing with deficits. And, no, it \nis not the budget deficit. It is the trade deficit.\n  The budget deficit is down, way down, down more than by one-half. So \nthe budget deficit has been coming down and moving in the right \ndirection. But the trade deficit has not. Yet, almost no one discusses \nthe trade deficit.\n  As I conclude my remarks today, I want to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an article written by the economist Lester Thurow. I ask \nunanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is entitled, ``Awaiting the Crisis.'' This is by \nLester Thurow, MIT economist. The subtitle is, ``It's fundamental: No \ncountry can run a trade deficit forever.''\n  And I want to read part of it.\n\n       When something has gone on for a long time, human beings \n     have a tendency to act as if it could go on forever--even \n     when they know that it cannot. Consider the triangular \n     trading pattern between the United States, Japan, and most of \n     the rest of East Asia. Japan runs a huge trade surplus with \n     the United States and now an even larger one with the other \n     countries of East Asia, most of which pay for their enormous \n     trade deficits with Japan by running even bigger trade \n     surpluses with the United States. The United States ends up \n     with a current account deficit (more than $150 billion in \n     1995) that is mostly attributable to its unfavorable balance \n     of trade with Japan and most of the rest of East Asia.\n\n  He does not say it, but he should also include Mexico and Canada.\n\n       Yet if there is one thing that we know about international \n     trade, it is that no country, not even one as big as the \n     United States, can run a trade deficit forever. Money must be \n     borrowed to pay for the deficit, but money must also be \n     borrowed to pay interest on previous borrowing.\n\n  And he goes on. The merchandise trade deficit in this country last \nyear was $170 billion. And it is growing. There was a great deal of \nactivity on this floor during this Congress talking about the budget \ndeficit. The Federal budget deficit is diminishing, going down, way \ndown. The trade deficit is going up. There has been almost no \ndiscussion about this on this floor except for myself and a couple of \nothers.\n  What discussion does exist on this floor is generally referred to by \nothers, the very people who have put us in this trade position, who \nsay, ``Well, that's simply the complaining by a few certifiable stooges \nthat don't have any training at all.''\n  Lester Thurow is right. No country can run a trade deficit forever. \nWe can see Americans who wear Chinese shirts, Mexican shorts, and \nItalian shoes, and drive Japanese cars, and watch television on \nTaiwanese television sets, and then complain about their jobs. ``What's \nhappened to my job? I'm paid less. I don't have job security.''\n  It simply does not add up. To the extent we have large trade \ndeficits, because we import more than we export, it means that the \nmanufacturing base of our country diminishes. No world economic power \nwill long remain a world economic power unless it has a sustainable \nmanufacturing base. You cannot move all that you produce overseas and \nstill believe you will remain a strong economic power.\n  I am not suggesting that our country ought to have a policy by which \nwe establish walls and prevent goods from coming in. I am not saying \nthat at all. What I am saying is that we must have a trade policy that \ntries to move us toward some kind of trade balance so we get rid of \nthese crippling trade deficits.\n  My colleague, Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, and I introduced a \npiece of legislation that we had hoped would be passed by this Congress \nin the waning days, and it was not. It would have established an \nemergency commission to end the trade deficit. Under this bill a \ncommission would be impaneled to give us recommendations on how can we \ntackle this trade deficit, and what kinds of policies this country can \nemploy to reduce this trade deficit.\n  The trade deficit must be repaid with a lower standard of living in \nour country. There is not any economist that will argue otherwise. To \nhave a trade deficit that is this large, the largest in human history, \nand growing, is very dangerous for our country.\n  That does not argue, as I said, for protectionism. It does not argue \nfor providing consumers with fewer choices. It simply argues that you \nmust have some kind of balance in your trade policies. It suggests to \nother countries that there are reciprocal responsibilities.\n\n  Let me give you an example.\n  China sends us an enormous amount of products to be sold in our \nmarketplace. And that is fine with me. But then what happens when China \nneeds airplanes. And it does, because it does not manufacture airplanes \nexcept for small airplanes, some 50-seat airplanes. It does not \nmanufacture the large planes. When China needs airplanes, because it \nhas a $30-billion-plus surplus with us, or we have a deficit with them \nof over $30 billion, you would think that China would say, ``All right, \nyou buy the things that we produce that you need, so now when we need \nsomething you produce, airplanes, we'll buy them from you.'' It is not \nthe way it works.\n  China says to us, ``We'd like to buy some of your Boeing airplanes. \nBy the way, you must manufacturer them in China. Yes. We'll buy your \nproducts if you manufacture them in China.'' I do not understand that. \nIt does not make any sense to me, particularly with a country that is \nrunning up a giant trade surplus with us or is putting us in a position \nto have an enormous deficit with them. When it intends to buy something \nthat we produce, it has a responsibility to buy it from our country, \nfrom our workers and from our producers.\n  The same is true with wheat. I will use China again, although I could \nuse others. China has this enormous trade surplus with us, growing in a \nvery significant way. It buys wheat, and we should be thankful that it \nbuys wheat. But, it is off price shopping with other countries to try \nto figure out where it can buy discount wheat. China has a \nresponsibility to buy wheat from us. When it is running up a $30-\nbillion-plus trade surplus or putting us in a deficit position, it has \na responsibility to us to buy our wheat.\n  I could talk at great length about Mexico and Japan and China and \nCanada. These countries have the significant portion of our trade \ndeficit, and we should talk with them about the need for reciprocal \ntrade policies. But I did not come to the floor to do that. I came to \nthe floor to point out that Lester Thurow, the MIT economist, has \nwritten ``No country can run a trade deficit forever.''\n\n  Those in this country who have a nagging feeling somewhere between \ntheir brain and the pit of their belly understand what it is. \nUnfortunately, economists in this town do not and most politicians do \nnot. That nagging feeling of uneasiness is to see a country whose \nmanufacturing is increasingly moving elsewhere. It is not simply the \nmanufacturing of low-skilled circumstances. No, it is the manufacturing \nwith high-skilled labor that is moving elsewhere. The result is we are \nleft in this country with jobs that move from high skill to low skill, \nfrom higher pay to lower pay, and from more security to less security. \nThat hurts this country.\n  My message to the Congress and the President is that we cannot \ncontinue to ignore this problem. This article I asked to have printed \nin the Record is entitled ``Awaiting the Crisis.''\n  I remember in the last Congress we had a significant debate about \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. We were promised by \neconomists and others that if we would pass NAFTA with Mexico and \nCanada, we would see several hundred thousand new jobs in our country. \nIt turns out we passed NAFTA. I did not support it.\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\n I actively opposed it. We not only did not get 300,000 new jobs; we \nlost more than 300,000 jobs. One recent study places the job loss \ncloser to 500,000 jobs.\n  It turns out the substantial new imports from Mexico are not imports \nresulting from low-wage, low-skill jobs. Instead, the imports are \nlargely the result of high-skilled jobs that are still paying low wages \nin Mexico. They are the result of jobs in electronics, automobiles, and \nautomobile parts. Those are jobs that used to be ours that are now \nsouth of the border.\n  I, personally, do not see that it advances this country's interest to \nput together trade strategies that result in jobs moving overseas. I \nmight say with respect to that, just parenthetically, we not only have \na trade policy that encourages that, we also have a tax policy that \nsays, ``By the way, shut your American plant, fire your American \nworkers, and move your jobs overseas and we will give you a big fat tax \nbreak.''\n  Twice I tried to get that changed on the floor of the Senate and \ntwice I lost. But I will be back, because we will vote again on that in \nthe next session of Congress. It might be in the interest of the \nlargest international corporations to collect a tax break from moving \njobs from Fargo or Bangor or Pittsburgh or Denver to Sri Lanka, \nBangladesh, China, or Korea, but it is not in our interests. It might \nbe in their interests, but it is not in ours. We ought to deal with \nthat.\n  Madam President, this is an issue that the next Congress must tackle. \nSenator Byrd, the Senator from West Virginia, and I will reintroduce \nthe legislation that we introduced toward the end of this session \ndealing with an emergency commission to end the trade deficit. I will \ncontinue to stimulate and agitate, if necessary, on this.\n  We must address this issue, but not in a way that retreats from the \ninterests of expanded and open markets. We must address it in a way \nthat focuses on what is in our economic interest as a country. We must \nnot address it in a way that allows those who sloganeer about \nprotectionism to claim anyone who does not share their view is \nprotectionist.\n  How do we, at the same time as we countenance largely open markets, \ninsist on our trading partners opening their markets to American \nproducers and the products made by American workers? How do we do that? \nThe failure to do that means we load our kids with debt that they will \nhave to repay with a lower standard of living. This is not the budget \ndebt. This is trade debt. The merchandise trade deficit this past year \nis close to $170 billion.\n  Madam President, let me again, as I conclude, pay honor and tribute \nto those who leave the U.S. Senate. It has been a privilege to me to \nserve with them.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Awaiting the Crisis\n\n       When something has gone on for a long time, human beings \n     have a tendency to act as if it could go on forever--even \n     when they know that it cannot. Consider the triangular \n     trading pattern between the United States, Japan, and most of \n     the rest of East Asia. Japan runs a huge trade surplus with \n     the United States and now an even larger one with the other \n     countries of East Asia, most of which pay for their enormous \n     trade deficits with Japan by running even bigger trade \n     surpluses with the United States. The United States ends up \n     with a current account deficit (more than $150 billion in \n     1995) that is mostly attributable to its unfavorable balance \n     of trade with Japan and most of the rest of East Asia.\n       Yet if there is one thing that we know about international \n     trade, it is that no country, not even one as big as the \n     United States, can run a trade deficit forever. Money must be \n     borrowed to pay for the deficit, but money must also be \n     borrowed to pay interest on previous borrowing. Even if the \n     annual trade deficit does not grow, interest payments do \n     until they are so large that they can no longer be financed. \n     Americans can also sell their assets (land, companies, \n     buildings) to foreigners to finance deficits, but that \n     approach is also limited since eventually there will be \n     nothing of value left to sell.\n       At some point the world's capital markets will quit lending \n     to Americans (the risk of default and of being paid back in a \n     currency of much lower value are simply too great), just as \n     they have quit lending to everyone else. The question is not \n     whether the end will come. It will. The question is when and \n     how fast. Will it come as one big shock or as a series of \n     smaller shocks that do less damage?\n       But no one knows, or can know, when or how fast. Economics \n     is quite good when it comes to assessing fundamental forces, \n     but it is horrible at timing and speed of adjustment. \n     Economic theory simply says nothing about either.\n       When the ends comes, the biggest effects will be felt in \n     most of the up-and-coming countries of East Asia. They will \n     lose not just their United States market and trade surpluses \n     but also their ability to run a trade deficit with Japan and \n     finance the importation of Japanese products, including \n     components and spare parts. Since much of what they sell in \n     their domestic markets depends on these Japanese imports, \n     cutbacks in production will have to be far larger than what a \n     simple elimination of United States trade surpluses would \n     indicate.\n       Many of the East Asian countries that think they have \n     reduced their dependence on the American market in recent \n     years will find that they have not. South Korea now sells \n     less than it once did to the United States and more to China \n     than ever before, but China could not afford to buy from \n     South Korea it if it did not have a trade surplus with the \n     United States. As China's sales fall in America, its \n     purchases from South Korea will have to fall as well.\n       In addition, many of the countries in East Asia have their \n     debts denominated in yen, even though most of their sales are \n     denominated in dollars. As a result, when the yen rises in \n     value vis-a-vis the dollar, the real value of their debts \n     explodes. This effect was already apparent as the dollar slid \n     from 120 yen to 80 yen over the last couple of years. \n     Indonesia and China would have been in a lot of trouble if \n     the dollar had not recovered.\n       As a consequence, when the United States loses its ability \n     to finance its trade deficit, Japan will lose not just its \n     American sales but also most of its East Asian sales. A few \n     countries in East Asia, such as Taiwan, have large foreign-\n     exchange reserves and will be able to continue to import \n     Japanese components and spare parts. But most other have \n     little in the way of foreign-exchange reserves--without their \n     American sales these countries will become uncreditworthy. \n     Their Japanese purchases will have to end almost instantly. \n     Having lost their United States and Asian export surpluses, \n     Japan's big export industries will have to undergo a big \n     contraction.\n       Paradoxically, the problems will be the least severe in the \n     United States. The standard of living there will certainly \n     decline as imports fall back into balance with exports, but \n     United States companies, such as auto manufacturers, will \n     quickly add third shifts and expand production to grab the \n     sales and market share that companies in Japan and the rest \n     of East Asia will be forced to give up. The problems of the \n     United States will be minor compared with those of Japan and \n     the rest of East Asia.\n       Given this reality, governments should act now to rebalance \n     trading patterns in order to avoid the crisis that will \n     emerge if current trends are simply allowed to play \n     themselves out. Everyone knows that a gradual readjustment \n     that is deliberately engineered now will be a lot less \n     painful than a sudden, market-forced adjustment at some point \n     in the future.\n       But it is just as clear that these governments will fail to \n     act in time. They will instead wait for the crisis to arrive.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 2, or 3 days ago I had the opportunity \nto speak on the floor about those of our colleagues on this side of the \naisle who are ending their Senate careers with the termination and \nadjournment of this Congress.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to speak briefly about my friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are doing the same \nthing with particular reference to one who has become a special friend.\n  Many people have paid well earned tribute to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Bradley, for his brilliance, dedication, and \npurposefulness; to a particular colleague, Senator Exon of Nebraska, \nwith whom I have been privileged to serve on both the Budget Committee \nand the Commerce Committee whose wit, sense of humor, and ability to \ndiffuse difficult situations is wonderfully welcome; to perhaps a \nfavorite of many, Senator Simon of Illinois who, even when one \ndisagrees frequently with him on issues, is always unfailingly \nfriendly, thoughtful, forgiving, and forthcoming; to the courtly and \ncourteous Senator Pell from Rhode Island.\n  Madam President, all are individuals that we will miss.\n\n\n                        SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  But I want to especially pay tribute to my dear friend and colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Louisiana, Bennett Johnston; with common \ninterests\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\nin many matters relating to energy, to all sorts of natural resources, \nto our parks, and particularly to a balanced Federal budget; the \ncompanionship that we had in search of a bipartisan solution to those \nquestions and of the balanced budget during the course of the last year \nor two. We would be closer in any event.\n\n  But, Madam President, I want to put on the Record one unique set of \ncircumstances that binds the two of us together in a way that \nillustrates in some respects how small this world is.\n  When I first came to the U.S. Senate in 1981, Senator Johnston had \nbeen here for a considerable period of time and was a leading, highly \nrespected, and very, very thoughtful Member of this body.\n  About 6 months after I was here, I visited at length my mother, who \ndied just a couple of months afterward, at her home in Massachusetts, \nand was talking to her with great enthusiasm about this new challenge \nof my life and this new career; describing the friendships I had made, \nat which point I said, ``One of the Democrats, mother, that I like best \nof all is Bennett Johnston. You know, he comes from Shreveport, LA, \nwhere your sister lived and raised her children, my cousins. I just \nthink that Bennett Johnston is a really terrific Senator.'' And my \nmother smiled at me, and responded, and said, ``Well, Slade, when you \ngo back to the Senate, you ask Senator Johnston whether he knows that \nhis father proposed to me while we were undergraduates at Louisiana \nState University.''\n  Well, Madam President, Senator Johnston obviously did not know that \nhis father had proposed unsuccessfully to my mother before he met and \nmarried the Senator's mother. But that brought us close enough together \nthat he and I have called one another cousin ever since.\n  Madam President, of all of the people whom I will miss in this body \nat the end of this Congress, I want to say that I will very, very much \nmiss my cousin, Bennett Johnston of Louisiana.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid a \nreluctant farewell to an outstanding leader, friend, colleague, and \nmentor--and an individual who has been a tremendous credit to this \ninstitution and to his home State--the senior Senator from Maine, Bill \nCohen.\n  The U.S. Senate is often referred to as the greatest deliberative \nbody on earth, a reflection on the stature of its most outstanding \nindividuals throughout our history. These leaders have all faced \ndifferent challenges in different ages, but share the traits that bind \nmen and women to greatness: courage, integrity, and a thoughtful \napproach to the issues of the day. They are people for whom public \nservice is a calling, not a career; and a solemn trust not ever to be \nbroken.\n  Senator Bill Cohen is one of these people.\n  Bill Cohen grew up in Bangor, ME, and would forever be instilled with \nthe solid, common-sense, honest characteristics that are the hallmark \nof any good Mainer. From humble but hard-working roots, Bill Cohen \nwould learn the values that have made him a great legislator, and a \ngreat leader.\n  Mainers are a proud and independent people, who believe in thinking \nfor themselves but also in helping each other. They understand that \nthere are no free rides--no endless summers. For every action there is \na consequence, and with every right comes a responsibility. People are \nexpected to make the most of the opportunities they have, but also to \nmake certain those opportunities exist for others. They insist that a \nperson keep their promises and be true to their word. And they believe \nthe ultimate measure of any man or woman is how close they remain to \ntheir principles precisely when it is most difficult to do so.\n  It is against this backdrop that Bill Cohen started his political \nlife, and he has carried these ideals with him throughout his tenure in \nthe public arena. He entered politics knowing that he would have to \nmake difficult decisions and willing to make them--but not knowing what \nor when. As it turned out, his moment would come very quickly.\n  It became clear early on that Bill Cohen would follow in the \ntradition of great Maine leaders like Margaret Chase Smith and Edmund \nMuskie. Indeed, from his earliest days in Congress, Representative \nCohen distinguished himself as an island of reason in a stormy sea of \nscandal. While America was suffering a crisis of confidence, Bill Cohen \ncharted a course straight through the heart of the storm as a member of \nthe House Judiciary Committee considering Articles of Impeachment \nagainst a President. Although just a freshman in the House, Bill was \nalready a man of conscience and courage--someone who was willing to \nmake the tough calls and risk his political future for the sake of \ntruth and America's honor.\n  One of our distinguished colleagues, Senator Robert Byrd, once said \n``What we really need is a constitutional amendment that says, `There \nshall be some spine in our national leaders' ''. I think Senator Byrd \nmight agree that if we had more Bill Cohen's, we might not need such a \nmeasure.\n  Maine and America have come to know that they can count on Bill Cohen \nto approach issues with thoughtfulness and reason, and I think that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have a tremendous respect for his \nintellect and integrity.\n  I think that is what Americans want in their leaders. Bill Cohen not \nonly listens to his constituents, but has the capacity to put the day's \nproblems and events into historical perspective. He has the intellect, \nthe integrity, and the strength to know the right thing to do--and the \nright way to do it.\n  Bill Cohen does not rise and fall with the political tide, but at the \nsame time he is very much aware of the issues and concerns swirling \nacross America as well as the world. In much the spirit of lighthouse-\nkeepers of Maine's past, Bill Cohen has always stood strong in the face \nof the often turbulent seas of politics, ever watchful and every ready \nto guide us in the right direction.\n  He has been a leader who believes it is his solemn responsibility not \nsimply to echo public sentiment, but to deliberate upon the issues of \nthe day and to add his own voice to the debate.\n\n  In fact, in 1992 he admonished that ``Those of us in Congress must be \nwilling to tell the American people what they need to know, not just \nwhat they want to hear.'' Otherwise, as he said just Friday in his \neloquent farewell speech, ``You don't need me; you just need a \ncomputer. * * *\n  It is that kind of powerful eloquence that has been such a persuasive \nvoice for reason in this body. As we well know, Mr. President, Bill \nCohen knows just the right thing to say for almost any occasion, and \ncertainly has a gift for the language. Of course, it's not unusual \npeople in our line of work to sprinkle their speeches with pithy little \nquotes from some famous writer. But let's be honest--most of these are \nusually stumbled upon by some clever speech writer leafing through \n``Bartlett's Famous Quotations.'' I mean, when was the last time you \nwere actually gazing wistfully out the window, thinking, ``You know, \nright now I'm reminded of that line in `The Iliad'* * *.''\n  Except for Bill. He really is sitting there, thinking about the cost \nof some arcane weapons system relative to gross national product and \nhow it all reminds him of that line in ``The Iliad.''\n  How many of us use timeless poetry and literature to inform our \nviews? Even more remarkably, how many of us use our own poetry and \nwritings?\n  That is why those of us in this Chamber are well aware that Bill is \nabout more than rollcall votes and unanimous-consent agreements. He is \nabout the thoughtfulness and beauty of poetry; he is about \ncontemplating our place in history; and he is about taking the time to \nreally think about the world around us. He knows that what is really \nimportant--what is really lasting and worthy of our attention--is not\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\nsomething that can be gleaned from a briefing book. It must come from, \nas Plato might have said, the examined life. For Senator Cohen, the \nexamined life is the only life worth living, and this philosophy is \nreflected in his public service.\n  Indeed, one might say that when it comes to values like honesty, \nintegrity, and fairness, Bill Cohen helped write the book.\n  In the Senate, Senator Cohen has been there to defend the \ndefenseless. He has been a compassionate pragmatist who believes, as I \ndo, that we can balance the budget and still have room for humanity. As \nWoodrow Wilson once said, ``The firm basis of government is justice not \npity,'' and in that spirit Bill Cohen believes that we should help give \npeople a hand up, not a hand out. And with boundless optimism and in \nthe best Republican tradition, he believes in the power and potential \nof the individual. Bill said it best in a speech he gave on the Senate \nfloor: ``Is there anything more un-American than to deny a human being \nthe chance to be the best he or she can be?\n  Indeed, there is a common thread that runs through Bill Cohen's \ncareer in government. In 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, \n``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' It is upon \nthat fundamental principal that Senator Cohen has based his work, and \nthe yardstick against which he measures our quality of life--and \nGovernment--in America.\n  In a passionate speech he gave in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles \nriots, Bill was typically eloquent and straightforward when he said: \n``If we expect people to be guided by the rule of law and the hand of \njustice, then justice must be done. * * * We who hold positions of \nhonor and responsibility as lawmakers have an absolute duty to see to \nit that laws we pass are carried out with fairness and with complete \nimpartiality.''\n  Senator Cohen has been a tireless champion for justice, whether for \nseniors, minorities, women, and even the U.S. Government. In fact, \nespecially the U.S. Government. Bill believes in the system--and he \ndoes not take lightly to that system being tarnished by corruption, \nwaste, or special privileges. He was there to champion lobbying reform; \nhe was there to ensure that criminal wrongdoing by public servants \nwould not be tolerated; and he was there to strengthen the code of \nethics for all who are entrusted with the public good.\n  Bill has also long been a respected and expert voice on intelligence \nand defense issues. As chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on \nSeapower and as former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nBill's leadership role at a key time in history laid the groundwork for \nmany of the successes we enjoy today--from keeping communism at bay, to \nhelping bring about the end of the cold war.\n\n  Throughout it all, the political battles, the tough votes, the late-\nnight sessions, Bill Cohen never forgot where he came from. Since 1969, \nwhen he was first elected to public office as the mayor of Bangor, ME \npeople have put their trust in Bill Cohen. He has never failed that \ntrust. He has never failed to honor us with his service and he has \nnever failed to make us all proud to call him Senator. I have certainly \nbeen proud to call him Senator, even senior Senator, but I feel even \nmore privileged to be able to call him my friend.\n  Bill set the standard in modern Maine politics for all of us to \nfollow. Indeed, if we ever had any hope of being successful, we had to \nfollow it. And his advice and wise guidance over the years has been \ninvaluable to me. I will forever appreciate the kindness he has shown. \nHe has been a colleague, a mentor, and an inspiration, and I will miss \nhim.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Cohen is about to embark on an exciting and \nfulfilling new journey, I wish him nothing but the best. But know this: \nThis institution, his State, and this country, will miss him dearly \nbecause he has been, as an editorial once said, ``as close to the ideal \ndefinition of a public servant as one can get.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12261-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, like most Americans, I have watched the \nevents of the past several days in the Middle East with great concern. \nThrough a series of miscalculations, the fragile peace process, which \nso many of us support and were hoping would be successful, seems to \nhave been threatened by renewed violence.\n  As a strong supporter of Israel, I hope a reopening of the \nconstructive dialog has been achieved in the White House in the past 24 \nor 36 hours. And I hope as well that both Israel and Palestinian \nleaders will renew their commitment to peace.\n  As they attempt to resolve their immediate differences, I urge Prime \nMinister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to act in good faith and with \nrestraint, although I have to say, after having had a lengthy meeting \nwith Mr. Arafat just a few weeks ago on the Gaza, I did not observe \nmuch restraint.\n\n  So often, dramatic events in one district of the world draw attention \nfrom some of the other things that are going on. I would like to call \nthe attention of my colleagues to the concern that I have over other \nthings that are taking place in that region of the world. I wish to \ncall to my colleague's attention, current actions being taken by Syria, \nactions which may prove to be an even greater threat to the security of \nIsrael and the stability of the Middle East.\n  A very dangerous game is being played by Syrian President Hafez Assad \non the Golan Heights. For the past month, Syria has been conducting a \nseries of troop movements along Israel's northern border, which will \nenable Syria to quickly launch an attack on Israel. Syria has \nredeployed up to 12,000 troops from in and around Beirut to within \nstriking distance of the Golan Heights. This is the first significant \nmanipulation of military forces since the Madrid Conference convened 5 \nyears ago to initiate the peace process.\n  Only by standing on the edge of the Golan, which I have done many \ntimes, and I am sure the Senator presiding has also, can you get the \nfull impact of the strategic significance of the Golan.\n  The Syrian troop movements is just the latest in a series of \ndestabilizing actions by Assad. Despite repeated invitations for Prime \nMinister Netanyahu, Assad has refused to renew peace talks with Israel. \nSyria still harbors some 10 anti-Israel terrorist organizations in \nDamascus. Syria also supports the anti-Turkish, anti-Jordanian \nterrorists, and let's not forget Syria's destabilization of Lebanon \nwith over 40,000 Syrian troops supporting Hezbollah terrorists.\n  Mr. President, the Syrian troop movements are additionally menacing \nin light of a serious surprise attack on Israel during the observance \nof Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement in 1973.\n  In 1973, Syrian commando units were used to attack Israeli positions \non Mt. Hermon during Yom Kippur, the day of fasting prayer and \nintrospection, which was observed in Israel just last Monday. Syrian \ntroop movements could force a dangerous escalation by virtue\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nof the implied threat to Israel of their forward positions.\n  In the most recent redeployment, which took place just last week, \nspecial forces were moved to forward positions on the Syrian side of \nMt. Hermon. These movements are most disturbing and significantly \nchange the military picture. It was a similar force which captured an \nIsraeli outpost on Mt. Hermon in 1973. They were only dislodged after \nheavy loss of life.\n  Mr. President, an editorial published in a recent Near East report \noutlines the threat to Israel of these recent Syrian actions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Troubling Syrian Troop Movements\n\n       For several weeks, Syrian troops have been moving from the \n     Beirut area to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, close to Israeli \n     positions on the Golan Heights. The New York Times (Sept. 18) \n     said Israel and the U.S. are particularly concerned about the \n     movement of crack Syrian commandos near Israeli listening \n     posts on Mount Hermon, given that the 1973 Yom Kippur War \n     began with a Syrian commando attack on Mount Hermon.\n       In its September 18 lead story, Ha'aretz reports that an \n     intelligence assessment (presented in recent days to Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu against the background of the troop \n     movements) says that, while there are no signs indicating an \n     immediate outbreak of hostilities, ``the probability of war \n     with Syria is no longer low.'' (In recent years, IDF \n     intelligence assessments have said there is ``a low \n     probability'' of such a war.)\n       The biggest military advantage Syria could gain from the \n     latest troop movement would be a reduction in the time needed \n     to move from a defensive to an attacking posture. ``The main \n     concern is not that the Syrians will try to attack the \n     Galilee, but will try a quick capture of some key point, like \n     Mt. Hermon. This evaluation is based largely on the nature of \n     the Syrian forces sighted in the area: special commando units \n     trained to engage in swift raids,'' wrote Ha'aretz \n     intelligence expert Yossi Melman (Sep. 18).\n       While the Syrian movements are troubling, their \n     significance should not be exaggerated. Israel and Syria have \n     reportedly exchanged ``pacifying messages'' aimed at heading \n     off a confrontation. Foreign Minister David Levy and U.S. \n     Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Jones are said to be involved \n     in calming things.\n       ``I don't see anything particularly alarming in the \n     redeployment,'' Jones said, adding that a military \n     confrontation between Syria and Israel'' seems pretty far-\n     fetched'' (Reuter, Sep. 17).\n       Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs \n     and Defense Committee: ``Syria's intention is evidently to \n     put psychological pressure on Israel and its new government. \n     And, when pressure is applied to you, the main thing is don't \n     get pressured.''\n       Syria's bullying tactics come at a particularly inopportune \n     time--just as Washington and Jerusalem have been working \n     tirelessly to arrive at a new formula for resuming Israeli-\n     Syrian talks. Damascus would do well to jettison the \n     questionable threats and troop movements in favor of re-\n     engaging in serious negotiations with Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12262-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12263-S12265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if I can address one other subject very \nbriefly since we are coming to the end of this session. I noticed an \narticle in the current Reader's Digest. I happen to be one who has such \nrespect for the Reader's Digest.\n  I was involved with a story 2 years ago with them. It took them 9 \nmonths to write the story. Everything is authenticated and documented \nin a way I don't know any other publication would equal. They were \ntalking about ballistic missiles that increasingly will be used by \nhostile states and is a real serious problem.\n  We have stood on the floor of this Senate over and over and over \nagain to try to address this problem, to make the people of America \naware that we are probably in a more threatened position today than we \nhave been in this country's history. They point out some things I had \nnot thought about, putting it in proper context.\n  They said there are five reasons why the Nation must take steps to \ndefend itself:\n  First, the ballistic missiles are proliferating. More than 20 nations \nare in the ballistic missile club, as they call it. Others are knocking \non the door. This is something we have been saying over and over again. \nIn fact, it has been 2 years since the former CIA Director, the first \none under President Clinton, said that we know of somewhere between 25 \nand 30 nations that currently either have developed, or are in the \nfinal stages of developing, weapons of mass destruction, either \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear.\n  This former CIA Director identifies five nations--Libya, Iraq, Iran, \nSyria, and North Korea--whose aggressive programs to arm missiles with \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons could threaten the United \nStates.\n  The second thing they talk about is that missile range and accuracy \nare increasing rapidly. I suggest, Mr. President, that the reason for \nthis is partly our fault because of what we have done in satellite \ntechnology.\n  I had occasion to become the first Member of Congress to fly a small \nairplane around the world a couple of years ago. I used that satellite \ntechnology. I never lost the satellite all the way around the world. \nBecause of that, there is no way of guarding against other uses, and \nthat means, through our global positioning system, other nations have \nincredible accuracy, and this is something that has to be taken into \nconsideration.\n  The third point is warheads of mass destruction are within reach of \nmany new missile powers.\n  We were shocked when we found out and discovered at the end of the \ngulf war that Saddam Hussein had a huge biochemical arsenal. Hundreds \nof tons were destroyed by the U.N. observers. We have no way of knowing \nwhere else in the world this could be happening.\n  The fourth point is, defense against ballistic missile attack is a \npractical reality. It is for political, not technological, reasons that \nthe U.S. Government has chosen not to build a missile defense. I think \nthat is very significant.\n  We not long ago debated the START II Treaty and we did, in fact, \napprove that from this body. I think I was the first one, the only one, \nwho voted against it until later in the vote when three others joined. \nMy argument was we were going back to accepting the confinements and \nrestrictions that were imposed upon us in the 1972 ABM Treaty, which at \nthat time didn't make sense to me, but it made more sense than it does \ntoday, because that was a bilateral treaty with a country that no \nlonger exists, which says, ``If you don't defend yourself, we will \nagree not to defend ourselves,'' therefore, that is a policy that \noffers some security.\n\n  I never really believed it did. However, it is now pointed out by \nmore and more people that that policy was flawed initially and \ncertainly is not one that today makes any sense. In fact, it was Dr. \nHenry Kissinger, who was the architect of the ABM Treaty in 1972, who \nsaid, ``It is nuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability.''\n  So that is our posture today, where we are. The last thing they said \nis the longer we wait, the less time we may have.\n  We had an NIA estimate not too long ago, a national intelligence \nestimate, that many of us felt was flawed in many ways. I think it told \nthe President what the President wanted to hear. It came to the \nconclusion that there is no threat out there for the next 15 years. I \nthink there are many problems with this. First of all, they talk about \nthe continental United States. I agreed with James Woolsey the other \nday when he said the last time he checked, Hawaii and Alaska were part \nof the United States.\n  The article also points out that it fails to mention that both Russia \nand China have ICBM's right now that have the capability of reaching \nthe United States, along with the weapons of mass destruction.\n  I remember President Clinton saying in the House Chamber during his \nState of the Union Message that there is not a single Russian missile \npointed at America's children. The head of the Russian strategic \nmissile forces told CBS news on ``60 Minutes'' that his ICBM's could be \nretargeted in a matter of minutes. I think it is a great disservice to \nthe American people for the President to try to imply that the threat \nis not out there.\n  Mr. President, many of the people in the intelligence community \nthroughout the world have said that the United States of America is \nfacing a greater threat today than we have faced since the \nRevolutionary War. I am deeply distressed that the President has been \nable to convince many of the American people that the threat is not out \nthere, and I intend, certainly during this recess, to do all I can to \nbe, if nothing\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\nmore than a one-man truth squad, to get the American people to \nunderstand the real threat that is facing us today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the missile defense \narticle entitled ``Defenseless Against Missile Terror'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Reader's Digest, October, 1996]\n\n                   Defenseless Against Missile Terror\n\n                       (By Ralph Kinney Bennett)\n\n       ``Ballistic missiles can and increasingly will be used by \n     hostile states for blackmail, terror and to drive wedges \n     between us and our allies.''\n       This warning, delivered to Congress last spring by R. James \n     Woolsey, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     had a particular immediacy. Just weeks earlier, China had \n     threatened Taiwan by test-firing missiles off Taiwan's \n     shores. In a not-so-veiled warning against interference, \n     China reminded a former U.S. diplomat that Los Angeles was \n     within reach of its nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles (ICBMs).\n       Ballistic missiles are becoming a dangerous factor in \n     international relations, but the United States has yet to \n     deal fully with the threat. Here are five reasons why the \n     nation must take steps to defend itself:\n       1. Ballistic missiles are proliferating. More than 20 \n     nations are in the ballistic missile ``club.'' Others are \n     knocking on the door. Although the United States stopped \n     exporting ballistic missiles over two decades ago, Russia, \n     China and North Korea eagerly peddle their rockets--often in \n     the guise of aiding ``space programs.''\n       Pakistan, which has been developing its own ballistic \n     missile, the Hatf, has reportedly acquired 30 nuclear-\n     capable, medium-range M-11 missiles from the Chinese to \n     counter India's growing missile force. Saudi Arabia owns \n     Chinese CSS-2 missiles. Iran has added Chinese CSS-8s, a \n     front-line ballistic missile, to its considerable arsenal of \n     Soviet-made Scuds. There has even been a report that Peru, \n     smarting from past reverses at the hands of its neighbors, \n     entered into negotiations with North Korea last year to \n     obtain ballistic missiles.\n       The CIA identifies five ``rogue nations''--Libya, Iraq, \n     Iran, Syria and North Korea--whose ``aggressive'' programs to \n     arm missiles with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \n     could threaten the United States.\n       There are indications that Libya is seeking to buy \n     ballistic missiles from North Korea . Iraq, whose Scud \n     rockets rained down on Israel and Saudi Arabia in the Gulf \n     War, is rapidly rebuilding production facilities to turn out \n     an upgraded Scud called the El-Hussein.\n       In North Korea, scarce financial resources are being \n     lavished on long-range Taepo Dong missiles. Intelligence \n     sources in South Korea report that within five years, these \n     rockets may be able to reach all of the western, and much of \n     the central, United States.\n       2. Missile range and accuracy are rapidly increasing. By \n     strapping on booster engines, countries can turn shorter-\n     range missiles into multi-stage rockets--vastly increasing \n     attack distance.\n       In December 1989 intelligence officials were astounded when \n     Iraqi missile scientists successfully tested a powerful \n     rocket bolted together from five Soviet Scud engines. Iraq's \n     ballistic-missile research and development facility at Mosul \n     was destroyed during the Gulf War, but it has been rebuilt \n     and expanded. North Korea and China are also creating \n     ``hybrid'' long-range missiles from rocket components. \n     Moreover, experts add, China is going all-out to make its \n     CSS-4 ICBM capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads.\n       One problem for missile neophytes--accuracy--may have been \n     inadvertently solved by the United States. Our Global \n     Positioning System (GPS) uses an orbiting satellite network \n     to provide an exact location fix on earth. Originally a U.S. \n     defense program, GPS is now routinely available to anyone--\n     including foreign governments.\n       Former CIA Director Woolsey explains that within a few \n     years, GPS could give ballistic missiles such pinpoint \n     accuracy that even with nonnuclear warheads, they would have \n     immense destructive power. GPS could make it feasible, \n     Woolsey warns, ``for Saddam Hussein to threaten to destroy \n     the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) or for Chinese rulers to \n     cause a Chernobyl-like disaster at a Taiwanese nuclear-power \n     plant.''\n       3. Warheads of mass destruction are within reach of many \n     new missile powers. The Grail for those building mass-\n     destruction weapons is a ``deliverable'' nuclear warhead, one \n     that is small enough and sturdy enough to be launched by a \n     missile. Designing one requires technical sophistication and \n     immensely complex calculations, which is why high-speed \n     supercomputers are vital to advanced weapon designs.\n       Thus, national-security experts were dismayed when the \n     Clinton Administration relaxed supercomputer export \n     guidelines. Since then, U.S. computers capable of bomb design \n     have gone to China and Russia. U.S. officials claim they will \n     keep close track to ensure the technology is used only for \n     civilian purposes. But as Stephen Bryen, a former Pentagon \n     official and an expert on strategic technology transfer, \n     notes, ``It is absurd to believe that in a country bent on \n     developing high-tech weapons, supercomputers will not end up \n     being used by the military.''\n       Meanwhile, countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and North \n     Korea have not ignored the path to a big bang on the cheap: \n     chemical and biological weapons. Pound for pound, poison gas \n     and such deadly germs as anthrax can have the same mass-\n     killing power as a nuclear bomb.\n       A chilling discovery at the end of the Gulf War was Saddam \n     Hussein's huge biochemical arsenal; hundreds of tons were \n     destroyed by U.N. observers. During the war, according to \n     Gen. Hussein Kamil Hasan, Saddam's son-in-law, Iraq got as \n     far as filling warheads with deadly germs such as the cancer-\n     causing aflatoxin.\n       4. Defense against ballistic-missile attack is a practical \n     reality. It's for political, not technological, reasons that \n     the U.S. government has chosen not to build a missile \n     defense. One of the first anti-missile weapons, the Nike-X, \n     was ready by the early 1960s. But, partly as a gesture of \n     good intentions toward the Soviets, then-Defense Secretary \n     Robert McNamara refused to deploy it.\n       This restraint culminated in the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972, which limited both countries' \n     defense systems. Although the Kremlin repeatedly violated the \n     treaty by enlarging its ABM system to protect greater \n     portions of the Soviet Union, by 1976 the United States had \n     closed its sole missile-defense facility in North Dakota.\n       Only when President Ronald Reagan revived interest in an \n     effective defense against ballistic missiles did funding pick \n     up, and the United States went on to make astounding leaps in \n     technology. The Reagan effort pointed to what is acknowledged \n     to be the most elegant and effective technique for killing \n     ICBMs--space-based sensing satellites and interceptor weapons \n     (either lasers or rockets) that find and destroy missiles at \n     their most vulnerable stage: shortly after launch. The space-\n     based system would be augmented by ground-based, hyerfast \n     anti-missile interceptors to ``clean up'' any remaining \n     missiles or warheads.\n       In 1993 a panel of scientists assembled by the American \n     Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) reviewed a \n     ballistic-missile defense system. The AIAA found ``no \n     technical barriers to the development and deployment'' of a \n     workable missile defense.\n       5. The longer we wait, the less time we may have. In \n     November 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order \n     12938, declaring missile proliferation to be a ``national \n     emergency.'' However, every Congressional effort to build a \n     defense against attack has been vetoed by the President or \n     thrown into a limbo of ``further research.''\n       A secret National Intelligence Estimate, prepared for the \n     President last November declared flatly: ``No country, other \n     than the major declared nuclear powers, will develop or \n     otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years \n     that could threaten the contiguous 48 states and Canada.''\n       Intelligence experts immediately pointed out the report's \n     flaws. It virtually ignored Alaska and Hawaii (``They're part \n     of the United States last time I heard, '' says Woolsey); \n     also, it brushed aside existing Russian and Chinese ICBMs and \n     the threat of instability in, or accidental launches from, \n     those countries. At least one freak launch of an armed Soviet \n     missile during routine maintenance has been reported.\n       President Clinton has said ``there is not a single Russian \n     missile pointed at America's children.'' We have no way of \n     verifying this--nor would it mean much, if true. Gen. Igor \n     Sergeyev, head of Russia's strategic missile forces, told CBS \n     News's ``60 Minutes'' that his ICBMs could be retargeted in \n     ``a matter of minutes.'' Indeed, another Russian general told \n     Tass news agency last June that a multiple warhead test just \n     conducted was the 25th launch in the past four years.\n       The Clinton Administration's missile-defense policy rests \n     on two slim pillars. One is the U.S. intelligence program--\n     which, says the report to the President, will spot missile \n     programs ``many years before deployment.'' But Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory physicist and missile expert Gregory \n     Canavan points out that intelligence analysts were completely \n     surprised by Iraq's big 1989 missile test. Analysts also \n     thought Iraq was five years away from building a nuclear \n     weapon; documents and equipment uncovered after the Gulf War \n     showed Iraq was about two years away.\n       The other pillar of the Clinton defense is the ABM treaty. \n     However, this agreement--negotiated with a national entity \n     that no longer exists--does not reflect the spread of \n     ballistic missiles to dozens of nations around the globe. By \n     bending over backward to comply with the treaty, the United \n     States has purposely blunted what small air defense it has. \n     This may already have cost American lives.\n       On the night of February 25, 1991, in the midst of the Gulf \n     War, a Scud missile was fired from Iraq. The launch was \n     picked up by American surveillance satellites, which computed \n     the missile's speed and direction. The pooled information \n     revealed the target area--Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where \n     American forces were stationed.\n       This vital information was transmitted almost instantly \n     back to earth--but not to Dhahran's two batteries of Patriot \n     missiles, upgraded anti-aircraft weapons intended to provide \n     battle-zone missile defense. Because of concerns about ABM \n     treaty compliance, the data went to the U.S. Space Command \n     headquarters near Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\n     There, analysts were supposed to evaluate the information and \n     send it on to Saudi Arabia--a time-consuming process in the \n     short life of a launched missile.\n       On that night, analysts were so unsure of the data that \n     they didn't even phone a warning to the Patriot batteries. \n     There was no attempt to intercept the missile, which hit a \n     temporary barracks, killing 28 GIs.\n       Surveys show that the public believes the United States can \n     ``shoot down'' incoming missiles. But if an ICBM were fired \n     at the United States today, here is what would happen:\n       A vast network of reconnaissance satellites would detect \n     the launch, compute its speed and predict its trajectory and \n     approximate area of impact. Ground-based radars would track \n     it. Then . . .\n       Nothing.\n       Untold numbers of Americans might die from a nuclear, \n     chemical or biological strike.\n       Surely, no treaty, no faith in our ability to see over the \n     political and technological horizon, should be allowed to \n     stand in the way of a missile defense that would prevent this \n     horrible outcome.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12263-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12265-S12266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to discuss the Medicare Program. Restoring solvency to the \nU.S. Medicare Program is the greatest domestic challenge that the \nCongress will face when we reconvene in January 1997.\n  The Medicare Program is in deep trouble. The latest report is \nentitled, ``Status of Social Security and Medicare Programs, a Summary \nof the 1996 Annual Reports.'' This is submitted by the trustees of the \nMedicare Program and the Social Security Program. I will restrict my \nremarks to the Medicare Program.\n  According to this report, the hospital insurance trust fund--that is \nthe program that pays for the hospital bills for individuals on \nMedicare--will run out of money by the year 2001.\n  How far away is 2001? That is 4 years from this coming January. The \ntrust fund is currently spending more money than it receives in \nrevenues. Even now, more money is going out than is coming in.\n  According to a recent report, this shortfall is increasing at a rapid \nrate. The trust fund lost more than $3 billion--I would like to repeat \nthat, Mr. President--the trust fund lost more than $3 billion in the \nmonth of August, according to the Treasury Department. That was a loss \ntwice as high as the deficit occurred in August, 1995.\n  The Medicare part B program--what I have been discussing up to now is \nthe part A program, the hospitalization. The part B program, which pays \ndoctor's bills for our senior citizens, faces equally dismal fiscal \nproblems. Unlike the hospitals' insurance program, this part of \nMedicare is voluntary. Retirees choose to participate. They then pay \npremiums into the system. And the premiums then go toward paying their \ndoctor's bills.\n  However, the premiums paid by the participants in the part B program \nfall far short of paying for the cost of the program. When the program \nwas set up it was never designed that the premiums that the retirees \npay would cover the cost of the part B program, namely the doctor's \nbills. It started out that the individual's premiums would pay 50 \npercent of the cost of the program and the other 50 percent of the cost \nof the program would come from the general fund of the United States, \nfrom ordinary tax and other revenues that go into the general fund. \nThat was 50-50.\n  Currently, by law, only a fourth of the program's costs are covered \nby the premiums. Twenty-five percent now is covered by the premiums \nthat are paid by the beneficiaries. The remaining 75 percent is paid \nfor from general tax revenues. In other words, Mr. President, we have \nthe strange situation as follows. Income taxes paid by factory workers, \nor the secretary in some office, or the janitors sweeping the floors \nand waxing the floors, their income taxes pay 75 percent of the \ndoctor's bills for our seniors. And this is true regardless of whether \nthe senior is somebody living on a very modest income or a \nmultimillionaire. So multimillionaires who are retired, on Medicare, \nhave three-fourths of their doctor's bills paid by ordinary citizens, \nscrimping away, paying dutifully their income taxes.\n  The part B expenditures have been increasing at a rapid rate for many \nyears, and are projected to nearly triple as a share of the Nation's \neconomy by the year 2020. In other words, these costs are escalating as \npart of the total expenditures in our country. They are going up and up \nand up. And they will triple some 25 years from now.\n  Because the general fund pays 75 percent of these costs, as just \noutlined, the Medicare Program will drain an ever increasing amount of \nresources away from other important Federal programs. The more that \ngoes out into this program for doctor's bills paid by the general fund, \nthe less there is in the general fund to pay for education, and health \ncare, Head Start programs, crime prevention, FBI, whatever it might be.\n  Early next century, starting in 2000, just some 4 years from now, the \nbaby-boom generation will begin to reach retirement age and, as a \nconsequence, start to demand benefits from the Medicare Program. They \nwill reach 65. They will want what others have. The current Medicare \nProgram, however, will be unable to meet those demands. It is essential \nthat we begin to reform Medicare next year. We cannot wait any longer. \nSo the changes we put in place can be instituted over a relatively long \nperiod. The longer we wait, the harder it is to institute the reforms \nthat are necessary under Medicare.\n\n  If we make these changes starting next year, it will have two \nimportant benefits. It will allow future retirees to plan for the new \nsystem, in other words, if there are going to be changes then those \nabout to retire can make some plans; and, second, as I mentioned \nbefore, it will provide some lead time so that the savings needed to \nrestore solvency can be achieved.\n  It is also imperative that any reform of the Medicare Program be done \non a bipartisan basis. The political stakes are simply too high for \nthis program to be left at one party or the other's doorsteps. We have \nto be in this together. All of us, Democratic and Republican Senators, \nare going to have to take difficult votes on Medicare if the program is \ngoing to survive. Both parties, away from the campaign trail, do now \nrecognize the need to reduce the Medicare spending.\n  For example, the President's last balanced budget proposal included \nreforms to Medicare that would have yielded $124 billion of savings \nover 6 years. That was the President's program, $124 billion of savings \nover 6 years. The final Republican plan proposed savings of $168 \nbillion. The President's savings, $124 billion; the Republican final \nplan, $168 billion. Obviously, there is a figure somewhere in the \nmiddle of this range on which Republicans and Democrats can agree.\n  There already has been put together a bipartisan plan. That was the \ncentrist coalition balanced budget plan which Senator Breaux and I and \nothers offered earlier this year. Some 20 of our colleagues joined with \nus to submit this program with important programmatic reforms to the \nMedicare system.\n\n  What did it do? It opened avenues for savings by allowing seniors to \nchoose private managed care plans. And it created a new payment system \nto encourage the growth in the availability and accessibility of such \nplans. It called for slower growth in payments to hospitals, \nphysicians, and other service providers. It called on higher income \nseniors to pay a greater share of the costs of the part B program. No \nlonger, it seems to me, can a multimillionaire have the taxpayers pay \nfor his or her doctor's bills just because he or she is on Medicare.\n  Finally, it increased the Medicare eligibility age to conform with \nthe increase in the Social Security eligibility age which will begin in \nthe year 2003. Starting in 2003, the age for retirement under Social \nSecurity will go up gradually. And we increase the eligibility age for \nMedicare to conform with that.\n  Together these reforms would reduce Medicare expenditures by $154 \nbillion over the next 7 years. This was a fair\n\n[[Page S12266]]\n\nand a balanced plan. I am pleased it received bipartisan support. And \n46 Members of this body, 46 out of the 100 Senators, voted for that \nplan: 22 Republicans, 24 Democrats.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that it appears that we can once again \nnext year convene our centrist coalition with the able leadership of \nSenator Breaux on the Democratic side, while I will be pleased to rally \nthe Republican Members. I am convinced we can once again come forward \nwith constructive solutions to the Medicare challenges.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would stress this. Members of this body \nare now scattering to 50 different States. All of them are going to be \ninvolved in the campaigns either as candidates themselves, or as \nhelping those from their parties in their own States.\n  It is my earnest hope, Mr. President, that the Senators seeking \nreelection and, indeed, all Senators will not lock themselves into such \npositions that would prevent them from taking the necessary votes that \nare going to be required if we are going to reform the Medicare Program \nnext year.\n  If we do not reform this program, if no one wants to touch it because \nit is too much of a hot potato, if it is regarded as the third rail \nwhich nobody can touch, leave it alone, then absolute disaster will \nface Medicare--the Medicare Program in the future.\n  So I again urge all my colleagues, those seeking reelection, those \nwho are not even Senators yet but are challengers, not to get \nthemselves into such a position that they are prevented from taking the \ntough votes that are required to reform the Medicare Program so that it \nwill be there for future beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I see that no one else is desiring to speak at this \ntime and, therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent to that I be recognized for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12265-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12266-S12267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BIPARTISAN LEGISLATING\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take the floor to first commend one of \nour previous speakers this afternoon, the Senator from Rhode Island, \nthe distinguished John Chafee, who worked as one of our leaders in a \ntruly bipartisan fashion in the last Congress in our mainstream \ncoalition, the so-called Chafee-Breaux coalition. We had an equal \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans who really worked very hard \ntogether to try to address some of the problems facing this country \nwith the inability of the Congress to really come together in any kind \nof a bipartisan fashion.\n  I have been in this business a relatively long number of years, and I \nthink it becomes increasingly evident to me, and I think to many \nothers, what the American people want us to do is to resolve our \ndifferences in a manner that makes sense, that is fair to the average \nAmerican, and that gets the job done. More and more, people back home \nin my State of Louisiana want Congress to just make Government work. \nThey elect us to do that. Yet they see so many times we seem to be \nengaged more in partisan battles that end up in stalemates and \nGovernment shutdowns, and people back home wonder whether what we do up \nhere makes any sense at all.\n  One of the bright spots in this Congress was the opportunity that I \nhad to work with many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle as \nwell as on the Republican side of the aisle in that mainstream \ncoalition, the so-called Chafee-Breaux organization. I think we really \nmade some progress. We came very close to actually adopting a budget. \nWe got 46 votes in the Senate on a package that was a real effort in \nMedicare reform, Medicaid reform, and it had a tax cut in it. It had an \nadjustment to the Consumer Price Index, which most economists agree is \nincorrect and does not properly state the amount of inflation for the \nentitlement program adjustment.\n  So we really, I think, went a long way toward getting a job done. We \nbrought that package to the floor. It had welfare reform in it. It was \ndebated. We had a surprisingly large number of votes from both sides of \nthe aisle that said, yes, it is about time we move in this direction.\n  I was very proud of that effort, and I commend the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and everybody who worked in that effort. Unfortunately, many of \nthe Members who worked with us are not going to be back in the next \nCongress because they have decided to voluntarily retire from Senate \nservice, and they are going to be missed. Each and every one of them \nwas a major contributor to this effort. While their physical presence \nmay be missed, I think the work they have helped us begin will still be \nwith us in the next Congress. Their advice and assistance and \nrecommendations, I hope, will still be forthcoming because they were \nvery valuable members of our group this year and can be of very \nvaluable assistance in a positive fashion in the next Congress.\n  So, having said that, I wish to also point out that there will be \nanother day to bring this effort to the floor in the next Congress. We \ncertainly intend to continue our organization, to continue our group, \nto see if we cannot bridge that gap between the two different aisles to \nform coalitions from the center out. I am absolutely convinced that the \nonly way we solve difficult problems in any kind of a parliamentary \nbody is by working from the center out in order to form a majority \ncoalition. I am absolutely convinced that you can never start from the \nfar left and hope to get a majority, nor can you start from the far \nright and ever hope to put together a majority on just about anything. \nBut if you start from the middle and work out and gradually pick up \nmore and more people, one day you find you have a majority, which is \nwhat a democracy demands from all of us. The people demand we make \nGovernment work. Hopefully, in the next Congress, we will be able to \ncontinue that effort and be even more successful than we were in this \nendeavor in this Congress.\n\n  My colleague from Rhode Island talked a little bit about Medicare. \nThat is one of the real challenges we are going to face in the next \nCongress. Medicare is so easy to politicize, and both sides have \ncontributed to that effort. We have scared people about the collapse of \nthe Medicare system. We have scared people about not adequately funding \nit. People must be very confused.\n  I remember the story quite well when we were doing the debate on \nhealth care reform and we had the Clinton plan and there was a lot of \ndiscussion about it being too large, too much too soon, and all of \nthose things.\n  I remember coming back home to New Orleans and having a lady come up \nto me in the airport and say, ``You are all working on that health care \nreform back in Washington?'' I said, ``Yes, ma'am, we are.'' She said, \n``Whatever you do, don't let the Federal Government take over my \nMedicare.'' I said, ``OK. We won't let that happen.''\n  Medicare is a Federal program. It was passed under the administration \nof 1965. It is run by the people in Washington. It is totally a Federal \nprogram. She loved it, but she sure did not want the Federal Government \nhaving anything to do with it, although the Federal Government had \neverything to do with it. So people are very concerned about this \nissue, and I think that we have to be careful and try to not politicize \nit as we are all guilty of doing too often.\n  The facts are very scary. These are the facts. They are not \nDemocratic facts or Republican facts. These are just facts about what \nis going to happen to Medicare from which so many seniors and their \nchildren benefit directly because mom and dad and grandfather and \ngrandmother are taken care of.\n  We have a heck of a problem facing us. The hospital insurance fund, \nthe so-called part A of Medicare that pays for the hospital insurance, \nwhich is financed by a 2.9-percent payroll tax, which is awfully high, \nequally divided between workers and their employers--part B, of course, \ncovers doctor bills--the latest figures we have show that\n\n[[Page S12267]]\n\nunder part A, hospital insurance, how much we spend is exceeding how \nmuch we take in to such an extent that the trust fund, which now has a \nsurplus of $121 billion, will be almost completely depleted by the year \n2000.\n  That is not that far from now--completely depleted. The trust fund of \n$121 billion is gone in the year 2000, and it will run a deficit, which \nmeans we will not have enough money to pay the bills of up to $53 \nbillion the next year, the year 2001, unless we make some changes.\n\n  CBO has projected the net Medicare outlays under the current law will \nincrease at an average rate of 9.3 percent between this year and the \nyear 2002. So we are going to be spending more money, and yet we are \nrapidly depleting the fund from which that money comes.\n  Our bill last year was one of three main proposals. The President's \nproposal called for savings of $116 billion; the Breaux-Chafee, Chafee-\nBreaux proposal had a savings of $154 billion over 7 years, and the \nRepublican budget plan called for savings of $270 billion.\n  There is one thing that is certain and nobody should disagree: We are \ngoing to have to do something, and it is not going to be easy. It is \ngoing to be painful. We can make it less political and less painful if \nwe try to bring together organizations and come from the center aisle \nout to come up with something that works.\n  Let us face it. It is a very inefficient system. The lady in New \nOrleans loved it, but she was not talking about how inefficient it is. \nIt is inefficient because it is an old-style program. It is called fee-\nfor-service. You send the bill; we pay the bill. No matter what the \nbill is, we pay it basically. Every other type of medical delivery \nsystem in this country is using innovative new programs--HMO's, \npreferred provider organizations, POS's, other types of innovative ways \nof delivering health care that has brought together a great deal of \ncompetition.\n  No. 1, we have to expand the options for Medicare beneficiaries, give \nthem more choices, let the choices be more competitive and all aimed at \nproviding quality service while at the same time doing it at a better \nprice. So, we have to encourage the growth of managed care and have \nmore alternatives for individuals than we have had in the past. Those \nare some of the things that we need to be looking at.\n\n  There are a whole bunch of options we put forth in our proposal, the \nChafee-Breaux bill. We are going to be revisiting that in the next \nCongress. Today, obviously, is not the day or time to outline a \ncomprehensive list on what we need to do with Medicare. Suffice it to \nsay that both sides together, Democrats and Republicans, have to \nrealize that this has to be one of our priorities in the early part of \nthe next Congress.\n  I would, frankly, like to see the new President-elect--I hope that it \nis the President of my party, the incumbent President, but should the \nformer Majority Leader Dole be elected, so be it--but whoever it is, I \nsuggest very strongly that immediately following the election they \nimmediately consider appointing a commission to take a look at this and \nhave a recommendation ready for us when we get back in January. Why \nwaste November, December, and January just talking about this issue? I \nsuggest whoever wins on November 5, one of the first things they do is \ncall for a bipartisan commission to begin work to present them with a \nrecommendation when the new Congress begins so we can start from day \none trying to forge a compromise that gets the job done in a number of \nentitlement areas, particularly in Medicare. We certainly have our work \ncut out for us.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you, very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12266-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE PARKS BILL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we sit here and watch the clock move \nforward as we close this Senate. I have been involved in the last \nseveral days in trying to get the parks bill before we leave. Forty-one \nStates have park projects in this bill. It is extremely important to so \nmany. We have been literally working round the clock to try to come to \nsome agreement. Senator Bradley, myself, Senator Murkowski, Leon \nPanetta, and his staff have been virtually working on this full time \nfor the last several days. We do not yet have an agreement. We are \nclose to an agreement.\n  But there is a very important concept in the letter from the \nadministration to Senator Murkowski that deals with ensuring that all \napplicable laws would pertain to the Tongass. This is a sticking point \nat this moment.\n  Mr. President, I just come here to express my public wish that we can \ncome together on this matter because it seems to me that it would be \ntragic if we couldn't come together when we are so close and we lose \nover 100 parks because one Senator felt that the wording didn't \naccurately reflect his view. I really feel that when we negotiate with \none another--and it is very difficult to do it--that we know that \nunderlying everything the laws of the United States of America will \napply to whatever we do. So whether it was stated, or whether it was \nstated in writing or not, it should not, it seems to me, be a breaking \npoint.\n  It has been a very long negotiation. I still have hope, although I \nhave to say I think it is a 50-50 situation at this point. I hope that \nwe can close this U.S. Senate out with a fitting tribute to the people \nwe all serve, and pass this parks bill.\n  I just hope that we can come together. None of us gets everything we \nwant in life. Certainly there are many things which I have been working \nfor that are not reflected in this bill, and I will come back another \nday to fight those battles.\n  But when the House of Representatives gets to pass a bill with only \n40 dissenting votes--I hope the majority leader and the minority leader \nagree--it seems to me that this U.S. Senate should be able to do the \nsame thing.\n  We should try to help each other gain the respect we all deserve for \nour points of view but at the end of the day--and at the end of this \nday and at the end of this session--we ought to bring home a parks \nbill.\n  Mr. President, for me it has been a very exciting Congress in many \nways, and toward the end, it was able to pick up some steam, and we \nwere able to be more bipartisan. I only hope that in the next hour or \nso we will come together, and that we will get a parks bill that gives \nus all comfort. I say ``gives us all comfort'' because it is a good \nbill. It is a bipartisan bill, and it is what we were sent here to do.\n  Thank you, very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12267-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12267-S12268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I see that the Senator from Georgia has \ncome to the floor. This is an opportunity for me.\n  I put a statement in the Record as a tribute to all of the Senators \non both sides of the aisle who are leaving.\n  But I want to tell the Senator from Georgia how much I am going to \nmiss his advice and counsel on issues that deal with security, and how \nmuch I respect his quiet dignity, his quiet leadership, and how much I \nwish him well and his family. I know, as Senator Bradley said \nyesterday, as he quoted a very famous poem, that he has miles to go \nbefore he sleeps. For Senator Bradley, Senator Nunn, and all of the \nother Senators who are leaving us--and as I said to Senator Bradley--I \nhope you will not need to take time out for a nap, let alone sleep, \nbecause we need the leadership that these great Senators have provided \nus on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

I have thoroughly enjoyed \nserving with the Senator from California, as well as the personal \nfriendship that we developed,\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\nparticularly since she has been in the Senate, but even before in \nconference committees that we had between the House and the Senate.\n  I enjoyed our affiliation, and I will be looking forward to the \nfuture years of excellent leadership by the Senator from California as \nI view this great body on C-SPAN, and as I watch the activities and \nfollow the daily events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12267-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE PARKS BILL\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I might also add that I completely support \nthe expressed desire and wish of the Senator from California that we \npass a parks bill.\n  Interestingly enough, one of my campaign commitments is yet \nuncompleted since 1972. It is sort of hard to admit that it is still \noutstanding after 24 years. In that bill is the Chickamauga-Chattanooga \nNational Park. That is the site of the famous Civil War battle where \nthe road has to be taken out of the park because traffic is basically \ninterfering with the park. This bill has the authorization requiring \nthe completion of that project.\n  It is my hope that the Senate, before it adjourns, will help me carry \nout that very important campaign commitment that has been pending now \nfor 24 years.\n  So I share the Senator's sentiments and thank her for her kind \nremarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12268-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12268-S12269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A SPECIAL WORD OF APPRECIATION TO THE STAFF\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress and my own Senate \ncareer draw to a close today, I want to say a special word of \nappreciation to our terrific floor staff and our support staff for all \nof their help to the Members and staff of the Armed Services Committee \nand to me personally during the past 2 years, and, indeed, during my \nentire Senate career.\n  I chaired the Armed Services Committee for 8 years and was ranking \nDemocrat on that committee for 2 years before I became the chairman. \nDuring the last 2 years, I have been the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee under Senator Thurmond's leadership.\n  So for 12 years of my Senate career, I have worked constantly with \nthe floor staff. I observed them before that time. In these last 12 \nyears, I have developed a very acute understanding and appreciation for \ntheir splendid service.\n  A great deal of work in the Senate takes place in the Senate \ncommittees. We know that. But the culmination of the completion of \nlegislative process occurs right here on the Senate floor; always has, \nand always will.\n  Our guests in the gallery and the people who watch television around \nthe country understand--because they watch and hear the procedures--\nthat the legislative procedure on the Senate floor is complicated. It \nalways has been. Maybe we can make it simpler. It always will be \ncomplicated because parliamentary rules in a democracy are complicated.\n  The sequencing of legislation, the filing and adopting of amendments, \nadvising the Presiding Officer and individual Senators of parliamentary \nprocedures, the taking down of every word that is spoken on the Senate \nfloor--as our reporters do so well every day, even in the heat of \ndebate--are all essential ingredients of the legislative process on the \nSenate floor. This process could not take place without the dedicated \nwork of extraordinarily capable and talented staff members.\n  Our Democratic floor staff works under the direction of Marty Paone, \nthe Secretary to the Minority. Marty stepped into some pretty big shoes \nwhen he took over from his predecessor and long-time valuable Senate \nstaff member, Abby Saffold, but those shoes fit Marty very well today. \nMarty's thorough knowledge of the details of the legislative process \nhave made him indispensable to the U.S. Senate. Marty has always been \navailable to me and to my staff to provide counsel and assistance \nwhenever we needed that assistance. I especially appreciate Marty's \nsupport in ensuring prompt consideration of the thousands of \nnominations that the Armed Services Committee reports every year.\n  On the staff of the Democratic leader Senator Daschle, John Hilley, \nwho left last year to become the Assistant to the President for \nLegislative Affairs; Peter Rouse, Senator Daschle's Chief of Staff; \nLarry Stein and Randy DeValk have worked very effectively with the \nArmed Services Committee Members and staff on national security issues \nand legislation.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say enough about the excellent day-to-day \nsupport we have had from Democratic floor staff of Brad Austin, Gary \nMyrick, Paul Brown, and Kelly Riordan who recently left the Senate \nstaff. These individuals work under the leadership of our highly \ncapable chief Democratic floor assistant, Lula Davis. I believe Lula is \nin the Chamber now. Lula is not only terrific in her leadership role; \nshe always has time for a friendly word or often a humorous remark to \nput our heavy burdens in the proper perspective. Lula is even \nthoughtful enough to point out when the senior Senator from Georgia is \nwearing a tie that is ``off color and out of style''. Unfortunately, \nthat sometimes occurs every day of the week. I am grateful for that \nkind of candid and frank advice from Lula in her leadership role. That \nprobably is a little out of the scope of duty, but nevertheless it is \nappreciated.\n  Managing and passing defense authorization bills and other \nlegislation in the Senate becomes more challenging every year. Lula, \nBrad, Gary, and Paul are terrific individuals, are great staff, and \nhave always been indispensable in assisting us move our committee bills \nthrough the Senate.\n  I also want to thank our excellent Democratic cloakroom staff of \nLeonard Oursler, Christine Krasow, Paul Cloutier, and Brian Griffin. \nThey must get asked about 1,000 times a week ``When is the next vote? \nWhen are we going to get out? What time do we adjourn?'' Of course, \nthey do not always know, but they always give you a good answer and \ntheir best assessment. They never fail to cheerfully respond to that or \nany other question even though it may have been answered by them 100 to \n1,000 times a day. Their selfless and dedicated service has made all of \nour jobs easier. Certainly, it has made mine easier during the entire \ntime I have been in the Senate.\n  I should also note that while not working with them on a day-to-day \nbasis as we do with our own floor staff, the Republican floor staff \nunder the Secretary of the Majority Liz Greene has always worked with \nus to resolve any problems or issues associated with our committee's \nwork. I must also note that Howard Greene was very helpful to me on \nmany occasions and to the committee when he served as the Secretary of \nthe Majority.\n  Legislative Clerk Scott Bates and his assistant David Tinsley; Bill \nClerk Kathie Alvarez and her assistants Mary Anne Clarkson and Danielle \nFling; and Enrolling Clerk Tom Lundregan and his assistant Charlene \nMcDevitt are an indispensable part of the legislative process on the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. President, I frankly do not know how they do it sometimes, but \nthey are able to keep track of all the amendments on major bills and \nproduce a complete Senate bill in a very short time.\n  Executive Clerk David Marcos and his assistant Michelle Haynes keep \ntrack of thousands of nominations that the Armed Services Committee and \nother committees of the Senate act on each year. We are deeply indebted \nto these capable people.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to the Senate Parliamentarian \nBob Dove, and members of his office: Alan Frumin, Kevin Kayes, and \nSally Goffinet, as well as their predecessors since I served in the \nSenate. When I came to the Senate, Dr. Floyd Riddick was the \nParliamentarian, and he was succeeded by Murray Zweben, both of whom \nwere excellent and took many, many hours of time to help junior \nSenators, like the Senator from Georgia, when we first arrived in the \nSenate. We were so desirous and in need of parliamentary advice. All of \nthe Parliamentarian staff have consistently provided objective and \ntimely answers to the many questions I have had over the years. I think \nthat is true of other Senators and certainly true of our staffs as they \nhave sought advice day in and day out.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I thank all of the official reporters of \ndebate that takes place in the Chamber under the direction of Chief \nReporter Ron Kavulick and all of the staff members who have the awesome \nresponsibility of producing the verbatim transcript of the Senate's \nproceedings. Journal Clerks Bill Lackey, Mark Lacovara,\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nand Patrick Keating, and Daily Digest Editor Thom Pellikaan and his \nassistants Linda Sebold and Kim Longsworth also play a key role in \nmaking the record of all of the activities of the Senate available to \nthe public.\n\n  I am certain that I have left someone out in this listing of \nindispensable people, but certainly I intend to include all of the \nstaff in my praise. The words that are spoken on the Senate floor and \nthe action that the Senate takes will be preserved for history long \nafter we are gone, thanks to these talented individuals who work \nmiracles under extraordinary deadlines every day.\n  In summary, Mr. President, my final words in this Chamber are simply \na thank you--a thank you to all the staff members who support the day-\nto-day activities on this Senate floor, for their dedicated service to \nthe Senate and to our Nation. They, indeed, make this Republic work. \nThey make the democratic system work. Everyone who follows the work of \nthis great body should understand that the Senate could not function \nwithout the tremendous effort and professionalism these staff members \nprovide.\n  I close by thanking my own personal staff that arrived with me in \n1972, and those that depart with me in 1996, as well as those who will \nremain and serve in other offices and those who have left during the \ninterim. I have had a remarkable personal staff. I have had a \nremarkable Armed Services Committee staff. I thank the staff members of \nthe Armed Services Committee on the Democratic side and also on the \nRepublican side who have been so faithful to their duties.\n  I have also had a remarkable staff on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations all of these years. I inherited that subcommittee and \nbecame acting chairman under the guidance of Senator Henry ``Scoop'' \nJackson, one of our all-time great Senators. I have been associated \nwith the subcommittee since about 1976, either as the vice chairman, \nacting chairman, chairman, or ranking Democrat on the committee under \nSenator Roth.\n  Mr. President, it has been a real pleasure working with all of these \nstaff members, and I wish all of them continued success in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Senate, I will not name \neach of you as there are so many Senators who I have been privileged to \nhave been associated--like my good friend, Senator Warner, is in the \nChamber and others. I have served with a number of giants in the annals \nof Senate history.\n  I was in a seminar about 2 weekends ago. Some of the most \ndistinguished people in the country were gathered together, famous \nauthors who had written books, playwrights, people who succeeded \nfabulously in business, chief executive officers in corporations, \nfamous sports figures, including Ray Floyd and Jack Nicklaus, great \ngolfers. I looked around the room, and I was, of course, winding down \nmy career. I asked myself the question, ``Would you swap the last 24 \nyears with any of these people, some of whom are fabulously wealthy, \nand most of whom are very famous?'' My answer was, ``No, I would not \nswap the last 24 years of service in the Senate with the service that \nany other person in this country or, indeed, in the world has \nrendered.''\n  My service in the Senate and my service to the people of Georgia has \nbeen a very special privilege and certainly the highest honor of my \nlife.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12268-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12269-S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ON LEAVING THE U.S. SENATE\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this will be my final speech as I conclude \n18 years in the U.S. Senate. Measured in length, it may be my best in \nthe opinion of many of my valued colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  What will I miss? Not the Washington DC morning traffic, and driving \nthe obstacle courses. My Ford Taurus will get a reprieve from this pot \nhole capital of the world. My pocketbook will be spared from the $35 a \nshot in used hubcap replacement, experienced 10 times in only the last \n2 years. With any luck, the Whitehurst freeway and its tributaries will \nbe fully operable for 90 consecutive days sometime in the 21st century.\n  I leave this place with the confidence that we will continue to build \nour bridges to the future of America on the firm footings of national \nsecurity policy. I have labored on the Armed Services Committee for the \npast 18 years. We won the cold war, after spending a lot of money, \nwithout firing a shot. I suggest that that is the best way to win wars. \nAs the only true superpower of the world, we have the dual \nresponsibility of providing for a strong national defense and, just as \nimportant, using our statute to lead and promote peace and \nunderstanding, including ratification and implementation of \ninternational agreements. To that end, a keen disappointment has been \nthe failure this year to ratify in a timely fashion the chemical \nweapons convention.\n  A bright spot has been the signing at the United Nations 10 days or \nso ago of the compenhensive nuclear test ban treaty. This treaty is one \nthat this Senator has been very much involved with. When I was in New \nYork for that signing event, it was inspiring as a giant leap for \nmankind's survival. An editional from the Omaha World-Herald dated \nSeptember 5, 1996, makes the case very well and I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. In my retirement I will surely miss my Senate colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. However, my loss of personal associations goes \neven further than that. I thank my personal staff here in Washington \nand in my Nebraska offices, many of whom have been with me for all \nthose 18 years and indeed a few who were with me back when I was \nGovernor of Nebraska.\n  The staff of the Budget, Armed Services, and Commerce Committees all \nwere more of personal relationships and coworkers than just staff. The \nsame is true of the Cloakroom personnel who have been so helpful and \nconsiderate over the years.\n  It has been the opportunity of a lifetime to serve in the U.S. Senate \nwhich is a collection of talented and dedicated individuals. I thank \nand appreciate all of you and I thank the people of the great State of \nNebraska for making it possible for me to serve here. God bless and \ngood luck.\n  Thank you, all. All of you have been great, and I shall always be \nindebted to you for your understanding and for your help.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and, for the final time, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n             [From the Omaha World Herald, Sept. 25, 1996]\n\n                      A Step Toward a Safer World\n\n       Leaders of more than 60 nations have given the world a \n     fitting symbol of peace and hope to mark the approach of a \n     new century.\n       On Tuesday, at the United Nations headquarters in New York, \n     they signed a treaty agreeing not to set off nuclear \n     explosions as a means of testing weapons. The signers \n     included the main nuclear powers--the United States, Russia, \n     France, the United Kingdom and China. Also signing were \n     nations, such as Israel, that either have a covert nuclear \n     program or the resources to start a nuclear weapons program \n     if they wanted to.\n       President Clinton signed for the United States. He wrote \n     his name with a pen used by President John Kennedy to sign a \n     limited nuclear test ban treaty in 1963. The gesture in honor \n     of Kennedy was appropriate. Kennedy's 1963 pact eliminated \n     most open-air nuclear tests, as well as tests underwater and \n     in space. Since then, most nuclear testing has been conducted \n     underground. The agreement signed Tuesday adds underground \n     tests to the ban, eliminating testing by explosion. It was \n     hailed as a major step toward the elimination of nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Certainly it would be premature to assert that the total \n     elimination of nuclear weapons is likely, or even practical. \n     India, a potential nuclear power, refused to sign, which is \n     troubling. North Korea and Libya voted against the treaty in \n     the United Nations, an illustration of the danger that \n     remains when law-abiding nations disarm.\n       Caution is essential, as even a leading proponent of \n     nuclear disarmament has written. Robert S. McNamara, who was \n     Kennedy's defense secretary, wrote last year that he believes \n     in total disarmanent ``insofar as is practical.'' With that \n     language, he said, he meant to call attention to ``the \n     necessity of maintaining protection against the covert \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists or nations \n     violating the nuclear disarmanent agreements.''\n       But it's a good time to act. The end of the Cold War and \n     the collapse of communism have brought about a climate in \n     which significant reductions in force can be realisitcally \n     considered. Rising affluence tends to act as a brake on \n     warlike behavior.\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\n     The spread of democracy has reduced tensions. High-speed \n     communications make it harder for dictators to maintain the \n     regimented societies that start was against their neighbors.\n       Kennedy took a risk in 1963 when he limited the ability of \n     the United States to test nuclear weapons at the height of \n     the Cold War. The result was one of his greatest \n     accomplishments. It demonstrated that good-faith negotiations \n     could make the world safer and more secure. A treaty can't \n     convert an evil heart into a good one. But it can reduce \n     misunderstandings that sometimes lead to war.\n       Kennedy's treaty also laid a foundation of understanding on \n     which further agreements could be negotiated. In 1974, the \n     nuclear powers outlawed the testing of the largest nuclear \n     weapons. In the 1980s, the inventory of U.S. and Soviet \n     warheads and delivery systems was cut back in a series of \n     arms-reduction pacts. In the 1990s, the drawdown of warheads \n     continued and the nuclear nonproliferation pact was extended.\n       Yes, the practically of eliminating nuclear weapons may \n     continue to be debated. But it shouldn't be abandoned as a \n     goal. Dramatic progress has been made in the past three \n     decades toward making the world less warlike. More progress \n     can reasonably be assumed, even if it occasionally means \n     taking a calculated risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12269-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, over the course of the more than 40 \nyears I have spent in the U.S. Senate, I have had the good fortune to \nserve with a number of people who have gone from being my colleagues to \nbeing my friends. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one such individual, \nSam Nunn, who I am sad to note is ending his career in this body at the \nconclusion of the 104th Congress.\n  It is perhaps only natural that Sam would come to be one of my \nclosest friends in the Senate, as we have much in common. To begin \nwith, we represent neighboring States, and almost immediately after Sam \narrived in the Senate, we began working together on a number of issues \nthat were, and are, of concern and importance to our constituents. From \n1972 to almost literally this day, Sam and I have cooperated on any \nnumber of matters, such as the Savannah River Site or Fort Gordon, that \naffect both our States. It would probably be safe to say that for many \nresidents of South Carolina, Sam Nunn is like a third Senator to them. \nAdditionally, I served with his great-uncle Carl Vinson, as well as \nwith Sam's predecessor, Richard Russell, both of whom were true legends \nof the U.S. Senate, as well as great Georgians. Finally, we are both \nveterans, Sam served ably in the U.S. Coast Guard and Coast Guard \nReserve, where he helped to protect our shores and maritime interests \nand undoubtedly learned the importance of a modern, well trained, and \nwell equipped military.\n  Without question, I think the bond between Sam and I grew strongest \nduring the years we spent together on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, where we worked together to provide for the defense of the \nNation. In the 24 years he served on that Committee, Sam went from a \nfreshman member to one of the Nation's most knowledgable and respected \nexperts on defense matters. In the process, he became the Committee's \nChairman and Ranking Member, and played an important and influential \nrole in the shaping of American defense policy during the cold War, and \npost-cold war eras. I have known no small number of committee chairmen \nin my time, and I certainly rank Sam Nunn as one of the most able and \ndedicated men to hold a position of such importance and responsibility.\n  Mr. President, Sam Nunn is known by the media, the public, and by his \ncolleagues in Congress as a seriousminded individual, who approaches \nmatters before him critically and carefully. Undoubtedly, his training \nas a lawyer and his service as a member of the Georgia House of \nRepresentatives, helped prepare him for his duties in the U.S. Senate. \nDuring his time in this Body, Sam Nunn has represented the people of \nhis State thoroughly and effectively, and he helped to turn the \nAmerican military into the finest fighting force that history has \nknown. I know that come January, I will miss Sam both as a colleague \nand friend, but I also know that I am glad he has spent the last 24 \nyears in the Senate, and I am certain that he will continue to work to \ninfluence public policy and to ensure that the United States remains \nthe strongest Nation in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12270-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, perhaps one of the greatest \ncharacteristics of our form of government is that it encourages \nliterally anybody and everybody to seek elected office. As a result, we \nhave avoided the creation of an elite ruling class, and the men and \nwomen who represent us in public office are individuals of diverse, \ninteresting, and unique backgrounds. Just look to the 100 members of \nthis Body and you will find a richly varied collection of experience \nand professions among our colleagues, and Senator Bill Bradley has \nperhaps the most unique background of our colleagues.\n  Though not a native son of the Garden State, Bill Bradley has been a \npart of New Jersey and the Northeast since his days as a history \nstudent at Princeton University. Clearly his time on that campus helped \nto influence how he would spend his years as an adult. A star member of \nthe Tigers basketball team, Bill would serve as the Captain of the 1964 \nOlympic basketball team and eventually go on to play professional \nbasketball for the New York Knicks for 10 years. Bill's excellence was \nnot limited to under the baskets, his performance as a student earned \nhim a coveted Rhodes Scholarship to the prestigious Oxford University \nwhere he received a master's degree.\n  For the past 18 years, Bill Bradley has ably represented the people \nof New Jersey in this Body. During his career as a Senator, Bill has \nbrought many of the traits he learned on the basketball courts, and in \nthe halls of two of the world's greatest learning institutions, to this \nChamber. Without question, he is a careful student of the issues that \ncome before the Senate, and he is always a thoughtful contributor to \nour debates. In particular, he is a forceful and passionate advocate \nfor matters that are particularly close to his heart, which include \neconomic development, the environment, education, fighting crime, and \npromoting racial harmony and equality.\n  Mr. President, despite his popularity, Senator Bradley has decided \nnot to seek a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. While we will miss his \nparticipation in the National debate, I am certain that he will \ncontinue to seek ways in which to serve New Jersey and the United \nStates. I join my friends and colleagues in wishing him well in \nwhatever he chooses to pursue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12270-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12270-S12271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, there are certain men and women who \nserve in the U.S. Senate who by their accomplishments or dedication to \ntheir constituents, have become stalwarts of this institution. Senator \nClaiborne Pell of Rhode Island is one such man.\n  For the past 36 years, Claiborne Pell has served capably and \nselflessly in this body, working hard to represent the interests and \nconcerns of his constituents. In the process, he has championed a \nnumber of issues and measures that have become a regular and important \npart of life in America for many of our citizens. Among the \naccomplishments our colleague is most proud of are the establishment of \nPell Grants, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, and the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial. Perhaps more than anything else, though, Senator Pell will be \nremembered for his commitment to the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Given Claiborne's rich background in international affairs, it is not \nsurprising that he should end up as one of this Body's and Nation's \nleading experts on foreign policy. Following his service as an officer \nin the Coast Guard during World War II, Claiborne became a member of \nthe Foreign Service, representing American interests in Czechoslovakia \nand Italy. Undoubtedly this extensive background was most beneficial to \nSenator Pell as he carried out his duties on the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, especially when he became its chairman.\n  A small State such as Rhode Island builds power and prestige through \nseniority, and during his almost four decades in the Senate Claiborne \nPell has worked tirelessly on behalf of his constituents. Without \nquestion, the ``Ocean State'' has benefitted greatly\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\nfrom the dedicated service of its senior, and longest serving, Senator. \nWhoever replaces our friend in this Chamber will have a challenging \ntask in attempting to match the commitment Claiborne Pell brought to \nthis job.\n  Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to have served with Senator \nPell these many years. He is a man of integrity and ability who has \ndone much to make our Nation a better and stronger place. I wish him \ngreat health and much happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12270-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JAMES EXON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I doubt that one can get any closer to \nthe ``Heartland of America'' than Nebraska, a State which lies in the \nmiddle of the Nation and is known for its plain talking, and well \ngrounded people. One man who has exemplified those characteristics \nduring his long and distinguished career in the U.S. Senate is Jim \nExon, who is retiring this year and returning home to the Cornhusker \nState.\n  Jim is of the generation of Americans who are veterans of World War \nII, individuals who understand and honor the notions of public service, \nsacrifice, and patriotism. To men of Senator Exon's generation, there \nis no problem that cannot be solved by rolling up one's sleeves, and \nsitting down and working together toward a resolution. In his three \nterms in the Senate, he repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to \nkeeping America strong, helping our Nation's farmers, and ensuring that \nour rural citizens had a voice in Congress.\n  Nebraskans have been well served by this Senator during the past 18 \nyears, because he was well prepared for the responsibilities and \ndemands of the U.S. Senate. A veteran, Jim's military experience taught \nhim how to be tough, self-resilient, and achieve goals and objectives. \nAs a businessman, Jim learned the importance of meeting a payroll and \noperating without undue interference from the Government. As the \nGovernor of Nebraska, he combined his military and business experiences \nto be one of that State's most successful chief executives, earning two \nterms in that office, which was followed by his election to the U.S. \nSenate in 1978.\n  For the past eighteen years, I have had the pleasure of serving with \nJim on the Senate Armed Services Committee. In his capacity as a member \nof that Committee, Jim has worked hard to help provide for the defense \nof the United States, and to ensure that our men and women in uniform \nhave the resources they need to do their jobs, and to meet any threat, \nanywhere. Without question, his experiences as a soldier and non-\ncommissioned officer in the World War II Pacific Theater certainly \nhelped to shape how he approached making defense policy.\n  Mr. President, Senator Jim Exon has served his State and Nation \nadmirably and selflessly. He stands as an excellent example of the \ntraditions of public service, and I hope that men and women in Nebraska \nand throughout the United States will follow the lead he has set to \nmake America a better and stronger place for all her citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12271-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on the nights when the Senate remains in \nsession well past when most others have gone to bed, when tempers are \nshort and most Members are frustrated that we have not made more \nprogress, those are the times when a sense of humor really comes in \nhandy. One colleague who consistently manages to find a bright spot \nwhen others only seem gloom, and who is able to find a humor in almost \nany situation, is our friend from Arkansas, David Pryor.\n  David has capably represented the people of Arkansas as their \nGovernor, and in both Houses of Congress. His career in our Nation's \nCapitol began in 1966 when he was first elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, and where he served in four Congresses. In 1979, he \nmoved across the Hill to the Senate where he is about to complete his \nthird term in office. Through his position on several key committees, \nDavid has been able to work to make Arkansas an even better place to \nlive, and I know his constituents are thankful for his efforts.\n  Though David and I did not share any committee assignments, I have \nenjoyed serving with him in the Senate these many years. The \n``Sheriff'', as I liked to call him as his father held that office in \nArkansas, always approached his duties with enthusiasm and dedication, \nand he upheld the finest traditions of this institution. David is truly \na gentleman of the South, and I know that he will be missed by his many \nfriends here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, given the great number of successes Senator Pryor has \nenjoyed throughout his life, I am certain that fate will again smile \nupon him in his career following the Senate. I wish good health and \nhappiness in the years to come and am grateful for having had the \nopportunity to serve with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12271-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12271-S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATE SUPPORT STAFF\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, when one thinks of the U.S. Senate, most \nvisualize this Chamber and the 100 Members as the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. To those of us who serve here though, we know that \nthe Senate actually goes well beyond the floor and galleries found \nwithin these four walls and two stories of the Capitol.\n  One of the best kept secrets of the Senate are the people who work \nhere and support our efforts in making the law. Especially critical to \nthat process are a number of individuals who work with us day in and \nday out. I would like to take a moment to recognize these people and \nthe valuable services they render to us, the U.S. Senate, and the \nNation.\n  This body is all about debate, and the chief Parliamentarian, Bob \nDove, and his assistants are critical to keeping the debate running \nsmoothly. These men and women have the unenviable responsibility of \ninterpreting the exhaustive and sometimes confusing rules of the \nSenate. Without question, anyone who has sat in the President's Chair \nand presided over the Senate has been grateful for the assistance of \nthese men and women when proceedings are suddenly bogged down in a \ntangled web of motions, countermotions, amendments, and objections. \nSomehow or another, the Parliamentarians are always able to sort things \nout and keep everything back on track.\n  Each year thousands of people visit the Senate to observe their \nrepresentatives at work. After getting a taste of what are often dry, \nand somewhat technical discussions, they leave here to tour and enjoy \nthe Smithsonian, the National Galleries of Art, or one of the many \nmonuments around town. The Reporters of the Senate, however, are unable \nto walk away from this Chamber no matter how tedious debate gets. These \nmen and women spend long hours on their feet, faithfully and accurately \nkeeping a transcript of the proceedings of this body. These detailed \nnotes are transcribed and printed in the Congressional Record in the \nmatter of less than 24 hours, a truly impressive feat. Without \nquestion, the men and women who work for chief reporter Ron Kavulick \nare truly worthy of commendation for their seemingly boundless levels \nof energy, and their unfaltering commitment to accuracy.\n  As each of us knows, the responsibilities of a Senator are not \nlimited to this floor. We have committee meetings and hearings, \nleadership meetings, appointments with constituents, and many other \nmatters which command our attention. Still, when it comes time for a \nvote, our place is here. The men and women in the Republican and \nDemocratic Cloakrooms are largely responsible for helping us keep track \nof when measures are coming up, how much debate time has been allocated \nby the leadership, and when we need to be in the Chamber for votes. Our \nlives would be much more hectic if it were not for the helpful service \nof the Cloakroom personnel and I know that I speak for all the Members \non this side of the aisle when I say that Hilary Newlin; Laura Martin; \nBrad Holsclaw; Michael Smythers; and Dave Schiappa all make our lives a \nlittle more organized and we greatly appreciate their efforts. The \nsecretary for the majority, Elizabeth Greene, and her assistant, John \nDoney, can be proud of their cloakroom staff.\n\n  The two people who have been tasked with much of the physical and \nadministrative matters of the Senate for most\n\n[[Page S12272]]\n\nof the 104th Congress were Secretary of the Senate Kelly Johnston, and \nSergeant at Arms Howard Greene. These individuals labored largely \nanonymously, and certainly with little thanks for their efforts; but \nwithout their contributions, we would not have had the many excellent \nand important services that their offices provide to us. Of course, two \nnew people fill these positions, Gary Sisco as Secretary of the Senate, \nand Greg Casey as Sergeant at Arms. We welcome these men to the Senate \nand wish them great success in their careers.\n  On a more personal note, as most of my colleagues probably already \nknow, I have long been an enthusiastic supporter of the Senate Page \nProgram. Bringing young men and women to Washington to witness and \nparticipate in the legislative branch of Government is not only \neducational, but will hopefully encourage these students to aspire to \nposts in public service. It is important to both good government, and \nthe continued well-being of the Republic, that bright, energetic, and \nconcerned individuals get involved in public policy and governing the \nNation. I am confident that the Senate Page Program will serve as a \ncatalyst for some of tomorrow's leaders.\n  Mr. President, I know that there are literally thousands of people \nwho make important contributions to the efficient operation of the U.S. \nSenate and I hope that they will not be offended that I have not \nrecognized them personally.

Mr. President, perhaps one of the greatest hallmarks of \nthe U.S. Senate is the civility of the institution. Though the 100 \nMembers of this body have views on the issues that are often far apart, \nwe debate our differences politely and completely, and more often than \nnot, are able to arrive at a compromise that benefits the majority of \nAmericans. One Senator in particular has repeatedly demonstrated \nhimself to be an individual of great decency and courtesy. This Senator \nis my good friend from Illinois, Paul Simon.\n  Senator Simon has dedicated his adult life to public service. \nBeginning with a stint in the U.S. Army in the early fifties, and soon \nafter his return to civilian life, he was elected to the Illinois house \nin 1954, and then to the Illinois senate in 1962. After his service in \nthe legislature, Paul Simon was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, where he served for 10 years, and played an important \nrole in legislation concerning education, job training, and was \ninstrumental in the establishment of the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children.\n  Since Paul came to the Senate in 1984, we have worked together on \nmany legislative initiatives, especially as we both had seats on the \nJudiciary and Labor and Human Resources Committees.\n  I commend Senator Simon for his willingness to listen to debate with \nan open mind, and for having the resolve to reach an agreement that is \nin the best interest of our Nation. I have enjoyed working with my \nfriend from Illinois through the years, and the Senate will not be the \nsame without him. Unquestionably, Paul has capably served his \nconstituents throughout his tenure, and I wish him and his family much \nsuccess and happiness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12272-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today to the \nsenior Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], who announced last year \nthat he would not seek reelection but that he would remain active in \npublic life.\n  Blessed with both great academic and athletic gifts, Bill Bradley \ngraduated from my alma mater, Princeton University, with honors in \nAmerican history. He won a rhodes scholarship to Oxford University, \nwhere he earned his graduate degree after studying politics, \nphilosophy, and economics. He was best known to many, before he came to \nthe Senate, as a basketball player of tremendous skill and talent.\n  During his career in the Senate, four principles have guided Bill \nBradley. He has sought to restore economic and personal security for \nAmerican families, strengthen our civil society, protect our natural \nheritage and rethink America's role in the world. He has worked toward \nthese goals on the Senate Finance Committee, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.\n  Others may focus on his contributions in the fields of economics and \ntaxes, but I believe he Bill Bradley has been particularly effective in \nbuilding bridges between peoples and spreading the values of \ndemocracy--methods which I also consider the best ways of building \nlasting security and peace.\n  Bill Bradley wrote the 1992 Freedom Exchange Act, the largest U.S. \neducational exchange initiative in history. I understand that more than \n10,000 ``Bradley kids'' have come here from the former Soviet Union to \nstudy and absorb our culture and the lessons for freedom, democracy and \na market economy.\n  The Senate will miss him and his spirit of independence. I am \nconfident that, although he is retiring, he will not be out of public \nlife. Whatever he and his family do, I trust that it will be as \nexciting and rewarding. The Senate, however, will truly miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12272-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the ties that bind us together here often \ntranscend party identity and the affairs of the day, and they \nfrequently span expanses of time and space.\n  Such are the ties on which my friendship with the senior Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] has been based. The initial tie was through his \nfather, our former colleague, Milward L. Simpson, who in his early \nyears--probably while he was a student at Harvard Law School in the \n1920's--earned high repute as a tutor. And among the students he \ntutored with great effectiveness, were the children of my uncle, \nClarence Pell. So I feel that my friendship with Senator Alan Simpson \nbegan long ago with this family association.\n  Alan Simpson brought to his work here in the Senate rare attributes \nof grace and good humor--qualities which help immeasurably in \nfacilitating the often contentious and trying process of political \naccommodation. To my mind, these qualities of mind and spirit, which do \nso much to promote comity and civility, are almost as important as the \nsubstance of the great good work that Alan Simpson has done in the \nfields of immigration reform, veterans affairs, and entitlement reform. \nIndeed, his success as a legislator is attributable in no small measure \nto the refreshing traits of character which he brought to the effort. \nMost important of all is his wonderful sense of humor--a quality often \nlacking in this body.\n  I value my association with Alan and Ann Simpson over the years and \nwish them well in all that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12272-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the 104th Congress certainly ended far \nbetter than it began. A year ago, I truly feared that the major \naccomplishments of my 36 years in the Senate were about to be \njettisoned by the extreme agenda of the new majority. Now, as the \nCongress draws to a close, the outlook is considerably brighter, thanks \nin great measure to President Clinton's determined resistance to an \nunreasonable dismantlement of progressive government. I am immensely \npleased, in particular, that the tide was turned on education and that \nwe actually wound up with a 12 percent increase in Federal funding.\n  To be sure, there have been some disappointments, notable among them \nthe failure to ratify the Chemical Weapons and Law of the Sea Treaties. \nAnd we should not lose sight of the fact that there is still momentum \ntoward curtailment of many programs of great merit. I fervently hope \nthat the coming election will produce a Congress that will be more \nmoderate in outlook and further redress the balance toward progressive \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12272-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12272-S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Senate soon will bid farewell to one \nof its most legendary Members--the senior Senator from Rhode Island, \nClaiborne Pell. I have had the distinct privilege of working with \nSenator Pell\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\nover the years on issues ranging from college student loans to United \nNations reform.\n  Senator Claiborne Pell entered the Senate in 1960. His stature in \nRhode Island politics perhaps was best summarized by the Almanac of \nAmerican Politics, which called him an ``iron fist in a velvet glove.'' \nHis political strength perhaps was no better demonstrated than when he \nwas first elected to the Senate. In the Democratic primary for the \nSenate seat, he defeated the current sitting Governor at that time, as \nwell as a former Governor and Senator. My good friend and soon to be \nSenior Senator from Rhode Island, John Chafee--a former State chief \nexecutive himself--knows well the formidable political strength of his \ncolleague, having once tried to unseat Senator Pell in 1972, only to \ncome up short.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I gave up my seat on the Foreign \nRelations Committee so that I could serve my State of South Dakota on \nthe Finance Committee. It is safe to say I miss being on that \nCommittee, in part because I enjoyed so much working with my friend \nfrom Rhode Island. His stewardship of that Committee as Chairman for 8 \nyears was masterful. He chaired the Committee with quiet but firm \nstrength. Perhaps his greatest legislative achievement during that time \nwas the State Department Authorization bill that became law in 1994. As \nthe ranking member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I \nworked closely with then Chairman Pell and the Subcommittee Chair, \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, to produce a sound, bipartisan bill. \nThis legislation made significant strides to streamline the State \nDepartment bureaucracy. It also set us on a course to reform the United \nNations, and made significant improvements in our Nation's \nnonproliferation laws.\n  Senator Pell's inspirational commitment to world peace is exceeded \nonly by his strong dedication to the cause of education in this \ncountry. In 1972, Senator Pell shepherded to passage legislation that \nestablished the Basic Education Opportunity Grants Program--a college \naid program for economically disadvantaged college students. Today, we \nknow them as Pell Grants. Nearly 25 years after their creation, Pell \nGrants represent a beacon of hope for young people who desire to attend \ncollege but lack the resources to attend. This Congress has shown its \nfirm commitment to the Pell Grant program. Indeed, Pell Grants are now \nat their highest level in the program's history.\n  The people of Rhode Island have numerous reasons to be proud of their \nsenior senator. His entire life has been devoted to public service--\nfrom membership in the Coast Guard to membership in the U.S. Senate. As \nwe all know, our dear friend faces his greatest challenge to date--\nbattling Parkinson's disease. Since he made this announcement last \nyear, my wife Harriet and I have had Senator Pell in our prayers. He \nwill continue to be.\n  We will miss the compassionate leadership of Senator Claiborne Pell. \nMost important, we will miss his friendship. Claiborne Pell can leave \nthe Senate knowing that he has given our Nation a legislative legacy of \nthe highest order, one that will be unrivaled for years to come. I wish \nmy friend from Rhode Island the very best for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12272-5", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute \nto one of my colleagues and Senate classmates who is leaving the Senate \nvery soon--my friend from New Jersey, Senator Bill Bradley.\n  Senator Bradley entered the Senate the same year I did--1979. The \nroads Bill and I traveled to get to the Senate had some similarities, \nbut mainly vast differences. My journey to the Senate weaved through my \nhometown of Humboldt to Oxford to Harvard Yard and, ultimately, to the \nHouse of Representatives. Bill Bradley's began in Crystal City, MO, \nwhere his father was a banker. Bill Bradley also was a Rhodes Scholar, \nbut before that, he went to Princeton University, where he re-wrote \nboth the NCAA and the Ivy League recordbooks as a basketball player. \nBill Bradley's exploits on the hardwood at Princeton are the stuff of \nsports legend. I remember well his senior season, when he led the \nPrinceton Tigers to the NCAA Final Four. Though the Tigers came up \nshort, he set a tournament scoring record and was named the \ntournament's most valuable player.\n  Of course, Bill Bradley continued to be a standout basketball player \non a professional level for 10 years with the New York Knicks. He \nhelped the New York Knicks win the NBA world championship. Not long \nafter he retired from professional basketball, Senator Bradley sought \nto be a standout in the political world. Yet again, he succeeded.\n  Senator Bradley must be feeling a strange sense of deja vous to hear \nmany of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle calling for a simpler \ntax code. In 1982, our friend from New Jersey put forward his ``Fair \nTax'' plan. He continued to advocate a restructuring of the tax code, \nand in 1986, his tenacious efforts paid off. The 1986 tax plan \nrepresented the most radical restructuring of the tax code in more than \na generation. It is safe to say that this would not have occurred \nwithout Senator Bradley's legislative and leadership skills. It was \nSenator Bradley that who as the bridge between the competing House and \nSenate tax proposals, with the final plan bearing a great deal of \nsimilarity to Senator Bradley's 1982 plan.\n  The 1986 tax reform plan demonstrated that when Senator Bradley takes \non an issue, he does so with firm determination. My friend from New \nJersey and I have worked together on a number of issues and we have \nbeen on opposite sides on many others. He has taken strong stands on \nthe environment, civil rights, and health care. When Bill Bradley \nspeaks on any issue, whether I agree or disagree with him, his words \nare well thought and his arguments are well formulated. There is no \nquestion that he is a man of ideas, a man committed to examining the \nmajor problems of our Nation, proposing solutions, and working to get \nthem accomplished. That is the stuff of leadership.\n  Senator Bradley has become a key player in our Nation's political \ndialogue. Indeed, he is a person to whom many of us in the Senate like \nto go to for his thoughts and his perspectives on any issue, ranging \nfrom the tax code to the NBA playoffs. That is why we should all be \npleased that, although Bill Bradley may leave the Senate, he has made \nclear he intends to remain on the public stage.\n  I have enjoyed serving in the Senate with my friend from New Jersey. \nI particularly enjoyed serving with him these past two years on the \nFinance Committee. I will miss him. I certainly hope he takes advantage \nof the privileges afforded to former members and visits the Senate as \noften as possible. I wish him nothing but the very best as he embarks \non the next chapter of what is already a legendary life and career. One \ncan call Senator Bradley many things--basketball player, Rhodes \nscholar, tax reformer, and United States Senator. I am proud to call \nBill Bradley my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12273-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12273-S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN--GEORGIA'S SENIOR SENATOR\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress draws to a close, \nI would like to take a moment to bid farewell to my many good friends \nwho today will cast their final votes in the United States Senate. \nProminent among these departing leaders is the great Senator from \nGeorgia--Senator Sam Nunn. As a fellow farmer, I have an inherent \nrespect for Senator Nunn. His leadership and tenacity--so often \ndemonstrated from his desk across the aisle--have time and again earned \nhim the admiration of the members of this body and his constituents. \nHis years of service to his country and state will be remembered \nforever.\n  Senator Nunn has dedicated much of his life to ensuring that United \nStates defense capabilities remain the strongest in the world. A native \nof the area in Georgia where General Sherman's troops once rallied, his \npatriotism may be attributed in part to a long bloodline of military \nand Congressional service. In his roles as Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Armed Services Committee, he consistently has fought to make \ncertain our country has the most advanced military weaponry in the \nworld. His efforts have\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\nhelped ready our country to meet nearly any military challenge.\n  Mr. President, as I look across the room, I am reminded that another \nGeorgian soon will be assigned the desk that Senator Nunn has occupied \nfor nearly one-quarter of a century. Without a doubt, his desk will be \ndifficult to fill, but I am sure Senator Nunn, in his wisdom and \nknowledge of this body, will do everything possible to guide Georgia's \nnew Senator. As we prepare to leave our Nation's Capital and return to \nour respective districts, my wife Harriet and I wish Sam Nunn and his \nlovely wife Colleen, the very best for the future. Something tells me \nthat the Senator from Georgia will continue to be a central figure in \nformulating our national security and foreign policies. It would be a \nmistake not to tap into Sam Nunn's knowledge, experience and \nleadership. God bless Sam Nunn as he embarks on interesting new \nchallenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12273-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to my good friend from Illinois, Paul Simon. Senator Simon will \nleave the Senate very soon, and I must confess that I will miss him. He \nis an outstanding legislator, and skillful writer, and most important, \na kind friend to me and my wife Harriet.\n  Throughout his life, Senator Simon has found success as a writer and \neditor. He is a prolific writer, and the author of many books, \nincluding perhaps the most comprehensive biography of Abraham Lincoln \nas a young legislator. The connection between these two Illinois \nfavorite sons past and present doesn't end there. Both Abraham Lincoln \nand Paul Simon began their political careers in the Illinois \nlegislature, and both at about the same time in their lives. Both built \na reputation of honesty and forthrightness. Both sported bow ties. \nWhere the careers diverged is somewhat ironic. Senator Simon holds the \nvery Senate seat unsuccessfully sought by Abraham Lincoln in his famous \nbattle with Stephen Douglas in 1858. Yet, Abraham Lincoln of course won \nthe presidency in 1860, an office Senator Simon unsuccessfully sought \nin 1988.\n  Certainly, there's much more to Senator Simon's career than his \nsimilarities with our Nation's greatest President. Much more. Senator \nSimon has been his party's most outspoken crusader for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. I am proud to have been an \noriginal cosponsor of his balanced budget amendment. He worked very, \nvery hard to get his amendment passed. We came so close last year--just \none vote short. He can be very certain that we will work hard to resume \nthe fight next year. I am confident that we will pass a balanced budget \namendment. And when we do, and when the required number of States \nratify the amendment, this Nation will owe a big thank you to our \nfriend from Illinois.\n  The fight for a balanced budget amendment symbolizes the kind of \ncommitment and determination Senator Simon possesses as a legislator. I \nalways enjoyed being on the same side of an issue with my friend from \nIllinois. I knew my chances of success were much improved if he was \ninvolved in any legislative effort I participated in. Conversely, I \nknew I had my work cut out for me when we were on opposite sides of an \nissue.\n  Senator Simon was a champion of many causes--literacy, college \nstudent loans, limitations on television violence, just to name a few. \nWe both served together as members of the Foreign Relations and \nJudiciary Committees. On Foreign Relations, he took a strong interest \nin the African continent. Indeed, in 1993, I sought his advice and \nperspectives before I made my trip to Africa to promote South Dakota \nagriculture.\n  There are so many things that can be said about Senator Paul Simon. \nHe is an extraordinary man who has led an extraordinary life. What I \nwill miss most however is his warmth and his kindness. If the Senate \nhad an unofficial ambassador of goodwill, it was the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois. Senator Simon regularly held open meetings in his office \nand had time for everyone who came to visit. That's the kind of \nSenator, the kind of man Paul Simon is. Senator Simon is an \nextraordinary individual, and a good friend. Harriet and I wish he and \nhis lovely wife Jeanne nothing but the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12274-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to my friend from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown. He and his \nlovely wife Nan have been good friends to me and Harriet. Hank Brown is \nboth worthy ally and worthy adversary. Over the years, I have worked \nwith my friend from Colorado on several issues of mutual interest. I \nremember well the battles we have fought together and the times when we \nhonorably have disagreed.\n  I remember one disagreement in particular. During my efforts in \nsupport of our South Dakota honey program, Senator Brown was relentless \nto end Federal funding for the program. Yet, in his effort to end honey \nprice supports, he still was willing to listen to my side. He even took \nthe time to sit down to visit with honey producers from South Dakota. \nHe listened to their concerns. I always will be grateful for that.\n  That is not the only time Senator Brown and I have agreed to \ndisagree. More than once, we have sparred over nuclear nonproliferation \nissues in South Asia. Senator Brown and I travelled to South Asia \ntogether and debated this topic quite extensively. While he and I \ndisagree on the best course of action our Nation should take to slow \nweapons-building programs in South Asia, I do not question for a second \nhis efforts to promote peace in this unstable region of the world.\n  As fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator Brown and I have shared a special \npersonal involvement in preserving and protecting the interests of our \nveterans. He has done an outstanding job as a member of the Veterans \nAffairs Committee. He has dedicated hours of service to making certain \nthat veterans programs meet each and every need of those who served \nbravely in our Armed Forces.\n  Finally, Senator Brown has been a tenacious advocate in congressional \nefforts to balance the bloated Federal budget. He has been a prominent \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee, and knows the vital importance \nof ending years of wasteful Government spending. He understands how \nnecessary it is for us to put the Government's fiscal house in order. \nHank Brown has risen to the fiscal challenges placed before him on the \nBudget Committee and has fought hard to protect Americans' hard-earned \nincomes.\n  I will miss my friend and colleague from Colorado--his hard work, his \ngood humor, and his friendship. During his term in office, Hank Brown \nhas demonstrated a sincere devotion to the people of his home State of \nColorado. He is a hard-working, commonsense public servant, dedicated \nto the people he represents. We in the Senate will miss his willingness \nto listen to differing views and to work together to cut through \nGovernment gridlock. I wish my friend Hank and his wife Nan all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12274-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12274-S12275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, on her retirement from the U.S. \nSenate. It is not easy for me to bid her farewell. I sincerely will \nmiss her presence in this body. Nancy and I have served together since \n1979, when we both came to this body. Since then, we have shared and \nfought for the same traditional midwestern ideals and values. Working \ntogether, we have succeeded in ensuring that our States get their fair \nshare of Federal funding. She understands the unique needs of rural \nAmerica. Few have shown her deep commitment to the interests of Kansas \nand the midwest.\n  It has been a great privilege for me to work with Senator Kassebaum. \nShe has been an inspiration to me and countless others. Her hard work \nand dedication to this body and to the people she represents in Kansas \nare unprecedented.\n  During our years together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nI\n\n[[Page S12275]]\n\ndeveloped a deep respect for Nancy's convictions and her commitment to \naiding people in lesser-developed areas of the world. As both Chair and \nranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senator \nKassebaum has shown compassion, tempered with pragmatism, in dealing \nwith the unique issues of war-torn, famine-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa. \nHer expertise on issues affecting this area of the globe is unequaled \nin the Senate.\n  Senator Kassebaum's expertise does not end there. She also knows the \nUnited Nations inside and out. She has dedicated much of her time to \nreforming the waste, fraud, and abuse that is rampant within the UN. \nFrankly, she spearheaded increased congressional oversight of the UN. \nThe Kassebaum Amendment withheld 20 percent of regular budget \nassessments beginning in fiscal year 1987, in an effort to make UN \nbudget voting proportional to country assessments. A host of UN \naccounting and budgetary assessment reforms have followed in the wake \nof this amendment.\n  Senator Kassebaum also is a champion of education. She has worked \ntirelessly to secure increased funding for student financial aid and to \nreorganize the Jobs Corps program. As Chair of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Kassebaum also must be given credit for \nshepherding the Republican workfare plan through Congress. Because of \nher steadfast determination, we finally passed real welfare reform--\nreform that will end the failed ``free lunch'' approach to welfare and \nwill bring aid to those who need it most. She is a tough, commonsense \nreformer, whose tenacity and calm resolve will never be forgotten nor \neasily replaced.\n  Finally, perhaps her crowning achievement of this Congress was \npassage this year of commonsense health care reform. Thanks to the \nSenator from Kansas, working Americans need not fear the loss of their \nhealth insurance policies when they change jobs or because of a pre-\nexisting condition. Thanks to the Senator from Kansas, the self-\nemployed will be able to deduct a greater portion of their health \ninsurance costs from their Federal tax liability. These represent real \nand positive health care reforms.\n  As the 104th Congress draws to a close, I wish my friend, Nancy \nKassebaum, the very best as she embarks on new interests in her home \nstate of Kansas and elsewhere. Her career in Washington has been \ndistinguished. Her public service to her State and Nation are unrivaled \nin terms of results. Senator Nancy Kassebaum will be remembered as a \nfirst-class public official.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to my friend \nand colleague, Senator Sheila Frahm, for her outstanding service to the \npeople of Kansas. As a former Kansas State Senator and Lieutenant \nGovernor, Sheila Frahm has served her country and State with pride.\n  Senator Frahm has a long and distinguished record of public service. \nShe served as a member of the Kansas Board of Education, a Kansas State \nSenator, and was Kansas' first woman Senate Majority Leader. She also \nwas the first woman in Kansas history to be elected Lieutenant \nGovernor. As Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Frahm served as a member of \nthe Governor's Cabinet and as Secretary of Administration, running the \nday-to-day operations of the Kansas State government.\n  Mr. President, in a matter of weeks, Sheila Frahm's life changed \ndrastically. She gracefully moved into the Senate seat of one of the \nliving legends of American political history, Bob Dole. Senator Frahm \nhas demonstrated time and time again that she can rise to any occasion. \nShe did so yet again here in the Senate.\n  As a member of the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Frahm played a vital role \nin moving legislation during the final months of the 104th Congress. \nSenator Frahm also came to the Senate at a time to help pass historic \nlegislation, including workfare, health care and illegal immigration \nreform. In a few short months she has voted to pass the kind of \nlegislation many of her colleagues have waited years to address. Sheila \nFrahm has earned the respect and admiration of her colleagues, her \nstaff, and her constituents.\n  We will soon bid farewell to our colleague from Kansas--Senator \nFrahm. My wife Harriet and I wish Senator Frahm, her husband Kenneth, \nand their three daughters, the very best. I am proud to have served in \nthe 104th Congress with Senator Frahm. Her valuable contributions to \nthe Senate will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12275-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12275-S12276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTE TO GUST LARSON\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \npay tribute to a great South Dakotan--Gust Larson of Midland. Gust is a \n``salt of the Earth'' individual whose feet are planted firmly in the \nreal world. Gust is truly one of South Dakota's unsung heroes. He \ndeserves to be recognized for his leadership in helping to preserve \nrail service across South Dakota. I was privileged to work with Gust \nLarson several years ago on this issue. My association with Gust \nconsists of some of the most productive and enjoyable work I have done \nas a United States Senator for South Dakota.\n  I first met Gust in the early 1980's when the Chicago & Northwestern \nRailroad [C] filed for abandonment of the only east-west rail line \nacross South Dakota. Gust owned the local grain elevator in Midland, a \nsmall town in the middle of western South Dakota with less than 300 \nresidents. When the C announced its abandonment plans, Midland and \nother communities along the rail line were devastated, as were all the \nfarmers and ranchers who depended on the railroad to ship their grain \nto market.\n  The prospects for blocking the abandonment looked bleak at the time. \nBack then, rail consolidation was the norm throughout the Nation. All \nacross the country, one rail line after another was being abandoned. \nThus, given the climate of the times, few people held out much hope \nwhen the C announced its intent to abandon the 164-mile line from \nRapid City to Fort Pierre. Some people even said there was no point in \nfighting the abandonment because the railroads always got their way \nwith the Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC].\n  Gust Larson was not one of those people. Gust is a fighter, and he \nwas not about to give up his and his fellow South Dakotans only rail \nlink to the outside world without a fight. Gust knew the rail line \nwould certainly be abandoned if nothing was done. He could not stand by \nand lose the only rail link to the grain market terminals to the east \nand down south to the Gulf of Mexico. Loss of this line would result in \nhigher costs for western South Dakota grain producers in shipping their \ngrain to market.\n  I shared Gust's concerns. The so-called political experts at the time \nadvised me to keep a low profile. They urged me not to get involved. \nFighting the abandonment was seen as a lost cause. Well, I grew up \nbelieving that lost causes sometimes were the ones worth fighting for. \nAnd, like Gust, I would not stand idly by and let the C abandon this \nimportant line. So, ignoring the advice of the naysayers, I joined Gust \nLarson's lost cause to save the rail line.\n  A shippers group called the Western South Dakota Railway Users \nAssociation was formed, and Gust agreed to serve as chairman. Some \nscoffed and said we were tilting at windmills in challenging a huge \ncorporation like C with all its financial resources and attorneys. \nSkeptics pointed out that the C had filed several other abandonment \npetitions across the country, and all of them had been approved by the \nICC. Why would our line be any different?\n  Despite these tremendous odds, we decided to take on the railroad. \nGust and his fellow rail users held countless telephone conversations \nand meetings with my office to formulate strategy and develop a plan of \naction.\n  Frankly, I suspect that C corporate officials who handled \nabandonment petitions on a regular basis didn't take Gust Larson and \nhis small band of rail users very seriously. After all, the C was \nsuccessful in other abandonment requests, and all certainly involved \nthe usual protests from people like Gust Larson. Well, the C \nattorneys and executives were in for a\n\n[[Page S12276]]\n\nsurprise. They had never encountered someone like Gust Larson before.\n  I requested that the ICC send an administrative law judge to hold a \nformal field hearing in South Dakota. At the ICC hearing in Philip in \nSeptember of 1983, Gust Larson and others emphasized to ICC \nAdministrative Law Judge Edward McGrail the importance of preserving \nthis important rail line. Much to the surprise of the naysayers and the \nC, Judge McGrail issued a ruling against the railroad's abandonment \nrequest.\n  As expected, the C appealed Judge McGrail's decision to the ICC. \nAfter intensive efforts, we convinced the Commission to let stand the \njudge's decision. Although Gust and the rest of us were very pleased by \nthe Commission's action, we knew the battle was not over. We knew the \nC could come back and file a new abandonment request, which would \nmean the battle would start all over again.\n\n  If the C truly was not interested in operating the line, it could \nrefuse to perform much-needed maintenance work on the line. This would \nlead to a gradual deterioration of the line's condition and ultimately \na degradation of service. The only real solution was to find someone \ninterested in operating the rail line. This obviously was no easy task.\n  We made a full-court press to identify potential buyers. After \ncountless meetings and phone calls, we were able to convince a group of \ninvestors who were willing to take their chances on the future of this \nline. The Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern Railroad [DM] was formed and \nan agreement was worked out with the C to purchase the C east-\nwest rail line across the entire state of South Dakota and into \nMinnesota. Since its inception, the D has invested millions of \ndollars in maintenance and track repair and has demonstrated its \ncommitment to improving rail service for South Dakota shippers.\n  Today, many people may not realize how close western South Dakota \ncame to losing its rail service to the east. Had Gust not stepped up to \nthe plate to lead the local shippers group, who knows what might have \nhappened?\n  Gust Larson is the pride of South Dakota. His effort to save the rail \nline is reminiscent of the legendary stories of tough, rugged fighters \nwho turned a vast prairie into a state of enormous promise and \nopportunity. Generations from now, Gust Larson's story also will be \nlegendary. He has made a lasting contribution to his community, his \nState and his country. It was one of the great privileges of my life to \nwork with Gust. It is an honor to know Gust Larson. It is an even \ngreater honor to call him my friend. I salute him. Thanks to the help \nof Gust Larson, the rumble of trains can still be felt and heard across \nwestern South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12275-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12276-S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, when the 105th Congress meets for the first \ntime early next year, this Chamber will have many new faces. This is \npartly because 13 of us, including myself, will leave this body to \npursue other goals and ambitions. I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto those of my colleagues who will retire from the U.S. Senate at the \nend of this term.\n  Mr. President, it has been my pleasure to work with my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Bill Bradley, since 1978. We arrived \ntogether, and together we depart.\n  Senator Bradley's respect for the opinions of his colleagues and \nthoughtful demeanor have made him one of the true gentlemen of the \nSenate. I have enjoyed working with him on the Committee on Finance and \nthe Special Committee on Aging. He has been a leader on tax reform, \nenvironmental protection, and violence prevention.\n  Senator Bradley established himself as a progressive leader in tax \nreform by proposing the Fair Tax Act in 1982. That later became the Tax \nReform Act of 1986. This act closed most of the loopholes that had \ncreated unfair and unbalanced tax burdens on the people of the United \nStates. This legislation also reduced Federal taxes on many low-income \nAmericans.\n  Bill has taken a personal interest in the protection of the \nenvironment over the years. He passed legislation to protect the shores \nof not only New Jersey but of the entire country through his support of \nthe Shore Protection Act of 1996 and has fought to protect millions of \nacres of virgin land from mining and development.\n  His determination to create jobs and to expand the police force in \nthose areas have made Senator Bradley a leader in finding solutions to \nthe violence that has become an everyday part of life in many \ncommunities.\n  The Senate is losing a great Member in Senator Bill Bradley. I wish \nhim and his family the best in the future.\n  I also want to pay tribute today to Senator Hank Brown. I have had \nthe honor of serving with the Senator from Colorado on the Government \nAffairs Committee. In addition, he has been a leader in the fight for a \nbalanced budget.\n  While he chose to serve only one term in the Senate, Hank had spent \n10 years in the House of Representatives. I served in the House and \nknow how difficult the schedule can be, splitting time between \nWashington and my home district, leaving little time to see family and \nfriends. Yet, while a Member of Congress, he earned a masters of law \ndegree from George Washington University. Hank is always looking for \nnew things to learn and new ways to grow as an individual. I am sure \nthat, after he moves back home, Hank will find many new experiences \nfrom which to learn whatever he chooses to do. He has served the people \nof Colorado well and will be missed.\n\n  Senator Bill Cohen and I came to the Senate in 1978 and I have \ngreatly enjoyed working with him over the years. In addition to being \nan effective Senator and a true champion for his State of Maine, \nSenator  Cohen also found the time to author eight books.\n  I have served with Bill Cohen on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand he has been a reliable ally in the struggle to reform our \ngovernment's procurement practices. Too many people think that our work \nis done here in the Congress when we pass appropriations bills. Senator \nCohen is among a small group of Senators who realizes that the \noversight process is just as important as approving the money.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will certainly miss the insights and energy \nof Senator Bill Cohen.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Nebraska, James Exon, is \nanother of my colleagues who has decided not to seek another term in \nthe U.S. Senate. I know that Senator Exon's retirement will cast a \nshadow over the great State of Nebraska and this body.\n  Senator Exon's friendship has been extremely important to me during \nmy time as a member of the Senate. I will miss him as we continue with \nthe next phase of our lives. We have been friends for 20 years, dating \nback to the days when we served our respective States as Governor. \nJames Exon was one of a group of Senators who dropped by a gathering of \nfolks from Arkansas last week. I was honored that he took the time out \nof his schedule to attend the gathering.\n  I appreciated Senator Exon's help on many pieces of legislation, \nincluding his strong support for my work to keep pharmaceutical drug \nprices down. He was also an original cosponsor of the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights, and worked with me to make the Internal Revenue Service more \naccountable for its actions. I am grateful for his help and support \nthroughout the years.\n  Mr. President, it has been an honor and a privilege to serve \nalongside Senator Exon here in this great body. We came to the Senate \nas dear friends, and I hope to continue the friendship in the future. \nBarbara and I have enjoyed our time spent with James and Pat Exon, and \nwe wish them the best in the future.\n  Mr. President, one of this country's true statesmen, Senator Mark \nHatfield of Oregon, has been a Member of this body since 1966. I am \ntruly grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with this great \nman.\n  Senator Hatfield's dedication to his State and Nation can be seen by \nhis mere length of service. For the past 30 years, Mark Hatfield has \nworked hard to improve living conditions for the people of Oregon and \nthe United States. Senator Hatfield has always been an ardent proponent \nof peace as he has continually worked to end armed conflict. It was \nSenator Hatfield who offered an amendment with then Senator McGovern to \nend the Vietnam War.\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\n  Senator Hatfield is also a man of great conscience. Mark has deep-\nseated beliefs and he stands by those beliefs regardless of the \nconsequences. Senator Hatfield has always looked to both parties for \nhelp in enacting important legislation. It is for this reason that Mark \nHatfield is one of the most respected and influential Members of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, Oregon is lucky to have a public servant who is as \ndedicated as Mark Hatfield. Barbara and I wish Mark and Antoinette all \nthe best and on behalf of my colleagues, I want to thank my friend Mark \nHatfield for all he has done for this institution and this Nation.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Alabama, Howell Heflin--known \nto many as the Judge--and I came to the Senate together in 1978. I have \nhad the honor of serving the last 18 years with this dedicated public \nservant.\n  Howell Heflin embodies the spirit of the U.S. Senate. Senator Heflin \nis a true gentleman and statesman. Therefore, it is not ironic that he \nis one of the most popular Members of the U.S. Senate and one of the \nmost beloved public figures ever in the State of Alabama. Whenever \ntimes get tough, Howell is always there to liven up the mood with his \ngreat wit and personality. I have had the opportunity to serve on the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee with Senator Heflin and \nI have seen firsthand the tireless effort he has given to improving the \ncotton, soybean, and peanut programs. Farmers all over this country \nshould thank Howell Heflin for the contributions he has made to \nagriculture. Knowing the importance of agriculture in my own State of \nArkansas, I am very thankful for the leadership of Howell Heflin.\n  Senator Heflin has always believed in doing what is right and \nstanding up for what you believe in. He regularly crosses party lines \nand votes his own personal beliefs. This is refreshing in a time when \npartisanship seems to take precedence over all other things.\n  Mr. President, it has truly been an honor for me to work with such a \ngreat man as Howell Heflin, but most importantly, it has been an honor \nfor me to call this man my friend. Barbara and I consider Howell and \nMike to be among our closest friends and we will miss them greatly. We \nwish them all the best as they return home to Tuscumbia, AL. And while \nthe U.S. Senate is losing one of its most dedicated members, Alabama is \ngetting back two wonderful citizens in Howell and Mike Heflin.\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 24 years, the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, Bennett Johnston, has become one of the most accomplished \nand dedicated Members to have served in the Senate. As chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for 8 years, and now the ranking \nmember, the Senator's remarkable leadership has led to important \nlegislation in energy policy.\n  Mr. President, one of the greatest things I will miss about the \nSenate is the wonderful relationships that Barbara and I have formed \nover the past 18 years, including the one we have with Bennett Johnston \nand his lovely wife, Mary. As we both travel back to our neighboring \nStates in the South, I look forward to continuing this friendship. I \nwish them all the best in their years ahead. I am truly honored, Mr. \nPresident, to have served with such a fine man.\n  Another fine colleague who arrived with me to the U.S. Senate in 1978 \nis Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the distinguished senior Senator from \nKansas. She has done an outstanding job representing Kansas and is \ntruly a dedicated public servant.\n  My fellow Arkansans and I were honored when Senator Kassebaum spoke \nat the unveiling of the portrait of Hattie Caraway, who represented \nArkansas in the U.S. Senate and was the Nation's first woman to be \nelected to the Senate. Senator Kassebaum gave an eloquent speech that \ndemonstrated how far women have come in the U.S. Senate.\n  It has been an honor to serve with the Senator from Kansas. She has \nalways been willing to cross this center aisle to accomplish what is \nbest for the Nation. When she leaves this body, her humility and \ndedication will be sorely missed. Indeed, the State of Kansas and her \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate will be saddened by her departure. \nBarbara joins me in wishing her all of our best in the future.\n  Mr. President, one of the finest men to ever serve as U.S. Senator, \nSam Nunn of Georgia, is also leaving this body. Sam Nunn's tireless \ndedication, loyalty, and determination extend not only to his work as \nSenator, but in his personal life as well. Barbara and I have enjoyed \nmany years of friendship with Sam and Colleen Nunn. I will carry many \nhappy memories of that friendship with me as I return to Arkansas.\n  Senator Sam Nunn has won not only my admiration and respect, but that \nof the American people. His efforts on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Small \nBusiness Committee are testaments to his desire to maintain peace, hope \nand prosperity in America. His work has also earned him the distinction \nof one of the greatest national security and foreign policy experts of \nour time. All who have worked with Sam Nunn, all who have followed his \ncareer, surely recognize the numerous contributions he has made. I will \nmiss him. America will miss this great Senator even more.\n\n  When I was first elected to the Senate in 1978, Senator Claiborne \nPell had been here for 18 years. I had always assumed he would be here \nlong after I left. When Senator Pell retires this year, he leaves an \nimpressive record of accomplishments in the areas of education, the \narts, and foreign policy. He has been more than a Senator from Rhode \nIsland, but a true statesman for the entire Nation.\n  Senator Pell was instrumental in instituting the education \nscholarships for disadvantaged students that bear his name. Untold \nnumbers of students have had the opportunity to go to college through \nthe Pell Grant Program. He has continued to be an advocate for \neducation throughout his career. Senator Pell recognized early on that \nthe education of our children is the best investment this country could \nmake.\n  Senator Pell has been a true friend and teacher to many of us here in \nthe Senate. I wish him well in his retirement. He has certainly earned \nit.\n  Mr. President, last week my colleagues and I gathered in this chamber \nto pay tribute to our dear friend, the senior Senator from Illinois, \nPaul Simon, by decorating ourselves with a trademark Paul Simon bow \ntie. I have known this distinguished man for many years and have always \nfound him to be a man of the highest regard in his love for this \ncountry of ours. He serves as a guide to all of us who serve in public \nlife through his honesty and decency.\n  Mr. President, Paul Simon stands strong for the things he believes in \nhis heart to be good and true. But under no circumstance has he ever \nturned a deaf ear to any of us wanting to express our views or \nconcerns. As I told this body just last week--as I go to the University \nof Arkansas next semester to speak to students from various educational \nbackgrounds--If I am ever asked the question by one of those students \nas to how to pattern their lives for a political future, I will tell \nthem to look at the life of Paul Simon, both the political life and the \npersonal life. I say this because Paul Simon has humanized politics and \nthe Government for each of us. I thank my friend for his leadership and \nservice to this country and wish him a health and happy future.\n  Mr. President, my good friend and colleague, Senator Alan Simpson, is \nalso leaving this body at the end of the term. Eighteen years we have \nserved here together, separated only by this center aisle. And it is \nthis very aisle that Alan Simpson has worked his career at building a \nbridge across--to join both sides in doing what is best for every \ncitizen of this great Nation of ours. Over the past several years, I \nhave had the honor and privilege of working with my friend, not only on \nthis floor, but also on the Finance Committee and the Special Committee \non Aging. His hard work and dedication to the people of this country \nhave served as a constant reminder to me and my colleagues of what we \nhave been sent here to do--and that is to serve the people of our home \nStates and all citizens of the United States.\n  Alan Simpson's humorous and unique approach to business on this floor \nwill be a great loss. Mr. President, Alan Simpson is one of the \ngreatest doers and builders that we have\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\never seen in this body, and his presence will be sorely missed. Barbara \nand I wish my friend and his beautiful wife Ann the very best in the \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, I know that all of my friends who are leaving will \nmiss the Senate. But I have even more confidence that those remaining \nin the Senate, and millions of citizens back home, will miss these \nwonderful public servants and the energy and wisdom they go generously \ngave to their country. We are truly a better nation for their \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12276-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the senior \nSenator from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, for his 16 years of service \nin Congress. He has worked for the citizens of Colorado as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, and was elected president of the 97th \nCongress Republican freshman class. He also has served his State for \none term as a U.S. Senator.\n  Everyone was surprised when Senator Brown was the first Republican to \nannounce in late December 1994 that he would not seek reelection in \n1996. At that time, Senator Brown said he had tired of his life inside \nthe beltway and had always thought of his time in Washington as a \n``period of temporary service.'' As a result, at the end of this \nCongress, Hank Brown will leave the Senate and return to Colorado with \nhis wife, Nan, and their family.\n  During the last 6 years, I have seen Senator Brown work diligently on \nthe budget, support environmental and agriculture issues affecting his \nState of Colorado, and deal with foreign policy matters that affect our \nNation as a whole.\n  Hank Brown and I have worked side-by-side on the Budget Committee \nand, while we did not see eye-to-eye all the time, his dedication to \nRepublican spending priorities was tireless and unsurpassed. I know \nthat members of his party will miss his ideas and input when we begin \nthe arduous budget process next year.\n  Senator Brown has also work for the people of Colorado on \nenvironmental and agriculture issues. He introduced legislation to \nprotect the Cache La Poudre River flood plain and worked diligently to \nestablish national trails along Colorado's western slope. He also came \ndown to the Senate floor to fight for the rights of Colorado ranchers \nwhen we debated the controversial topic of grazing fees.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Hank Brown has \nsupported military aid and training to Eastern European countries. And, \nI am pleased to say, after studying the ins and outs of the General \nAgreement on Trade and Tariffs, Senator Brown joined me and several \nother Senators by voting against that abomination of a trade agreement. \nEven today, I regret that the Senate in the 103d Congress saw fit to \npass that treaty and that the President supported its passage. But, \nI'll save that talk for another time.\n  The long and short of it, Mr. President, is that Hank Brown will be \nmissed in the Halls of the Capitol. I bid the good Senator, his wife \nNan, and their three children farewell as they leave Washington, DC, \nand wish Hank many happy years of retirement. May it hold new \nchallenges and exciting opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12278-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe great men of the Senate. He has served his State of Arkansas with \nhonor as a State Representative, Governor, Member of Congress and \nfinally as a U.S. Senator. Despite this wonderful career, he has not \nlost touch with the ``common man.''\n  I know all my colleagues agree, David Pryor is truly one of the most \nwell-liked members of this body. Whether defending the Special \nCommittee on Aging and the Nation's elderly or as the primary sponsor \nof the Tax Payer Bill of Rights, you can count on the Senator from \nArkansas tirelessly and doggedly fighting to do what he believes is \nright. However, no matter how heated the battle, Senator Pryor always \nmaintains his cool and always treats his fellow Senators with dignity \nand respect.\n  Senator Pryor has accomplished much in his career, but he will always \nbe remembered as the No. 1 advocate for the Nation's elderly. Having \nserved as chairman and ranking member of the Special Committee on \nAging, he has led the way in his dedication to protecting and enhancing \nthe lives of our senior citizens.\n  As a member of the Agriculture Committee, David Pryor has worked to \nprotect the American farmer, and, as the primary sponsor of the Tax \nPayer Bill of Rights, he almost singlehandedly focused attention on IRS \nabuses of the American taxpayer.\n  There is no doubt the Senate will miss David and his charming wife, \nBarbara. Barbara has worked diligently to bring outstanding Arkansas \nart to Washington so all visitors to David's office can enjoy it. The \nSenate will miss their personal touch and we wish them well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12278-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Senator Bill Cohen is one of our \ncolleagues who often comes to mind when considering the mainstream in \nthis body. The presence of these individuals who defy labeling is \nindeed fortunate in the effort to achieve the compromise so essential \nin government. I have noted over the years that observers attempting to \ndefine these so called liberal Republicans, conservative Democrats, and \n``moderates'', often were describing colleagues like Bill Cohen who \nsimply considered the issue at hand on the merits and decided, in his \njudgement, in the interest of the greater good. Party Line and dogma \nhave never been decisive factors in his decisions, and as a result he \nwas regularly numbered among those who brought about the compromise \nnecessary for progress.\n  First elected to the House in 1972, Bill Cohen immediately \ndemonstrated his fortitude and independent thinking in dealing with \nperhaps the most traumatic issue to face the Congress in this century. \nAs a member of the impeachment committee charged with the \nresponsibility of considering the actions of the Nixon Administration, \nhe spoke eloquently of the imperatives of accountability and \nresponsibility in the conduct of public officials. True to the \nprinciples evidenced in that courageous beginning, he remains today a \nspokesman for and example of civility in government and public service.\n  Bill came to the Senate in 1978 where he quickly established himself \nas a dedicated and studious member, mastering the intricacies of a \ndiverse set of issues facing our Nation. He was a spokesman for \nmilitary preparedness long before others in more recent times adopted \nthe popular mantra of ``military readiness''. His service on the Armed \nServices Committee has clearly established Bill Cohen not only as a \nguardian of military preparedness but also as a protector of those who \nserve in the ranks of our Armed Forces. His exemplary service on the \nIntelligence Committee was of invaluable benefit to this Nation on \nissues of grave importance to our National Security. His evenhandedness \nin his service on the Judiciary Committee and his sensitivity and \ncompassion demonstrated while on the Committee on Aging again stand as \ntestimony to the quality of his service to the people of Maine and this \nNation.\n  Senator Bill Cohen departs our ranks with the respect and admiration \nof all of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We wish him and \nJanet the very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12278-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12278-S12279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend \nand colleague, Senator Paul Simon, who is leaving the Halls of Congress \nafter 22 years of distinguished service in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  Simply put, Paul Simon epitomizes what we think of when we use the \nterm public servant. Since 1954, he has served the people of Illinois \nas a State Representative, as a State Senator, as Lieutenant Governor, \nas a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and as a United States \nSenator. At every level of government, Paul has proven to be a model of \nthoughtfulness and integrity.\n  As a fellow member of the Senate Budget Committee, Paul Simon stands\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\nout, not because of his trademark bow tie, but because of his dogged \ndesire to eliminate our crushing debt burden and his willingness to \ntake the tough medicine necessary to accomplish that goal. Moreover, \nPaul has keenly understood our obligation to repay not only the public \ndebt but also the debt owed to Social Security and other government \ntrust funds.\n  In addition to his efforts to get our Nation's finances in order, \nPaul Simon has been a tireless advocate for the need to expand \neducational opportunities for all Americans. Specifically, he has been \na leader in ensuring that those with disabilities receive public \neducation, in combating illiteracy through passage of the National \nLiteracy Act, and more recently, in expanding access to higher \neducation by championing the direct college loan program.\n  While all of us in this body will sorely miss his leadership and \ncordiality, our loss is Southern Illinois University's gain where Paul \nwill head up the Simon Public Policy Institute. We wish both him and \nhis wife Jeanne the very best in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12278-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the \nsenior Senator from New Jersey, Senator Bill Bradley. Since the first \nday this professional basketball player walked onto the floor of the \nSenate in 1979, I have been proud to work closely with him on numerous \nissues.\n  As all Senators know, we spend hours on the Senate floor, toiling \naway on legislation that affects our home States, other Members' \nStates, and America as a whole. But, I believe Bill Bradley will be \nmost-remembered for his endless struggle to rewrite our tax code in the \nTax Reform Act of 1986, his unwavering dedication to reform our \ncampaign finance system, and his tireless efforts to protect the health \nand welfare of American men, women, and children.\n  I remember well when, in June of 1986, the Senate overwhelmingly \nsupported the Tax Relief Act by a vote of 97-3. Although this \nlegislation was guided carefully through the Congress by Senator Bob \nPackwood, I would like to take the time today to give credit where \ncredit is due. Without the dedication of the Senator from New Jersey, \nthis bill would have died a thousand deaths on its journey from the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee to President Reagan's desk.\n  After we passed this monumental legislation, Senator Bradley said, \n``Each senator was willing to sacrifice something that was important to \nhis or her State to do what was in the best interest of the country.'' \nThank goodness for Senator Bradley's foresight and coalition building. \nWithout him, many of those gaping tax loopholes we closed would still \nexist and millions of low-income Americans would have fallen well-below \nthe poverty line.\n  I also would like to commend Bill Bradley for joining me in our fight \nto reform the campaign finance system through a constitutional \namendment. I will miss his assistance behind-the-scenes and on the \nSenate floor and am hopeful that he will continue to work toward a fair \nand equitable system for all political candidates when he leaves this \ndistinguished body.\n  Mr. President, I cannot leave the floor without mentioning Senator \nBradley's commitment to the health and well-being of American men, \nwomen, and children. During the 104th Congress, he fought against cuts \nto the Food Stamp Program, the WIC Program, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security. Indeed, he joined me and 33 other Senators in 1995 to \nprotect the Social Security Trust Fund by voting against the balanced \nbudget amendment. That vote took courage, Mr. President, and I commend \nhim for it.\n  In closing, I would like to address the good Senator's work on \nlegislation which we recently passed here in the Senate and which the \nPresident has signed into law. Known around Senator Bradley's office as \nthe ``Baby Bill,'' the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of \n1995 will ease the worry of many families experiencing the miracle of \nchildbirth. Thanks to Bill Bradley, hospitals will be required to \nprotect the health of new mothers and their infants for a minimum of 48 \nhours following a vaginal birth and a 96-hour stay after Caesarean \nbirths. I was pleased to co-sponsor this bill and am thrilled that \nSenator Bradley can leave the Senate following such a grand \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. President, to say that Bill Bradley will be missed in the Senate \nis an understatement. Although he is retiring as a U.S. Senator, I do \nnot believe we have heard the last of Bill Bradley in the political \narena. I wish him, his wife, Ernestine, and their daughter, Theresa \nAnne, all the best for the future and a safe journey home to Montclair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12279-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise at this time to pay tribute to my \nfriend and colleague, Alan Simpson, who is retiring after serving for \n18 years in this body.\n  None of us should have been surprised by Al's entrance into politics. \nAfter all, he learned firsthand about the life of a public servant from \nhis father, Milward, who served the people of Wyoming as Governor from \n1954 to 1958 and as a U.S. Senator from 1962 to 1966.\n  After graduating from college, Al Simpson began serving his country \nas a 2d lieutenant in the U.S. Army where he was a member of the 5th \nInfantry Division and the 2d Armored Division during the Army \nOccupation in Germany. In 1956, he returned home, went to law school, \nand joined his father's law firm in Cody, WY. In 1964, he was elected \nto the State legislature where he represented his home county for 13 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, regardless of whether one thinks that it was destiny \nor industry that brought Al Simpson to Washington, his 18 years of \nservice have left an indelible legislative mark.\n  Since he became chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Immigration \nSubcommittee, the Senator from Wyoming has worked assiduously in \ndeveloping tough laws to crack down on illegal immigration and \ncommonsense policies to govern legal immigration. Indeed, it is a \nfitting testament to his efforts that one of the last measures passed \nin the 104th Congress was an immigration reform bill that he authored.\n  But immigration is just one of the many contentious issues that Alan \nhas been willing to take on. As a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, he recognized the demographic strains that Social Security \nand Medicare will face in the coming decades and was one of the first \nSenators to bring serious attention to this issue.\n  Mr. President, Al Simpson and I have agreed on many issues and \ndisagreed on many others, but as one trial lawyer to another, I have \nalways had a profound respect for his directness, his tenacity, his \ncandor, and most of all, his ability to tell a good joke. While we \nshall all miss his good humor and good counsel, we wish both him and \nhis wife, Ann, all the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12279-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12279-S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to one of the great \nnonpartisan, effective Senators of this body, Nancy Landon Kassebaum.\n  Senator Kassebaum's 18 years in the Senate have been marked by shifts \nback and forth in control of the Senate. She was elected into the \nminority, came into the majority within 2 years, returned to the \nminority in her second term, and recently returned to the majority.\n  She has been the Senator we needed in these times. Whichever \ndirection the winds of partisanship blew, she was the safe haven for \ncompromise and progress in the public interest. That is why her \nendorsement is courted so assiduously on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that the winds have blown back and forth, \nbut Senator Kassebaum has fixed on the great issues that concern all \nAmericans and sought the solutions we needed. I remember when we saw \nskyrocketing deficits in this body that we worked together to make a \nfreeze work. I had a ``Fritz Freeze'' and she had a ``K. G. B.'' \nfreeze--Kassebaum, Grassley, Biden, and Baucus. Finally, we worked \ntogether in 1987 on a joint, compromise freeze. She has also tackled \nlimiting campaign spending from a Constitutional point of view. We all\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\nknow the importance of finding a way to limit the influence of money in \npolitics, and she has not been reluctant to advance a thoughtful \nposition on that. And she has been a leader on making historic progress \nin South Africa. She has been the Senate's voice on Africa, and we \nappreciate that. Furthermore, she has been deeply involved in the issue \nof health research, particularly on Orphan Drugs. Basic health research \nis America's particular pride and strength, and she made sure that \nthose with rare diseases are included in our hopeful enterprise. That \nis a contribution that will change the lives of families through the \ngenerations, who otherwise would have suffered without any hope \nwhatsoever. Mr. President, these are all issues that are fundamentally \nimportant and nonpartisan. They reflect her judgment and her \nleadership, and we are privileged to have worked with her on them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must brag on my home city of Charleston. \nSenator Kassebaum has recognized its beauty through her frequent \nvisits, and, coincidentally, it is home to her son, his wife, and their \nchildren. I hope we will see more of her there after this Congress is \nover, but, certainly, she has been a real leader that we will miss in \nthis Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12279-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to wish my friend, Jim Exon, an \nenjoyable retirement from this body. It's been a pleasure to serve him \nfor the past 13 years, especially on the Budget Committee; together, \nwe've fought for issues which were important to the average American. \nWhen I think of Jim's many accomplishments, I will especially remember \nhis commitment to the Medicare program and his opposition to cutting \nMedicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  For the past 2 years, Jim has served as ranking minority member of \nthe Budget Committee. It's been a tumultuous time. But as a businessman \nwho founded a successful company, he brought to the Senate significant \nbusiness skills and a commitment to fiscal responsibility. That was \nalso evident in Jim's work on the Armed Services Committee, where he \nwas a persistent and effective voice to reduce waste in the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Recognized in the Senate as an authority on agriculture, rural \nAmerica, commerce, national defense and transportation, Jim was, above \nall, a voice for Nebraska's interests. Whether fighting for fair \ninternational trade agreements for mid-west agriculture, or \ncosponsoring legislation that made Medicare reimburse rural and urban \nhospitals at the same rate, or having Nebraska's Niobrara River \ndeclared a National Scenic River, Jim always championed the State he \nhad served as Governor.\n  It's no wonder that the book ``Politics in America'' notes that Jim \nExon, ``makes a real contribution to the Senate as a mirror of public \nopinion in America's heartland. It is hard to think of anyone else in \nthe chamber who so seems attuned to the questions and concerns of the \ntypical middle-American.''\n  Jim, your presence in the Senate will be sorely missed. Others may \nfill your seat, but few will be able to fill your shoes. As you begin \nthe next stage of your career and your life, I wish you all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12280-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENTIAL EXPORT TAX SYSTEMS ON U.S. OILSEED \n                               PROCESSORS\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, last month, as we were voting on an \nextension of the Generalized System of Preferences, I spoke on the \nfloor about a tax system employed by certain countries, including \nBrazil and Argentina, that operates to confer an unfair competitive \nadvantage on exports of oilseed products from those countries at the \nexpense of United States producers of these products. These unfair tax \nschemes, commonly known as differential export tax systems, or DETs, \nhave been of great concern to all soybean growing states, including my \nState of Illinois, one of the leading soybean States in our country.\n  As I explained last month, these tax schemes, which operate in much \nthe same way as WTO-impermissible export subsidies, make a mockery of \nthe principles of free and fair trade. Until these unfair tax schemes \nare eliminated in countries throughout the world, U.S. processors will \ncontinue to lose ground in world markets for soybean meal and oil.\n  I was therefore pleased to learn that the Government of Brazil \nrecently passed a law that eliminates these tax schemes in the states \nthat employ them. I want to take this opportunity to commend the \nGovernment of Brazil for this major achievement. By this action, the \nBrazilian Federal Government has greatly contributed to the further \nliberalization of world trade. I am hopeful that other countries that \ncontinue to rely upon these trade-distorting tax schemes will be \nencouraged to follow the lead of Brazil and take similar steps toward \ntrade liberalization. I will continue to monitor this issue closely, \nand if we do not see further progress in this regard, the Senate \nFinance Committee should consider examining this issue in more detail \nas part of its trade agenda in the next Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12280-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LORD & COMPANY, INC.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud today to praise an outstanding \nVirginian and his Virginia company. Juan G. ``Bill'' Cabrera is \nPresident of Lord & Company, Inc., in Manassas, VA, and last week Mr. \nCabrera was named the Minority Small Business Person of the Year for \nhis region of the country.\n  Government contracts are crucial to our country in so many ways. \nFirst, they are an essential part of Virginia's economy, especially in \nthe Northern Virginia area. Second, through minority contracting \nprograms, our government provides invaluable opportunities to minority-\nowned businesses to get a necessary foothold in the marketplace. Third, \nour taxpayers deserve and demand that they receive the maximum value \nfor their money.\n  Mr. Cabrera and his company are a perfect example of this important \ncombination. He moved the fledgling company from Alabama to Virginia in \n1984 where it began to acquire more contracts in the fields of \ninstrumentation, controls, and monitoring systems. In 1991, the Small \nBusiness Administration certified the firm for the section 8(a) \nprogram, and Lord & Company took off.\n  The company has received numerous quality awards from the Departments \nof the Navy and Army, Fairfax County Public Schools, and numerous \nprivate companies. Moreover, Mr. Cabrera has made special efforts to \ndiversify his workplace by hiring single parents, minorities, and \nothers in need of employment. The company has also started its own \ncontracting program by adopting a small minority-owned business and \nassisting it with technical and managerial support.\n  Mr. Cabrera has been recognized for his talents before, having served \nas a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business and \nattending the Amos Tuck School of Minority Business Executive Program \nat Dartmouth College.\n  In sum, Mr. Cabrera has shown remarkable energy in providing solid \nwork product to the taxpayers and his other clients, community \ninvolvement to his area, and jobs to his growing number of employees. I \nam proud to salute him for his recent award and look forward to hearing \nabout Lord & Company's continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12280-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12280-S12281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             S. 1986, UMATILLA BASIN PROJECT COMPLETION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, for two decades, I have worked to \nresolve the fishery and irrigation conflicts in the Umatilla River \nBasin in the northeastern region of my State of Oregon. In 1988, with \nthe passage of the Umatilla Basin Project Act, we brought all interests \ntogether behind a project which advanced the goal of restoring \nanadromous fish runs in the Umatilla River. The act authorized pumping \nfacilities to allow three irrigation districts, which previously \nwithdrew their water from the Umatilla River, to receive an equal \nvolume of water from the adjacent Columbia River to irrigate their \ncrops and, in return, leave their water in the river for fish. The \nproject, which has had no negative impact on the Columbia River, \nenabled the reintroduction of salmon stocks in the Umatilla River\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\nthat had been lost since the 1960's. Benefits of the project have been \nfelt by both the fish and the irrigators in the basin, whose water \nsupply is much more stable today than it was in the 1980's.\n  The Umatilla Basin Project has been a product of years of debate and \ngrassroots consensus building. I had hoped to build on that spirit this \nyear and reach an agreement which would have allowed the fourth, and \nfinal, Umatilla Basin irrigation district, the Westland Irrigation \nDistrict, to also exchange Umatilla River for Columbia River water. The \npotential for such an agreement to finally solve a number of remaining \nand long-standing water issues in the basin was very promising, and, \nlast July, I introduced a bill to complete the project, address the \nFederal Government's treaty fishery obligations to the Umatilla Tribes, \nadjust the boundaries of the four irrigation districts to formally \nincorporate lands that had long been irrigated with project water, and \nresolve water supply concerns jointly held by the Umatilla Indian \nReservation and the City of Pendleton, OR.\n  I commend the Umatilla Tribes, Umatilla Basin Irrigation Districts, \nthe State of Oregon, Water Watch of Oregon and the City of Pendleton \nfor their diligent efforts to attempt to resolve this complex and \ndifficult array of issues. Since last April, my staff has worked \nvirtually nonstop with all of these local interests, Congressman \nCooley, the House Resources Committee staff, the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee staff, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the \nClinton administration in an effort to forge a consensus agreement. \nUnfortunately, the consensus I had hoped for was not achieved. While \nthe parties agreed on the need to construct facilities to allow the \nfinal Columbia River exchange, referred to as Phase III, and other \nefforts to improve the Umatilla fishery, they could not agree on the \nterms and timing of the irrigation district boundary adjustment.\n  The four irrigation districts agreed to an environmental review of \ntheir boundary adjustment proposal. They also agreed to provide \nsignificant mitigation water for fish until the year 2003, or until a \nsubstantial portion of the Phase III exchange was on line, whichever \ncame first. They could not agree, however, to give the Secretary of the \nInterior the authority to act on the information obtained in connection \nwith a National Environmental Policy Act review, which was a condition \nof the boundary adjustment decision. Unfortunately, this discretion \nwas, in the eyes of the Clinton administration, an essential element of \nany agreement. In addition, the irrigation districts insisted that the \nauthorization of the Columbia River exchange facilities and other \nfacilities intended to improve the fishery be conditioned upon the \nsatisfaction of their boundary adjustment request. At this late date in \nthe congressional session, these differences of opinion proved to be \ninsurmountable.\n  Though my desire to complete the Umatilla Basin Project is great, I \ncould not allow myself or others to forget the overriding objective of \nthe 1988 Umatilla Basin Project Act. That act states that the decision \nto adjust the irrigation districts' boundaries ``shall be considered as \nsecondary to the purpose of providing water for fishery purposes.'' \nWhile it is understood that the Umatilla Basin Project should not \nnecessarily disadvantage irrigation districts, restoration of the \nanadromous fish runs must continue to be its predominant mission.\n  I regret that the parties failed to reach consensus on this most \nimportant issue, and I hope that the Oregon Delegation will work \ntogether with the affected parties in the 105th Congress to reach \nconsensus on the issues that remain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12280-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12281-S12283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have spoken on the Senate floor in a \npersonal tribute to Senator Claiborne Pell of my neighboring State of \nRhode Island, and I wish him well in his retirement, but this year we \nin the U.S. Senate are losing 12 other colleagues, all of whom have \nleft a unique mark on this institution and have served their states and \nthe American people with dignity and integrity. All have been committed \nto the concerns of their constituents and have fought for issues that \nhave moved this Nation forward and kept us strong, safe, and powerful. \nWe shall miss each of them, and we shall miss their friendship, \ncamaraderie, and counsel.\n\n\n                           Senator James Exon\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nJim Exon. The institution of the U.S. Senate is the hallmark of \nAmerican democracy. Few Members with whom I have served have more \nskillfully represented national concerns and constituent interests \nduring the long and arduous deliberations and debates in committee and \non the floor of the U.S. Senate than Jim Exon.\n  As Senator Exon leaves this body, he leaves a long and distinguished \npublic service record, a legacy of independence, dependability, and a \ntough, common sense approach to policy as well as politics which will \nnot be forgotten. As ranking minority member of the Budget Committee \nduring the challenging early days of the 104th Congress, Senator Exon, \nknowing full well the shortcomings of the Republican budget, withstood \nthe early onslaught of positive publicity for the new majority, and \ntirelessly devoted his efforts to leading the charge in committee not \nonly to point out, line by line, what was wrong, but to convince the \nAmerican people that he was right.\n  Senator Exon has been an anchor of reasoned debate and bi-\npartisanship on defense, transportation, and business issues as well as \non budget issues; and with his characteristic firmness, perseverance, \nand drive, he has always reflected the best of the pioneer tradition of \nhis beloved Nebraska. With his retirement, we will have lost a skilled \nand committed colleague who cares about public service and whose career \nis a symbol of institutional pride and personal responsibility to the \ncommon good.\n\n\n                         Senator Mark Hatfield\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the senior Senator from Oregon, Mark \nHatfield, who has been a beacon of bi-partisanship in this Chamber. \nSenator Hatfield has always been, above all, a statesman dedicated to \nthe Senate tradition of reasoned debate and responsible bipartisan \nsolutions. In seeking common ground, whether on the budget or on issues \nof arms control and peace or on issues affecting the day to day lives \nof his constituents and families across America, Senator Hatfield has \nnever been afraid to exercise his legendary independence, even if it \nmeant risking the wrath of his party.\n  Another word that aptly describes the long and distinguished public \nservice career of Senator Hatfield, is ``independence.'' In every one \nof his votes he has shown extraordinary integrity, and I have been \nespecially inspired by his work on arms control and his commitment to \ncommon sense in national and international affairs.\n  At a time in this institution when we hear partisan politics in a \nshrill crescendo, we shall miss his quiet, steady voice of reason and \nhis humanity, for he has been, in many ways, the conscience of the \nSenate. Mark Hatfield has left a mark on this place. I am hopeful we \nall will remember the standard he has set.\n\n\n                          Senator Bill Bradley\n\n  I want to pay tribute to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey whose \nintellect and passion for ideas tempered by a common sense perspective \nhave made him a calm voice for bipartisanship and logic. Senator \nBradley has never been bound by the way things have always been done. \nHe has always found a way to break new ground, find a better way, reach \nhigher, and strive harder to help redefine and restructure our response \nto children in the inner city, to race relations in America, to tax \nreform and campaign finance reform.\n  He led the 1986 tax reform bill and led the effort to delink human \nrights in China from the need to extend most-favored-nation status. I \nworked with him in that effort and recognized the keen, sharp \nhistorical perspective that he brings to human rights, international \neconomics, and international relations.\n  We have shared a commitment to Campaign Finance Reform and, again, \nhis extraordinary ability to find a new way, try a different idea, and \ndevise a better solution to our common problems has been inspiring as \nhas been his commitment. We have learned to respect his judgment and \nanalysis.\n  Mr. President, the quality of leadership and service embodied in the \nlife\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\nand career of Senator Bradley serves as a model for every young \nAmerican, and he shall be missed in the 105th Congress.\n\n\n                           Senator Hank Brown\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the distinguished Senior Senator from \nColorado, Hank Brown with whom it has been a pleasure to serve. When I \nwas chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and \nInternational Operations and he was the ranking member, we developed an \nextraordinary working relationship and I welcomed his friendship and \nhis counsel.\n  Senator Brown is thoughtful and deeply committed to the truth. He is \nfearless in his willingness to buck the system and ignore political \npressures to do what he believes is right. His commitment and counsel \nin finding the truth in the BCCI investigation led to legislation that \ntightened the banking laws and addressed narcotics trafficking.\n  Mr. President, in my work with Senator Hank Brown, I do not recall a \ntime when he lost his sense of humor or the twinkle in his eye. His \ncalm forceful commitment to his county, to his constituents, and to \nthis institution will be missed. I am grateful to have had the \nopportunity to serve with him.\n\n\n                            Senator Sam Nunn\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Georgia, Senator Sam \nNunn. I do not believe there is any Member of the Senate who is more \nstudious and astute. Any American who believes that a strong national \ndefense is a necessity in this changing world, will look to the career \nof Senator Nunn with respect and admiration. His specific knowledge and \nkeen analysis of defense issues, international relations, and armed \nservices is without equal. When it comes to NATO, his undertaking of \nthe complex historical relationships and potential policy alternatives \nthat have developed during the evolution of our involvement in NATO \nhave made him a world leader and the voice of reasoned debate.\n  Senator Nunn has led the fight for more efficient uses of defense \nresources and greater accountability of defense contractors. He has \nbeen an invaluable ally in this institution to every American in \nuniform. He has been a calm, reasonable leader in the defense debate of \nthe post-cold-war era.\n  Senator Nunn is as thoughtful as he is astute, as committed as he is \nwise, and as influential as he is fair. We will miss the kind of \nleadership that Senator Nunn has brought to this institution. We can be \nsure that debates on the floor of the Senate in the 105th Congress and \nthereafter will echo his leadership, his resolve, and his commitment. \nHis influence in defense policy--his legacy--will be felt for years to \ncome. I join my colleagues in wishing him well.\n\n\n                           Senator Bill Cohen\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Maine, Senator Bill \nCohen, a fellow New Englander, and our most renowned author, who has \nbeen respected on both sides of the aisle for his intellect and his \ndown-east devotion to his beloved Maine. Senator Cohen's intelligence \nand his substantive approach to the issues are surpassed only by his \nextraordinary range of talents.\n  Senator Cohen is known in this chamber for his devotion to detail and \nreasoned analysis of the issues, and recently he has expressed his \nconcerns about partisanship and the political atmosphere which has \ndominated debate on the Senate floor. But his concern has never led to \ncriticism of the process, people, or promise of this institution or of \nthe purpose and function of government. He has always been a positive \ninfluence and has sought to make government in general and the Senate \nin particular responsive, efficient, and accountable. Negativism has \nnot been a part of Senator Cohen's vocabulary.\n  He is going home to New England, and we know how much he loves his \nState of Maine, the beauty and the majesty of the rocky coast that \nreaches out into the Atlantic. As a fellow New Englander, I understand \nhis love for it. His roots are as deep as his commitment to his beliefs \nand principles, and whatever he chooses to do, we wish him well.\n\n\n                         Senator Howell Heflin\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Alabama, Senator \nHowell Heflin--Judge Heflin, or just Judge, as he is known to his \ncolleagues--whose long public service career has shaped the judicial \nsystem in this Nation. His temperance, knowledge, experience, and \nconstitutional scholarship have helped preserve the integrity of the \nword ``justice'' in our democracy and taught us the lesson of judicial \ntemperament and legislative leadership.\n  If there is one word that describes Senator Heflin it is \ndeliberative. He weighs the issues, individually without concern for \nparty or political expedience. He evaluates, analyzes, reevaluates and \nmakes a decision based on the facts and only the facts. Senator Heflin \nhas represented the people of Alabama with grace, charm, intelligence, \nand integrity. His service and his character represent the best of the \nU.S. Senate and his leadership and perspective shall be sorely missed \nwhen the Judiciary Committee convenes in the 105th Congress.\n\n\n                        Senator Nancy Kassebaum\n\n  I want to pay tribute to the Senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, \none of this institution's most respected authorities and most effective \nleaders on Labor and Human Resources issues. She is an extraordinary \nperson whose quiet commitment and personal integrity have marked a \npublic service career that has lived up to her family name and to the \nexpectations of the people of her beloved Kansas.\n  Her bipartisan leadership culminated this year in passage of the \nKennedy-Kassebaum health insurance bill that protects health benefits \nfor million of working Americans and relieves them of the fear of \nlosing their health insurance if they lose their jobs or have a \npreexisting condition. She was instrumental in giving America this \nlandmark health reform legislation when many said it could not be done \nthis year. I have also known Senator Kassebaum to be deeply committed \nto foreign affairs and especially to concerns of African nations.\n  Her name has become synonymous with education, public health, labor, \nand employment policies, but her devotion is to her family and to \nKansas. The Senate will miss her, but the people of Kansas will have \nher home.\n\n\n                        Senator Bennett Johnston\n\n  I want to pay tribute to Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana who \nhas served for 24 years on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. He has been either the chairman or the ranking member of \nthat committee for 16 of those 24 years and every year he has left his \nmark on this Nation's policies on the preservation and development of \nnatural resources.\n\n  His legislative skills and his knowledge of energy and natural \nresource issues are extraordinary and have led to the development of \npolicies and programs that have had a deep and lasting impact on our \nNation.\n  He has served the people of Louisiana faithfully, fairly, and with \ndiligence, and his legislative skills, leadership, and knowledge will \nbe missed in the 105th Congress.\n\n\n                          Senator Alan Simpson\n\n  I want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Alan Simpson, who has always brought his unique perspective to \nbear on the critical issues of our time. His carefully reasoned and \nfocused approach often has helped this Chamber see the essential center \nof issues with which he has been associated during his years on the \nJudiciary and Finance Committees.\n  I have worked with Senator Simpson on camping finance reform and the \ncandor, humor, and skill with which he approached the issue was \nrefreshing, insightful, and direct. He is the kind of Senator whom the \nAmerican people seek and re-elect because he reflects their interests \nand their ability to weed through the details to find the essential \ntruth.\n  Senator Simpson has served the interests of the people of Wyoming and \nof the West with profound skill and style and his personal commitment \nto immigration policy will mark a long and distinguished public service \ncareer. The Senate has been a better place because of the leadership of \nSenator Alan Simpson.\n\n\n                           Senator Paul Simon\n\n  I want to pay tribute to my colleague from Illinois, Senator Paul \nSimon. We shall long remember the Senator who wore a bow tie every day. \nHe brought to this Chamber a dignity and scholarship that has lifted \nthe level of debate\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nand preserved the grand traditions of this institution.\n  Senator Simon has been a national leader on literacy and on the power \nof the written word. His career and his life are a tribute to \nknowledge, learning, and the pursuit of excellence. Senator Simon has \nwalked these corridors with a quiet dignity and brought to them a sense \nof decency that we shall long remember.\n  Senator Simon is truly a skilled teacher. He has taught us, in the \nU.S. Senate, the lesson of civility and he has taught us and every \nAmerican who has heard his message that it is in the best interest of \nthis Nation to put a premium on intellect again. He has done so in his \nactions, words, and deeds, and he shall be missed not only for his bow \nties but for his honorable public service, his powerful independence, \nand his skill as a leader, a debater, and a quintessential U.S. \nSenator.\n\n\n                          Senator David Pryor\n\n  I want to pay tribute to my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator David Pryor who is a skilled and effective legislator with a \ngentlemanly southern charm and a modesty that belies his extraordinary \nskills and accomplishments.\n  Of his many accomplishments, not the least of which is his \nagricultural record for the people of Arkansas, Senator Pryor became an \noutspoken critic of the prices that pharmaceutical companies charge for \nprescription drugs and his leadership on the issue brought national \nattention to the problem and gave hope to millions of elderly Americans \nwho could not afford their medication.\n  Senator Pryor's record of leadership in public service is marked by \ncompassion and civility. I wish him all the best as he leaves the \nSenate and takes on new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12281-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEN OF COLOR HEALTH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at this time, I would like to take a moment \nto recognize, encourage, and pay tribute to a comprehensive, new health \ninitiative called ``The Men of Color Health Initiative'' which was \nstarted at the Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center in my State of \nMassachusetts in 1993. This outstanding health service has combined \nyears of careful and thoughtful research with a grassroots outreach \nprogram that brings to light important health care issues such as \naccess to health care for people of African, Asian and Latino descent \nthroughout Massachusetts and the United States.\n  The Men of Color Health Initiative was inspired by the need to \naddress, in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate manner, the many \nhealth and social issues facing men of color today. In 1993, \nrepresentatives of this program embarked upon a statewide study to \nexamine why ethnic minority men did not routinely have access to the \nhealth system. This project was designed to educate and activate men of \nAfrican, Asian and Latino descent with regard to healthy lifestyles and \nappropriate medical care. The key to this process was the need to \nunderstand the health care needs, experiences, issues and perceptions \nof these highly exposed and often neglected groups.\n  This focused health care initiative takes a large step forward in \nattempting to help men of color become more aware of the health care \noptions they have today. Many of the men interviewed before the \ninception of this program indicated that hospital emergency rooms were \ninsensitive, inefficient, nonresponsive, and biased against ethnic \nminority men. There was an underlying distrust in and cynicism about \nthe health system today. Many stated that language barriers keep them \naway from the options that they do have.\n  This program has gone the extra mile to see that the necessary \nsurveys are conducted and discussion groups are available for male \nhealth system users and community-based providers to elicit information \nabout viable methods to reach the population at risk. I applaud the \nefforts of this superb program and I wish it much success in the \nfuture. This thoughtful and successful program should be a model for \nothers across the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12283-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES COMPETITION IN CONTRACTING ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on May 23, I introduced a bill--S. 1797--to \nimplement the recommendation of the National Performance Review that we \nshould ``require [Federal Prison Industries] to compete commercially \nfor Federal agencies' business'' instead of having a legally protected \nmonopoly. My bill would ensure that the taxpayers get the best possible \nvalue for their Federal procurement dollars. If a Federal agency could \nget a better product at a lower price from the private sector, it would \nbe permitted to do so--and the taxpayers would get the savings.\n  Mr. President, many in both government and industry believe that FPI \nproducts are frequently overpriced, inferior in quality, or both. For \nexample, I understand that the Veterans Administration has sought \nrepeal of FPI's mandatory preference on several occasions, on the \ngrounds that FPI pricing for textiles, furniture, and other products \nare routinely higher than identical items purchased from commercial \nsources. Most recently, VA officials estimated that the repeal of the \npreference would save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency \nalone, making that money available for veterans services.\n  Similarly, the Deputy Commander of the Defense Logistics Agency, \nwrote in a May 3, 1996, letter to Members of the House that FPI has had \na 42-percent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries, \ncompared to a 6-percent rate for commercial industry. For this record \nof poor performance, FPI has charged prices that were an average of 13 \npercent higher than commercial prices.\n  On July 30, 1996, the master chief petty officer of the Navy \ntestified before the House National Security Committee that the FPI \nmonopoly on Government furniture contracts has undermined the Navy's \nability to improve living conditions for its sailors. Master Chief \nPetty Officer John Hagan stated, and I quote:\n\n       In order to efficiently use our scarce resources, we need \n     congressional assistance in changing the Title 18 statute \n     that requires all the Services to obtain a waiver for each \n     and every furniture order not placed with the Federal Prison \n     Industry/UNICOR. * * * Speaking frankly, the FPI/UNICOR \n     product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. \n     UNICOR has, in my opinion, exploited their special status \n     instead of making changes which would make them more \n     efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need \n     your support to change the law and have FPI compete with GSA \n     furniture manufacturers. Without this change, we will not be \n     serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and \n     efficient way.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1797 is supported by the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the Business and Industrial Furniture \nManufacturers' Association, the American Apparel Manufacturers' \nAssociation, the Industrial Fabrics Association International, and the \nCompetition in Contracting Act Coalition. It is also supported by \nhundreds of small businesses from Michigan and around the country that \nhave seen FPI take jobs away from their businesses and give them to \npersons convicted of crimes and serving time in prison, and are \njustifiably outraged.\n  We all want to do what we can to ensure that we make constructive \nwork available for Federal prisoners, but the way we are doing it is \nwrong. As one small businessman in the furniture industry put it in \ntestimony at a House hearing earlier this year:\n\n       Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in \n     and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who \n     was twice wounded fighting for our country and give that work \n     to criminals who have trampled on honest citizens' rights, \n     therefore effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's \n     business which the Veteran's Administration suggested he \n     enter?\n\n  Mr. President, my bill would not restrict FPI's business. It would \nnot require FPI to close any of its facilities. It would not force FPI \nto eliminate any jobs for Federal prisoners. It would not undermine \nFPI's ability to ensure that inmates are productively occupied. It \nwould simply require FPI to compete for Federal contracts on the same \nterms as all other Federal contractors. That is simple justice to the \nhard-working citizens in the private sector,\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\nwith whom FPI would be required to compete.\n\n  Mr. President, I intended to offer S. 1797 as an amendment to either \nthe Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill or the omnibus \nappropriations bill. Unfortunately, the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations bill was never brought to the Senate floor, and the \nomnibus appropriations bill was brought up under an agreement which \npermitted no amendments. This parliamentary situation made it \nimpossible for me to bring S. 1797 before the Senate for its \nconsideration.\n  I want to assure Federal Prison Industries, however, that this issue \nis not going to go away. The issue is too important to the taxpayers, \nand too important to the many small businesses adversely affected by \nunfair competition from Federal Prison Industries, to be ignored.\n  Earlier today, I received a letter transmitting the administration's \nformal position on S. 1797. This letter clearly indicates the \nadministration's agreement that the process by which Federal agencies \npurchase products from Federal Prison Industries needs to be reformed. \nThat letter states:\n\n       The Administration favors reform of Federal Prison \n     Industries to improve its customer service, pricing, and \n     delivery while not endangering its work program for Federal \n     inmates. . . .  The Administration will present reform \n     proposals for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in \n     the next session of Congress.\n\n  I ask that a copy of this letter appear in the Congressional Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with this letter, the administration has \npromised to join us in a serious reevaluation of the process by which \nFederal Prison Industries sells its products to other Federal agencies. \nThe heart of that process is, of course, FPI's mandatory source status. \nThe administration has made a commitment to present us with a reform \nproposal in the next Congress, and I intend to hold the administration \nto that commitment.\n  Mr. President, I do not consider myself to be an enemy of Federal \nPrison Industries. I am a supporter of the idea of putting Federal \ninmates to work. A strong prison work program not only reduces inmate \nidleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work ethic, \nprovide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to product society \nupon their release.\n  However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a \nmanner that does not unfairly eliminate the jobs of hard-working \ncitizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able to achieve \nthis result only if it diversifies its product lines and avoids the \ntemptation to build its work force by continuing to displace private \nsector jobs in its traditional lines of work.\n  We need to have jobs for prisoners, but it is unfair and wasteful to \nallow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and when it will take \nthem. Competition will be better for FPI, better for the taxpayer, and \nbetter for working men and women around the country. I look forward to \nworking with the administration in the next Congress to make reform of \nFederal Prison Industries a reality.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: During consideration of the FY 97 \n     appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice and State, you had \n     originally proposed a floor amendment incorporating your \n     bill, S. 1797, regarding the Federal Prison Industries. At \n     the time, the Administration developed a statement regarding \n     that amendment. Since the amendment was never introduced, no \n     statement was ever sent.\n       At your request, we are providing you in this letter with \n     the statement that would have been sent. It reads as follows:\n       ``The Administration favors reform of Federal Prison \n     Industries to improve its customer service, pricing, and \n     delivery while not endangering its work program for Federal \n     inmates. The appropriations process is not the best way to \n     address this issue. The Administration will present reform \n     proposals for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in \n     the next session of Congress.''\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Steven Kelman,\n     Administrator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12283-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12284-S12285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ASPEN STRATEGY GROUP RECOMMENDS MEASURES TO REDUCE NUCLEAR \n                          PROLIFERATION THREAT\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, our Nation faces many national security \nchallenges in the post-cold war era. I can think of no greater \nchallenge than the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The Aspen Strategy Group, which I chair along with Ken \nDam, is committed to providing a bipartisan forum within which to \naddress this and other national security concerns.\n  In August of this year, the Aspen Strategy Group, which included top \nU.S. national security officials and experts, met in Colorado to \ndiscuss our Nation's proliferation challenges and policies. I believe \nthe observations from these meetings, as well as the resulting ideas \nand recommendations, will enhance our Nation's understanding of these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Aspen Strategy Group's recommendations related to the threat of \nnuclear proliferation.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nBipartisan Aspen Strategy Group Recommends PracticaL Measures to Reduce \n                     Nuclear Proliferation Threats\n\n       The Aspen Strategy Group (ASG), chaired by Senator Sam Nunn \n     and Ken Dam, met in Aspen, Colorado on 10-15 August to \n     examine post-Cold War threats presented by the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Several top U.S. \n     officials, including the Secretary of Defense, attended the \n     ASG meeting, along with leading experts on weapons \n     proliferation from the United States and other countries. The \n     group reached a general (although not necessarily unanimous) \n     consensus on several points.\n       The ASG believes that the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction constitutes one of the greatest threats the \n     United States faces in the post-Cold War era. Accordingly, \n     controlling WMD proliferation is among our top national \n     security policy priorities.\n       Efforts to control WMD proliferation provide a mixture of \n     good news and bad:\n       Important progress has been achieved in restraining--even \n     rolling back--nuclear proliferation. The Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty has been extended indefinitely. The \n     nuclear weapons formerly controlled by Ukraine, Belarus and \n     Kazakhstan have been consolidated in Russian hands. South \n     Africa has voluntarily dismantled its nuclear arsenal. Brazil \n     and Argentina terminated their nuclear efforts, and North \n     Korea has frozen its weapons program. And, most recently, a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been approved.\n       But new threats have also appeared, and they appear \n     particularly difficult to control. Russia continues to \n     present a ``loose nukes'' problem. Moreover, the dangers of \n     biological and chemical weapons proliferation have become \n     more acute. Dual use BW and CW technology is widely \n     available, and such weapons activities are relatively easy to \n     conceal. Subnational groups as well as states have sought \n     (successfully in the case of the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan) \n     to acquire such capabilities. Millenarian or terrorist \n     groups, moreover, may not be susceptible to the rational \n     calculus of deterrents.\n       The Aspen Strategy Group believes that, while there is no \n     ``silver bullet'' with which to eliminate threats of WMD \n     proliferation, there are a variety of steps that should be \n     taken to lessen current risks. These include:\n       1) Enhance Nunn-Lugar Legislation. The Nunn-Lugar program \n     was designed to improve U.S. security by preventing hostile \n     parties from acquiring the nuclear weapons, materials, and \n     technology of the former Soviet Union. It has achieved \n     demonstrable results. Yet Nunn-Lugar funds have been targeted \n     for cuts by congressional appropriations committees, and \n     critics cite Russian policies vis-a-vis Chechnya, Bosnia or \n     the Middle East as grounds for such cuts.\n       The ASG agreed that the Nunn-Lugar legislation is not a \n     favor to Moscow. Rather, it serves the security interests of \n     the United States, and it deserves to be fully funded. The \n     group urges the Administration to exert greater efforts to \n     marshall support for this legislation, and enjoin Congress to \n     extend to it the financial support its success to date \n     warrants.\n       2) Ratification of the Chemicals Weapons Convention. \n     Congressional ratification of the CWC is long overdue. While \n     this treaty will not eliminate all CW threats, it does \n     provide significant benefits--not least the assurance that \n     foreign governments will be obligated to monitor terrorist \n     threats.\n       Some complain about the treaty's enforcement provisions. \n     But the CWC will soon achieve the ratification by the 65 \n     governments that are required for it to go into effect. The \n     ability of the United States to propose modifications and \n     qualifications to the enforcement provisions depends on its \n     being one of the countries ratifying its adoption. Staying \n     out of the treaty, moreover, could place our chemical firms \n     at a commercial disadvantage.\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\n       Others are concerned that the CWC will not cover the most \n     critical cases, i.e., those in which national governments are \n     determined to develop chemical weapons and seek to evade \n     controls. This may be true, but dealing with these cases will \n     require the effort of international coalitions, and the \n     cooperative process of enacting the CWC will facilitate the \n     establishment of such coalitions. The treaty would also \n     establish international norms for compliance and monitoring, \n     providing objective goals for these coalitions. In light of \n     these benefits, the ASG urges the Congress expeditiously to \n     ratify the CWC.\n       (3) Improve federal, state and local capabilities to \n     respond to CW and BW attacks. If a foreign state or terrorist \n     group utilized CW or BW attacks against our people, the first \n     authorities on the scene will be state and local authorities. \n     Thus, cooperation between federal and local authorities is \n     more important than ever, as is cooperation between domestic \n     law enforcement agencies and national intelligence \n     organizations.\n       The ASG believes the United States, building on the base \n     established by the Nunn-Lugar legislation and subsequent \n     Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendments, should undertake a more \n     comprehensive effort to develop and coordinate policies for \n     dealing with BW and CW threats. The initial agenda for such a \n     program should include:\n       The development of coordinated interagency and federal/\n     state/local government plans for responding to a CW and/or BW \n     attack, including the sharing of information, personnel and \n     equipment;\n       The review of statutes and other legal institutions \n     necessary for effective cooperation between different levels \n     of government on this issue;\n       The promotion of cooperation between government authorities \n     in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to develop \n     measures to monitor materials that could be used to create \n     chemical and biological agents.\n       (4) Review U.S. policy of ``no first use.'' With the end of \n     the Cold War and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact, one \n     pillar underlying our reluctance to commit to ``no first \n     use'' of nuclear weapons has disappeared. During the Gulf War \n     the Bush Administration warned Saddam Hussein that any use of \n     chemical or biological weapons would provoke a massive U.S. \n     response--allowing the inference that nuclear weapons might \n     be used. While ASG members held different views about the \n     desirability of translating the Gulf War declaratory policy \n     into a general principle of U.S. policy, they agreed on the \n     importance and timeliness of an official review of this \n     issue.\n       (5) Preserve a full-court defense against Iraqi efforts to \n     acquire WMD. Iraq continues to develop weapons of mass \n     destruction in defiance of the international community. \n     Diplomatically, it seeks to initiate United Nations \n     monitoring and remove sanctions. The ASG believes that we \n     must not compromise on the UN enforcement of sanctions on \n     Iraq or its efforts to monitor Iraqi WMD activities. The \n     maintenance of adequate U.S. forces to ensure Iraq's \n     compliance remains essential.\n       (6) The role of the media. The ASG urges that the media \n     consider its own role in dealing with issues related to \n     weapons of mass destruction. The widespread availability of \n     sensitive information is a significant factor in the ability \n     of nations and subnational groups to develop WMD. The \n     effectiveness of terrorist groups to employ such weapons for \n     coercion may depend on media reactions. And, if a real or \n     suspected CW or BW attach should occur, the media response \n     (if it stimulated public panic) could greatly complicate the \n     efficacy of official actions.\n       These are delicate issues, for they raise questions about \n     civil liberties and freedom of the press. Government \n     officials must be particularly sensitive to these matters in \n     their efforts to address the problem. Yet the media must \n     begin to develop standards for responding to reports of \n     terrorist WMD threats or attacks. Some discussion between \n     representatives of the media and government officials about \n     how the government and the press deal with each other in a \n     crisis and how press freedoms can be reconciled with a need \n     for public order and security would be timely and relevant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARV TEIXEIRA\n\n  Mr. REID.

BOWSHER\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of our Nation's \nmost dedicated and loyal public servants, Comptroller General of the \nUnited States Charles A. Bowsher.\n  On September 30 of this year, Charles Bowsher will complete his term \nof office as Comptroller General of the United States and head of the \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  In 1981, President Reagan appointed Mr. Bowsher to a 15-year term as \nComptroller General of the United States. This appointment capped a \nlong and distinguished career in both the public and private sectors. \nPrior to his appointment, Mr. Bowsher was associated with Arthur \nAndersen & Co. Between 1967 and 1971, he interrupted his 25-year career \nat Arthur Andersen to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for \nFinancial Management.\n  During those years, Mr. President, I had the privilege of working \nwith Chuck Bowsher in my capacity as Under Secretary--and later \nSecretary--of the Navy. His critical work as Assistant Secretary earned \nhim the Distinguished Public Service Awards from both the Navy and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office, or GAO as we call it, \nis one of the least heralded agencies of the Federal Government. \nCongress created the GAO in 1921 with the mandate to audit, evaluate, \nor investigate virtually all Federal Government operations--wherever \nthey might take place. In other words, the GAO serves as a watchdog \nover the taxpayers' money--guarding against fraud, abuse, and \ninefficient allocation of public funds.\n  In its oversight capacity, the GAO produces in-depth reports at the \nspecific request of congressional committees, or on its own initiative. \nRecently, GAO reports have served as a nonpartisan factual basis for \ncongressional debate on issues ranging from health care reform and the \nsavings and loan crisis to the Federal budget deficit and efforts to \nreinvent government. Meanwhile, the agency continues to monitor high-\nrisk government activities that could lead to major losses from waste, \nfraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n  Under Chuck Bowsher's leadership, the GAO has saved taxpayers \nbillions and billions of dollars. GAO recommendations assist Members of \nCongress and the executive branch in making difficult decisions on the \neffective use of scarce Federal funds. Over the past decade, Congress \nhas implemented numerous GAO recommendations--including budget \nreductions, cost avoidances, appropriations deferrals, and revenue \nenhancements--totaling more than $100 billion. Each year, the agency \nissues more than 1,000 written reports, and its officials testify as \nmany as 300 times before congressional committees.\n  In short, Mr. President, under Chuck Bowsher's leadership the GAO has \ndone an outstanding job of protecting the taxpayers' interests while \npromoting sound fiscal management practices throughout the Federal \nGovernment. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring a truly \nexceptional public servant who has served this Nation with integrity, \ndedication, honor, and dilligence--the Honorable Charles A. Bowsher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12285-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12285-S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY IN THE PIPELINE BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last Thursday, the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent S. 1505, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and \nPartnership Act. I'm\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\npleased that the following day, the House of Representatives also \nadopted the bill by a significant margin. The bill has now been sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  Mr. President, in the hours leading up to House consideration of the \nbill, a concern was raised that a provision in the bill might impact \nwetlands protection.\n  By way of background, let me say that under current law, the \nDepartment of Transportation [DOT] is required to identify unusually \nsensitive environmental areas. Once these areas have been identified, \nDOT is to promulgate special rules to minimize the chances of a liquid \npipeline accident in these areas. DOT is currently in the process of \nimplementing this provision of the law.\n  In fact, current law does not identify wetlands as one of the areas \nDOT should look at when making its identification of these unusually \nsensitive environmental areas. That is why I and my fellow cosponsors \nattempted to remedy this situation through language in S. 1505. The \nbill directs DOT to include ``critical wetlands'' in its consideration.\n  Apparently, the use of the term ``critical'' has raised a question in \nsome parts of the environmental community as to whether we are \nattempting to create a new category of wetlands that might undermine \nother wetlands protection programs carried out by the Environmental \nProtection Agency or the Corps of Engineers. This is just not true.\n  I want to assure first, the American people and second, the \nenvironmental community, that the language of S. 1505 is simply \nintended to give direction to the Department of Transportation, and its \nOffice of Pipeline Safety.\n  In no way are the words intended to have any precedent-setting effect \non any other law or agency. In no way are the words designed to \ndiminish the role of DOT to protect the environment and the public's \nsafety in and around pipelines.\n  Mr. President, I have recently spoken to all of my cosponsors of S. \n1505, and they too agree with what I have just said. They too share the \nsame interpretation of the words and the intention of the legislation.\n  This language will strengthen the pipeline safety program's \nprotection of both the environment, and the public's safety.\n  Mr. President, again I want to reiterate this language is not \nintended to have any impact outside the pipeline safety program. I \nbelieve the criticisms aimed at the use of the term ``critical \nwetlands'' are unjustified. I believe it is a false canard.\n  Mr. President, I hope this statement clears up any administration \nmisconception that may exist on this matter. And, I hope the President \npromptly signs this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12285-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

BERAM VETERAN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on November 16, 1996, the Nicholas G. \nBeram Veteran's Association will celebrate its 50th anniversary at a \ndinner event in Randolph, MA. I regret very much that I will not be \nable to join the members of this fine organization on their special \noccasion. However, I would like to take a few moments to share with the \nmembers of this body the association's half-century of history.\n  The Nicholas G. Beram Veteran's Association was founded in 1946 by a \nsmall group of Syrian-Lebanese veterans from the Boston area. From 25 \ncharter members this group has grown to over 250 veterans; its ranks \ncomprised of individuals who have served their country with distinction \nin every military conflict since World War II.\n  The Nicholas G. Beram Veteran's Association has made commendable \nefforts in honoring the service, not only of its own members, but of \nall Arab-American veterans. The deceased receive a special service at \nthe wake, and their families are presented with an American flag. This \nyear more than 450 graves of Arab-American veterans in 15 cemeteries in \nthe Boston area were decorated. Additionally, the association maintains \na long-established scholarship fund that provides annual $1,000 grants \nto up to nine students.\n  As the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, I take special pride in the \nactivities of the Nicholas G. Beram Veteran's Association. I salute its \nmembers for their five decades of commitment to their heritage and \nservice in our Nation's Armed Forces. On behalf of all my Senate \ncolleagues, I congratulate the Nicholas G. Beram Veteran's Association \non what I am certain will be a successful anniversary celebration, and \nextend my best wishes for future years of continued prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12286-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12286-S12287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LOW INCOME HOUSING CREDIT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Senators Moseley-Braun and Baucus and I \nwant to call attention to a matter that is very important to the small \ngroup affected. At the end of my remarks I will ask that a letter to \nHUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, signed by myself and Senators Baucus and \nMoseley-Braun, be included in the Record. We are asking the Secretary \nto review the criteria for income determination for the low-income \nhousing tax credit and consider using the criteria and standards \nalready in effect under the low-income guidelines for section 8 of the \nU.S. Housing Act as income guidelines for the low-income housing tax \ncredit.\n  Senators Baucus and Moseley-Braun have seen situations in Montana and \nIllinois similar to one facing the community of Hibbing, MN. Several \nyears ago, the city of Hibbing organized a development program to \npurchase and restore the historic Androy Hotel in downtown Hibbing. The \nhotel was run down and had been abandoned. The rehabilitation was \nimportant to the city of Hibbing not only because of the history of the \nAndroy Hotel, but because it symbolically dominates the downtown area.\n  The rehabilitated hotel has been constructed for much needed senior \ncitizen housing and there has been historic restoration of the hotel \nballroom and lobby on the first floor. The low-income housing tax \ncredit program made some of the funding provided by the city of Hibbing \nand a local bank possible.\n  The low-income housing tax credit restricts the use of housing units \nto seniors of a certain income level. Unfortunately, because of a \nunique situation, many Hibbing seniors are just above the prescribed \nincome level. This is because in Hibbing there is a long history of \nsaving for retirement due to the commitment by the iron mining industry \nto solid pension programs and Social Security income for both\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\nspouses. Thus, almost all low-income seniors in Hibbing who would like \nto move to the Androy are not eligible to do so.\n  If the Secretary were to apply different income guidelines such as \nsection 8 low-income housing guidelines to the low-income housing tax \ncredit, the Androy Hotel and other buildings rehabilitated for low-\nincome elderly residents could be occupied. There is a great need for \nmore affordable housing in many communities, particularly for those on \nfixed incomes. Many senior citizens welcome the opportunity to move to \nfacilities for seniors that are in their own communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our letter to Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development Henry Cisneros be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Henry G. Cisneros,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to bring to your \n     personal attention some unique situations in Illinois, \n     Montana, and Minnesota relating to the use of the low income \n     housing tax credit. Some serious problems have developed with \n     certain facilities during the ``rent up'' phase in projects \n     designed for senior citizens.\n       Senior citizens were supposed to live in these housing \n     projects, but the income limits for the elderly populations \n     are the problem. Senior citizens are uniquely over income in \n     these areas in which the projects are located.\n       The Department of the Treasury has issued a notice \n     explaining that, for purposes of determining qualifications \n     as a low income housing project, the income of individuals \n     and area gross income will be determined in a manner \n     consistent with the determination of annual income and the \n     estimates for median family income under Section 8 of the \n     U.S. Housing Act of 1937.\n       Therefore, because of the authority which has been \n     delegated to HUD regarding income determination for the low \n     income tax credit, we would ask that you consider and review \n     existing criteria and standards already in effect under \n     Section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to determine if \n     these guidelines provide any relief for these situations. \n     There are special factors that create these situations in our \n     states and probably others as well.\n       We would appreciate your review of this issue and look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Paul Wellstone,\n     Max Baucus,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12286-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12287-S12288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senate adjourns and we all go \nhome and spend time with our families and our constituents, I wanted to \njoin my good friend, Senator Feingold, to discuss the issue of campaign \nfinance reform.\n  This year, Senator Feingold and Senator Thompson and myself \nintroduced comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation. Our bill \nwas the first bipartisan effort in this area in over 10 years. We \nworked hard, and we fought a valiant fight. Unfortunately, we did not \nsucceed. But I am here today to put the Senate on notice that the fight \nis far from over--as a matter of fact, it is just beginning.\n  Our effort is about restoring the public's faith in the Congress and \nthe electoral system. It is about elections being won or lost based on \nidealogy, not fundraising. It is about leveling the playing field \nbetween challengers and incumbents. And it is about bringing a dramatic \nchange to the status quo.\n  Mr. President, poll after poll demonstrates that the public has lost \nfaith in the Congress. One of the reasons this has occurred is because \nthe public believes--rightly or wrongly--that special interests control \nthe political and electoral system. In order to limit the ability of \nspecial interests to control the process, we must enact campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Well, Mr. President, as I stated, we will continue in our efforts. We \nwill be introducing a new campaign finance reform bill on the first day \nof the 105th Congress. And we will be taking all necessary steps to \nensure that our bill is addressed early in the Congress.\n  During consideration in the 104th Congress, countless hearings were \nheld on this matter. I believe we all learned a considerable amount \nfrom those hearings. But as every schoolchild knows, some day you have \nto move past the classroom, go into the real world, and put what you \nlearned to good use. We are at that stage.\n  Mr. President, as I have often noted, if we do nothing on this matter \nwe invite the contempt of the American people and such contempt is a \npoison that hurts our democracy. Simply, we must act to pass campaign \nfinance reform.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Thompson and most \nimportantly, my good friend, Senator Feingold, for all they have done \non this subject. I am deeply grateful to have them as my comrades-in-\narms as we move forward to fight for this needed reform again.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nand good friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, to once again urge \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in making a \ncommitment to pass meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform.\n  Just a few months ago, we had an abbreviated but spirited discussion \nhere on the Senate floor about the issue of campaign reform. The \nSenator from Arizona and I, along with the Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson, brought to this floor the first bipartisan campaign \nfinance reform bill in a decade.\n  The importance of the bipartisan nature of that effort should not be \nglossed over too quickly. For the previous 10 years, the battle over \ncampaign reform had been marked by partisan skirmishes--Democrats \naccusing Republicans of defending the status quo, Republicans accusing \nDemocrats of attempting to rig a system to protect their congressional \nmajorities. And not surprisingly, nothing was accomplished.\n  But last year, in what one newspaper called the ``most hopeful and \nremarkable legislative development in Washington of 1995'', three U.S. \nSenators of vastly differing political and philosophical ideologies, \nsat down in a room and drafted a comprehensive reform proposal that was \ndesigned to be fair to Democrats, Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives alike.\n  We certainly had our differences. I have long been a supporter of \npublic financing. The Senator from Arizona believes we can encourage \ncandidates to limit their campaign spending and reduce campaign costs \nby providing free television time to congressional candidates. The \nSenator from Tennessee is one of this Congress' most ardent advocates \nof congressional term limits. But despite these differences, we also \nfound we had many commonalities in how we believe our political system \nshould function.\n  For example, we each have significant misgivings about the role money \nplays in our electoral system. We shared a concern that more and more \nAmericans are choosing not to run for public office because they lack \nthe access to the millions of dollars necessary to run a competitive \ncampaign. We were troubled that Americans have come to view their \nelected leaders and representatives with a depth of cynicism not seen \nsince the early 1970's.\n  That is why we put together a proposal that could be supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. That proposal, for the first time \never, would have provided congressional candidates access to low-cost \nmedia and postage rates in exchange for a candidate's voluntary \ncompliance with limits on their campaign spending. Specifically, \ncandidates would have had to agree to three limits: a limit on their \noverall spending based on the size of their State, a strict limit on \nthe amount of personal funds they expend during their campaign, and a \nrequirement to raise at least 60 percent of their campaign funds from \nindividuals residing in their home States.\n\n  The proposal had a number of other important provisions as well. The \nbill would have sharply limited the influence of political action \ncommittees. It would have reformed the congressional franking process \nwhich has seen its share of abuse in recent years. It would have \nrestricted the practice of bundling campaign contributions to \ncircumvent contribution limits. It would have provided candidates \ngreater protection from independent expenditures and required greater \naccountability for those who engage in negative advertising.\n  And perhaps most importantly, it would have essentially shut down the \nsoft money system--a system that has shown itself this year to be \ncompletely\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\nout of control. Soft money, a term used to describe an unregulated and \nunlimited flow of money between the special interests and Washington \nlawmakers, is severely undermining and compromising the effectiveness \nof the Presidential system and is making a mockery of every single one \nof the limits we have in current law that governs how much individuals \nand entities may contribute to congressional candidates.\n  So what happened here on the Senate floor last June, Mr. President? \nAfter a limited debate we were unable to gain the 60 votes necessary to \novercome a procedural hurdle and cut off a filibuster. But we did \nreceive a remarkable 54 votes, including several from our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. Let me repeat that, Mr. President. A \nstrong majority in the U.S. Senate voted in favor of advancing the \nMcCain-Feingold reform proposal.\n  Some have said that this doomed any hope for campaign finance reform, \nthat this was the end of the line for this issue. On the contrary Mr. \nPresident, this is clearly just the beginning for bipartisan campaign \nfinance reform. It took us 3 years to reform our lobbying disclosure \nlaws. It took us 3 years to finally reform the Senate's rules on the \nacceptance of lobbyist-provided gifts, meals, and vacation junkets. And \nit may take us just as long to see real campaign reform enacted into \nlaw.\n  I for one am fully confident that we will prevail. We will prevail \nbecause it is becoming increasingly difficult for opponents of campaign \nreform to defend an indefensible system that is crumbling all around \nthem. To suggest that the current system is fair, is functional, and is \nworthy of the voters' trust is simply an absurd proposition and no one \nis buying it.\n  We have already begun to hear some of the numbers coming in and it is \nbecoming clear that the current trend of skyrocketing campaign costs \nwill continue through the 1996 elections. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona and I will be back here during the opening days of the \n105th Congress to discuss those numbers and to shine a spotlight on \nsome of the darkest corners of our political system.\n  Two years ago at this time, my Republican colleagues were touting \ntheir Contract With America and the issues they hoped to address in the \nfirst 100 days of the new Congress. I said it countless times then that \none issue that was conspicuously missing from that contract was \ncampaign finance reform. I was, quite frankly, astonished that although \nother reform issues were mentioned, there was not a single word about \nwhat has to be considered the mother of all reform issues. It was \nentirely omitted from the contract.\n\n  Not surprisingly, we did not debate campaign finance reform in the \nfirst 100 days of the 104th Congress. Or the second 100 days. Or the \nthird, or the fourth. In fact, we did not debate campaign finance \nreform here in the Senate until 18 months after the start of the 104th \nCongress. Eighteen months, Mr. President. It was a pretty good strategy \nby our opponents. They knew that by waiting so long to schedule debate \non campaign reform that it would be highly unlikely that there would be \nenough time in the legislative session for a proposal to work its way \nthrough the legislative process and become law.\n  In the House, the strategy was even simpler. They just refused to \nallow the bipartisan reform bill modeled after the McCain-Feingold bill \nto come up for a vote. By only allowing votes on a Democratic reform \nbill and a Republican reform bill, the House leadership guaranteed that \nno reform bill would leave the House alive.\n  So rather than throwing any kind of knockout punch, the Congress has \nchosen to bob and weave around the issue of campaign finance reform. \nThis cannot be allowed to happen in the 105th Congress, and that is why \nthe Senator from Arizona and I are joining today to call on our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to agree to debate campaign \nfinance reform here on the Senate floor during the first 100 days of \nthe 105th Congress. It does not matter if Republicans retain control of \nthis body or if Democrats can reclaim the majority--campaign reform \nmust be the subject of floor debate in the first 100 days of 1997, \nregardless of the outcome of the elections.\n  Mr. President, the campaign finance reform landscape has experienced \na significant shift in recent years. When I arrived here in 1993 and in \nthe years before that, there was certainly a significant block of \nSenators that believed that money had little role in the outcome of \nelections. They believed that the embodiment of true political reform \nwas to have unlimited campaign spending coupled with even less \nregulation of the entire campaign finance system.\n  Some still cling to that viewpoint, Mr. President, but not many. I'd \nlike to point to a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives \njust about 2 months ago. On July 25, the House voted on legislation \nbacked by Speaker Gingrich that had as its foundation the Speaker's \nview that our campaign system is not overfunded as most of us believe, \nbut is in fact underfunded. That legislation, known as the Thomas bill, \nwould have opened up the campaign finance system and permitted \nunlimited campaign spending to continue without providing any \nassistance to challengers and not a single reform of the soft money \nprocess.\n  What happened to that bill, Mr. President? Quite simply, it was \nobliterated on the House floor by a vote of 259 to 162. Nearly 70 \nRepublican House Members, nearly 70 of them Mr. President, rebelled \nagainst the Speaker and voted against his bill.\n  We have seen some amazing things happen in the other body over the \ncourse of the last 2 years. We have seen some eye-opening votes over \nthere. But I cannot think of another single vote where so many \nRepublican House Members defied Speaker Gingrich and voted against a \nbill that he was so prominently a part of.\n  Mr. President, considering that the Speaker's point of view was so \nuniversally condemned on the floor of the House, and considering that \nthe McCain-Feingold bill received a majority of votes in this body, I \nnot only think that bipartisan campaign finance reform is a strong \npossibility, I think that it is a strong probability. Republicans want \nit, Democrats want it, incumbents want it, challengers need it, and \nmost importantly, the American people are demanding it.\n  I would hope that our other colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, \nwill join the senior Senator from Arizona and I in insisting that the \n105th Congress address the issue of campaign finance reform in the \nfirst 100 days of the next congressional session. I want to once again \nthank my colleague and friend from Arizona for his perseverance on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12287-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12288-S12289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL STUDENT/PARENT MOCK ELECTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to highlight a program \nthat brings a greater comprehension and appreciation of the democratic \nprocess to millions of American students from kindergarten through high \nschool: the National Student/Parent Mock Election.\n  The benefits of this fine program cannot be underestimated. Students \nwho have participated in the National Student/Parent Mock Election \nreport that it had a profound effect on them and made them aware of the \nrights and the responsibilities inherent in their U.S. citizenship. By \nstressing the importance of voter participation early on, these \nstudents gain a greater understanding of the democratic process, \nparticularly the fact that democracy does not happen by itself. It \nsucceeds only if citizens are informed and participate.\n  Many of the ``State Election Headquarters'' which collect the votes \nfrom the schools will host spirited mock ``conventions'' complete with \nstudent ``delegates'' and ``anchors'' reporting the outcomes of the \nPresidential and Congressional elections. Taking part in these events \ngives students a sense of political ownership. Students also see first \nhand the work and effort that go into a political campaign.\n  State participation in the National Student/Parent Mock Election is \ncrucial. For example, in my own state of Utah, Governor Michael Leavitt \nhas proclaimed October 30 as ``Mock Election Day.'' More than 46,000 \nUtah students have registered to vote, doubling voter turnouts from the \nlast election.\n  The California Mock Election will employ a formal voter registration \nprocedure so that students can better understand the voting process. \nBesides voting for the President and 52 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives,\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\nCalifornia students will vote on 3 statewide propositions dealing with \nclean water, racial discrimination, and the minimum wage.\n  In Kansas, a local public broadcasting station plans to air a live \ntown hall meeting. Candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and \nthe Senate will answer questions put to them by schoolchildren.\n  Those who are interested in participating in the Mock Election can \ncall the Mock Election's toll-free number (800-230-3349) and may visit \nthe Mock Election's new Internet Website at http://allpolitics.com.\n  Mr. President, it only makes sense that habits learned young set the \ncourse for adult behavior. Through the Student/Parent Mock Election, \nyoung people are hopefully beginning a commitment to responsible \ncitizen involvement that they will continue as adults. I commend those \nindividuals who have worked so hard to make the National Student/Parent \nMock Election a nationwide success.\n\n\n               1996 National Student/Parent Mock Election\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every Member of Congress understands the \nimportance of elections. We know that the votes cast on November 5 will \ndetermine the future leadership and direction of communities across the \ncountry, and of the Nation as a whole. We know that informed voters are \nthe essence of our democracy.\n  As citizens across the country focus on this year's elections and its \noutcomes, the National Student/Parent Mock Election is helping young \nstudents learn about the importance of the election process. The Mock \nElection offers parents and teachers across the country an opportunity \nto help students learn about democracy, make decisions about key \nissues, and understand the meaning of the civic responsibility on which \ndemocracy survives and thrives.\n  On October 30, 1996, millions of students and parents across the \ncountry will cast their votes for President, Vice President, Senators, \nRepresentatives, Governors, and local officials as part of the National \nStudent/Parent Mock Election. In 1992, over 5 million Mock Election \nparticipants cast votes in all 50 States and Washington, DC. Every \nState called in their votes on who would win the elections and \nrecommendations on key national issues to the National Mock Election \nHeadquarters, as over 20 million viewers watched on television.\n  The 1996 National Student/Parent Mock Election is sponsored by Time \nMagazine, CNN, Time Warner, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, Xerox Corp., \nAmerican Happenings, and Electronic Data Systems, and is also supported \nby an $80,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education.\n  The National Student/Parent Mock Election is an on-going project. In \nthe fiscal year 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act, passed by the Senate \non Monday, September 30, and signed by President Clinton, the project \nwill receive $125,000 from the U.S. Department of Education to continue \nto educate students on key issues and the principles of democracy \nthroughout the school year that begins in September, 1997.\n  This year, the Massachusetts Corporation for Educational \nTelecommunications [MCET] serves as the Massachusetts Mock Election \ncoordinator. MCET plans to make the Massachusetts Mock Election one of \nthe most important mock elections in the Nation. Through the use of new \ntechnologies, MCET will reach a wider audience than ever before and \nwill provide interactive programming so that students can actually \ndebate the issues that are important to them--not just read about them.\n  A live, interactive broadcast series of these programs will be \ndelivered to all Massachusetts schools via satellite well before the \nelection. The first program will engage students, parents, and teachers \nin discussions of election-related issues important to students--\neducation and employment. The second program will offer students the \nopportunity to talk to local politicians and others working in politics \nabout what it takes to be a leader. The third program will be the Mock \nElection Day coverage on October 30. Massachusetts students will cohost \nall three programs with Katy Abel of Boston's Channel 7 News.\n  The lessons that students and their parents learn as participants in \nthe Mock Elections will benefit American politics for years to come. If \nthe next generation of Americans is well prepared for the challenges of \ndemocracy, our liberties will be in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12288-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12289-S12290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE ACTION ON CONFIRMING FEDERAL JUDGES\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I'm glad that I have been able to work closely with my \nRepublican colleagues in a spirit of cooperation on a number of \nimportant issues that have come before the Senate this year.\n  I must say, however, I am disappointed this bipartisan spirit has not \nallowed us to confirm seven judicial nominations remaining on the \ncalendar--all well-qualified people who have had hearings and were \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think that we should stop, right now, and talk about what's going \non here.\n  No one understands better than I the heat that can be generated over \njudges in an election year. But let me set the Record straight--\nabsolutely straight: The Senate, under Democratic leadership, \nfaithfully confirmed Republican Judges in Presidential election years.\n  All year, Republicans have been offering assurances that the Senate \nwould continue this bipartisan approach and put judges through.\n  But today, it has become crystal clear that the bipartisan spirit of \nthe past has been broken. And let's tell it like it is: My Republican \ncolleagues have decided to grind confirmations to a halt as we head \ntoward the coming Presidential election.\n  Currently, there are 63 vacancies on the Federal bench.\n  This year, the Judiciary Committee has held only 5 nominations \nhearings, and reported out only 23 nominees to fill these vacancies. We \nshould have done more.\n  The Judicial Nominees who were fortunate enough to pass through the \ncommittee this session have been further held up here on the floor.\n  Not one judge was confirmed before July 10 this year and none have \nbeen confirmed since August 2.\n  As a result, the Senate has confirmed only 17 district judges and no \ncircuit judges this session. Seven nominees are currently pending on \nthe floor--three for the district courts and four for the circuit \ncourts.\n  Some have suggested that shutting down the confirmation process is \npar for the course in an election year. They are wrong. And let me set \nthe record straight.\n  George Bush made nearly one-third of his 253 judicial nominations in \n1992, a Presidential election year. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I held 15 nominations hearings that year, including 3 in \nJuly, 2 in August, and 1 in September.\n  In 1992--the last Presidential election year--the Senate continued to \nconfirm judges through the waning days of the 102d Congress. We even \nconfirmed seven judges on October 8--the last day of the second \nsession.\n  As a result, the Senate confirmed all 66 nominees the Judiciary \nCommittee reported out that year--55 for the District courts and 11 for \nthe circuit courts. Let me repeat: This session, only 17 district \njudges have been confirmed and no circuit judges have been confirmed.\n  And let me say: 1992 was not an off year. To the contrary: It \nrepresented the Senate's practices over the last decade:\n  In 1988--an election year--we conformed 42 district and circuit court \nnominees, including 12 judges confirmed in October that year.\n  In 1984--an election year--we confirmed 43 nominees, including 13 \njudges in October.\n  And in 1980--an election year--we confirmed 64 nominees, including 10 \njudges on September 29.\n  Overall, during the past 16 years, since 1980, the Senate has \nconfirmed an average of 51 nominees each year.\n  Overall, during the last 4 election years, the Senate has done even \nbetter, confirming an average of 54 nominees each year.\n  Let me repeat: our track record this session: The Senate has only \nconfirmed 17 judges.\n  The Senate has been dragging its feet despite the undeniable fact \nthat these judges are badly needed. The Federal\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\ntrial and appellate courts to which we confirm judges apply our Federal \nlaws. Without a steady supply of judges, these courts cannot enforce \nour laws.\n  Right now, 12 of the Nation's 94 Federal judicial districts and 5 of \nthe 12 circuit courts have judicial emergency vacancies--that's what \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States calls vacancies that have \nexisted for 18 months or more.\n  These emergency districts had an average of 635 criminal case filings \nin 1995--almost twice the national average of 355 filings. There \naverage backlog of 4,153 cases exceeds the national average of 2,853 \ncases by 46 percent--1,300 cases.\n  The President has nominated judges for 15 of the 17 emergency courts. \nThree have received hearings and await a committee vote, three more are \nbottled up on the floor.\n  This is not the way we should be doing business here--and this is \nmost certainly not business as usual as far as I'm concerned.\n  We should put a stop to the politics, and confirm these judges today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MINING PATENT MORATORIUM\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee concerning a report on mining patents that was recently \ncompleted by the Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would gladly engage in such a \ncolloquy with my distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Forests \nand Public Land Management Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. The senior Senator from Idaho has worked on mining \nlaw reform legislation for several Congresses and is a recognized \nexpert in the area of mining and natural resources. I am pleased to \ndiscuss the mining issue with him.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chairman for his kind words. In July, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee received a copy of a report from \nthe Interior Department, entitled ``Five Year Plan for Making Final \nDetermination on Ninety Percent of Grandfathered Patent Applications \nPursuant to Public Law 104-134.'' My subcommittee has not yet fully \nanalyzed the report that addresses the mineral patent moratorium which \nwas enacted originally on September 30, 1994, for fiscal year 1995, and \nextended through fiscal year 1996 on April 25, 1996. I believe the \nAppropriations Committee received the report as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee received \nthe report. I am concerned that the report appears to provide a \npartisan justification for Secretary Babbitt's various actions and \ninactions regarding the mineral patenting process since 1993.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I share your concern, and I note that the report provides \na plan to process 90 percent of the mineral patent backlog in five \nyears, which may or may not be effective. The Conference Report on H.R. \n3610, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, extended the patent \nmoratorium for fiscal year 1997. In your view has the Congress endorsed \nSecretary Babbitt's actions and his plan?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Certainly not in my view. We will review the adequacy \nof the Secretary's plan at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree, and I note further that the Congress is clearly \nnot in a position to ratify or reject the Department's determinations \nregarding individual patent applications which are pending and are \nidentified in the Secretary's report as ``grandfathered,'' or impliedly \nidentified as not ``grandfathered'' by their absence on the list.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I completely agree. The legality of the Secretary's \nactions, inactions and determinations affecting individual patent \napplicants will be reviewed, as needed, by the federal courts in \naccordance with due process law.\n  Mr. CRAIG. One final concern which I have is that the Interior \nDepartment may be construing the ``five-year'' schedule to clear the \npatent backlog as somehow shielding the Department from claims of \nunreasonable delay by individual patent applicants in the interim. Such \na construction would be clearly contrary to our intent, which was to \nkeep the patent application processing moving forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I share your concern. Such a construction would thwart \nour purpose entirely.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the distinguished Chairman for this colloquy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12290-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12290-S12291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BURMA SANCTIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the weekend, more than 500 Burmese \ncitizens were arrested--more than double the number picked up in an \noutrageous sweep back in May.\n  And, their crime, Mr. President? Their crime was an effort to \nparticipate in a conference on the future of democracy called by Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi, Burma's legitimately elected leader.\n  Just as discouraging as the arrests is the action taken against Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi. The street to her home has been cut off by armed \nguards, and I understand over 100 troops have been deployed in and \naround her compound.\n  Her weekly addresses to supporters have been cut off.\n  Her movements are completely restricted.\n  In fact, when I asked if anyone from our embassy had direct contact \nwith her, I was told the phone lines have been cut along with access to \nher home.\n  So, at this moment, as I speak, there is no certainty as to her \nphysical well-being--we have no idea what condition Daw Aung San Suu \nKyi is in--we have no idea what SLORC goons may be doing within her \nhome, now, a prison.\n  But, I want to remind my colleagues of something terribly important \nthat this courageous woman has repeatedly emphasized--she is not the \nissue--she is only a symbol, a champion for her nation's freedom.\n  Her cause, her call to us is to restore democracy to her beleaguered \nhomeland, Burma.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, once again, to call \nupon the administration to take decisive action to assist Aung San Suu \nKyi and her supporters.\n  This time, the circumstances are different.\n  On Monday, when the President signed the omnibus appropriations bill, \nthe foreign operations section included provisions setting a new policy \ncourse for Burma.\n  Although many of my colleagues agreed with language I had included in \nthe bill which imposed immediate sanctions, the Senate and the foreign \noperations conferees agreed to a weaker position offered by my \ncolleague from Maine and endorsed by the adminstration.\n  This language, which the administration supported, required a ban on \nnew investment under specific conditions.\n  The administration agreed to move forward ``if the Burmese government \nhas physically harmed, rearrested for political acts or exiled Aung San \nSuu Kyi or has committed large-scale repression of or violence against \nthe Democratic opposition.''\n  That's exactly what the law requires.\n  Ironically, in the case of defining repression, every official I \nspoke with suggested sanction would be invoked if SLORC took action \nsimilar to the May offensive--I might add, no one actually believed \nSLORC would be so ruthless to repeat so sweeping and offensive an \nattack on peaceful democratic activists.\n  Mr. President, in the past this administration has issued ultimatums \nto SLORC.\n  In 1994, Tom Hubbard, then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for \nAsian Affairs traveled to Rangoon and warned SLORC that if we did not \nsee improvements in human rights, democracy, and drug trafficking, the \nUnited States would take appropriate punitive action.\n  SLORC immediately challenged the demarche and launched a massive \nmilitary attack against ethnic groups generating more than 80,000 \nrefugees. Attacks in the countryside were matched by rounding up \ndemocracy advocates in Rangoon.\n  America's response? The administration looked the other way.\n  The next year, Ambassador Albright traveled to Rangoon and repeated \nthe message and saw virtually the same results--massive detentions, \ntorture, and arrests--a complete rejection of our concerns and \ninterests.\n  Now, we are faced with the worst deterioration of the internal \nsituation since the stolen elections in 1990.\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\n  SLORC has accused Aung San Suu Kyi of collaborating with outside \ngroups and foreign embassies against the interests of Burma. Senior \nofficials have denounced the legislation just signed into law--there is \nno question the recent events reflect SLORC's decision to directly \nchallenge America's commitment to democracy and its champions so \nobviously under siege.\n  This time, SLORC is challenging more than an ultimatum issued in a \nmeeting of State Department officials--this time the junta is \nchallenging American law.\n  There are few countries I can identify these days with regimes so \nrepugnant, unjust, and ruthless as SLORC.\n  They represent a direct and dangerous threat not only to their own \ncitizens but ours as well.\n  A few weeks ago, I was sent photographs of senior SLORC military \nintelligence officers enjoying a meal with Khun Sa, the region's most \nnotorious opium warlord.\n  These pictures would convince even the most singleminded SLORC \nbusiness crony that doing business with SLORC is subsidizing and doing \nbusiness with drug traffickers--and even oil companies with so much on \nthe line in Burma, have to recognize that those kind of relationships \nare not in America's interests.\n  Mr. President, I understand the NSC will convene a deputies meeting \ntoday at 3 to review options for Burma.\n  No doubt one of the options will be a ban on visas. Let me make clear \nto anyone in the administration listening--such a step is not enough.\n  When we were in conference on the foreign operations bill, the \nadministration pledged to issue a Presidential order banning visas to \nSLORC officials if we would agree to modify our language making such an \naction mandatory. We did and we expect the administration to live up to \nthis commitment which was made long before the actions taken this \nweekend.\n  Nothing short of fulfilling the additional obligations spelled out in \nlaw will meet the test our Nation and our credibility face today in \nBurma.\n  Democracy is under siege--meaningful support and time are running \nout--lives are on the line. I urge the President to take swift action \nto save a nation, its people, and American honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12290-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12291-S12292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on September 19, 1996, the Joint \nCongressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies organized to prepare \nfor the next congressionally hosted inauguration.\n  It is appropriate now, as we prepare to adjourn less than four months \naway from Inauguration Day 1997, to reflect on the historic \narrangements Congress has made to ensure that this confirmation of the \nvoters' will is carried out publicly as our electoral cycle is \ncompleted.\n   Mr. President, once again Congress prepares for an inauguration of a \nPresident of the United States. This was the initial responsibility \nthat faced the First Congress. When the Senate established its first \nquorum on April 6, 1789, Congress was the only functioning branch of \nthe Federal Government; the executive and judicial branches did not yet \nexist. On April 6, Members of the Senate and House of Representatives \nmet in the Senate Chamber to count the electoral ballots and declare \nGeorge Washington elected president. They dispatched messengers to \nnotify General Washington at Mount Vernon. On April 9, the Senate \nappointed a committee ``to make the necessary arrangements for \nreceiving the President'' and to meet with any committee that the House \nappointed for such purposes. Those committees, which reported their \nplan for the inauguration on April 25, were the precursor of today's \nJoint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.\n  Every four years since Congress has held presidential inaugural \nceremonies. On April 30, 1789, President Washington took his oath on a \nbalcony at Federal Hall, where Congress was then meeting in New York \nCity. By 1793 Congress had moved to Congress Hall in Philadelphia, and \nWashington took his oath this time in the Senate Chamber. Four years \nlater, John Adams's inaugural occurred in the larger House Chamber. In \n1800 the Federal Government transferred to its permanent home in \nWashington, DC, and on March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson became the first \npresident inaugurated in the U.S. Capitol Building. That ceremony took \nplace in the Senate Chamber (now restored as the Old Supreme Court \nChamber). James Madison was sworn into office in the new House Chamber \nin 1809 and again in 1813. After British troops burned the Capitol in \n1814, James Monroe's inauguration in 1817 was held across the street, \nin front of the temporary Capitol building, on the present site of the \nSupreme Court. These were the first inaugural ceremonies performed \noutdoors. Poor weather forced the inauguration back indoors in 1821, \nbut since Andrew Jackson's inauguration in 1829, the ceremonies \ngenerally have been conducted outdoors to accommodate growing numbers \nof citizens wishing to attend.\n\n  From 1825 until 1977 presidential inaugurations took place on the \nEast Front of the Capitol, where large platforms were erected on the \nsteps leading to the Rotunda. At first these ceremonies were held on \nMarch 4th. The adoption of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution \nin 1933 advanced the date to January 20th. Franklin D. Roosevelt became \nthe first to take his oath under this amendment, on January 20, 1937. \nRoosevelt's first three inaugurals took place at the Capitol, but in \n1945, while the National was still engaged in the Second World War, \nRoosevelt overruled congressional objections and took the oath of \noffice at the White House. The Inaugural Ceremony resumed at the \nCapitol with Harry Truman's ceremony in 1949.\n  Ronald Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981, saw the ceremonies \nshift to the Capitol's West Front, where the terraces served as the \ninaugural platform and where even larger crowds could be accommodated \ndown the Mall. Frigid weather in 1985 forced President Reagan's second \ninauguration indoors into the Capitol Rotunda.\n  Between Inaugurations, nine individuals have taken the presidential \noath of office elsewhere. Following the death or resignation of \npresidents, vice presidents were sworn into office at the White House, \nin a Washington hotel, a New York City brownstone, a Vermont farmhouse, \nand aboard Air Force One.\n  Gerald R. Ford assumed the Vice Presidency under the 25th amendment \nto the Constitution on the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew \nand Ford was sworn in as President August 9, 1974 on the resignation of \nRichard M. Nixon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a press release which documents the \nmembers of the Committee and their official actions in the first \nCommittee organizational meeting and the text of Senate Concurrent \nResolutions 47 and 48, authorizing the Committee and inaugural \narrangements, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Joint Leadership Elects Warner to Inaugural Post\n\n       Senator John Warner has been elected chairman of the Joint \n     Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the \n     committee created by Congress every four years to oversee the \n     inauguration for the President of the United States.\n       In addition to Warner's selection, the committee decided to \n     hold the 53rd inauguration on the West Front of the Capitol. \n     The inaugural will take place January 20, 1997.\n       In keeping with tradition, Warner's nomination was put \n     forward by Senate Democratic Whip Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and \n     seconded by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. In \n     addition to Lott and Ford, other members are: Speaker of the \n     House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., House Majority Leader Richard \n     Armey, R-Tex. and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-\n     Mo.\n       Senator Warner is the first Virginian to chair the Joint \n     Inaugural Committee since 1945, when Senator Harry Byrd, Sr., \n     D-Va., chaired the panel.\n       Historically, the Joint Inaugural Committee is formed the \n     year prior to the Congressionally-hosted ceremonies, and \n     ceases operation after the ceremonies conclude. The \n     committee, which was authorized March 20, is charged with the \n     planning and execution of all inaugural activities at the \n     U.S. Capitol, including the swearing-in ceremony and the \n     traditional inauguration luncheon that follows.\n       During the meeting, Warner announced that former Assistant \n     Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere Jennifer Joy \n     Wilson, will be executive director of the committee. Wilson \n     also served as chief of staff to former Virginia Republican \n     Gov. John Dalton.\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, in accordance with the Refugee Act of \n1980, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter to the President dated September 30, 1996, and signed by Senator \nKennedy as ranking member and by me as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nImmigration of the Judiciary Committee, and a copy of Presidential \nDetermination 96-59, concerning refugee admissions for fiscal year \n1997.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Under the provisions of the Refugee Act \n     of 1980, members of the Committee on the Judiciary have now \n     consulted with your representatives on the proposed admission \n     of refugees for Fiscal Year 1997.\n       We note that refugee numbers continued a gradual downward \n     trend. We would comment that the 78,000 figure, while \n     technically correct as to refugee admissions, does not \n     reflect the Cuban entrants, who for all intents and purposes \n     are treated as refugees. We believe that it would be helpful \n     in future years if the reports of State, HHS, and INS \n     included information on the admission of Cuban--and other--\n     entrants, as well as refugees. We believe that would provide \n     both a clearer and more realistic picture of the overall \n     admissions process.\n       We are hopeful, as well, that next year's report will \n     include a discussion of refugee welfare dependence in its \n     ``analysis of the anticipated social, economic, and \n     demographic impact'' of proposed refugee admissions, and the \n     steps that are undertaken to move refugees to self-\n     sufficiency.\n       We want to congratulate the Administration on its role in \n     the successful completion of the Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action, and on the significant accomplishment in bringing \n     this historic program to an end. We believe that, after 20 \n     years and 1.2 million persons resettled, the close of the \n     Southeast Asian and the Amerasian programs is appropriate, \n     and expect that the ``ROVR'' initiative, by which a number of \n     the remaining Vietnamese may be considered for U.S. \n     resettlement, will fit within the 10,000 numbers allocated to \n     Southeast Asia.\n       We can foresee fast-moving refugee situations developing in \n     Bosnia and Iraq. We trust that the Administration will \n     maintain close contact with the Congress regarding its plans \n     in these areas. When significant numbers of former residents \n     return to Bosnia, for example, serious instability could \n     quickly ensue. Similarly, the situation in Iraq could change \n     dramatically at any moment. Such changes might necessitate \n     the use of Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) \n     or other emergency measures.\n       We commend the Administration for acting rapidly to move \n     2,100 Iraqis who have worked closely with this country and \n     the United Nations in northern Iraq out of harm's way. We \n     urge that the Administration consider the safety of those \n     Kurdish employees of American non-governmental organizations \n     working in Iraq.\n       We share your commitment to strengthening U.S. refugee \n     admissions and assistance programs consistent with the \n     guiding principles set forth in the Refugee Act of 1980. We \n     continue to believe that the United States should do its \n     share in providing resettlement opportunities to true \n     refugees who cannot safely return home nor stay in the region \n     of first asylum. We strongly support the need to contribute \n     our fair share to life-saving assistance programs. Such \n     programs provide assistance to so many more refugees that the \n     resettlement of the much smaller numbers who have no other \n     option and are of special humanitarian concern to the United \n     States.\n       We support your proposal for sufficient funds to provide \n     cash and medical assistance to eligible refugees during their \n     first eight months after arrival here.\n       We concur with your proposal to admit 78,000 refugees in \n     FY97.\n           Most sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Immigration.\n     Alan K.

Mr. President, earlier this week we passed the \nomnibus appropriations bill. Included in\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\nthat bill are provisions that clarify lender liability issues under \nSuperfund. These are important provisions that make it clear that \nlenders that do not participate in management are not liable under \nSuperfund or the underground storage tank provisions of RCRA.\n  It is also important, however, that we clarify a critical aspect of \nthese provisons. First, you and I are aware of the colloquy in the \nCongressional Record of September 30, 1996, between Senators Smith and \nD'Amato regarding the Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit \nInsurance Protection Act of 1996. The colloquy seems to suggest that \nunder the bill, EPA has no authority whatsoever to promulgate \nregulations on CERCLA liability. That was not my understanding of the \nintent of the lender and fiduciary provisions.\n  My understanding is that our intention was to substantially endorse \nEPA's addressing of lender liability under Superfund in its 1992 lender \nliability rule, and to validate EPA's prior exercise of rulemaking \nauthority for lenders and fiduciaries. Addressing lender liability \nspecifically in this bill was necessary because, in 1980, Congress did \nnot foresee how its original language, protecting security interest \nholders from liability, would be interpreted. Congress also could not \nhave foreseen the restrictive view in Kelley v. EPA, 15 F.3d 1100 (D.C. \nCir. 1994), of EPA's authority to issue rules interpreting Superfund \nauthority. The omnibus appropriations bill specifically addresses and \nmodifies the earlier interpretations of the original language. Should \nnew circumstances again arise concerning interpretations of lender and \nfiduciary liability, we believe and it is our intent that EPA has the \nauthority to clarify and refine the liability rules applying to lenders \nand fiduciaries.\n  Mr. Baucus, is it correct that nothing in the lender liability \nprovisions in the omnibus appropriations bill, precludes EPA from \nissuing rules to clarify and refine the rules applying to lenders and \nfiduciaries?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, what you have expressed is my understanding of the \nintent of Congress in enacting this legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That earlier colloquy also talked about a recent \nopinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, \nKelley v. EPA, 15 F.3d 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1994), reh'g denied, 25 F.3d \n1088 (D.C. Cir. 1996). I think it is important that we avoid any \nmisunderstanding, based on that case, concerning EPA's authority to \nissue rules. The Kelley decision struck down EPA's original lender \nliability rule, but this legislation recognizes EPA's authority to \npromulgate rules in this area. This is consistent with our general \nintent that EPA should use its expertise to issue authoritative \ninterpretations of CERCLA, whether by guidance or regulation. For \nexample, EPA has issued guidances pertaining to the liability of \nresidential homeowners, de minimis and de micromis parties, and others. \nSuch clarifications and expressions of prosecutorial discretion have \nserved to reduce litigation and given the regulated community and \nothers clarity over questions of liability.\n  Mr. Baucus, is it correct that the lender liability provisions in the \nomnibus appropriations bill are intended to reaffirm EPA's ability to \nissue such interpretative guidance?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is my understanding of the intent of the lender \nand fiduciary liability provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12292-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12293-S12294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ON THE POLITICIZATION OF THE FBI BY FBI GENERAL COUNSEL HOWARD SHAPIRO\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on September 25, the Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing about the White House and FBI files matter. I attended \nthat hearing for the testimony of Mr. Craig Livingstone. However, I was \nnecessarily absent for the testimony of FBI General Counsel Howard \nShapiro.\n  I was unable to make my comments a part of that record. However, I am \ncompelled to make them a part of the Record of this body. This is an \nextremely important issue, in my view. And it begs the attention of all \nof my colleagues.\n  Allegations have been made against Mr. Shapiro that he has been too \ncozy with the Clinton White House. I'd like to remind my colleagues \nthat when law enforcement plays footsie with the White House, law \nenforcement decisions become political. And that can lead to a gross \nabuse of the powers of law enforcement. Civil liberties can be trampled \non, and the pursuit of justice can be frustrated.\n  After the White House travel office firings, the FBI was accused of \nallowing itself to be politicized. Bureau Director Louis Freeh said he \nwould put an end to even the appearance of a cozy relationship. He \nsaid, ``I told the President that the FBI must maintain its \nindependence and have no role in politics.'' Mr. Freeh understands the \nnecessity of keeping a wall between politics and law enforcement.\n  But, Mr. President, many of us in the Congress are not convinced that \nMr. Freeh has reconstructed that wall. Questions arise because of \nspecific actions taken in the Filegate matter by his general counsel. \nMr. Shapiro is Director Freeh's hand-picked counsel. In the wake of the \nallegations, Mr. Freeh has expressed confidence in Mr. Shapiro, much as \nhe did with agent Larry Potts. Mr. Potts was involved in the disaster \nat Ruby Ridge.\n  The sum of Mr. Shapiro's actions greatly benefited the subjects of \ncongressional and independent counsel investigations; that is, present \nand former White House employees. At the same time, Mr. Shapiro's \nactions may have done much harm to the investigations.\n  Four specific actions suggest that Mr. Shapiro played ball with the \nWhite House:\n  Issue 1. On July 16, Shapiro gave a heads-up to the White House about \nwhat was found in Craig Livingstone's FBI background file by the staff \nof the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. The chairman \nhad been invited to review the Livingstone file by Director Freeh. But \nbefore the chairman arrived, Mr. Shapiro notified the White House of a \npolitically explosive item contained in the file.\n  In the file, it was discovered that an FBI agent had interviewed \nformer White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. The agent's notes say that \nNussbaum reported the First Lady was instrumental in hiring Mr. \nLivingstone.\n  Mr. Livingstone is one of two central players in the Filegate affair. \nOne of the important, unanswered questions is, who hired him and why. \nClearly, the information had relevance to the investigation.\n  But the effect of Mr. Shapiro's heads-up was to alert the White House \ndamage control operation. That way, everyone could get their stories \nstraight before being interviewed. Sixteen people under investigation, \nand/or their attorneys, and/or members of the damage control team knew \nabout the item before the Chairman of the Committee could read the \nfile. This includes a witness about to go before a federal grand jury.\n  Mr. Shapiro claims his purpose for the heads-up was to make sure both \nsides were equally apprised. It was his effort to appear neutral. \nHowever, Mr. Shapiro managed to achieve the opposite of his stated \nintention. He gave everyone being investigated a heads-up. That's a \nfact. The investigators were the last to know. That's also a fact. If \nMr. Shapiro were really being neutral, he would have refrained from \ndoing anything. Instead, he gratuitously appointed himself referee and \ninserted himself in the middle of three investigations. Now, as a \nresult, his actions and judgment must be called into question.\n  Just one month prior to this--on June 14--this very same Howard \nShapiro personally authored the FBI's own review of the files matter. \nThat review vowed that the FBI never would be ``victimized'' again by \nthe White House. In my judgment, that hollow promise was broken barely \na month later.\n  Issue 2. Mr. Shapiro also gave the White House an advance copy of the \nGary Aldrich book. That's the controversial and revealing book written \nby the FBI agent who formerly investigated the backgrounds of White \nHouse employees. Mr. Shapiro gave the advance copy to the White House \ndamage control outfit. That way, the White House could prepare ahead of \ntime its vitriolic attack-responses against Mr. Aldrich once the book \nwas published.\n  Mr. Shapiro's stated reason for this heads-up was he was concerned \nthe\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\nbook might reveal sensitive White House security information. Yet, in a \nletter dated September 18 from White House counsel Jack Quinn to \nChairman William Clinger regarding the matter, Mr. Quinn mentions no \nsuch issue. Rather, Quinn says the issue was ``the integrity of the \nBureau's background investigation process.'' It wasn't sensitive White \nHouse security matters at all.\n\n  In addition, when asked for the first time about giving the Aldrich \nbook to the White House, Shapiro described the exchange as a much more \ncasual event. On July 30, he was deposed by the House committee. On \npage 82 of his deposition, Shapiro says, ``Well, I called and advised \nJack Quinn that there was a book in draft that had been given to us to \nreview that * * * based on our prior experience we could not ensure \nwould not be published before we completed our review of it. And I \nbelieve, if my recollection is correct, that I asked him if he wanted \nto have a copy of it.'' Mr. Shapiro goes on to say he didn't discuss \nthe contents of the book with Mr. Quinn.\n  This is how I see it, Mr. President. First, Mr. Shapiro provided the \nbook to the White House as a courtesy. Then he discovered his action \ncame under scrutiny. It was highly controversial. Once again, he was \naccused of playing footsie with his contracts at the White House. So he \nrationalized what he had done by inventing the story of sensitive White \nHouse security information being at the heart of his concern.\n  Frankly, I don't buy it. It isn't backed up by Mr. Quinn, and it \nisn't backed up by Mr. Shapiro's own testimony when he was first asked \nabout it. Furthermore, isn't it fair to assume that, if Mr. Shapiro is \nsincere about his motives, he would have sent a copy of the Aldrich \nbook to the Secret Service since it is responsible for sensitive White \nHouse security matters?\n  Issue 3. On July 16, Mr. Shapiro authorized two FBI agents to pay a \nvisit to Agent Dennis Sculimbrene upon Shapiro's discovery of the \ncontroversial information found in Mr. Livingstone's FBI background \nfile. Mr. Sculimbrene was the agent who had prepared the Livingstone \nfile. White House officials were questioning the accuracy of the file. \nAs a consequence, Mr. Shapiro took it upon himself to once again \nreferee the situation. He sent the two agents to Sculimbrene to clarify \nthe discrepancies. Later that day, Sculimbrene's work station was also \nsearched by FBI agents.\n  The problem with this action by Shapiro is that it could be seen as \nintimidation of an agent at the behest of White House officials. \nMoreover, in the process of sending these agents, Shapiro created at \nleast the appearance of a conflict of interest for himself. As General \nCounsel, he inserted himself into an operational matter. On that part \nof the operation, he could no longer be an independent, impartial legal \nadvisor to the Director. Instead of defending the FBI, he has to defend \nhis own actions. This conflict now allows the public to question his \nmotives and the plausibility of his explanations.\n  Finally, Mr. Shapiro took this action without consulting the \nindependent counsel, and despite the Attorney General's June 20 \nannouncement that continued involvement in this matter by the FBI would \nconstitute a conflict of interest.\n  Issue 4. A July 25 letter from Mr. Quinn to the FBI Director was \nfirst read to Mr. Shapiro over the phone to get his opinion as to the \ntone and some editorial content of the letter. That letter was highly \npolitical, attacking the credibility of some FBI agents, and also \nattacking the chairman of a standing committee of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in the performance of his oversight responsibilities. \nThat hardly shows an arm's-length relationship between the White House \nand the FBI in the midst of this political confrontation.\n  Mr. Shapiro has responded to each of these issues. It's on the \nrecord, for everyone to see.\n  I have reviewed that record. In my view, Mr. Shapiro's explanations \nring empty. The inescapable conclusion is, he's been playing footsie \nwith the White House. At the very least, there's a clear-cut appearance \nproblem. Neither is good for the FBI's image or for the public's \nconfidence in the Bureau.\n  I look at the results, not the explanations. The results are, what he \ndid helped those being investigated. What he did interferred with the \ninvestigations. That's my interpretation. And that's a fair \ninterpretation because he inserted himself into these matters. He \nappointed himself a referee in the arena of politics. And frankly, that \ngives the FBI a black eye, and it further erodes the confidence the \npublic has in the Bureau.\n  As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and chairman of its \noversight subcommittee, this Senator can no longer have confidence in \nMr. Shapiro's impartiality. I do not have confidence that he will \ndiscontinue this cozy relationship with the White House.\n  I note the many credible voices in both bodies of Congress calling \nfor Mr. Shapiro's resignation. This Senator has reserved judgment on \nthat question. It is my intention to thoroughly review the complete \nhearing record, together with Mr. Shapiro's responses to my and others' \nfollow-up questions. Upon completion of that review, I will come to my \nown conclusion as to whether or not Mr. Shapiro can continue to fulfill \nhis responsibilities in a credible and impartial manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12293-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12294-S12295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DETENTION AND 212(c) WAIVERS FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS PROVISIONS OF H.R. \n                                  2202\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to clarify a few changes made in the criminal alien \nprovisions of the Senate immigration bill when the House and Senate \nconferees adopted the conference report on H.R. 2202, the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. These \nprovisions are included in this omnibus appropriations measure. I know \nSenator Hatch was deeply involved in the development of the section on \ncriminal aliens, as a conferee on this legislation.\n  First, I would like to ask about a change made to the exception to \nmandatory detention for criminal aliens. Section 303(a) of the \nconference report would add to the Immigration and Nationality Act a \nnew section providing for mandatory detention of criminal aliens by the \nAttorney General prior to deportation or exclusion, which was already \nrequired under the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act \nsigned into law earlier this year. That section in the conference \nreport also includes a provision permitting release in extremely narrow \ncircumstances--specifically, only for criminal aliens who qualify for \nthe Witness Protection Program under section 3521 of title 18, United \nStates Code, in the discretion of the Attorney General. I would like to \nask the Senator if this section, new section 236(c)(2), requires that \nthe criminal alien actually be admitted to the Witness Protection \nProgram, under section 3521 of title 18, before being eligible for \nrelease?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. The criminal aliens may be released from custody only \nif the Attorney General has accepted the alien into the Witness \nProtection Program. That is reflected in the statutory language \nspecifically providing that the release provision applies ``only if'' \nthe Attorney General makes a determination pursuant to section 3521 of \ntitle 18, United States Code to accept an alien into the Witness \nProtection Program.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Then, the release criteria regarding the criminal \nalien's safety to the community, the severity of the offense, and the \ncriminal alien's likelihood of appearing for deportation proceedings \nare to be applied after the alien has been accepted to the witness \nprotection program?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Those criteria are intended to limit the \ncircumstances in which criminal aliens who have been admitted to the \nWitness Protection Program may be released. The statutory language in \nnew section 236(c)(2) clearly provides that those are additional limits \non the Attorney General's release authority. The fact that a criminal \nalien has been admitted to the program is not alone sufficient to \njustify releasing that alien. In order to release the alien, the \nAttorney General must also be satisfied that the alien will not pose a \ndanger to the safety of other persons or of property, is likely to \nappear for any scheduled proceedings, and the Attorney General is \nrequired to give due consideration to the severity of the offense \ncommitted by the alien.\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senate Immigration bill included a somewhat \ndifferent set of criteria for the release of criminal aliens prior to \ndeportation, permitting release only for aliens who are cooperating \nwith law enforcement authorities or for purposes of national security, \nin the Attorney General's sole and unreviewable discretion. Could you \nexplain the purpose of this change?\n  Mr. HATCH. The conference report provision is intended to limit \nthe conditions for release permitted in the Senate bill to those \nnecessary to serve the purposes the Senate was trying to accomplish. \nThe Senate provisions may have permitted releases under more \ncircumstances than were truly necessary. To begin with, the conference \nreport does not permit the release of criminal aliens for purposes of \ncooperating with law enforcement unless the alien has been accepted \ninto the Witness Protection Program pursuant to section 3521 of title \n18. Nor does the conference report permit the release of criminal \naliens for purposes of national security, because it was difficult to \nimagine a circumstance in which the release of a convicted criminal \nwould serve our national security interests--unless the criminal had \nbeen accepted into the Witness Protection Program.\n\n  Thus, I can assure the Senator from Michigan that the central purpose \nof the Senate amendments regarding mandatory detention--preventing the \nrelease of criminal aliens to further prey on American citizens--is \nfurthered by the conference provision to an even greater degree than \nthe Senate provision.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Finally, I have one more question for the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, regarding the changes made to eligibility of \ncriminal aliens for waivers of deportation or exclusion under old \nsection 212(c) of title 8, United States Code. The Anti-terrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act signed into law earlier this year, as well \nas the Senate Immigration bill, eliminated the possibility of 212(c) \nwaivers for any criminal aliens who had committed any of several crimes \nthat make aliens deportable under section 241 of title 8, United States \nCode. The conference report restores 212(c)-type waivers for criminal \naliens who have not been convicted of aggravated felonies. Could you \nexplain the purpose of this change?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say first of all that I share the Senator's concern \nwith the procedural abuses under this country's immigration laws that \nhave long been available to criminal aliens. The limitations on 212(c)-\ntype eligibility for criminal aliens in the conference report, which \nappear in new section 240A(a), is intended to put an end to that. The \nreason the total bar on 212(c) review for criminal aliens in the \nTerrorism Act was revised to bar only aggravated felons was that, \nfirst, the definition of ``aggravated felony'' has been expanded to \nencompass most of the deportable crimes under old section 241, for \nwhich 212(c) review was barred in the Terrorism Act. Second, there was \nsome concern that there might be certain rare circumstances we had not \ncontemplated, when removal of a particular criminal alien might not be \nappropriate. For example, an alien with one minor criminal conviction \nseveral decades ago, who has clearly reformed and led an exemplary life \nand made great contributions to this country, we believed ought to \nretain eligibility for a waiver of deportation or exclusion.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. So, 212(c) relief--or new section 240A(a) relief--is \nintended only for highly unusual cases involving outstanding aliens \nsuch as the one you describe?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. The extraordinary circumstances necessary \nfor a grant of 212(c) relief should refer to the insignificance of the \ncrime, and to substantial contributions to society made by the alien. \nTo qualify for section 212(c) or analogous relief, despite the \nexistence of a criminal conviction, an alien will have to show \nsubstantial benefits this county from granting the relief--not the \npotential hardship to the alien from not granting relief. I understand \nyour concern that relief under this section will not be so limited, \nsince it has not been so limited in practice in the past. We believed, \nhowever, that passage of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct sufficiently demonstrated the Congress' serious concern about the \nabuse of section 212(c), that we could expect Immigration Judges to \nbegin using their discretion under section 212(c) more judiciously. As \nyou know, the Terrorism Act eliminated 212(c) relief for virtually any \nalien who had been convicted of any crime, including some misdemeanors. \nSeveral members believed that only by eliminating Immigration Judges' \ndiscretion to grant section 212(c) relief to criminal aliens altogether \ncould we prevent section 212(c) from being used to grant relief too \nfreely. The prevailing view was that the Terrorism Act sent a clear \nmessage that section 212(c) was being abused, and that Immigration \nJudges could be expected to respond to that message and take a hard \nlook at 212(c) relief. The partial restoration of section 212(c) relief \nfor aliens who have not committed aggravated felonies will test that \ntheory.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That, of course, has been my concern. Section 212(c) \nrelief was always intended to apply only to ``those cases where \nextenuating circumstances clearly require such action''--as Congress \nput it when it enacted section 212(c) as part of the Immigration and \nNationality Act in 1952. For the past 8 years, however, 212(c) relief \nhas been granted to more than half of all who apply, the vast majority \nof whom are criminal aliens, amounting to thousands of criminal aliens \nper year.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. Now that we have restored \nsection 212(c) waivers for a small percentage of criminal aliens we \nexpect Immigration Judges to use their discretion under this new \nsection only in unusual cases involving exceptional immigrants whose \ncriminal records consist only of minor crimes committed many years \nago.We expect that to be the case under these new provisions.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the limited restoration of section 212(c) relief does \nnot include reasonable limitations on its use, I will be prepared to \nwork with my colleagues to address that problem. Is my understanding \ncorrect that you too will pay close attention to how this provision is \ninterpreted?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I would also like to let the Senator from Michigan \nknow how much I appreciate his commitment and dedication on this issue.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you. I would likewise thank the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for his diligent efforts on this issue in \nconference and his explanation of the conference report's provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12294-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12295-S12296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRANSFER OF PERSONS FOUND NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to make several brief comments \nregarding a provision included in the Economic Espionage Act passed \nyesterday. That legislation included an amendment I offered when this \nbill first passed the Senate to permit the transfer of Federal \ndefendants found not guilty by reason of insanity from the inadequate \nfacility of St. Elizabeths Hospital to the custody of the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Each of the approximately 26 inmates affected by this legislation \nwere confined prior to the enactment of the Insanity Defense Reform Act \nof 1984. Since 1984, Federal inmates found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity have been turned over to the custody of the Attorney General \nfor appropriate treatment. This corrective legislation would extend \nthis treatment to the pre-IDRA confinees.\n  St. Elizabeths Hospital is in a state of disrepair. According to \npress reports, the 70-year-old heating system is unreliable and can \nleave patients shivering in the cold during the winter months. The \nhospital staff is completely overwhelmed, and shortages of important \nantidepressant medicines have been reported by doctors.\n  These conditions should concern us all, and we should seek workable \nlong-term solutions. But, we should deal promptly with current \nproblems. What is particularly troubling is the lack of security at the \nfacility, which is putting the public at risk. There are 26 Federal \ndefendants in the hospital that may be a danger to themselves and \nothers. Among these inmates is John Hinckley, Jr., who attempted to \nassassinate President Reagan in 1981.\n  According to the Department of Justice, there have already been three \nknown escapes by these inmates in the\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\nlast 2 years. Fortunately, all of these inmates were recaptured, but \nnot before one of them traveled to North Carolina and allegedly \nsexually molested two 3-year-old girls before he was found and returned \nto custody. Sadly, the hospital did not notify the Marshals Service, \nwhich is responsible for the security of these inmates, of a single \nescape.\n  St. Elizabeths Hospital apparently does not have the capability to \nprovide adequately for the security or well-being of these 26 Federal \ndefendants, even though the Federal Government pays $450 per inmate per \nday, which works out to $164,250 per inmate annually. It is time that \nthe Federal Government take responsibility of these individuals for \ntheir own safety and the safety of the general public.\n\n  This bill transfers these 26 Federal defendants to the custody of the \nAttorney General. This will allow the defendants to be placed in \nappropriate Federal Bureau of Prisons medical facilities, for a \nfraction of the current cost, and to receive care appropriate to their \nconditions. The Justice Department has estimated that by transferring \neven half of the 26 patients to Federal medical facilities that the \nUnited States would save at least $1.5 million annually.\n  The bill also requires that St. Elizabeth's Hospital provide to the \nDepartment of Justice the medical and treatment records for these \ninmates and bars the hospital from preventing doctors from discussing \nthe inmates' treatment with Department of Justice officials. The \nhospital has been withholding the records, making it impossible for the \nDepartment--which is, after all responsible both for the inmates' well-\nbeing and for paying for their upkeep--to make effective decisions.\n  With respect to this records and access provision, I would like to \nbriefly mention another related provision of this legislation. At the \nrequest of Senator Leahy, we have included a provision clarifying the \neffect of the record and access provision on doctor-patient testimonial \nprivileges.\n  This provision is intended to ensure that this legislation in no way \nalters the current state of the law regarding such testimonial \nprivileges. Where these testimonial privileges currently exist, they \nwill continue to have effect. Where they do not now apply, this \nlegislation does not make them applicable.\n  I do not believe that any doctor-patient privilege is applicable to \nthe treatment of the patients affected by this legislation. Indeed, it \nwould be anomalous if, in a post-adjudication setting, such a privilege \ndid exist. It would frustrate the ability of the government to provide \nappropriate care and treatment for these patients entrusted to the \nGovernment's care as a result of the adjudication.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides for the safety and well-\nbeing of the public and of affected patients in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. I am pleased by its adoption by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nDepartment of Justice endorsing this legislation be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed for your review and \n     appropriate reference is a draft bill, entitled the ``Act to \n     Improve the Treatment of and Security for Certain Persons \n     Found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity in the District of \n     Columbia'' (``Act''). A section by section analysis of the \n     bill is also enclosed.\n       This legislation is intended to improve the treatment and \n     security of approximately twenty-six persons who were found \n     not guilty by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia, \n     prior to the enactment of the Insanity Defense Reform Act of \n     1984 (IDRA). At present, these persons are committed to the \n     custody of the District of Columbia's St. Elizabeths \n     Hospital, although the United States remains financially \n     responsible for them.\n       The Act would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4243 to establish \n     constitutional procedures--in essence notice and an \n     opportunity for a hearing for each individual person--under \n     which the Attorney General could take custody of these \n     persons. To foreclose constitutional concerns that might \n     arise if the release conditions and procedures pertaining to \n     such persons were changed, the Act makes a series of \n     technical amendments to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4243 to ensure that \n     these matters would continue to be governed by standards \n     identical to those under the District of Columbia rather than \n     IDRA.\n       The enactment of the bill would give the Justice Department \n     the option of leaving this fairly small class of persons in \n     St. Elizabeths, contracting with a state or private facility \n     for their treatment in a secure setting, or placing them in a \n     Bureau of Prisons medical facility. The Department would not \n     have to handle all the persons the same way, but could pick \n     and choose the best course of treatment for them \n     individually, keeping in mind required security and public \n     safety concerns.\n       The benefits of this legislation are threefold. First, the \n     transfer of custody may allow for an improvement of medical \n     and mental health care and treatment over that which is \n     presently available at St. Elizabeths Hospital. Second, some \n     patients have escaped from St. Elizabeths and engaged in \n     criminal activity. These patients should be placed in more \n     secure facilities. Third, the United States is presently \n     incurring medical bills of $450.00 per day for each of these \n     inmates. Transfer of custody to a Federal medical facility \n     would result in savings per patient of nearly $120,000.00 per \n     year. Even if only half of these patients were transferred to \n     such a facility, the United States would realize annual \n     savings of at least $1.5 million.\n       The Act would require the District of Columbia and St. \n     Elizabeths Hospital to provide the Attorney General access, \n     within prescribed time limits, to medical records pertaining \n     to the persons whose custody could be transferred to the \n     Attorney General. This portion of the bill would resolve a \n     pending suit the Department of Justice has brought against \n     the District of Columbia over these records. The District has \n     refused the Department access to these records, despite the \n     fact that the United States is financially responsible for \n     the care and treatment of the persons to whom the records \n     pertain at an annual cost of more than $4 million. Access to \n     these records, interviews with mental health professionals \n     who have examined the persons to whom they pertain, and \n     access to the patients themselves, are all important in \n     enabling the Department of Justice to properly evaluate the \n     condition of these patients before any transfer would be \n     effected. The Act would prohibit the District of Columbia \n     from preventing persons in its employ from providing such \n     information to the Department of Justice or a contractor \n     hired for this purpose, and would permit an interview with \n     any patient who voluntarily consented to be interviewed.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the submission of this proposal to Congress.\n       I hope the bill will be promptly introduced, referred to \n     the appropriate committee for consideration and enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12295-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12296-S12297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Interior Appropriations Committee in a brief colloquy \non the recently passed Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to engage my colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the recently passed months \nappropriations bill contains funding for many programs within the \nDepartment of Interior. It also includes funding for several programs \nadministered by the Department of Energy [DOE]. I rise today to offer \nmy support for continued funding for the DOE Office of Oil and Gas \nTechnologies.\n  This program plays an important role in the technological aspects of \noil and gas development. Moreover, this office plays a critical role in \nthe international arena at a time when the world energy market is \nundergoing a substantial transformation. The move away from central \nplanning and increased competition in many nations has presented \nunprecedented opportunities for U.S. companies with the expertise and \nexperience in developing oil and gas production.\n  The fall of the Soviet Union and the gradual opening of markets in \nLatin America and Asia have unleashed significant potential for United \nStates companies. For several decades, and some cases longer, oil and \ngas reserves have been almost entirely under State control. Only \nrecently have these markets been open to outside investment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to respond to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. GORTON. If the opportunities exist for U.S. companies, what role \ndoes the Government play?\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Office of Oil and Gas Technologies plays a vital \nrole in two major areas. First, DOE will help ensure that the \nregulatory structures that emerge in these developing countries are \nfavorable to U.S. businesses. This is a particularly important mission \nfor the DOE to undertake because the Office of Oil and Gas Technologies \nhas the technical experience and day-to-day interactions with \nbusinesses involved in this area. Moreover, because the energy business \nin many countries is still wholly or partially controlled by the \nGovernment, the prestige of the U.S. Government play a key role in \ngaining access to the markets for U.S. companies.\n  Second, the U.S. government needs to be vigilant in helping ensure \nthat the technical and business implications of new trading agreements \nin the energy sector do not discriminate against U.S. businesses--\nespecially service companies and smaller independent producers who \noften lack the resources to track these international developments. \nSince we are making the investment in the technology, we should also \nmake the relatively much smaller investment in helping to ensure that \nthis business and technology do not face unfair competition overseas.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As we have seen in the past few years, tremendous \nopportunities have arisen for U.S. companies abroad. I hope that the \nChairman will join me in supporting continued funding for the Office of \nOil and Gas Technologies and their international competitiveness work. \nI yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12296-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMENDING MICHAEL J.

Mr. President, the immigration bill signed into law on \nSeptember 30 includes the following provision:\n\n     SEC. 352. EXCLUSION OF FORMER CITIZENS WHO RENOUNCED \n                   CITIZENSHIP TO AVOID UNITED STATES TAXATION\n\n       (E) Former Citizens Who Renounced Citizenship to Avoid \n     Taxation.--Any alien who is a former citizen of the United \n     States who officially renounces United States citizenship and \n     who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced \n     United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding \n     taxation by the United States is excludable.\n\n  The wording of the statute is embarrassing. How can an alien renounce \nU.S. citizenship? In what capacity would said alien do so officially? \nOne assumes that a court of law would find the language incoherent and \nunenforceable. Still, the intention is clear and needs to be addressed.\n  This is the way we legislate at 5 o'clock in the morning 4 days \nbefore adjournment. One wonders how many other similar items ended up \nin the continuing resolution passed by the Senate less than 6 hours \nbefore the end of the fiscal year.\n  The provision imposes an extraordinary penalty on certain persons who \nexercise the legal prerogative of expatriation: permanent exile from \nthe United States. Wealthy individuals who renounce their American \ncitizenship to avoid U.S. taxation--expatriates, as they are called--\nhave now been added to the list of terrorists, convicted criminals, \npersons with communicable diseases, and others who are by statute \ndeemed unworthy of admission to the United States.\n  It occurs infrequently, but expatriation to avoid taxes is even so a \ngenuine abuse. By renouncing their U.S. citizenship, individuals may \navoid taxes on gains that accrued during the period in which they \nacquired their wealth--and while they were afforded the benefits and \nprotections of U.S. citizenship.\n  This issue was considered by the Finance Committee early in the 104th \nCongress. In March 1995, a measure to address the problem was included \nin Senate legislation to restore the health insurance deduction for the \nself-employed. Prior to the House-Senate conference, however, concerns \nwere raised about whether the expatriation provision comported with \narticle 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \nwhich states: ``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including \nhis own.'' The United States is a party to this treaty, and it is \naccordingly law. We consulted a number of scholars, but there was no \nimmediate consensus on the matter.\n  Because of the urgency of the underlying legislation, which had to be \nenacted before the April 17th tax return filing deadline, the conferees \nchose to drop the expatriation provision so that the questions of \ninternational law could be studied. That decision by the conferees was \nmet with criticism in the Senate. This was surprising, since I \nbelieved--and I said on the Senate floor more than once--that it was \nour duty to act with special care when dealing with the rights of \npersons who are despised.\n  The issues of international law were later resolved, and on April 6, \n1995, I introduced S. 700, the first Senate bill to tax expatriates on \ngains accrued prior to expatriation. Subsequently, Chairman Archer \nintroduced a bill that did not follow the accrued gains approach, but \ninstead built on current law. In my view and that of the Treasury \nDepartment and most other tax experts, the House bill will not \neffectively deter tax-motivated expatriation. However, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimated that the House bill raised more \nrevenue, and it was included as an offset in the recently enacted \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n  Now, having failed to adopt the preferable--in my view--Senate \nexpatriation measure, we have compounded our error by enacting an ill-\nadvised provision to punish tax-motivated expatriates by banishing them \nfrom the land.\n  The appropriate response to exploitation of a loophole in the Tax \nCode is to close the loophole. Just 6 months ago, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral of the United States agreed. On March 13, 1996, Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Jamie S. Gorelick wrote to House Speaker Gingrich in opposition \nto the provision. She wrote:\n\n       The Administration believes that tax issues should be \n     addressed within the context of the Internal Revenue Code, \n     and that it would be inappropriate to use the [Immigration \n     and Naturalization Act] to attempt to deter tax-motivated \n     expatriation.\n\n  A short while later, however, the administration reversed its \nposition. On May 31, 1996, Ms. Gorelick wrote another letter in support \nof the provision. I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of both letters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, we were unable in this Congress to secure needed \nchanges in the tax laws to resolve, again in my view, the expatriation \nproblem. We ought to have enacted S. 700. Instead, we have enacted a \nmeasure that does not reflect well on a free society. I do hope we will \nreconsider this matter early in the 105th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                      Deputy Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: This letter presents the views of \n     the Administration concerning H.R. 2202, the ``Immigration in \n     the National Interest Act of 1995,'' as reported by the \n     Committee on the Judiciary on October 24, 1995.\n\n[[Page 12298]]\n\n       Many of the provisions in H.R. 2202 advance the \n     Administration's four-part strategy to control illegal \n     immigration. This strategy calls for regaining control of our \n     borders; removing the job magnet through worksite \n     enforcement; aggressively pursuing the removal of criminal \n     aliens and other illegal aliens; and securing from Congress \n     the resources to assist states with the costs of illegal \n     immigration that are a result of failed enforcement policies \n     of the past. The Administration's legislative proposal to \n     advance that strategy is H.R. 1929, the ``Immigration \n     Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995,'' introduced by \n     Representative Howard Berman on June 27, 1995.\n       The Administration endorses a framework of legal \n     immigration reform that respects our immigration tradition \n     while achieving a moderate reduction in overall admission \n     numbers to promote economic opportunities for all Americans. \n     The Administration seeks legal immigration reform that \n     promotes family reunification, protects U.S. workers from \n     unfair competition while providing employers with appropriate \n     access to international labor markets to promote our global \n     competitiveness, and promotes naturalization to encourage \n     full participation in the national community.\n       While the Administration strongly supports reform of the \n     current immigration law that affects both illegal and legal \n     immigration, and H.R. 2202 contains many provisions that are \n     similar or identical to the Administration's legislative \n     proposal, enforcement initiatives, and overall strategy, H.R. \n     2202 raises serious concerns in specific areas that we hope \n     the House of Representatives will examine thoroughly. The \n     Administration's concerns include, but are not limited to the \n     following:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Section 301(e) amends section 212 (a)(10) of the INA, as \n     redesignated by this bill, by adding a new subparagraph which \n     makes inadmissible any alien, who is a former citizen and who \n     the Attorney General determines has officially renounced his \n     citizenship for purposes of avoiding taxation by the United \n     States.\n       The Administration has proposed changes in the Internal \n     Revenue Code to remove incentives that encourage certain U.S. \n     citizens to avoid U.S. taxes by renouncing U.S. citizenship. \n     The Administration approach has been passed by the Senate \n     twice and is being considered in the ongoing balanced budget \n     negotiations. The Administration believes that tax issues \n     should be addressed within the context of the Internal \n     Revenue Code, and that it would be inappropriate to use the \n     INA to attempt to deter taxmotivated expatriation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jamie S. Gorelick,\n     Deputy Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                      Deputy Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 1996.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, Committee \n         on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the \n     Administration on H.R. 2202, the ``Immigration Control and \n     Financial Responsibility Act of 1996''. The Administration is \n     reversing decades of neglect in controlling illegal \n     immigration. Many of the provisions in both the House and \n     Senate bills would ratify the Administration's efforts in the \n     field to combat illegal immigration. The administration's \n     four-part strategy calls for regaining control of our \n     borders; protecting U.S. workers through worksite \n     enforcement; aggressively removing criminal and other \n     deportable aliens; and obtaining the resources that are \n     necessary to make the strategy work. Both the House and \n     Senate bills contain many provisions that support the \n     Administration's enforcement initiatives and are based on or \n     similar to the Administration's legislative and budget \n     proposals.\n       We look forward to working with the conference committee to \n     craft a strong, fair, and effective immigration bill. \n     However, H.R. 2202 raises serious concerns in specific areas \n     that we hope the conference committee will examine \n     thoroughly. In addition, a number of amendments to the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) made by the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. \n     L. 104-132, present substantial obstacles to the effective \n     enforcement of the immigration laws. The conference committee \n     has an opportunity to remedy some of those problems with a \n     careful and more comprehensive approach to amending the INA. \n     The Administration's views include, but are not limited to \n     the following:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We strongly recommend adoption of the House provisions \n     contained in sections 301 (except 301(c) and (f)), 303, 304, \n     305, 307, 308, and 309. However, an amendment must be made to \n     strike section 241(d) (added by the AEDPA) which provides \n     that aliens ``found in'' the United States without having \n     been inspected and admitted are inadmissible. This language \n     is problematic, will lead to litigation; and is inconsistent \n     with the House immigration bill. In addition, there is no \n     waiver provision for inadmissibility under the newly-created \n     section 212(a)(9), even for immediate relatives of U.S. \n     citizens. We strongly recommend the inclusion of a \n     discretionary waiver of inadmissibility.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jamie S. Gorelick,\n                                          Deputy Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may I add my remarks to those by many \nSenators in the Chamber as we bid a fond farewell to our colleague from \nNebraska. Senator Exon and I came to the Senate together and, from our \nfirst day, served together on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nSenator Exon attended his last hearing of that committee earlier this \nafternoon and, once again, propounded the tough questions as he has \ndone year after year, coming directly to the point of the issue, but \nbringing to bear a background in which he draws upon the distinguished \nperiod of his life from World War II, when he was proud to wear the \nuniform of this country in the cause of freedom.\n  He is another who has worn the uniform who is leaving the Senate. The \nSenate gradually, primarily because of change of times and \ndemographics, has fewer and fewer in its membership who served in \nuniform. Having had that privilege, he brought with him that knowledge \nthat could be applied, that is unique and particularly useful when our \nArmed Services Committee had to make decisions relative to the safety, \nwelfare, training, and the active duty pay of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces.\n  So, not only does the Senate today salute him at the end of this \nchapter of his career in public service, but so do generations of the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague from \nVirginia for his most kind remarks. Indeed, we came here together. But, \nindeed, we knew each other even before that.\n  I remember very well my friend, the Senator from Virginia, when he \nserved as Secretary of the Navy with great distinction. When I was \nGovernor of Nebraska, he was the head of the centennial commission and \ncame out to Nebraska. That is the first time I really got well \nacquainted with John Warner. At that time I had no idea we would \neventually serve in the U.S. Senate.\n  As students of history understand, and I think most people would \nbelieve, probably more great individual contributors to government at \nall levels have come from the State of Virginia than from any other. \nCertainly, I just want to say from my perspective, none has done more, \nnone has dedicated himself more fervently to what he thought was right \nfor Virginia and for the United States of America than my good and dear \nfriend, John Warner.\n  I wish you nothing but the best, my friend. I assure you that we will \nbe keeping in touch.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I wish to carefully \nnote in the Record that that was a statement of courage, looking to the \nfuture, and not marking any imminent retirement by myself from the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12297-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12297-S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was privileged to shake the hand of Sam \nNunn just now, the distinguished, esteemed Senator from Georgia, as he \ndeparted the Chamber. He said to me, ``This will be our last handshake \non the floor of the U.S. Senate.''\n\n  That was, indeed, a very moving split second for me, because we have, \nthrough the 18 years that I have been a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, shaken hands many times on this floor--and on occasion \nshaken a few fists at one another. But the period that I remember the \nbest is when he was chairman of the committee, having succeeded a long \nline of very distinguished individuals: John Stennis, ``Scoop'' \nJackson, John Tower, Barry Goldwater--all Senators. But my most \nmemorable period is when I was privileged to serve as the ranking \nmember\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\nof the Armed Services Committee some 6 years. I served with the \nchairman, who was Senator Nunn, and we took, in each of those years, to \nthis floor legislation of our committee, the authorization bills, and \ndebated them with our colleagues, sometimes long into the night.\n  We don't seem to have the night sessions as we did in the old days, \nbut I can remember leaving the Chamber with some of those bills and the \nSun was coming up--12, 14, 16 hours of continuous debate as 1 day's \nactivities on usually a 3- or 4-day consideration of our bill.\n  So I will miss him a great deal. He is a very dear friend.\n  I think back on how he was elected to the Senate in 1972 and served \non the Armed Services Committee for 24 years. He served as chairman of \nthe Manpower and Personnel Subcommittee in the seventies. I remember \nserving briefly with him on that subcommittee. He was chairman of the \ncommittee, of course, after becoming ranking minority member. It is a \ndistinguished career.\n  He was chairman of the full committee from 1986 to 1993 and now, in \nthe last years of his career, again is the ranking member. I point that \nout because he was always, to the maximum extent possible by any Member \nof the U.S. Senate, bipartisan in his approach to the responsibilities \nof our committee and those issues that related to national security and \nforeign affairs.\n  He followed in the tradition of two great Georgia Members of the U.S. \nCongress, his uncle, Congressman Carl Vinson, chairman of the House \nArmed Services Committee. I have a picture, which I treasure greatly, \nfrom when I was Secretary of the Navy. I recommended to the President \nof the United States, at that time Richard Nixon, that the tradition in \nthe U.S. Navy that existed from the first day of a sailing ship should \nbe broken and that the Navy should name a ship for a living individual.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Mel Laird, at that time, consulted with me. \nI took the decision to Mr. Laird. He said, ``Let's give it a try.''\n  Mr. Laird had been in the U.S. Navy in World War II. We went to see \nthe President. The President had been in the Navy. He was an officer \nduring World War II. Three sailors sat down and decided we would name a \nsupercarrier the ``Carl Vinson,'' on the occasion of his 50th year in \nthe Congress of the United States and concluding many of those years as \nchairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n  I mention that because we had a model of the ship built and the \nPresident of the United States, myself and Secretary Laird presented \nthat model to Carl Vinson. Sam Nunn is in the picture. It is a \nremarkable picture, because Senator Nunn's sideburns were down almost \nbelow his jaw. I will never forget that. It hangs in his office.\n  Another distinguished Member of Congress, of course, was Richard \nRussell, who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee for 16 \nyears. I will have further to say about that Senator as I close my \nremarks.\n  Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading \nexperts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on \nnational security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our \ncountry and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I \nthink he will make his greatest contribution in the years to come, \nwherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker.\n  His approach to national security issues has been guided by one \nfundamental criteria: What Sam Nunn believes is in the best interest of \nthe United States of America.\n  As a junior Senator in 1978, he ultimately voted in favor of the \nPanama Canal Treaty because he thought--Mr. President, he thought--it \nwas in the long-term national security interest of our Nation, even \nthough he knew it was not a popular position, particularly in the South \nand most particularly in Georgia. He supported the policies of \nPresidents of both parties when he thought they were right, and he \nraised questions about the policies of the Presidents of both parties \nwhen he thought questions needed to be raised.\n\n  But, again, as we look back in the history of Congress and its \nconstitutional role in foreign policy--and how many debates have I been \nin and Senator Nunn and others, for example, on the War Powers Act, on \nconsultation? Just today in the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I \nthink quite properly, questions were raised about the level of \nconsultation between the President, President Clinton, and the \nCongress. But Sam Nunn, to me, applied what is known as the \n``Vandenberg rule,'' a very distinguished former Member of the U.S. \nSenate, recognized for his strength in foreign policy, who, to \nparaphrase his saying, always believed that partisanship politics \nshould be checked at the water's edge, and that has been a guiding \nlight for Senator Nunn.\n  Sam Nunn always worked, as I say, in a bipartisan fashion, almost \ninvariably. His numerous initiatives and legislative accomplishments \ninvariably have Republican and Democratic cosponsors. Senator Nunn is \nfond of saying that he has yet to see a problem or a challenge facing \nthis country that can be solved by only one political party. How true \nthat is in national security and foreign policy.\n  I started to go over his accomplishments and just selected a few, \nbecause I was involved. He was a tremendous supporter of the welfare of \nour men and women in uniform and their families. He helped restore \nquality of force, the total arms force, following the serious problems \nthat we had in the aftermath of Vietnam; indeed, during Vietnam. He \ncoauthored the Nunn-Warner benefits package of 1980, perhaps the first \nsingle piece of legislation for which I have received, I think \nunjustifiably, but nevertheless some modest recognition.\n  He was a leader in establishing a program of transition benefits in \nthe nineties to military and civilian employees of DOD who lost their \njobs as a result of the downsizing of the defense infrastructure of the \nmilitary services.\n  NATO was a very, very favorite subject. I traveled with him on many \noccasions to NATO, as I did through the capitals of the world, and sat \nwith him when he, on a one-on-one equal basis shared views with heads \nof state, heads of government, world leaders in Europe, in Asia, and \nthe Middle East.\n  He was a strong supporter of maintaining NATO as an active and \nenergetic alliance. He wrote three reports to the Senate on the health \nof the NATO alliance. He is very highly regarded by political and \nmilitary leaders throughout the NATO community.\n  If there were one subject to concern him the most--and, indeed, it \ndoes me and, I am sure, almost every Member of this body--it is the \nproliferation of the knowledge of how to construct weapons of mass \ndestruction, proliferation of that knowledge and, indeed, the \nproliferation of the arming of the weapons themselves.\n  Senator Nunn, together with Senator Lugar of Indiana, created the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program to help countries of the former \nSoviet Union dismantle their weapons of mass destruction and the \nfacilities to produce such weapons.\n  He also offered legislation to improve our domestic capability in \ncounter- terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction. I joined him. I \nhappened to be the manager of the defense bill at the time that \namendment was raised by Senators Nunn, Lugar, and Domenici.\n  And I joined as a cosponsor in authorizing the Department of Defense \nand other Government agencies of the Federal Government to share with \nlocal law enforcement some of the basic knowledge of how to deal with \nthe situation, should they be confronted with the threat of the use of, \nsay, a crude weapon, chemical or biological weapon of mass destruction \nin any of our 50 States. I urge the communities to avail themselves of \nthat authorization in our most recent 1997 bill.\n  We had our differences. We have fought toe to toe on this floor when \nI, together with Senator Dole and others, passed the gulf resolution, \nthat resolution to authorize President Bush to utilize the men and \nwomen of the United States, a half a million of whom were in positions \nready, together with perhaps the most magnificent allied coalition ever \nformed in the history of the world, to repel the invasion of Saddam \nHussein.\n  But it was necessary in the President's mind to have the support of \nthe Congress of the United States. And that is a chapter in history \nthat should be studied carefully by all Presidents,\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n\nbecause when the men and women of the Armed Forces go forward beyond \nour shores, in harm's way, we want the total support of both the \nPresidency and the Congress and, to the extent possible, the people of \nthe United States behind those troops, particularly when the risk of \npersonal injury is very high.\n  We had our differences. We fought that battle. It was about a 5-vote \ndifference in the outcome. But from the very moment of the decision of \nthe United States to support the resolution, which I was privileged to \ndraft under the direction of the then-leader, Senate Dole, from the \nvery first minute of the vote by the Senate of the United States, \nSenator Nunn backed President Bush in his decision to use force and to \nturn around the situation that was tragic in the eyes of the world.\n  We had our differences on the interpretation of the ABM, the SALT, \nthe START treaties, but always, once again, bipartisanship was \nforemost.\n  A moment ago Senator Nunn spoke about the staff of the Senate. One of \nhis hallmarks was his ability to attract the finest people for \nprofessional staff, in the years particularly when he was chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and in the \nGovernmental Operations Committee. And I think that is the hallmark of \na great Senator, the ability to attract quality staff, to spend long \nhours of dedicated service to their Nation and to their Senate.\n  Mr. President, Senator Nunn always had a profound preference, as he \nshould, for Senator Russell. He used to say from time to time that he \nonly temporarily was the holder of the Senate seat from Georgia which \nwas once held by Richard Russell. And I thought I would conclude my \nremarks by reading the remarks of our distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, at the unveiling of the \nstatue in the Russell rotunda of Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. I \nask unanimous consent to have the entire remarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Richard B. Russell, Jr. (D-GA, 1933-1971)\n\n       At the unveiling of the statue of Russell in the rotunda of \n     the Russell Senate Office Building on January 24, 1996, \n     Senator Byrd said of Russell:\n       ``He was the senator, the uncrowned king of the southern \n     block, and he was as truly a Senate man as was Henry Clay or \n     Daniel Webster or John C. Calhoun or Thomas Benton or any of \n     the other giants who had preceded him.\n       ``Senator Russell's philosophy of government was rooted in \n     constitutionalism. . . . He was always regarded as one of the \n     most fair and conscientious members of this body.\n       ``Through it all he served his nation well. Richard Russell \n     followed his own star. He did not pander. His confidant was \n     his conscience. He was always the good and faithful servant \n     of the people. He was good for the Senate, and he loved it \n     dearly. I can say without any hesitation that he was a \n     remarkable senator, a remarkable American, a remarkable man \n     who enjoyed the respect and the affecting of all who served \n     with him.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. But I shall read this one paragraph.\n\n       Through it all he served his nation well. Richard Russell \n     followed his own star. He did not pander. His confidant was \n     his conscience. He was always the good and faithful servant \n     of the people. He was good for the Senate, and he loved it \n     dearly. I can say without any hesitation that he was a \n     remarkable Senator, a remarkable American, a remarkable man \n     who enjoyed the respect and the affection of all who served \n     with him.\n\n  I think, Mr. President, certainly this Senator, and I feel most, can \nsay that Senator Byrd's remarks capturing the magnificence of Richard \nRussell--Sam Nunn can return to Georgia with a clear conscience that he \ndid his best to fulfill the reputation of Richard Russell of Georgia.

Mr. President, I too join our many colleagues in \nwanting to say goodbye, good luck, and thank you to our colleagues. All \nof them are leaving this body. And as they leave they leave a mark of \ngreat distinction, each and every one of them.\n  I cannot help, Mr. President, as I review the names of those who are \nretiring--we have heard several comments from many colleagues about the \nnames, and they are all familiar--but I cannot help but note that when \nyou talk about people like Senator Pell, Senator Hatfield, Senator \nNunn, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Johnston, Senator Simpson, Senator \nBradley, Senator Cohen, Senator Exon, Senator Heflin, Senator Pryor, \nSenator Simon, Senator Brown, this is a really distinguished group of \npeople, Mr. President.\n  And when I think of what each of them brings to our deliberations, to \nthe body, to the Senate, they have enriched us substantially, each one \nof them, some with longer lists of legislation than others, but each \none with a unique character, and a list of people of principle, of \nintegrity, of honesty. And one of the things I think that each of us \nhas to consider is who is going to follow, who is going to follow over \nthese next few years as we approach the 21st century. Is there going to \nbe a sense of what this institution is about? Are they going to have \nrespect?\n  Mr. President, as I said, the question as to those who follow, will \nthey have the respect, the reverence, not only for this institution, \nbut for the way we operate as a Government, with the respect that I \nthink has been denied of more recent years by many, who choose to use \nthis place often as a battleground, as opposed to a people's forum, \ntrying to, in many cases, get the edge, get the leg up, get the \npublicity, get the press?\n\n  I do not want to be too nostalgic here. These are wonderful people \nwho, with the help of good health, will go on to do many other things. \nIt strikes me, at a particular time when things seem to be so unruly in \nour society, so much hostility, so much anger, so much confusion that \nwe take the best of us in this group and say so long to them with not \nonly respect and reverence for them but with some misgivings, some \napprehension as to the ordinary citizens of our society who are not \nserving in this body as they greet the newcomers. There will be many of \nthem--I do not know how it ranks in the numbers that have come in a \nsingle class.\n  Mr. President, I say goodbye to each of those individuals. I want to \nmake particular note of the retirement of my colleague, Senator Bill \nBradley, with whom I have worked very closely over these years, with \nwhom I have shared prospects for what we can do for New Jersey, for the \ncountry, unity of opinion, and sometimes a different approach to how we \ngot to these goals, Mr. President, but nevertheless someone whose \nfriendship I treasure and whose presence will be missed here, in \nparticular by me, because of our close association.\n  In particular, as I mentioned Bill Bradley, Senator Mark Hatfield and \nothers, who have served this body so well. I will miss them all and I \nknow we will be a different place.\n  This body is far bigger than the total sum of the individuals who \nserve it, and we will continue on, God willing, with strength and with \npurpose and with comity and collegiality. That is my wish.\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to say goodbye, once again, to my colleague, \nMark Hatfield, who is retiring after serving the people of Oregon, and \nthe United States, for 30 years as a member of this body.\n  Recently, I have been contemplating Mark' absence from the \nAppropriations Committee. Whether as chairman or ranking member, his \nleadership will be missed. And as I reviewed our contacts over the \nyears, I wanted to acknowledge that, even given our different party \naffiliations, our relationship has been one of the most satisfying \nassociations I've ever had in my life. This man has special qualities \nthat endeared him to many, including this Senator.\n  Despite the constant fray, Mark was always true to his beliefs and \nwas able to maintain and express his convictions, without confrontation \nor belligerence. His value system set standards in the Senate for all \nto admire, and perhaps emulate. Undoubtedly, his legacy of good will, \nhonesty and integrity benefited all who served with him.\n  In the area of public service, Senator Hatfield's career has been \ndistinguished by an uncompromising commitment to improve the human \ncondition and to address what he has so eloquently called ``the \ndesperate human needs in our midst.'' Among the many\n\n[[Page S12301]]\n\nissues on which we fought together, was the work we did to ensure that \nhundreds of thousands of refugees from Southeast Asia would not face \npersecution and that refugees, worldwide, are given a fair hearing by \nthe American Government. Under his leadership, we also worked together \nto end U.S. nuclear testing and to reduce defense spending. Although \nMark Hatfield has sometimes stood alone in his humanitarian and \ncourageous efforts, he never shied away from acting according to his \nconscience. So it is no wonder that all of his Senate colleagues have \nthe deepest and most sincere respect for him.\n  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mark has been an \ninspiration. He was consistently a voice of reason. He tried to avoid \npartisanship and worked tirelessly to unite, not divide. His concern \nwas always policy, not politics. As Chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Senator Hatfield has demonstrated that he views \ninvestment in our infrastructure as an investment in our future.\n  Because he chose to spend 30 years in the public arena, we are all \nbetter off. Whether addressing health care, energy, environment, \ntransportation policy, nuclear testing, or refugee issues, Senator \nHatfield's convictions and commitment have elevated the debate in this \nchamber. He has always been passionate; he has always been thoughtful; \nhe has always been fair.\n  I know I speak for all my colleagues when I say that Mark Hatfield's \ncompassion and convictions will be sorely missed by all of us in this \nChamber. It has been a pleasure to serve with him and to enjoy the \nwarmth of his friendship; I wish him my very best as he goes on to new \nchallenges and continues to contribute to his State and his country.\n\n\n                    tribute to senator alan simpson\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Alan Simpson of \nWyoming, who is retiring from the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, and across the political spectrum, will miss Alan Simpson in the \nyears to come. You do not have to agree with Alan on every issue to \nappreciate his warmth, his great sense of humor, and his outstanding \nabilities as a legislator. Perhaps Alan's greatest talent is being able \nto tenaciously fight for an issue, but in a manner that leaves even his \nopponents with smiles on their faces.\n  Mr. President, I also think of Alan Simpson as someone who is willing \nto stand up for what he believes, even when his closest colleagues may \ndisagree with him. I have special respect for his steadfast support for \na woman's right to choose, a position that put him at odds with many in \nhis party. Alan's belief that families, not politicians, should make \nbasic moral decisions like abortion is consistent with his principles, \nand he deserves our credit and our respect for his willingness to \ndefend those principles, no matter what the cost. Undeniably, Alan is a \nman of courage.\n  Mr. President, Alan Simpson and I have disagreed on many issues. But \nI have tremendous respect for the Senator and a real affection for the \nman. Whatever our differences on policy, I consider him a great friend. \nAnd I hope that he and Ann and I will find the occasion to share some \ntime together whenever and wherever we can do that.\n  Senator Simpson has made a real contribution to this great \ninstitution. I wish him the very best as he leaves the Senate, and I \nhope we will continue to hear his views, and benefit from his quick \nmind and unique wit, in the years ahead.\n\n\n                    tribute to senator howell heflin\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly great U.S. Senator, \nHowell Heflin, on his retirement from this body. The Senator was a \ntireless champion for the people and interests of Alabama. And as a \nlawyer, judge, and a U.S. Senator, Howell has been a consistent and \nconstant supporter of racial justice and civil rights for all.\n  One of the most moving movements in the Senate was when Senator \nHeflin spoke about Senator Moseley-Braun's attempt to deny the United \nDaughters of the Confederacy a renewal of the patent for their \norganization's official design. Senator Heflin rose and said, ``I have \nmany connections through my family to the Daughters of the Confederacy \n* * * but the Senator from Illinois is a descendant of those that \nsuffered the ills of slavery.'' Senator Heflin voted with Senator \nMoseley-Braun.\n  Mr. President, although we did not agree on every issue, I always \nrespected Senator Heflin's intelligence, integrity, and independence. \nIt is very unfortunate that the Halls of the Senate will no longer \nresonate with his voice of moderation and reason.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Heflin leaves the Senate, I want to wish \nhim and his family all the best.\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a true giant of the U.S. \nSenate, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Claiborne Pell. He has \nserved our Nation and his State with great distinction for 36 years in \nthis body.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell has so many Senate accomplishments that I \ndo not have time to recount them all. However, I do want to highlight \nhis work in three areas: Foreign relations, education, and \ntransportation.\n  In foreign affairs, he has worked for peace since the end of World \nWar II. He actually helped establish the modern United Nations. He \nserved as a Foreign Service officer, and later as chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee. In all of these positions, \nhe tirelessly worked to expand democracy throughout the world and to \npromote peaceful resolutions to conflict.\n  Mr. President, whenever you hear the word education in the Senate, \nthe first person you think of is Claiborne Pell. He was a key architect \nof the 1965 Education Act that provided the first Federal funding for \nelementary and secondary education. He was also instrumental in \ncreating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities. Finally, he wrote the student aid program that \nbears his name: Pell Grants. These grants give low income students the \nopportunity to attend college and the chance to attain the American \ndream.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell and I worked most closely on \ntransportation issues. And it is no exaggeration to say that Claiborne \nPell is a visionary in the transportation field. Many years ago, he \nwrote a book, ``Megalopolis Unbound'', which advocated high speed \nground transportation to deal with future urban congestion. Senator \nPell and I worked to make his vision a reality by fighting to ensure \nquality rail service in the Northeast corridor and through the \nconstruction of the new Providence AMTRAK station.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is losing an extraordinary Senator and \nstatesman. Although he leaves a great void in the Senate, I want to \nwish my friend Claiborne Pell and his family health and happiness for \nmany years.\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Bennett Johnston, the senior \nSenator from Louisiana, as he prepares to leave this body after 24 \nyears of distinguished service. It has been a privilege to serve with \nBennett.\n  I worked with Senator Johnston on the Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees, and I was impressed with the way he handled the tough \nissues. He is a skillful negotiator, always willing to try to find a \ncompromise to end legislative gridlock. For Johnston, the important \nthing was policy, not politics.\n  Although we will all miss Senator Johnston, he will be especially \nmissed by the people of the Pelican State. He actively championed \nLouisiana's interests, particularly in the areas of education and \ninfrastructure.\n  At the national level, Senator Johnston understood the dangers of \ndepending on foreign oil. And he consistently argued for the \nformulation of a comprehensive, national energy policy.\n  Mr. President, it is true that the Senator from Louisiana and I did \nnot agree on every issue that came before the Senate. But I learned \nquickly that he was a very skilled legislator, who was always willing \nto defend his convictions.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of Louisiana will certainly miss Bennett \nJohnston's commitment and concern, and I will miss the integrity and \nintelligence he brought to the Senate. I wish him well in his future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most \ndedicated\n\n[[Page S12302]]\n\nMembers of the United States Senate, Sam Nunn, on his retirement.\n  Few members have worked so doggedly to protect the defense and \nsecurity of our country as Senator Nunn. When he came to the Senate in \n1972, Sam brought a commitment to make this Nation more secure by \nstrengthening America's defenses, by reducing the threat of nuclear \nwar, by eliminating wasteful Pentagon spending and by fostering pride \nin America.\n  While his accomplishments are numerous, I view his leadership in the \neffort to support the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former \nSoviet Union as one of his most important and far reaching \ncontributions. Without exaggeration, this initiative significantly \nreduced the risk of accidental nuclear war. For this alone, all \nAmericans owe him a debt of gratitude.\n  Through his dedication to our men and women in uniform, Senator Nunn \nproved that there is more than one way to defend your country. And by \nsecuring the enactment of National Service legislation, which offers \ngenerous education benefits in exchange for public service, Senator \nNunn is helping to instill in our young people the importance of public \nservice and as well as a respect for American values.\n  Mr. President, I have tremendous respect for Senator Nunn's work on \nbehalf of the people of Georgia and the United States. Though we have \nnot always shared the same view on defense policy, I have always \nadmired his careful analysis, deliberation and evaluation.\n  His 24 years of public service in the Senate will undoubtedly leave a \nlasting imprint on the national security and defense policy of our \nNation. I know that I join with all of his Senate colleagues in saying \nthat Senator Nunn's presence will be sorely missed. I extend my best \nwishes as Sam leaves the Senate and begins the next phase of his \ncareer.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BILL COHEN\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished Member of this \nbody, Senator Bill Cohen, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of \nthe 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is losing one of its most respected and \ndedicated members. Bill Cohen is the kind of person that Americans \nwant, and America needs, in Government. He is someone with unquestioned \nintegrity, who has always done what he believes to be right, even if \nhis own party disagrees with him.\n  Bill Cohen first came to national attention at one of our Nation's \ndarkest hours, during the Watergate scandal. As a member of the House \nJudiciary Committee, he was one of the first Republicans to break ranks \nwith President Nixon, and he led a group of moderate Members who \nsupported a resolution of impeachment. It was the right thing to do. \nAnd it was typical of the kind of independent thinking that has marked \nBill Cohen's career ever since.\n  From his days on the Watergate Committee, Bill Cohen has worked hard \nto promote ethics in Government, and he has made an enormous \ncontribution in this area. He has helped strengthen the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, and he worked to enact legislation that \nsubstantially increased reporting requirements for lobbyists. Senator \nCohen also joined me in the successful effort to ban most gifts to \nMembers of Congress.\n  Mr. President, Bill Cohen is one of the most thoughtful Members of \nthis body, someone who thoroughly studies an issue before announcing a \nposition. Consequently, when Bill Cohen comes to this floor, people \nlisten. They admire his judgment, his fairness, his integrity, and so \ndo I. I have not agreed with Bill Cohen on every issue, but I have \nalways respected his scholarship, his leadership, his statesmanship.\n  It has been a privilege to serve with Bill Cohen in the Senate, and \nit is unfortunate that people of his stature have decided to leave this \nbody. But I want to wish Bill all the best as he leaves this body for \nnew challenges. He has served his country with distinction, we will all \nmiss him very much.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE FOR SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague \nand friend, Paul Simon. When I think of Paul's extraordinary career in \nthe Senate, I'm reminded of a remark by Toni Morrison, ``As you enter \npositions of trust and power, dream a little before you think.'' \nAlthough Paul's intellectual abilities are well known, he even holds 39 \nhonorary degrees, he is also a great dreamer. For he has dreamed of a \ncountry where no child has to live in poverty, where no young person is \ndenied an education because of financial reasons and where no senior \ncitizen is bankrupted by a medical emergency.\n  And Paul has tirelessly fought to make those dreams reality. It is \nnot surprising that in 1983, during his 10 years in the House, Time \nmagazine noted that Simon passed more legislation that year than other \nMembers of the House of Representatives.\n  In the Senate, Paul has been particularly concerned with affording \nevery American the opportunity of an affordable education. Among his \naccomplishments in this area, he recently enacted major education and \njob training legislation which includes the National Literacy Act, the \nSchool-to-Work Opportunities Act and the Job Training Partnership Act \nAmendments. He was also the leading champion of the new direct college \nloan program, enacted in 1991 as a pilot program and expanded in 1993 \nas a replacement for the guaranteed student loan program.\n  Mr. President, Paul and I have personally fought many battles \ntogether. And although I could speak about his support on any number of \nissues, I want to especially recall his constant and consistent efforts \non the issue of gun control. I knew that I could always count on \nSenator Simon's support in the continuing struggle to take guns off our \nstreets.\n  When I think of Paul's retirement from the Senate, I remember the \nwords of Thomas Jefferson. When Jefferson presented his credentials as \nU.S. Minister to France, the French Premier remarked, ``I see that you \nhave come to replace Benjamin Franklin. Jefferson corrected him; \nsaying, ``No one can replace Dr. Franklin, I am only succeeding him.''\n  In much the same way, Paul Simon is also irreplaceable. As he begins \nthe next phase of his career, I wish my friend continued success and \nbest wishes.\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE FOR SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer my best wishes to Senator Pryor on his \nretirement from the Senate. All of his colleagues will miss David's \ncandor and commitment, but his presence in Washington will be \nespecially missed by the people of Arkansas and by our Nation's senior \ncitizens.\n  Senator Pryor's motto has always been ``Arkansas Comes First.'' And \nas he's noted, it's more than a slogan--it's a way of life. Throughout \nhis career, he's been a fighter for Arkansas' interests and for her \npeople. As a member of the Agricultural Committee, David's leadership \nled to the development of innovative programs and legislation to aid \nArkansas' farmers and to protect her resources.\n  Senator Pryor is also considered one of Washington's leading \nadvocates for older Americans. Starting in 1989, he served for 6 years \nas chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. He is nationally \nrecognized for his work to help save the Social Security system, to \nreform the nursing home industry and to lower the price of prescription \ndrugs. He also endeavored to ensure that Government institutions \npreserve the essential dignity of our country's elderly.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Finance Committee, Senator Pryor \nalso wrote the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, the first piece of legislation \nin over 40 years which guaranteed certain rights to individuals when \ndealing with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  If I had to sum up David Pryor's Senate career, including the 6 years \nhe held the number three leadership post, in a single word, that word \nwould be service. And that reminds me of a remark by the great \nhumanitarian, Albert Schweitzer. He noted, ``The only ones among you \nwho will be truly happy are those who have sought out, and found how to \nserve.'' If that's true, than David Pryor is definitely the happiest of \nmen.\n  As he leaves the Senate, I wish my colleague well as he begins the \nnext stage of his career, and his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12300-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12302-S12303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12302-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORTS ON MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY AND HIGHWAY SAFETY FOR CALENDAR YEAR \n                1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM-176\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the 1995 calendar year reports as prepared by the \nDepartment of Transportation on activities under the Highway Safety \nAct, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and the \nMotor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, as amended.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nSocial Security Act to require the Internal Revenue Service to collect \nchild support through wage withholding and to eliminate State \nenforcment of child support obligations other than medical support \nobligations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE UNIFORM CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to help \nensure that children across this country get the economic support they \nneed and deserve from both parents in order to have a wholesome \nchildhood, grow up healthy, and thrive.\n  Mr. President, child support reform is an urgent public issue because \nit affects so many children. In 1994, one out of every four children \nlived in a family with only one parent present in the home. Half of all \nthe 18.7 million children living in single-parent families in 1994 were \npoor, compared with only slightly more than one out of every 10 \nchildren in two-parent families. Clearly the payment of child support \nby the absent parent is an important determinant of the economic status \nof these children.\n  Unfortunately, the failure to pay child support is extraordinarily \nwidespread, cutting across income and racial lines. Of the 10 million \nwomen raising children with an absent parent, over 4 million had no \nsupport awarded. Of those 5.4 million women who were due support, \nslightly over half received the full amount due, while a quarter \nreceived partial payment, and a quarter received nothing at all. Let me \nrepeat that, Mr. President--more than half of the women with child \nsupport orders received no support or less than the full amount.\n  Mr. President, common sense will tell you that children are hurt when \nparents do not pay support. But perhaps some evidence will make the \npoint even clearer. A recent survey of single parents in Georgia, \nOregon, Ohio, and New York documents the real harm children suffer when \nchild support is not paid: During the first year after the parent left \nthe home, more than half the families surveyed faced a serious housing \ncrisis. Nearly a third reported that their children went hungry at some \npoint during the year. And over a third reported that their children \nlacked appropriate clothing such as a winter coat.\n  Mr. President, it is also clear that better child support enforcement \ncan produce a lot more money for children. A 1994 study by the Urban \nInstitute estimates that if child support orders were established for \nall children with a living noncustodial father and these orders were \nfully enforced, aggregate child support payments would have been $47.6 \nbillion dollars in 1990--nearly three times the amount of child support \nactually paid in this country.\n  Unfortunately, this country has made all too little progress in \ntackling the child support problem, and this has been true under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations. For all women over the past \ndecade, the average child support payment due, the average amount \nreceived, as well as the percentage of women with awards, have remained \nvirtually unchanged--adjusting for inflation. Similarly, the State \nchild support enforcement system that serves welfare families and \nnonwelfare families who ask for help has made progress in paternity \nestablishment, but little progress overall. Over 500,000 children had \ntheir paternity established by State agencies in fiscal year 1994--a 50 \npercent increase over the last 5 years. But fewer than one out of every \nfive cases served by State agencies had any child support paid in \nfiscal year 1994--a figure that has risen only slightly since fiscal \nyear 1990. Mr. President, it is an intolerable situation for our \nNation's children when State child support agencies are making \nabsolutely no collection in 80 percent of their cases.\n  My bill will help make sure that we achieve real progress for \nchildren. During this session, Congress passed some important \nimprovements in the child support system in the welfare bill that \nrecently became law. My bill would give States a chance to implement \nthese new changes and then assess their success or failure. If these \nreforms succeed in dramatically improving the performance of State \nchild support offices, then this bill would not tinker with success. \nIf, however, we do not see dramatic improvement in collections within \nthe next 3 years, this bill would ensure that we take bold steps to \nhelp children. This bill would leave establishment of paternity and \nchild support orders at the State level but move collection of support \nto the national level where we can more aggressively pursue interstate \ncases and send a message to all parents obligated to pay support that \nmaking full and timely support payments is an obligation as serious as \nmaking full and timely payment of taxes. If more than half the States \ndo not achieve a 75-percent collection rate in their child support \ncases, then the system of collection would be federalized to ensure \nthat children get the support they need and deserve.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been 12 years since this Congress passed the \nfirst major child support legislation. However, despite this \nlegislative effort and additional reforms in 1988, according to a \nrecent study there is a higher default rate on child support payments \nthan on used car loans. I do not believe a single Member of this body \nwill argue with me that this is wrong. If, under the newly revised \nFederal law, States can rectify this situation, we can all take \npleasure and satisfaction from watching them do it. If they cannot, we \nmust no longer stand idly by wringing our hands. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill so that America's children of every income level \nwill be assured of the support they need and deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \nAct of 1996, to modify provisions of law relating to public assistance \nand benefits for aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the alien public assistance benefits amendments of 1996\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to put into \nlaw those very important provisions of the recent immigration bill \nwhich were deleted at the insistence of the White House.\n  The taxpayers of the United States, and particularly those in the \nmost heavily immigration-impacted States such as California, deserve \nour protection of the public treasury as contained in this measure.\n  Without the provisions included in this bill, persons who are \neligible to receive food stamps and other public assistance will now be \npermitted to bring to the United States their immigrant relatives whose \nincome is also below the threshold for many of the Nation's welfare \nprograms. And this, despite, our professed tradition of not allowing \nany person ``likely, at any time, to become a public charge'' to \nimmigrate to this country.\n  Without the provisions of this bill, illegal aliens will continue to \nreceive drivers' licenses, and under the ``motor-voter'' law \nprovisions, these illegal aliens with drivers' licenses could well wind \nup voting in U.S. elections.\n  Without the protections contained in this bill, illegal aliens could \ncontinue to receive treatment for AIDS at taxpayers' expense. Please \nhear that--persons who should not even be in the country--who are here \nin violation of our laws--could receive treatment for AIDS at a current \naverage cost of $119,000 per person.\n  Without this legislation, illegal aliens will be permitted to remain \nin public housing for up to 18 months, even after they have been \nidentified and are determined to be ineligible for this taxpayer-funded \nassistance. An unconscionable result.\n  Without the provisions of this bill, immigrants who have become \ndependent on taxpayer-funded welfare will now be able to evade \ndeportation because of a previous court decisionmaking immigrants on \npublic assistance immune from deportation. This bill will clearly \ndefine the term ``public charge'' and make that important provision \nenforceable once again.\n\n  Without the provisions herein, illegal aliens will continue to \nreceive Social Security credit for performing unauthorized work in the \nUnited States. A startling result.\n  Without the procedures provided in the measure for verifying an \nimmigrant's eligibility for welfare, we will continue to have illegal \naliens who obtain welfare merely by claiming they are a U.S. citizen.\n  And, without the authorization provided in this bill, States will not \nhave the authority to establish their own verification systems in order \nto prevent illegal aliens from obtaining State and local welfare \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\n  Mr. President, the provisions in this bill were included in the \nillegal immigration bills that passed by overwhelming majorities in \nboth Houses of Congress. However, by holding the sword of a Government \nshutdown over the head of the Congress, President Clinton forced the \nSenate to delete these important provisions. This legislation will \nswiftly restore them.\n  Most immigrants are hard working and self-sufficient. Many of those \nwho do use welfare use it only because our laws and processes make it \navailable to them. If it is not available, they will continue to work \nhard, succeed, and obtain the American dream without welfare--just as \nimmigrants to this country have for most of our history.\n  However, this administration not only resists sensible controls on \nthe use of welfare by legal immigrants, it also insists on provisions \nthat will result in illegal aliens accessing the welfare system--for \nexample, by falsely claiming to be U.S. citizens. The American people \nshould be appalled by that.\n  Mr. President, the efforts of this administration to so dramatically \nchange a vital part of title V of the illegal immigration bill at the \nlast minute ill-serves the taxpayers of this country. Both its policies \nand its tactics are dead wrong. This bill will remedy that cunning \nmanipulation of the legislation process, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2193. A bill to establish a program for the disposition of donated \nprivate sector and United States Government nonlethal personal property \nneeded by eligible foreign countries; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n         THE U.S. VOLUNTARY AND MATERIAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce the ``United States \nVoluntary and Material Assistance Act of l996.''\n  This bill establishes a program for the voluntary transfer of \nnonlethal equipment and goods donated by the private sector and made \navailable as surplus personal property by Federal agencies. The \nrecipients of these donations are eligible foreign countries who make \nlegitimate requests through the program.\n  My bill combines the surpluses generated from our wealth, the innate \ngenerosity of the American people, our entrepreneurial dynamism, and \nour humanitarianism into a cost-effective program of public-private \nassistance to serve our foreign policy and commercial interests.\n  The bill I am introducing today would look to both Federal agencies \nand the private sector for donations of usable goods and equipment for \nshipment abroad. The disposition of surplus personal property from the \nFederal Government is managed and regulated under the Federal Property \nand Administrative Services Act of l949, and amendments thereto. The \nsystem of priorities that now exists for disposing surplus Federal \nproperty would not be altered by this new program. My bill would simply \nadd foreign recipients to the list of eligible domestic recipients. It \nwould place foreign countries at the end of the current pecking order \nof eligibility behind domestic claimants for receiving surplus Federal \nproperty.\n  U.S. private organizations and individuals presently donate surplus \nproperty to virtually any recipient they want. Many prefer to donate \ntheir goods to domestic groups or to private voluntary organizations. \nHowever some wish to ship their donated goods to foreign recipients. \nNothing in my proposed bill would mandate any change in the manner \nprivate sector organizations now donate their surplus properties. In \nfact, private organizations wishing to donate charitable goods abroad \nnow find the process difficult, time consuming, and expensive. This \nbill would make it easier, faster, and less costly to do so.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will bring benefits to many \nparticipants. It will provide us with another tool to conduct American \nforeign policy. It will benefit private enterprises such as businesses, \nfarms, associations, schools, and others who make charitable donations \nto the program. It will strengthen private voluntary groups and non-\ngovernmental organizations who receive and transfer donated items, and \nit will bring help to recipient countries and requesting organizations \nin those countries. The bill is, I believe, a winner for all parties \ninvolved.\n  If enacted, this bill would add another cost-effective tool for \ncarrying out U.S. foreign policy. It will help fill some of the gap \ncreated by the steady reductions in our official foreign assistance \nprogram.\n  My bill would provide donated equipment and goods at much lower costs \nthan official foreign assistance, thereby further reducing the burden \non American taxpayers. Because the goods are donated and not procured, \nbecause the shipping costs can be negotiated downward through \ncompetitive bidding, because the program requires very little \nmanagement and bureaucratic infrastructure, and because it will rely \nheavily on volunteers and nongovernmental organizations, the cost of \nproviding foreign assistance will be significantly reduced.\n  Mr. President, some small-scale model programs now providing donated \nhumanitarian goods abroad claim they provide more than ten dollars' \nworth of items for every one dollar invested. In cases where \ntransportation costs are low and the value of the donated goods are \nhigh, there can be a better than 100 to 1 ratio in the value of \ndonations supplied to the cost of the program.\n  In addition to the cost effectiveness, this program inspires and \nreinforces the generosity and volunteer spirit of the American people. \nIt encourages extensive grassroots involvement to make the program a \nsuccess.\n  There are numerous private groups and individuals already lending \nvoluntary assistance overseas. Many are supported by the Federal \nGovernment, others operate on their own funds or with funds privately \nraised. A modestly funded program providing humanitarian assistance to \nthe Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, for example, \ninvolves charitable contributions and shipments of donated goods from \nmore than 700 cities in all 50 States and from virtually every \ncongressional district. Thousands of American citizens willing to give \nof their time, talents, and resources make this program work. The \nprogram I am proposing will involve less bureaucracy, less redtape, \nless funding, and more voluntarism. Because of this, spare equipment \nand disposable goods can be provided more quickly and at lower costs \nthan traditional official foreign assistance.\n\n  Participation in international assistance efforts by the private \nsector is generally limited to collecting and making donations or \npreparing goods for shipment. My bill seeks to expand and strengthen \ntheir participation by creating a viable second track for assistance \nalongside the government-to-government track.\n  While overall responsibility for management of the program will \nreside with a program coordinator in the Department of State, several \nprovisions in my bill strengthen and encourage the role of the private \nsector. The coordinator is authorized to enlist the services of private \norganizations and voluntary organizations to collaborate in all phases \nof the program. Finally, the bill enhances the role of private \norganizations and voluntary groups by authorizing their involvement in \nidentifying and verifying requests from abroad, receiving donations, \nand distributing and monitoring items once they are delivered.\n  Donations of excess goods to eligible countries can bring many \ntangible and nontangible benefits to American business. Many American \nfirms already donate large quantities of usable medical, agricultural, \neducational, pharmaceutical, and other equipment and consumables to \nforeign countries. This is testimony to the generosity and pragmatism \nof American business.\n  The practicality of donating surplus goods is extensive. Apart from \nthe positive public relations that voluntary donations can bring, the \ndisposal of surplus goods can reap other concrete advantages for \nAmerican business. Donations of goods can help open valuable storage \nspace and reduce related costs for both the Federal Government and \nprivate donors who wish to upgrade, restructure, or reinventory their \nstocks of equipment and products. It can generate financial benefits to \nprivate businesses by reducing tax liabilities derived from charitable \ndonations not fully depreciated.\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\n  American businesses can also enjoy market advantages by making \ndonations to countries where they have little or no market presence. \nThis can be a considerable advantage for companies wishing to establish \nan international market presence, to learn about foreign markets, \nestablish or expand business networks, or generate interest in their \nproducts. Acts of good will can have a self-serving motive.\n  Let me spell out some of the major features of this bill. First, my \nbill would establish a program coordinator in the Department of State \nwho would be responsible for the overall management of the program. The \ncoordinator will be more than a recycler of surplus property. He will \nhave the responsibility for responding to legitimate requests from \nabroad by developing a system for identifying, receiving, and shipping \ndonations. He will be charged with overseeing the receipt, \nclassification, storage, shipment, and use of donated properties to the \nprogram. Finally, he will be charged with ensuring quality control of \nthe donations and surplus properties so that the program does not \nbecome a repository for unwanted goods. He would be charged with \nassisting private voluntary organizations and nongovernmental \norganizations in the implementation of the program.\n  My bill will permit only non-lethal property donations or surplus \nitems under the program. No item designed for military, religious, or \npolitical use will be allowed.\n  The program will not generate needs but would attempt to satisfy \nthose requests which have been authenticated through our overseas \nmissions, Peace Corps, or private voluntary organizations. The search \nfor usable items in the United States will take place only after the \ncoordinator has received a legitimate request from abroad and entered \nit into the program. Once identified, a donation must be certified as \nacceptable for their intended use. This program must not and will not \nbe an outlet for damaged goods which only add to the cost of \nthe program and undermine its objectives.\n\n  In addition to quality assurances, the bill requires that the \ncoordinator develop a policy to ensure that the donations and Federal \nsurpluses be used, operated, and maintained by the recipient in a \nmanner that was intended when requested and transferred.\n  Only those countries now eligible for U.S. foreign assistance can \nparticipate. Additional requirements to enhance the integrity of the \nprogram are built into the program. The transferred items cannot be \nresold for profit by or in the recipient country and no transfer will \nbe permitted to countries which impose special import duties on the \ndonated properties.\n  The bill suggests that the President and the coordinator test the \nefficacy of the program in pilot programs in sub-Saharan Africa. While \nthere are needs around the world, the needs of sub-Saharan Africa \ncountries are most serious and extensive. It is my hope that a \nsignificant effort can be devoted to this underdeveloped region of the \nworld.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a modest appropriations for fiscal years \nl997 and l998 of $20 and $25 million respectively. These funds will be \nused to establish the program, and pay for personnel, related \ninfrastructure, and transportation costs involved in shipping donations \nabroad.\n  I hope the United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Act of \nl996 will draw the support of the U.S. Senate and the Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2194. A bill to provide the public with access to quality \noutfitter and guide services on Federal lands, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE OUTFITTER AND GUIDE POLICY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation \nto provide the public with access to high quality outfitter and guide \nservices on Federal lands.\n  The public served are visitors to the remote and challenging \nbackcountry of our national forests, public lands, wildlife refuges, \nnational parks, and in a dew instances, lands managed by the Bureau of \nReclamation. Many people lack the skills, equipment, and experience to \nvisit the rugged areas found on our public lands. They depend upon the \nservices of professional outfitters and guides for traveling into these \nareas, for their comfort and safety, and for gaining the memorable \nexperiences that keep millions of people returning to these special \nplaces each year.\n  The 374 small outiftter and guide businesses spread across my State \nof Idaho are stable businesses and substantial contributors to Idaho's \neconomy. The total gross economic effect attributed to outfitting and \nguiding activities in Idaho is in excess of $100 million annually, \nbenefiting many local motels, restaurants, retail stores, and a \nbackcountry transportation network of charter air and bus companies.\n  Because Idaho is a prime destination for American and international \nvisitors, the typical Idaho outfitter does reasonably well in his or \nher business, with a net return of 10 percent of gross revenue, \naccording to a study in 1993 by the University of Idaho's Department of \nResource Recreation and Tourism.\n  Nationally, the statistics are not as rosy. Studies indicate the \noutfitter and guide industry as a whole expect to net only 4.1 percent \nof their gross revenue. Nonetheless, these outfitter and guide services \nwill attract a significant economic benefit--new money, if you will--to \nthe rural communities and counties in which they operate.\n  With the exception of concessioner law governing hospitality services \nat national parks, this Congress has never addressed the practices of \nthe outfitter and guide industry and the needs of the millions of \nvisitors who use these services on Federal lands.\n  The outfitter and guide industry is a multifaceted venture. Idaho's \ncowboys are such an integral part of our culture that it's difficult to \nestablish a date upon which they became part of the recreation \nindustry. Idaho's whitewater industry traces back as an offshoot of \nsurplus World War II rafts and has enjoyed booming growth since the end \nof the 1940's. Alongside these activities has developed a complex \noffering of hunting, fishing, hiking, llama packing, photography tours, \noutdoor skills training--anything needed to whet the appetite and meet \nthe expectations of visitors to our State.\n  It wasn't until 1982 that the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement established a formal policy for the issuance and \nadministration of outfitter and guide special use permits. But Bureau \nof Reclamation has only this year begun to develop such a policy with \nno input whatsoever from this Congress.\n\n  Most outfitters will tell you that they have an excellent \nrelationship with their agency partners. There is a clear emphasis in \nthis partnership on high quality service to the public, resource \nprotection and a fair return to the government for the opportunity of \ndoing business on public lands.\n  Over the past 4 years, however, an increasing number of outfitters \nand guides have witnessed steady deterioration of this professional \nrelationship. That deterioration is occurring at the field level, \nundoubtedly as a consequence of agency reorganization, down-sizing, \nbudget restraints, and decentralization of policy review. Individual \nproblems are difficult to address in formal administrative procedures, \nbecause Congress has never created the fundamental principles to guide \nthis relationship.\n  Outfitters in my State also believe--and they make a credible case--\nthat there is an alarming surge of bias against commercial operations \nin congressionally designated wilderness and other backcountry \nmanagement areas. As guiding services are eliminated or reduced in \nthese areas, so go the opportunities for our own citizens and our \ninternational visitors to experience the American West in a manner \nreminiscent of the way Jim Bridger and Lewis and Clark once saw it.\n  I am introducing legislation today to address this deficiency. I am \nintroducing this legislation so a discussion can begin on an outfitter \nand guide policy. I will pursue a policy in the coming Congress.\n  This bill begins a process of setting in place clear policy for \nagency managers to provide access to the Federal lands for that segment \nof the public that needs or desires the services of outfitters and \nguides. It expresses the intent of this Congress that those needs will \nbe met through competition in the quality of services offered to the \npublic, through responsible resource protection, and through a fair fee \nto the government.\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\n  This bill also raises the bar and sets a higher standard for \noutfitter and guide performance in the next century. We want and need \ntheir investment in the training and equipment and facilities required \nby the public to visit backcountry. That's not a job the agencies can \nor should be doing.\n  If outfitters are living up to their commitment to the public, their \ninvestment should be secured and good service rewarded by performance-\nbased renewal of a right to operate.\n  But I think Congress has been very clear in debating proposed \nconcessions policy reform that satisfactory is just no longer good \nenough. Congress needs to give the agencies a clear signal that the bad \nand the mediocre are to be removed from a system upon which the \nAmerican public relies for its use and enjoyment of recreation \nresources.\n  Over the past 4 years, my colleague from Utah and my colleague from \nArkansas have grappled with the unique and sometimes peculiar details \nof the outfitter and guide industry. Similarly my colleague from \nAlaska, who is also the author of concessions policy legislation, is \nvery knowledgeable of the very large outfitter and guide industry in \nhis State.\n  I would hope that in the next Congress we can combine our efforts to \nmeet the needs of a public who confront a very diverse choice of \nrecreation opportunities on Federal lands. I am convinced that we err \nin attempting to squeeze these diverse operations into the same mold. \nThere is a uniqueness in the outfitters and guide industry that \ndeserves to be addressed separately.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that my introduction of outfitter and \nguide legislation is not solely a reaction to their efforts. The \npossibility of this legislation has been a point of discussion among \nIdaho outfitters and myself for over 2 years.\n  In the meantime, the hunch that the agency relationship was \ndisintegrating has become a reality. Some far-ranging problems have \nbeen developing and have taken on clarity for an industry that is \ncritically important to the economy of my State and most other Western \nStates. We were perhaps short-sighted in not addressing the overall \nstructure and operations of this industry in a more formal fashion at \nthe beginning of this decade.\n  I look forward in the coming months to detailed discussions of the \nsteps to be taken in correcting these problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 2195.

Mr. President, I introduce the Human Tissues Safety \nAct of 1996. I want to acknowledge at this time the hard work and \ncosponsorship of my colleagues, Senators Dodd and Simon, who have acted \ntirelessly in crafting this legislation which I believe enjoys broad \nsupport throughout the industry, and which offers patients receiving \ntransplanted human tissues substantial new safety protection and \nassurance of quality.\n  This bill addresses regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of \nhuman tissue, including cells grown from a patient's own tissue, for \ntransplantation. The bill also addresses the regulation of stem cells \nobtained from umbilical cord blood, which involves similar issues.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that human tissue is \nregulated in a manner that ensures its safety, while allowing efficacy \nto be demonstrated through the use of patient outcome registries rather \nthan premarket approval mechanisms that would impede patient access and \nburden the development of important new tissue repair therapies.\n  Mr. President, I find it shocking that FDA does not even have a list \nof the hundreds of tissue banks in this country that process human \ntissue from cadavers. Without such a list, FDA cannot send inspectors \nto these tissue banks to ensure that they comply with the Agency's \ninfectious disease screening requirements. We should not wait until a \nchild get AIDS from infected tissue to empower FDA to ensure compliance \nwith its infectious disease screening requirements.\n  At the same time, our bill would create reduced regulation for the \nsafest type of human tissue--human cells that are taken from a patient \nbiopsy, grown in cell culture, and then reimplanted into the same \npatient to repair or replace similar tissue. This type of tissue, known \nas autologous tissue, presents no risk of infectious disease. Although \nautologous tissue has historically been unregulated, both in the U.S. \nand throughout the world, the FDA recently announced that it would \nbegin requiring premarket approval for this class of tissue in December \n1997.\n  The FDA's policies for allogeneic, that is, from a donor source, and \nautologous, that is, from the same patient, tissue are inconsistent \nwith the concept of regulating products based on risk. For instance, \ncartilage that is obtained from a cadaver presents a number of risks--\ninfectious disease, rejection by the patient's body, graft-versus-host \ndisease, and the risks associated with using immunosuppressive drugs--\nbut is not subject to premarket approval. It does not make sense to \nrequire premarket approval for a patient's own cartilage, when \nalternative, and more risky, sources of cartilage are essentially \nunregulated.\n  This bill approaches this field from a very different perspective. We \nbegin with a recognition that transplantation of human tissue, whether \nallogeneic or autologous, has been an unregulated practice of medicine \nfor over thirty year. During this time, the major problems with tissue \nand, for that matter, organ transplantation have been, first, the risk \nof infectious disease and, second, the lack of enough donated tissues \nand organs for all the patients who need them. There has never been any \ndemonstrated need for a premarket approval mechanism for tissue \ntransplantation. Indeed, the lack of premarket approval has permitted \nrapid progress to occur in this field, along with faster patient access \nto important new therapies.\n  This bill also recognizes that human cells and tissues are not drugs, \nbiological products, or medical devices, and that it is inappropriate \nto regulate them as if they were. Drugs may be toxic or carcinogenic, \nwhile tissue is not. Drugs circulate in the bloodstream and have \nsystemic effects, while tissue is typically transplanted into a \nlocalized area and does not circulate in the blood. For these, and many \nother reasons, tissue is generally less risky than the products that \nFDA traditionally regulates. The results of transplantation generally \nare much more predictable than are the effects of a synthetic chemical. \nIt does not make sense to regulate human tissue under a regulatory \nregime designed for vastly different products. Nor does it make sense \nto regulate autologous tissue more stringently than allogeneic tissue.\n  We also recognize that, unlike the patented products that FDA \nregulates, human tissue transplantation typically involves \nnonproprietary substances, such as heart valves, bone marrow, corneas, \nand ligaments. As a result, it's difficult for physicians, tissue \nbanks, and biotechnology companies that develop new ways to use tissue \nto financially justify the expenditures associated with meeting \npremarket approval requirements. It is unclear, for instance, that bone \nmarrow transplantation would have been developed had FDA required \npremarket approval for this technology. And, indeed, when FDA decided \nto require premarket approval for human heart valves, two of the four \ntissue banks that supplied these heart valves to surgeons went out of \nbusiness.\n  The bottom line is that FDA's plan to regulate many types of human \ntissue as if they were drugs, and to regulate autologous tissue more \nstringently than allogeneic tissue, is an exercise of trying to fit \nsquare pegs in round holes. It will significantly increase the costs of \ndeveloping new tissue repair therapies, while delaying patient access \nfor years.\n  This bill also addresses the regulation of umbilical cord blood, a \nrelated field with tremendous medical promise. Until recently, a baby's \numbilical cord was considered to be a disposable medical waste. Now we \nknow that umbilical cord blood is a rich source of stem cells, which \nlike bone marrow can be used in transplantation to treat childhood \nleukemia and other cancers. In\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\nfact, cord blood stem cells are even better than bone marrow stem cells \nbecause cord blood cells require less precise donor matching than bone \nmarrow cells.\n  Bone marrow transplantation has been essentially unregulated for the \npast 30 years, and during that time the principal problem has not been \na lack of safety or efficacy, but a lack of bone marrow. Only about 10 \npercent of transplant candidates are able to obtain a donor match in \ntime to save their lives. So cord blood transplantation is an exciting \nand potentially lifesaving new development.\n  Unfortunately, while bone marrow transplantation was developed at a \ntime when FDA did not feel the need to subject every new therapy to \npremarket approval, cord blood transplantation was not. As in the case \nof autologous cell therapies, FDA is proposing to regulate cord blood \ntransplantation as if it were a drug, significantly hindering the \ndevelopment of this new therapy.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not answer all of the questions. For \nexample, I believe that when we take up this legislation at the \nbeginning of the next Congress we must address issues including \nsafeguarding the confidentiality of proprietary company and patient \ninformation likely to be recorded during the registry process. Also, \noversight will be needed to ensure that if and when FDA implements this \nprocess, an overriding theme drives the regulatory exercise . . . that \nbeing that the rigor of the FDA's requirements match, but not exceed, \nthe degree of manipulation a particular human tissue product undergoes.\n  This is an exciting and potentially very important new field of \nbiomedical research. It is my intention to focus on this issue early in \nthe next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Bradley):\n  S. 2196. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the birth of Thomas \nAlva Edison, to redesign the half dollar circulating coin for 1997 to \ncommemorate Thomas Edison, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     the thomas alva edison sesquicentennial commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senators Bradley, \nLevin, and myself, to submit a resolution that would direct the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint coins in 1997 commemorating the 150th \nanniversary of Thomas Alva Edison's birth.\n  The genius behind more than 1,300 inventions, including the \nincandescent light bulb, the alkaline battery, the phonograph and \nmotion pictures, Edison was awarded the Congressional gold medal in \n1928 ``for development and application of inventions that have \nrevolutionized civilization in the last century.'' We have the \nopportunity to again honor one of the world's greatest inventors by \nissuing both commemorative and circulating coins with Mr. Edison's \nlikeness.\n  Mr. President, not only would these coins honor the memory of Thomas \nEdison, they would also raise revenue to support organizations that \npreserve his legacy. The two New Jersey Edison sites, the ``invention \nfactory'' in West Orange, NJ, and the Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, \nNJ, are both in poor condition. Irreplaceable records and priceless \nmemorabilia are in danger of being destroyed because of leaky roofs, \ndefective electrical systems and faulty sprinkler systems. The profits \nraised from surcharges on the commemorative coins would provide funds \nto repair and preserve these and five other historical Edison sites \nacross the country and to expand educational programs that teach us \nabout this great American.\n  Let me emphasize that this legislation would have no net cost to the \nGovernment. In fact, because circulating coins are a source of \nGovernment revenue known as seigniorage, this bill will reduce \nGovernment borrowing requirements, thereby lowering the annual interest \npayments on the national debt. An Edison commemorative coin program \nalso has strong support among America's numismatists whose interest is \ncrucial to the success of any coin program.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this legislation at the end of the 104th \nCongress with the expectation that it will be reintroduced in the next \nCongress and passed next year during the sesquicentennial of the birth \nof Thomas Alva Edison. This legislation would honor a great American \ninventor, it would provide seigniorage to the Treasury to help service \nthe national debt, it is popular among coin collectors, and it would \nprovide sorely needed funds to important historical sites.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Thomas Alva Edison \n     Sesquicentennial Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary American and New Jerseyan. A hero of the imagination \nwhose ingenuity and continuing output of technology profoundly changed \nthe lives of people throughout the world. A genius who set a standard \nfor American inventiveness that has keyed our progress as a nation.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure in my final floor statement \nto join my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, in \nintroducing the Thomas A. Edison Commemorative Coin Act.\n  In the spring of 1876, the young Thomas Alva Edison, not yet 30 years \nold, moved 15 of his workers to the small town of Menlo Park, NJ. This \nyoung man, who had decided to go into the ``invention business,'' did \nnot see inventions as strokes of luck. Rather, Edison believed that \ninventions were the products of dedicated work and purpose.\n  Mr. President, before he had reached 21 years of age, Edison was \ngranted his first patent for a telegraphic vote-recording machine. He \nhad developed this machine while he was reporting the votes of Congress \nover the press wires from his job as a telegraph operator. With this \ninvention, at each rollcall Members of Congress would simply press a \nbutton at their seats, immediately registering the vote at the \nSpeaker's desk, where votes were counted automatically. Already at this \nearly age, Edison showed that he was ahead of his time. In response to \nhis invention, the House declared that it was not ready for automated \nvoting, and the Senate today continues to go by voice vote. For this, \nat the very least, it is suitable that Congress recognize Thomas \nEdison.\n  At Menlo Park, Edison developed a string of remarkable new \ntechnologies that would shape human history. In 1876 he was \ninstrumental in improving the telephone to reach marketability. In \n1877, Edison sang ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' and played it back to his \nastonished workers, having invented the first ``talking machine,'' or \nphonograph. On New Years' Eve in 1880, Edison illuminated Menlo Park at \nnight with forty incandescent light bulbs, which he had developed 1 \nyear earlier. In 1883, he extended the use of electricity to develop an \nelectric railway that soon became the basis of an electric street car \nsystem. In 1891, he produced a Kinetoscope and 35 mm film using \ncelluloid, two products which were the predecessors of all later \nmotion-picture machines and film.\n  Despite his achievements, Edison was a man who held that there was no \nsuch thing as genius, and his many failed trials and efforts inspired \nhim to say that his success was ``99 percent perspiration and 1 percent \ninspiration.'' For Thomas Edison, inventing was a passion, and he \ndemanded as much from those who worked with him.\n  In authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Mint to \nproduce a commemorative coin in his memory, it is my hope that we will \nnever forget to acknowledge Edison's contributions and inventive \nspirit. Once the costs of the production of the coin are recovered, \nproceeds from the sale of this coin will fund the renovation and upkeep \nof seven sites in five different States dedicated to preserving \nEdison's work, including the Invention Factory in West Orange, NJ, and \nthe Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, NJ.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the Wizard of \nMenlo Park, whose inventions had a scope and effect which are truly \nawe-inspiring.

JAMES E. FORREST, SC, USN (RET)\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor my friend, \nRear Adm. Jim Forrest. He is an outstanding American, an exemplary \nnaval officer, and a man who has made a very significant contribution \nto the development of our national defense.\n  Over the years, the U.S. Senate has paid tribute to many people for \ntheir commitment to making this country great. Most of those so honored \nhave in common with Admiral Forrest an extraordinary sense of \ndedication, the ability to marshall people and resources toward a \ncommon goal, and the good judgement to know what course of action to \ntake in a given situation. Very few of them however, can match Admiral \nForrest's record of consistent outstanding public service spanning 56 \nyears. For many of us on Capitol Hill, Admiral Forrest was already an \ninfluential force and source of excellent advice when we arrived. Over \nthe years I have greatly appreciated his knowledge on defense matters \nand his wise counsel.\n  As Admiral Forrest prepares to retire as executive director of the \nNaval Reserve Association, a position that he has held for the past 22 \nyears, he should be proud that he has established a bench mark for \nexcellence for others in the Navy to follow. As you can see, his \naccomplishments speak for themselves. A native of Palms, CA, Admiral \nForrest enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and served on the battleships \nTennessee and Wyoming and the fleet oiler Cuyama, before earning an \nappointment to the Naval Academy in 1942. Following his commissioning \nin June 1945, he commanded three auxiliary motor minesweepers before \ntransferring to the Supply Corps in l948. Admiral Forrest was selected \nfor flag rank in 1971 and served for 3 years as the Auditor General of \nthe Navy. His academic achievements include obtaining an MBA from \nStanford University and graduating from the Navy Postgraduate School \nand the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S12325]]\n\n  Upon his retirement from active duty in 1975, Admiral Forrest \naccepted the many challenges associated with the position of executive \ndirector of the Naval Reserve Association, where he made many important \ncontributions to the Naval Reserve, the Navy, and our national defense. \nMost importantly, through his personal interaction with national \nleaders, Admiral Forrest brought about an increase in mutual trust and \nimproved coordination between the Reserve and Active components of the \nNavy. He also increased the readiness of the Naval Reserve. In \naddition, long before we had promoted quality of life issues, Admiral \nForest was one of the most active proponents of adequate pay and \nbenefits for Active and Reserve military personnel and their \ndependents. If there was a need, he identified it and worked to fill \nthe void. If there was a problem, he recognized it early, proposed the \nsolutions, and worked toward resolution. In short, if I had only one \nword to sum up his actions over the past 56 years, it would be \nleadership. As a nation, we owe Adm. Jim Forrest a great deal for his \ncontribution. I know I speak for the entire U.S. Senate when I say \nthank you, Admiral, for a job ``extremely well done!'' To my friend, \nJim Forrest, who is truly a great American, ``Fair winds and following \nseas!

Mr. President, it was my great fortune to be \nassigned to the Committee on Appropriations relatively early in my \nfirst term in the Senate. It is through that Committee that I have been \nable to serve my State in a way that I believe has contributed \nmeasurably to an improvement in the economic quality of life for the \npeople of Louisiana.\n  As I began my second full term in the Senate, I had the added good \nfortune of taking over the reins of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nPublic Works, as it was known at the time, from a wonderful man who \ntaught me so much about the Senate, the late and beloved Senator John \nStennis of Mississippi. When I fell heir to that chairmanship, I also \ninherited the services of the longtime staff director of the \nsubcommittee, Proctor Jones. It is of Proctor and his service to the \nSenate and his country that I wish to speak today.\n  Every now and then in this body, someone of the thousands of loyal \nstaff who toil for us and our constituents achieves an elevated status \namong Senators and staff colleagues. I think few would deny that \nProctor has long since reached that plateau.\n  Proctor Jones came to this body in 1960, and, aside from 4 years of \nservice as a proud Marine, he has served here continuously since that \ntime. He has seen and participated in more of the sweep of politics and \npublic policy than most of us can imagine, and along the way he has \namassed an unrivaled knowledge of the legislative process and a nearly \nunmatched institutional memory.\n  Members in both Houses and on both sides of the aisle know they can \nturn to Proctor for advice and assistance with absolute confidence that \ntheir requests will be treated fairly and respectfully. They also know \nthat he gets results. Proctor's broad and detailed knowledge of his \nappropriation areas helps account for his uncanny ability to find the \nmeans, even when none appears available, to achieve the legislative \ngoals that we set.\n  While such knowledge gives Proctor authority, he would never think of \nabusing the great powers we entrust to him. He is a man who loves and \ncherishes the institutions of Government and who is guided by the fine \nGeorgia code of honor he learned from his early mentor, the late \nSenator Richard Russell, the giant whom Proctor served early in his \nSenate career.\n  If anything, Proctor is self-deprecating and deferential to a fault: \nas he is fond of saying, ``I just work here, I don't vote. And I love \nmy job.'' He has indeed loved his job and has performed his duties in a \nway that has made a profound difference in those areas covered under \nour Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee. He has \nalways understood that we have a serious obligation to protect and \nimprove the country's physical infrastructure and to support and \nnurture the Nation's scientific brain trust at the national \nlaboratories and throughout the Federal Government. Uninformed critics \nhave sometimes derided those vital responsibilities as pork or \nmisplaced priorities, but I firmly believe that Proctor's vision and \ndedication have contributed mightily to the security and strength of \nthis country.\n  Proctor has also become my valued personal friend, owing in large \nmeasure to his infectious enthusiasm for everything in life from opera, \nto travel, to sports, to hiking and joyous gatherings of friends and \nfamily. As I conclude my service in the Senate, I want Proctor and his \nfamily to know that I speak for my colleagues, past and present, in \nsaying thanks for a job done well and as no one else could have done \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12325-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12325-S12326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      APPROPRIATIONS IMPORTANT TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ABUSE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are a few matters contained \nwithin the omnibus appropriations bill that I would like to highlight. \nIn the overall context of a multibillion dollar bill, these may not be \nsignificant to some, but they are to me and to the people of Vermont.\n  First, I note that we have been able to include an amendment to the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act that doubles the amount \nthat Vermont and other small States will receive annually. This change \ncompletes the increase that we have been trying to accomplish since \nenactment of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \nto provide small States with $400,000 a year in Federal funding for \nfamily violence prevention programs. It is appropriate that in October, \nwhich is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we finally \nconclude this amendment.\n  Domestic violence remains the leading cause of violent death in \nVermont. Over 50 percent of homicides in the State last year reportedly \narose from domestic violence situations--and this is down from the \npercentages in prior years. Also contained in the omnibus \nappropriations bill is legislation making conviction of a crime of \ndomestic violence a disqualification from gun ownership. Too many women \nand children are threatened by domestic violence and too many become \nvictims of that violence.\n  I commend the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual \nAssault, the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services, and all of the \nlocal community organizations that work so hard and provide such \nessential services to those at risk of domestic and family violence. I \nnote that Vermont established its own statewide domestic violence \nhotline and sexual abuse hotline almost a year before the national \nhotline was finally created this spring. I expect that Vermont will \nalso lead the country in terms of developing services and programs to \nconfront the problems of rural domestic violence.\n\n  We were also able to increase funding for the Violence Against Women \nAct programming to $197.5 million this year. Because of Vermont's \noutstanding advocates and programs, ours was the first State to receive \na VAWA grant 2 years ago and I am confident that Vermont will remain on \nthe leading edge in these important programs. This year Vermont \nreceived over $700,000 for VAWA programming.\n  We have also been able to protect the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act programs that sends important funding to \nVermont and other States to assist in efforts to prevent crime and \ndelinquency. I want to thank, in particular, Ken Schatz and the Vermont \nChildren and Family Council for Prevention Programs and Shirley Martin, \nVermont's JJDP Specialist, for their help in working to protect and \npreserve the Juvenile Justice Program and avoid the loss of as much as \n$187,500 from the nearly $800,000 that Vermont receives annually. \nVermont could not afford the loss of such Federal assistance. In the \nomnibus appropriations bill, we were able to include $170 million for \nnational juvenile justice programming this year, which is a significant \nincrease from last year.\n  Finally, we were able to include in the appropriations bill is a much \nneeded adjustment to the Victims of Crime Act to extend for an \nadditional year the time in which the State and victim assistance \ngrantees may retain and use\n\n[[Page S12326]]\n\ngrants from the Federal Crime Victims Fund. This is important in years \nin which collections of fines and penalties at the Federal level are \nexceptionally large, as they were this past year. Through this \namendment we are trying to ensure that State grants from the crime \nvictims fund can be used wisely over a more extended period of time. \nThis amendment will augment the increase in the minimum victim \nassistance grant to small States from $200,000 to $500,000 per year \nthat I was able to include in the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, \nwhich passed earlier this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12325-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEDICATION OF SHIRLEY L. MILLER PAVILION\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on October 5, 1996, the Children's \nCancer Caring Center will dedicate the Shirley L. Miller Pavilion at \nthe prestigious Cleveland Clinic of Broward County, FL. The pavilion \nwill house facilities used by the Clinic to treat its hundreds of young \noutpatients. Mr. President, it is fitting that this pavilion \nmemorialize the good name and extraordinary life of Shirley L. Miller \nof Miami, FL who passed away on September 24, 1996.\n  Shirley L. Miller, along with her close friends, Lee Klein and Erma \nPodvin, have been deeply involved in providing medical care to children \nwith cancer for 35 years. The Children's Cancer Caring Center, of which \nShirley was a cofounder and vice president, provides totally free \ncancer treatment for hundreds of children from Florida and elsewhere. \nIn addition to medical treatment, the caring center provides ancillary \nservices--counseling, special events, and an overnight summer camp--to \nafflicted children and their families. Beyond donating thousands of \nvolunteer hours, Shirley and her colleagues have raised tens of \nmillions of dollars to support their efforts over the years.\n  Mr. President, Shirley L. Miller represents what is great in America. \nHer dear friend and president of the caring center, Lee Klein, called \nher ``a beautiful gift to the thousands of children who confronted this \ndisease and whose lives she touched.'' Shirley L. Miller was a great \ncredit to her community and her family, including her husband of 46 \nyears, Irving, and her brother, Samuel Levine, and sister, Gloria \nBerger. Her children, Roger Miller, Sherri Gersten, Miki Goldstein, \nRenee Simmons, and Cary Caster, and her 13 grandchildren, have much to \nbe proud of. She received numerous awards in recognition of her civic \nactivities on behalf of Mount Sinai Medical Center, Hebrew Academy, the \nGreater Miami Jewish Federation, the Girl Scouts of America, the \nNational Council of Jewish Women, Temple Beth Shalom of Miami Beach, \nand the Youth Orchestra of Florida. Her son, Roger, explained ``She was \na woman who spent so many waking hours helping others less fortunate \nthan she.''\n  Mr. President, although the Shirley L. Miller Pavilion at the \nCleveland Clinic in Broward County will serve to memorialize her name, \nthe lifetime of unlimited caring Shirley L. Miller provided to \nthousands of children and their families will be our greatest monument \nto this extraordinary woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12326-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12326-S12327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE STAFF OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress and my own \ntenure in the Senate draw to a close, I want to take this opportunity \nto thank and pay tribute to my staff on the Senate Special Committee on \nAging for their fine work, dedicated service, and exemplary commitment \nto the needs of our Nation's elderly.\n  I have had the privilege of serving as a member of the Aging \nCommittee since first coming to the Senate, after having served on the \nHouse Aging Committee for many years. In 1991, I assumed the position \nof ranking Republican member on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, \nafter the sudden and tragic death of John Heinz, our beloved friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania. He left us long before his contributions \nwere fully credited and before his mission could be completed. It was \ndaunting indeed to follow in the footsteps of John Heinz, who was \nlegendary in his advocacy on behalf of our Nation's senior citizens.\n  In 1995, I succeeded another giant in the field of aging issues, \nSenator David Pryor, as chairman of the committee. Senator Pryor has \nbeen an indefatigable leader on issues affecting the quality of life \nfor our seniors and protecting them from all forms of exploitation. \nDavid has decided to retire from the Senate, but the high standard of \nexcellence that he set throughout his years as a Congressman, Governor, \nand Senator will be remembered with great fondness and gratitude by \nthose who have been honored to serve with him, and by those who were so \nhonorably served by him.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that in these last 5 years the Aging \nCommittee has had a strong record of achievement, thanks in large part \nto my highly dedicated and talented committee staff. The committee has \nbrought many problems now facing our Nation's elderly to the attention \nof the Congress, policy makers, and the public. It has provoked public \ndebate and has proposed solutions on how our Government programs can \nbetter serve the elderly and disabled.\n  For example, the committee has examined a host of issues relating to \nMedicare and Medicaid. It has examined how managed care trends will \naffect the elderly and disabled populations, and how some Medicare \nHMO's have given poor quality and service to Medicare enrollees. We \nhave reviewed the Medicare hotline and the level of service provided by \nthe Medicare program itself to enrollees. The committee has identified \nhow those with Alzheimer's disease and other chronic conditions of \naging often fall through the cracks of our health care system, and how \nwe should rethink our programs to provide more integrated care.\n  The committee has placed strong emphasis on the long-term care needs \nof our Nation's elderly and disabled, recommending ways to protect the \nrights of nursing home residents and offering proposals on how to help \nfamilies prepare for the crushing financial burden of long-term care.\n  The committee has held hearings on the mental health needs of older \nAmericans and heard riveting testimony on the once taboo subject of \nsuicide among the elderly. Our hearings have cast a bright spotlight on \nthe high prescription drug costs facing older Americans and how, \ntragically, some older Americans face the Hobson's choice of whether to \nbuy food or medicine, because they simply cannot afford both.\n  As has been the long tradition of the Aging Committee, we have \nexercised an active investigative agenda, focusing on how senior \ncitizens are often prime targets of scams and con artists. Our \ninvestigations have revealed how some health care providers manipulate \nthe system to siphon off as much as $100 billion a year from our health \ncare system. We have heard sobering testimony from perpetrators on how \neasy it is to rip off the health care system and the taxpayers. Major \nreforms have been now signed into law to crack down against these \nabuse, in large part due to the investigations and recommendations from \nthe Aging Committee.\n  We have investigated telemarketer who offer prize giveaway, contests, \ninvestment schemes and other promises of gold to trusting senior \ncitizens. Tragically, these scams have resulted in many seniors losing \nthousands of dollars, and often their entire retirement savings.\n  The committee has devoted much attention to the unfettered growth of \nthe Social Security disability program and how this program suffers \nfrom management deficiencies, fraud and abuse, and far too little \noversight. We have provoked important public debate on problems in our \nFederal disability programs and have stressed the need to start facing \nhead on the problems posed by the future insolvency of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds.\n  While this is but a taste of the entire record of the Aging \nCommittee's activities over the past 5 years, it gives a flavor of how \nthis committee has alerted the Congress and the public to the needs of \nour aging population.\n  I want to pay special tribute to my staff on the Aging Committee who \nhave played a major role in each of these committee efforts.\n  Since 1991, my Aging Committee staff has been under the able \ndirection of Mary Gerwin, who has been the driving\n\n[[Page S12327]]\n\nforce behind the issues we have reviewed and who has shaped many of the \nlegislative proposals we made as a result of our investigative and \noversight efforts.\n  I also want to recognize the fine work and dedication of deputy staff \ndirector Priscilla Hobson Hanley; chief investigator Helen Albert; \nprofessional staff member Victoria Blatter; professional staff member \nLiz Liess; committee chief clerk Sally Ehrenfried; systems \nadministrator Beth Watson; research assistants Lance Wain and Lindsey \nLedwin; staff assistants Karina Lynch, Wendy Moltrup; and Myrna Webb; \nand GPO printer Joyce Ward. I extend my gratitude to these and all of \nthe many committee staff, both past and present, who have contributed \ngreatly to the mission of the committee.\n  I also want to recognize the fine work of Kathryn Gest, my press \nsecretary and Mike Townsend, committee press secretary, for their \nexcellent work in promoting the work of the Aging Committee.\n  Mr. President, the Aging Committee is perhaps unique among \ncongressional committee due to its strong bipartisan cooperation. I \nwant to congratulate and thank Senator Pryor's dedicated staff on the \ncommittee for their many years of service to both the Senate and our \nsenior citizens.\n  As I retire from the Senate, my staff will disperse to seek new \nopportunities and to make their contributions to the Nation in other \nways. I wish them well and am deeply indebted to them for their \nservice. The Senate Special Committee on Aging serves a very special \npurpose for the Congress and the Nation--and my staff on that committee \nhas been very special indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12326-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FLOW CONTROL LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the U.S. Congress has failed \nthis year to resolve a serious solid waste problem, that of flow \ncontrol. Many solid waste management issues have been rightly addressed \nby State and local governments. State and local governments have \ndecided how solid waste will be managed, preferring landfilling, \nincineration, recycling, composting, waste reduction, or a combination \nthereof. Similarly, they have also provided the needed funding for \ntheir solid waste programs.\n  However, while State and local governments have played the key role, \nthe Federal Government has also been involved in the management of \nsolid waste. Through regulatory actions and federal court rulings, the \nFederal Government has dramatically influenced how State and local \ngovernments have approached their solid waste problems. For example, \nwhen the Supreme Court recently held that State and local governments \ncould no longer designate where privately collected waste could be \ndisposed of, some States and localities--including many in my State of \nMinnesota--were adversely affected.\n  No longer could a State--except in rare instances--prohibit waste \nshipments from out-of-State or impose fees on waste disposal that \ndiscriminate on the basis of origin, nor direct where privately \ncollected waste had to be disposed. As a result of this decision--and \nthose of other courts--many local governments teeter on the brink of \nbankruptcy. Without the ability to guarantee a volume of waste flow to \ntheir waste facilities, local governments are less able to finance the \nfacility, as well as to plan for future development.\n  Recent Congresses, in addition to this one, have attempted to address \nthe flow control problem. Legislation has been introduced to give \nStates the authority to restrict the amount of solid waste imported \nfrom other States. However, the Senate and House have yet to agree on a \nsolution. Due to Congress' inability to address flow control, many \nlocal governments are contemplating--or have already undertaken--\ndrastic actions such as laying off employees and raising taxes. In \naddition, some local governments have had their bonds downgraded. \nAlarmingly, it seems that if the flow control problem is not addressed \nsoon, the financial problems of many communities in my State of \nMinnesota and elsewhere will only worsen.\n  I have wholeheartedly supported flow control legislation in the past. \nWhile many in Congress continue to oppose such legislation, I will not \nrest. In the 105th Congress, I will continue to advocate flow control \nlegislation to help communities in our country better manage their \nsolid waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12327-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12327-S12328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the \nomnibus appropriations bill adopted by the Senate this week and signed \ninto law by the President.\n  Passage and enactment before the end of the fiscal year was important \nto keep the Government in business and meeting the needs of American \ncitizens.\n  The bill is significant in that it continues the Republican Congress' \nmove to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. It would have been \neasier had the President and his party not been more interested in \nobstruction over cooperation. Still, this Congress has cut around 300 \nunneeded Federal programs and saved $53 billion in discretionary \nspending.\n  We provide for a higher level of defense funding than the President \nrequested. We also approved strong anti-crime and antidrug packages, \naggressive antiterrorism programs and stringent antiillegal immigration \nmeasures. The bill increases funding to our States and communities hard \nhit by natural disasters.\n  My State of Idaho is one where residents and businesses had to cope \nwith rains, floods, and wildfires this year. There is a role for the \nFederal Government in helping stabilize riverbeds and hillsides, \nreducing environmental damage, putting businesses back on solid footing \nand firefighting efforts. This bill accomplishes that.\n  The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service watershed and flood \nprevention operations receive a $63 million increase in this bill, $5 \nmillion will go to help the Boise area recover from the devastating 8th \nStreet fire in the Boise foothills. Without immediate attention to the \nfragile hillsides, this winter's rains and next spring's snowmelt could \nsend tons of water and mud into homes and businesses all along the \nBoise front.\n  Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management's firefighting account \nwill get a $17 million increase over last year. Wildfires are claiming \nmore and more Western land, and the BLM's resources are stretched to \nthe limit.\n  The Forest Service, which manages more than 20 million acres in \nIdaho, gets a $144.5 million increase in firefighting funding, $17.7 \nmillion for management of the National Forest System, almost $2 million \nfor forest and rangeland research and nearly $19 million in State and \nprivate cooperative programs.\n  The Federal Government owns two-thirds of the land in Idaho, so I'm \npleased these needed increases will help develop and maintain solid \nmanagement and cooperation with private and State landowners.\n  Preservation of our natural resources and treasured environment is \nimportant to me and to Idaho. I'm pleased to see the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service will get a $6 million dollar increase for the \ncooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This grant program to \nthe States will allow for cooperative agreements to save species and \nhabitat. As I work on a revised Endangered Species Act, I want to \nencourage cooperation of States and private land owners to enter into \nthese types of arrangements. States and local governments will play a \ngreater role in species protection and recovery in the future.\n  Native Americans in Idaho and across the country will see increases \nin the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. These \nincreases are important so we don't neglect our obligations to tribes \nand their residents.\n  Besides what this bill does, it is important for what it does not do. \nThere are no increases in grazing fees for ranchers in the West. Other \namendments which limit Native American sovereignty were also dropped.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that this Congress passed, and the \nPresident signed, the Safe Drinking Water Act. The bill is the only \nmajor environmental legislation of the 104th Congress, and represents \nthe way environmental laws should work. It protects public health and \nsafety while giving States and communities the flexibility\n\n[[Page S12328]]\n\nto manage water systems to meet their local needs. It is truly the best \nway to ensure safe and affordable drinking water to every American.\n  This omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $40 million \nfor the new Safe Drinking Water Act. $10 million will be dedicated to \nimportant health research on contaminants that are present in drinking \nwater and that pose real threats to humans, like the microbe \ncryptosporidium that killed over 100 people in Milwaukee in 1993. With \nbetter science and a better understanding of contaminants in our \ndrinking water, the Environmental Protection Agency and our States will \nbe able to target their limited resources on the most serious water \nproblems.\n  Earlier I mentioned how this bill strengthens our national defense. \nWhile I do not agree with all that is in this omnibus package, \nespecially the funding for foreign aid, I have to applaud stronger \nnational defense.\n  This bill provides an additional $9 million to slow the pace of the \nClinton defense cuts. I believe this administration has cut too far, \ntoo fast. At a time when we're asking men and women in uniform to do \nmore, we shouldn't be providing less. As our Armed Forces take part in \nso-called peace-keeping operations around the world, we should be \nsupporting them, not cutting them. As chairman of the Armed Services \nPersonnel Subcommittee, I'm pleased our military forces will be getting \na 3 percent pay raise. I wish it could be more, but at least we're \ntaking care of the troops and their families.\n\n  Idaho plays a key role in research and development to keep our \nnational defense the best and strongest in the world. I am proud of the \ndedicated scientists, engineers, and workers in Idaho who fill \nimportant roles to make sure when our troops are called into action, \nthey have the best and most advanced equipment and technology. The work \nat laboratories from Idaho Falls to Sandpoint saves lives.\n  The Department of Defense appropriations bill in this omnibus package \nfunds projects which help diversify the missions at the Idaho National \nEngineering Laboratory. It provides $3.5 million for an Air Force \nBattle Management System and $3 million for the chemical weapons \ndemilitarization Mobile Munitions Assessment System. These projects are \ndesigned to protect our forces in the field, where training and \nequipment are expected to perform.\n  Our Navy benefits from this bill as well. This bill funds $40 million \nover the President's request for advanced submarine technology \ndevelopment, much of this work is done at the Navy's acoustic center at \nLake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho. Pend Oreille is the deepest lake \nin the country, and provides an excellent laboratory and training \nground for development of the quietest and hardest to detect submarines \nin any ocean.\n  Mr. President, while I don't like the fact this bill is more than \n$6.5 billion dollars more than Congress originally proposed, it does \ncontinue to bring fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, and \ncontinues the pledge this Republican Congress made to Americans to \nbalance the budget. It is important to note these spending increases \nare paid for with other provisions in this bill.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I can only hope that in the next Congress, \nwe can not only trim discretionary spending, but we can pass laws that \nwill attack runaway mandatory spending. It is possible, if we have a \nPresident and a Congress that will work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12327-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITY OF HOLLAND\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the city of \nHolland, MI. In June 1996, the National Civic League selected Holland \nas 1 of 10 All-America Cities that best displayed their ability to \nrecognize and respond to problems in the community.\n  Holland was singled out for several of its successful community \nprograms. These include: the Maple Avenue Church recreation facility, \nwhich provides supervised youth programs which reduce gang violence; \nVan Raalte Elementary School's program of offering tutoring, drug \nprevention training, recreation, and family help; and the Our-street \nprogram, which helps homeowners, landlords, and tenants. These programs \nwork to bring down racial and ethnic barriers that have divided people \nand foster a strong sense of community.\n  When announcing this year's winners, John W. Gardner, chairman of the \nNational Civic League said, ``These ten communities have one thing in \ncommon: A belief in the power of grass-roots problem solving.'' I can \nthink of no better description of the city of Holland. The residents of \nHolland have taken it upon themselves to reach out to their neighbors \nand work to improve their community.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating the city of \nHolland on this distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12328-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RETIREMENT OF JOHN GALLOS, TWIN CITIES TELEVISION PIONEER\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there was a song actor Walter \nBrennan made popular in the early 1960's in which he reminisces about \nan old farmhand he recalled from his childhood. ``I can't remember when \nhe 'tweren't around,'' went the lyrics. I rise today to pay tribute to \nan outstanding Minnesotan, one of our State's pioneers in television, \nof whom can truly be said, ``We can't remember when he 'tweren't \naround.''\n  An entire generation of Minnesotans fondly remembers John Gallos as \nCommodore Cappy and Clancy the Cop, the characters he created for a \npair of early-morning children's programs at WCCO Television in \nMinneapolis. In the early 1950's, television was in its infancy. It was \nanything goes as John and his colleagues experimented with and defined \nthis new medium. The weekly prop budget of $1.50 did not buy much in \nthose early years, but the kids who flocked to their television sets to \nstart their days with a dose of Cappy or Clancy did not care: they had \nfound a place where they were always welcome.\n  Besides his children's programming, John hosted a nondenominational \nreligious talk show entitled ``Sunday Morning With John Gallos'' which \nran on WCCO for 31 years. The show was honored in 1995 with a Wilbur \nAward from the Religious Public Relations Council for its excellence in \ncommunicating religious and ethical issues. John rightly counts \n``Sunday Morning'' as one of his proudest achievements.\n  When I think of John, another of his Sunday projects comes to mind: a \nweekly salute to Laurel and Hardy that introduced the comic legends to \na new generation.\n  There is one story John often tells because to him, it demonstrates \nthe positive impact local television can have on a community. For the \nrest of us, it exemplifies the positive impact John Gallos himself has \nhad on the lives of Minnesota families. It happened just before \nValentines Day around 1959. John, as Commodore Cappy, was talking on \nthe air with Vivian Vulture, one of his puppets. ``I suppose you'll get \na lot of Valentines this year,'' he told her. ``No, Commodore, I never \nget any Valentines,'' answered Vivian, and she started to cry. The \nCommodore wiped a tear from his own eye and said, ``Perhaps the \nchildren will think of you this year.''\n  Mr. President, over the next few days, more than 10,000 Valentine \ncards poured into the WCCO studios addressed to that little puppet.\n  In recent years, the voices of most of the pioneering talents in Twin \nCities television have grown quiet, as they trade their shifts in front \nof the cameras and microphones for retirement. And now, after nearly a \nhalf century spent inside the radio and television studios of WCCO, \nJohn Gallos is retiring, too. My colleagues in the Senate join with me \nin congratulating John for his lifetime of service to his community. We \nthank him for his generous spirit, and wish him well in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12328-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12328-S12329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MONETA J. SLEET\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on September 30, 1996, our Nation, \nand the world, lost one of its most gifted documenters of history, \nphotographer Moneta J. Sleet.\n  Moneta was the first African-American to win journalism's most \nprestigious award. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for documenting \nthe funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His photograph of Coretta \nScott King holding her 5-year-old daughter at Dr. King's funeral has \ncome to symbolize the tragedy of this turbulent period in our nation's \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S12329]]\n\n  Moneta spent the majority of his career chronicling our Nation's \ncivil rights movement. We are grateful to have had Moneta to record \nthis important part of our history. In 1956, he met a 28-year-old \nMartin Luther King, Jr., who at the time was a minister in Atlanta. \nMoneta fostered a close relationship with King, and later would travel \nwith him to Sweden when he received the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. Moneta \nalso accompanied Vice President Richard M. Nixon to Africa in 1957 when \nthat continent was on the verge of independence.\n  Moneta was born in Kentucky in 1926. He attended Kentucky State and \nreceived a master's degree in journalism from New York University. \nMoneta went on to work for the Amsterdam News, Our World, Ebony, and \nJet magazines. Moneta Sleet died in New York City at the age of 70, \nleaving behind his wife, three children, and three grandchildren.\n  On September 30, we lost an American treasure. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in honoring the life of Moneta J. Sleet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12328-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE WELLNESS PLAN OF DETROIT, MI, AND HEALTHSOURCE SAGINAW\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, with the 104th Congress coming to \na close, this Senator wanted to come to the floor and express his \ndisappointment at the failure of Congress to act on a couple of \nextremely important issues affecting the State of Michigan.\n  One of the matters is a Medicare 50/50 enrollment composition rule \nwaiver for the Wellness Plan of Detroit, MI. The Wellness Plan is a \nfederally certified Medicaid health maintenance organization located in \nDetroit, MI. It currently has 150,000 enrollees--141,000 of whom are \nMedicaid, 12,000 commercial and 2,000 Medicare. Since 1993, the \nWellness Plan has had a health care prepayment plan contract with \nMedicare. However, technical changes enacted by Congress effective \nJanuary 1, 1996, unintentionally prevent the Wellness Plan from \nenrolling additional Medicare beneficiaries under the HCPP contract. So \nwhile the Wellness Plan now is positioned to become a full Medicare \nrisk contractor, it currently is precluded from doing so due to the 50/\n50 Medicare/Medicaid enrollment composition rule.\n  My colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and I introduced \nlegislation recently to grant this waiver to the Wellness Plan. It is \nimportant to note that even the Health Care Financing Administration \n[HCFA] supports the Wellness Plan receiving this plan-specific 50/50 \nwaiver. Because this legislation is noncontroversial, only affects the \nState of Michigan, and is supported by the entire State delegation, it \nwas our hope that we could either include this measure in the omnibus \nappropriation bill the Senate passed this week.\n  Regrettably, we were unable to include this language in the omnibus \nappropriation bill due to opposition from the Finance Committee to the \naddition of any Medicare or Medicaid provisions. While this Senator \nintends to pursue this initiative in the next Congress, it is truly \ndisappointing that we were not allowed to enact this provision this \nyear. This may appear to be a relatively minor, technical legislative \nissue, but it would have had a profound impact on the ability of \nMedicare beneficiaries in the State of Michigan to participate in this \neffective health care plan.\n  Mr. President, the other matter has to do with HealthSource Saginaw \nhospital facility in Saginaw, MI. For the past 2 years, several of us \nin the Michigan delegation have been working diligently to provide a \ntemporary extension of the moratorium that Congress had enacted and \npreviously extended that prohibits the Department of Health and Human \nServices from considering HealthSource Saginaw to be an institution for \nmental diseases [IMD]. The most recent moratorium expired on December \n31, 1995. We were able to get a moratorium extension in last year's \nreconciliation bill. Obviously, the President's veto of that bill \ndashed our hopes of solving this problem through that mechanism. In the \ninterim, however, the State of Michigan has been forced to subsidize \nthe losses incurred by HealthSource Saginaw since the expiration of the \nmost recent moratorium. Reportedly, this has cost the State of Michigan \n$902,000 to date since January 1, 1996, it is estimated that amount \nwill increase to $1.2 million by the end of the year.\n  The fiscal year 1997 Labor-HHS-Education appropriation bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives contained legislative language providing \nan extension of the moratorium through the year 2000 or until the first \nday of the first quarter in which Michigan's State plan would become \neffective under the new MediGrant program. It was our hope that such \nlanguage would be included the omnibus appropriation bill or any \ncontinuing resolution that was sent to the President. Once again, the \nFinance Committee's opposition to any such Medicare or Medicaid \nprovisions prevented us from succeeding in enacting this moratorium for \nHealthSource Saginaw this year. That is very unfortunate for the people \nof Saginaw, who risk losing an important health care facility in their \narea, and for the people of Michigan, who continue to have to subsidize \nthis facility's operation because of the unwillingness of some in \nCongress to address this matter prior to adjournment.\n  As with the waiver for the Wellness Plan, this Senator intends to \ncontinue to press for the moratorium for HealthSource Saginaw in the \n105th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12329-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MARVIN C.

Pryor, who on Saturday, October 12, 1996 will be consecrated to the \noffice of bishop to the episcopacy of the Third Ecclesiastical \nJurisdiction of Southwest Michigan. Pastor Pryor is a member of the \nChurch of God in Christ, Inc. The ceremony will be conducted by Bishop \nChandler D. Owens, chief apostle of the 4 million member organization.\n  Marvin Pryor is pastor of the Victorious Believers Ministries, where \nhe has served since 1984. Under Pastor Pryor's strong leadership, \nchurch membership has grown from 30 to 700 parishioners. Pastor Pryor \nhas also been influential in the establishment and operation of the \nchurch's After School Tutorial Program, Food and Clothing Assistance \nProgram, and Prison Ministry.\n  Pastor Pryor is no stranger to public service. He worked for the \nFlint School District for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1992 to \ndevote his full time to the ministry. He served as an administrator for \n24 years and was Flint Northern High School's Principal for 16 years.\n  Marvin Pryor is a Michigan native who has received advanced degrees \nfrom both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. One \nof Marvin's greatest joys in life is the time he shares with his wife \nand four children and their extended family. Of the numerous awards he \nhas received for his community, civic, and religious involvement, he is \nmost proud of being named Father of the Year by city of Flint Mayor \nWoodrow Stanley.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Marvin C. Pryor \non a long life of faithful service to the community, and in \ncongratulating him on becoming a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, \nInc.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12329-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12329-S12330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE STAFF OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT \n                MANAGEMENT AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nstaff of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving either as the chairman or the \nranking member during my entire tenure in the Senate. The subcommittee \nhas been responsible for a number of significant legislative and \noversight accomplishments during the past 18 years and, while it would \ntake too long to describe each of these accomplishments, I want to \nmention just a few of them:\n  The Competition in Contracting Act [CICA] of 1984, major procurement \nreform which remarkably improved the way Government agencies acquire \ngoods and services.\n  The independent counsel law, which serves to ensure that wrongdoing \nat the highest levels of Government will be impartially investigated.\n  The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988, designed to improve\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\nthe regulation and accuracy of medical laboratory tests.\n  More recently and under the leadership of Senator Levin, the \nSubcommittee was instrumental in the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct which requires public registration of professional lobbyists.\n  Just this year, the subcommittee was responsible for the enactment of \nthe Information Technology Management Reform Act. This landmark \nlegislation will save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way \nthe federal government approaches, purchases and uses technology.\n\n  As a result of two subcommittee hearings, the Federal Employee Travel \nReform Act of 1996 recently became law. This act represents the biggest \nchange in Federal travel rules in 40 years and will result in an \nestimated savings of $4 billion over the next five years.\n  Not only has the subcommittee staff achieved significant legislative \naccomplishments, but they have worked tirelessly to ensure that the \nsubcommittee's oversight function was performed aggressively, credibly, \nand with the utmost integrity and care. Regardless of the issue, the \nsubcommittee has undertaken its oversight role with vigor and tenacity. \nThe subcommittee has performed oversight on issues ranging from \nprocurement to Government ethics and, more recently, from bank failures \nand federal construction to aviation safety.\n  The subcommittee has also published a number of investigative reports \nwhich have had significant impact on Government reform. These reports \ninclude ``Federal Government Losing Millions By Not Minding the \nConcessions Store'' and ``Computer Chaos: Billions Wasted Buying \nFederal Computer Systems''. A soon to be released report on Federally \nFunded Research and Development Centers [FFRDC] will lay the groundwork \nto significantly improve the Federal role in promoting scientific \nresearch.\n  Today, I wanted to pay tribute to the staff who have worked \ntirelessly in recent years to continue the tradition of excellence \nalways associated with the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement. Under the leadership of staff director Kim Corthell and \ndeputy staff director Paul Brubaker, the staff continues to perform a \nrespected and recognized oversight and legislative function on Capitol \nHill.\n  I want to express my gratitude and thanks to the current subcommittee \nstaff--Kim Corthell, Paul Brubaker, Paulina Collins, Bill Greenwalt, \nFrankie deVergie, and Andrea Gerber.\n  I also want to recognize and thank other members of my staff who \nserved on the subcommittee in the past--Mary Gerwin, Priscilla Hanley, \nAndy Antrobus, Jennifer Goldthwait, Kelly Metcalf Meese, Julie Denison, \nand Matthew Frost.\n  Finally, I want to mention and thank the individuals who have most \nrecently served on the subcommittee as fellows and detailees--Don \nMullinax, Ralph Dawn, Marty Grenn, Chris Condon, and Peter Wade.\n  These women and men made an invaluable contribution to the \nsubcommittee's work and to improving government. I deeply appreciate \ntheir loyalty and dedication, and I wish all of these talented and hard \nworking individuals continued success and much happiness in their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12329-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A MORE BALANCED IMMIGRATION BILL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we move toward adjournment, I \nwish to comment on the recently passed illegal immigration reform bill. \nI also wish to commend everyone who helped hammer out the compromise \nthat was incorporated into H.R. 4278, the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations bill.\n  The resulting compromise properly shifted the focus from penalizing \nthose legally admitted to this country to those who illegally cross our \nborders. The conference report, as passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last week, would have severely restricted benefit \neligibility for legal permanent residents and other lawfully admitted \nimmigrants. Legal residents--people who contribute to our society by \nworking hard, paying taxes, serving in our Nation's Armed Forces, and \nobserving all laws to remain in the United States--would have been \nineligible for most Federally funded public assistance based on income.\n  The resulting compromise eliminates deeming provisions that would \nhave restricted the ability of legal immigrants to receive federal \nbenefits during their first 5 years in the United States. Moreover, it \ndropped provisions mandating deportation or denial of naturalized \nstatus to immigrants who accept Federal benefits during a 12-month \nperiod over 7 years.\n  These are significant changes which soften the newly enacted welfare \nreform bill that bars legal resident aliens from receiving a number of \nFederal benefits.\n  The House-passed conference agreement also called for establishing \nincome standards for the sponsorship by U.S. citizens of family members \nthat were unrealistically high and would have had a deleterious effect \non family reunification--a long-standing goal of U.S. immigration \npolicy. The conference agreement numbers would have kept sponsorship of \nimmediate family members out of the reach of many hard-working, tax-\npaying families. Under the compromise, sponsors of immigrant relatives \nmust now earn a minimum of 125 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nThis is a more realistic standard that will assist low-income wage \nearners in reuniting with their family members.\n  I voted for the Senate immigration reform bill in May, not because I \nthought it was perfect, but because it addressed the issue of illegal \nimmigration. I was hopeful that the House and Senate bills could be \nnegotiated in a bipartisan fashion so that Congress could enact \nmeaningful immigration reform. During the conference, Democrats were \nexcluded from the process. The results, Mr. President, were \npredictable.\n  The Congress does not represent only one opinion. We must be willing \nand able to compromise, to hear one another's concerns, and find \nsolutions that will not harm our citizens and legal immigrants. \nCongress was on the verge of enacting legislation that would have \ncreated a second-class citizenship for legal immigrants.

Mr. President, as we complete our business in the \nSenate today, I rise to note with interest the support the \nAppropriations Committees in the House and Senate gave to the trauma \nreduction initiative under the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Program of the Bureau of Justice Assistance.\n  On page H11848 of the September 28, 1996 Congressional Record, the \nCommerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Appropriation subcommittee \nmembers of the House and Senate urge the Bureau of Justice Assistance \nto favorably consider funding the initiative. As you may know, the \ntrauma reduction project was developed by Cooper Hospital/University \nMedical of Camden, NJ, and NOVA Southeastern University of Fort \nLauderdale, FL, to respond to and prevent violence and crime in our \nneighborhoods. What makes this initiative unique is the joining of \ntherapeutic and alternative dispute resolution methods to train \npersonnel who intervene most often in violent or even chronic abuse \nsituations.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues from New Jersey and the \nDepartment of Justice to make this proposal a reality. Not only will it \nassist immediate victims of abuse and crime, but it will contribute to \nreduce the spiral of crime and violence which plagues our neighborhoods \nand burdens our health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12330-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12330-S12331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        URBAN WOES AND SOLUTIONS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's \nattention to an op-ed in the New York Daily News by Professor Mitchell \nMoss. Professor Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center of New \nYork University, has a long history of illuminating our Nation's urban \nwoes, and potential solutions.\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\n  I ask that the article entitled ``U.S. Cities Need a Helping Hand'' \nby Mitchell Moss be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    U.S. Cities Need a Helping Hand\n\n                           (By Mitchell Moss)\n\n       Like suburbanites who commute to high-income jobs in \n     downtown offices, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole treat cities as \n     places to raise money, not as centers of commerce and culture \n     with physical and human needs.\n       The same is true across the political spectrum. Both \n     parties used cities to stage their conventions--but failed to \n     acknowledge the economic and social importance of cities in \n     their party platforms. Neither party has a set of policies to \n     deal with the impact of immigrants, to help schools, to pump \n     private dollars into housing or to use the renewal of the \n     infrastructure as a way to create jobs.\n       The Democrats' only strategy for cities is to create more \n     empowerment zones. That's supply-side idea stolen from Jack \n     Kemp's playbook, but it is too unproven to warrant expansion \n     into a national spending program. And congressional Democrats \n     still support the entrenched interest groups that impede \n     innovation at the community level.\n       As for the Republicans, it took Kemp, a former housing \n     secretary, to remind them that cities are still part of the \n     United States. In fact, the GOP platform virtually ignores \n     cities while paying homage to the nation's agricultural \n     heritage and calling for tax policies to preserve the family \n     farm.\n       The GOP would shift most domestic programs to the states, \n     putting cities at the mercy of suburban and rural-dominated \n     legislatures that consistently shortchange urban schools and \n     mass transit systems.\n       And both parties have joined in passing anti-urban welfare \n     reform legislation. The targets of this law--poor people and \n     legal immigrants--are disproportionately located in the \n     nation's major cities. Moreover, welfare reform, when \n     combined with the bi-partisan agreement to balance the budget \n     without reducing entitlements, will force Washington to \n     intensify its two-decade-old policy of urban disinvestment.\n       Ironically, the federal government's abandonment of cities \n     is occurring at the precise moment when central-city office \n     markets are rebounding, when business improvement districts \n     are cleaning up streets and sidewalks and when church and \n     community-based corporations have mastered the art of \n     developing low-cost housing.\n       There is even a new cadre of mayors trying to do what was \n     once considered impossible: Govern big cities. Giuliani in \n     New York, Riordan in Los Angeles, Daley in Chicago, Rendell \n     in Philadelphia and White in Cleveland are taking on the \n     challenge of reducing high taxes, holding down municipal \n     labor costs, stimulating tourism and improving safety--all \n     without the help of their governors and legislatures.\n       So what can Washington do to help mayors and their cities? \n     There are no quick fixes. But there are priorities that \n     warrant funds and attention:\n       National immigration policy has caused overcrowding in big-\n     city schools, especially in New York and Los Angeles. The \n     cost of educating the children immigrants should be partially \n     covered by the federal government and not just local \n     taxpayers.\n       Washington should build on its successful use of tax \n     incentives to attract private dollars to finance low-income \n     housing and stimulate minority employment in the contracting \n     and construction trades. Federal policy makers also should \n     recognize the importance of religious-based organizations in \n     housing and economic development.\n       The federal government can help create jobs while improving \n     urban infrastructures by fostering public and private \n     investment in mass transit, intelligent highways and \n     waterfront development.\n       The federal government cannot cure the problems of cities, \n     but voters must not let the presidential candidates run away \n     from the cities, either.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12330-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VOLUNTEER AMATEUR RADIO OPERATORS\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nvolunteer amateur radio operators who provide an essential emergency \ncommunications service to government and private relief agencies during \ntimes of national disasters.\n  After floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and tornados, amateur \nradio, or ``ham'' operators as they are often called, provide emergency \ncommunications when other forms of communications are down. They are \noften the only ones who can relay messages from victims in disaster \nareas to loved ones in other locations. There are over 4,000 ham radio \noperators in Maine, over 650,000 nationwide, and several million \ninternationally.\n  To give you an example of the valuable public service that ham radio \noperators provide, I want to tell you about a story that came to my \nattention last year. A couple honeymooning on St. Maarten were lost \nduring Hurricane Luis. The hurricane caused massive destruction to the \nisland, leveling neighborhoods, tearing apart hotels and restaurants, \nand washing out roads. Thousands of tourists were stranded without \nelectricity, running water, or telephone service.\n  George Foss, a ham radio operator from Franconia, NH, worked with \nLinda Leeman and David Seaborn of my staff, and ham radio operators in \nCuba, Panama, North Carolina, and Aruba to contact the U.S. Consulate \non the Dutch side of the island where one of the diplomats was \noperating an amateur radio station on emergency power. At the time, \nthere were only two cellular telephones in service for the entire \nisland. All other forms of communication had been destroyed by the \nhurricane. The hard work of these amateur radio operators made it \npossible to locate this couple and let their friends and family back \nhome know they were alright.\n  Mr. President, I want to publicly thank George Foss and the millions \nof amateur radio operators worldwide who volunteer their time to aid in \nthese search and rescue efforts. We all owe them our thanks and sincere \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12331-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12331-S12332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RESOLUTIONS OF THE VERMONT ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record, \ncopies of two resolutions passed on May 31, 1996, by the Vermont \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police dealing with the creation of a national \nclearinghouse for information on police performance and the police \nofficer bill of rights.\n  I would like to thank them for sharing these resolutions with me.\n  The resolutions follow:\n\n     Resolution for the Support of National Officer Clearinghouse \n                              Legislation\n\n       Whereas the vast majority of police officers serve and \n     protect their communities professionally and successfully \n     with diligences, courage and integrity; and\n       Whereas it is essential that the public maintain confidence \n     in the professionalism and integrity of its police officers, \n     and the ability of police agencies to maintain those \n     standards; and\n       Whereas only a small percentage of police officers have \n     acted in a manner that does not meet the public's \n     expectations or the profession's standards of ethics and \n     conduct; and\n       Whereas it is in the best interest of the public and the \n     policing profession to assure that such officers are denied \n     further opportunities to serve as police officers; and\n       Whereas such officers who are terminated or who resign \n     because of misconduct can often secure subsequent police \n     service employment at other agencies, often by reason of not \n     fully disclosing the circumstances of a previous termination \n     or resignation; and\n       Whereas the ability of such officers to move from one \n     agency to another severely limits police agency's ability to \n     identify officers that should not be working police services; \n     and\n       Whereas the ability of a prospective employing agency to \n     identify such officers could be enhanced through a national \n     clearinghouse of information by which prior police service \n     employment is made known to prospective employing agencies; \n     and\n       Whereas, at the urging of the International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police, the Florida Police Chief's Association, and \n     the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, legislation was \n     introduced by Senator Bob Graham and Congressman Harry \n     Johnson to create a National Officer Clearinghouse, but the \n     legislation was not enacted by the 103rd Congress: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police \n     calls for Vermont's Congressional delegation to support S. \n     484--the ``Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers \n     Registration Act of 1995'' and companion House legislation \n     co-sponsoring this legislation, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police, \n     through its membership, actively participate in the \n     clearinghouse once it is established.\n       Passed this 31st day of May, 1996 in Vergennes, Vermont.\n                                                      Gary Watson,\n                                                        President.\n\nResolution in Opposition of Police Officers' Bill of Rights Legislation\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Congress is presently considering \n     legislation to establish a federal Police Officers' Bill of \n     Rights; and\n       Whereas, if adopted, this legislation would require every \n     local, county and state law enforcement agency to adopt a Law \n     Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, or lose substantial \n     amounts of federal grants; and\n       Whereas, the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police \n     believes that due process rights for all police officers \n     subject to (1) investigation for violation of department \n     rules and regulations; and (2) subsequent disciplinary action \n     are well provided for in individual agency policy and \n     procedure in compliance with prevailing federal and state law \n     and court mandates; and\n\n[[Page S12332]]\n\n       Whereas, this legislation violates the theory of states' \n     rights established under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution, through which the states retain the right to \n     regulate those matters that the federal government had not \n     regulated; and\n       Whereas, specific provisions of the Police Officers' Bill \n     of Rights will deprive police administrators of vital and \n     necessary powers to conduct both informal and internal \n     investigations to resolve employee grievances, and to \n     maintain a civil service system free of politics;\n       Now therefore be it resolved that the Vermont Association \n     of Chiefs of Police hereby affirms its opposition to H.R. \n     2946, H.R. 2537 and all bills and amendments of a similar \n     nature that would establish a federal Police Officers' Bill \n     of Rights.\n       Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be \n     delivered to Vermont's Congressional Delegation along with a \n     request that the resolution be entered into the Congressional \n     Record.\n       Passed this 31st day of May, 1996 in Vergennes, Vermont.\n                                                      Gary Watson,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12331-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO J. MARK TIPPS\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to a \nmember of my staff who has served me and the State of Tennessee with \ndedication and excellence for the past 2 years. When I came to the U.S. \nSenate, I had no previous political experience. That meant that I had \nno staff waiting for their next assignment, no idea how to set up an \noffice, and no time to learn. Luckily, I did have Mark Tipps.\n  To my great benefit, Mark Tipps agreed to take a leave of absence \nfrom his law partnership at Bass, Berry, and Sims in Nashville and \nbring his wife Joi and two beautiful daughters, Annie and Grace, to \nWashington to serve as my Chief of Staff.\n  I first came to know Mark when he volunteered to help me clarify and \narticulate my position on various issues during my campaign. Although \nhe also had no direct previous political experience, I was instantly \nimpressed by his ability to bring complicated state and national issues \ninto focus and his level-headed, common-sense approach. Throughout his \ntenure in Washington, he has used these qualities to help me put \ntogether and maintain a first-rate staff; keep a strong presence in \nTennessee, even when the Senate schedule keeps me in Washington; \ndevelop a successful, focused legislative agenda; and make the right \ndecisions for Tennesseans on tough issues.\n  Most importantly, Mark has played a major role for me and my entire \nstaff in making sure these past 2 years were not only challenging, but \nalso enjoyable. I remember the first trip I made to Washington with \nMark after my election. We were late to a meeting because we were \nwandering around the Capitol looking for the Russell Building. We \neventually found it, but it has been the source of many jokes over the \npast 2 years as we recount just how far we've come. Mark is known among \nmy staff and throughout the office for his open-door policy and good \njudgment. Staff members know that if they have a problem or need \nadvice, personal or professional, all they have to do is knock. With \nhis easygoing, affable personality, Mark is more than just a boss to my \nstaff--he is a friend. Mark has also become far more than just a staff \nmember to me and my wife, Karyn. He is a personal friend and we look \nforward to staying in touch with his family during our frequent visits \nto Nashville.\n  The one request that Mark made of me when he came to Capitol Hill was \nthat I not make him stay more than 2 years. I am begrudgingly and with \nmuch hesitation keeping that promise, and I wish Mark the very best of \nluck as he returns to his home in Nashville to resume his law practice. \nIf Mark takes nothing else back home with him after his 2-year \n``baptism by fire'' here, he is at least taking a fifth family member \nand his first son. John Alfred Tipps was born on May 29 and may not \nremember much of his stay here, but can hopefully read this tribute and \nknow how much his Dad contributed to this country. The whole Frist \noffice will miss Mark, but we all send him off with our very fond \nmemories, sincere gratitude and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12332-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SAVINGS BANK LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, although I do not serve on the \nFinance Committee, I was pleased to work closely with that committee \nduring this Congress on a number of issues which have a special impact \non the people of Massachusetts. For example, in the Small Business Job \nProtection Act, we were able to provide tax relief for fishing families \nin New Bedford, MA, as well as extend the research and development tax \ncredit and employer-provided education tax deduction. In addition, in \nthat legislation, we raised the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour--the \nfirst installment of that raise just went into effect this week, and \nthe benefit is being felt by families all across Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, while we can take pride in this work, there were \nseveral miscellaneous tax provisions that the committee, without making \nany judgment about their merit, found unable to give proper review or \nconsideration. One of these technical amendments would clarify the tax \ntreatment of the State-mandated consolidation of savings banks life \ninsurance departments. Specifically, the amendment would address the \npotential unfair consequences for the savings bank life insurance \n[SBLI] industry which is unique to New York, Connecticut, and \nMassachusetts.\n  While the Finance Committee did not act on this issue in the current \nCongress, it is my hope and expectation that the Senate will be able to \nmake the necessary technical clarifications in the law early next year.\n  I should point out that all six Senators from affected States wrote \nto the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware, \nrequesting committee consideration of the measure. That letter, which I \nask to be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks, was \nsigned by Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, D'Amato, Dodd, Lieberman and me. \nMr. President, in addition to the clear, bipartisan support for this \ntechnical amendment, the Treasury Department has indicated the Clinton \nadministration has no objection to this proposal.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue in the \n105th Congress. I yield the floor.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During upcoming negotiations on the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1995, we would ask that you support a \n     technical amendment to address potential unfair tax \n     consequences for the savings bank life insurance (SBLI) \n     organizations in New York, Connecticut and Massachussets. \n     SBLI is an industry unique to our three States. The provision \n     would clarify the tax treatment of the state-mandated \n     consolidation of mutual savings bank's life insurance \n     departments.\n       More specifically, the provision would clarify how the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 should treat certain additional \n     policyholders dividends mandated by the Massachusetts State \n     Legislature in 1990. As explained further in the attached \n     paper, the legislation consolidated the state's savings \n     banks' life insurance departments into a new non-public stock \n     company, while still providing for the sale of its products \n     through these state banking institutions. Because of the IRS' \n     expansive interpretation of current law, it is essential that \n     Congress clarify that the 12-year dividend payout associated \n     with this consolidation should be treated as a deductible \n     policyholder dividend rather than a nondeductible redemption \n     of equiy. The IRS has indicated that if the tax clarification \n     of this issue is not made this year, SBLI and its \n     policyholders will be subjected to this tax inequity which \n     will be regrettably and unfairly passed on to the consumer.\n       Only the Savings Bank Life Insurance Company of \n     Massachusetts is immediately affected by the IRS' \n     interpretation of the Code. However, the sister industries in \n     both New York and Connecticut may be adversely affected if \n     the Tax Code is not properly clarified because they may \n     follow the consolidation approach taken by Massachusetts. \n     Revenue estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation project \n     that the cost of this clarification to the Tax Code would not \n     exceed $25 million over the next five years, and the \n     Administration has testified that it does not oppose \n     providing legislative relief to SBLI.\n       Mr. Chairman, for the aforementioned reasons, we would \n     appreciate your cooperation in clarifying the Tax Code as it \n     relates to this timely issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John F. Kerry,\n     Joseph I.

Mr. President, as the Senate comes to the close of \nthis session, I want to express a few words on the passage of H.R. \n4167, The Professional Boxing Safety Act. I am extremely pleased that \nthe 104th Congress will be the first in 35 years--since the days of the \nKefauver Committee--to reform professional boxing. The bill has been \nsent to the President for his consideration.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Bryan, who represents the premier \nboxing State in our country, for his great help and counsel on this \nbipartisan legislation. In the House, Subcommittee Chairman Mike Oxley, \nChairman Bliley of the Commerce Committee, Rep. Pat Williams, and Rep. \nJohn Dingell all played vital roles in getting this historic \nlegislation passed in that body.\n  I have been an avid fan of professional boxing all my life. I still \ngo to several fights each year. Boxing can be a thrilling and honorable \ncontest between highly skilled athletes. At its best, professional \nboxing for me and millions of other fans is the ``sweet science.''\n  But professional boxing in our country is also a big money, often \nunregulated industry that has been aptly described as the ``red light \ndistrict of sports.'' I regret it has earned that distinction through \ndecades of controversy, scandals, and ethical abuses.\n  Of primary importance for me has been the lack of proper health and \nsafety measures for the unknown, journeymen boxers who sustain the \nsport. They may never make more than a few hundred dollars a night, and \nare subject to physical and financial exploitation from unscrupulous \npromoters. It is the only profession they know.\n  As soon as they are of no use to a promoter, they are discarded. Left \nwith the debilitating effects that result from years of punishment. No \npension, no medical care, no assistance from any league or association \nin the industry.\n  Other major sports have well-run private associations that provide \nbenefits to their athletes, and address ethical abuses on behalf of the \npublic. Boxing has none.\n  With no private organization in this industry, and uneven public \noversight at the State level, it is appropriate for the Congress to act \non behalf of the athletes whose health and safety is often put at risk.\n\n  In fact, five States have absolutely no public oversight of \nprofessional boxing. That can easily lead to dangerous or fraudulent \nsituations.\n  This bipartisan legislation, H.R. 4167, is closely based on the bill \nSenator Bryan and I passed through the Senate last October--S. 187. It \nis a modest but practical bill. It establishes a series of health, \nsafety, and ethical standards for each professional boxing event in the \nUnited States.\n  This act will greatly assist dedicated State boxing commissioners as \nthey strive to responsibly regulate this industry. The Association of \nBoxing Commissions strongly endorsed S. 187, and I received letters \nfrom boxing officials from all over the United States in support of it.\n  This is not a Washington-based, bureaucratic solution to the problems \naffecting boxing that are matters of public concern. I sought the views \nof State officials from each commission in the country before drafting \nthis legislation.\n  It is a common sense, limited proposal that puts the interest of the \nathletes above those of the promoters who would otherwise cut corners \non safety. The primary effect of the bill will be to ensure that all \nboxing events are supervised by State officials. H.R. 4167 will ensure \nthat a modest level of health and safety measures are provided.\n  It will also assist State commissioners as they work with their \ncolleagues in neighboring States to stop fraudulent or unsafe events. \nAll medical suspensions placed on injured or debilitated boxers must be \nrespected under this bill.\n  A significant provision added in the House will prevent conflicts of \ninterest in the industry. State commissioners who serve the public \ninterest in regulating professional boxing will be prohibited from \nreceiving compensation from the business side of the sport. That will \nhelp address the troublesome influence that the self-serving \nsanctioning bodies have gained over the years.\n  Importantly, I'd like to emphasize what this bill does not do. It \ndoes not require appropriations; it does not create a Federal boxing \nbureaucracy or entity of any kind. And it does not impose costly \nmandates on State commissions.\n  H.R. 4167, the Professional Boxing Safety Act, properly leaves \nregulation of the sport to State officials. But it will strengthen \nhealth and safety standards on behalf of the athletes, and require \nresponsible oversight by these commissioners.\n  I believe this legislation will make professional boxing a safer and \nmore honorable sport. That's a solid achievement for industry members, \nState officials, and the fans who long for it to be as great a sport as \nit can be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12333-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12333-S12334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FCC'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment today to \noffer some observations on the FCC's recent attempts to implement the \nimportant Telecommunications Act that we passed during the 104th \nCongress. I ask unanimous consent that my comments appear as if \npresented in morning business.\n  As we all know, prior to the 104th Congress, we had been debating \ncommunications issues for almost 20 years with little forward progress. \nDuring the 104th, the chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, Senator Larry Pressler, hammered out a \nbalanced, bipartisan piece of legislation that addressed the extremely \ntechnical and controversial issues raised in deregulating the \nbroadcasting and communications industries. When we all gathered in the \nLibrary of Congress on February 8, 1996, to witness the signing of this \nhistoric legislation into law, I think pretty much all of us were proud \nof our collective accomplishment. We hoped and expected that our \nefforts would produce new services, new competitive options, new jobs \nand investment, and a competitive marketplace.\n  However, recently, I have been watching the highly controversial \nefforts of the FCC at it has worked to implement this new law. And, as \nYogi Berra once said, it's starting to look like deja vu all over \nagain.\n  Congress hammered out a consensus blueprint--one that was fair and \nbalanced, and one that all the various industries signed onto. That \nprocess took a lot of work; in fact, the Senate-House conference took \nover 4 months. However, I am concerned with the manner in which the FCC \nhas gone about implementing this bill. In fact, yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal contained an article which identified many of the problems \narising from the FCC's implementation of the Telecommunications Act. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of that article be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the FCC's \nimplementation of the Interconnection provision--the FCC's order \nimplementing this provision is 932 pages and contains some 4,062 \nfootnotes--has alienated virtually all of the State regulators, and it \nhas generated a massive appeal to the courts by the local exchange \ncompanies--this represents about three-quarters of the entire industry. \nThus, the balanced, consensus approach that Congress achieved has, \napparently, been set aside, and now, unfortunately, we are seeing these \nissues before the courts.\n  Mr. President, this situation is not good for anyone. Confusion, \nindustry strife, and massive court filings don't facilitate the \nconstruction of the information superhighway. Because I believe that \nthe U.S. competitiveness in the global information economy will \nbe dependent upon how quickly we upgrade our communications networks, \nit is absolutely essential that the FCC not adopt implementation \npolicies that frustrate the timely deployment of information and \ncommunications infrastructure. I encourage the FCC to go back to the \nlegislation that we passed and to follow the roadmap that Congress \noutlined. That roadmap calls for,\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\nfirst, encouraging private sector negotiations, and, second, relying \nupon the State commissions to arbitrate solutions to the problems that \nprivate parties cannot work out. The FCC is responsible for overseeing \nthis process but should not try to take over the process by rehashing \nall the issues that Congress resolved in the enactment of this act. It \nneeds to implement Congress' blueprint in a balanced, consensus \nfashion, so that the communications industry can begin the important \njob of bringing new services, new options, and new technologies to the \nAmerican public.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2, 1996]\n\n                      How Bureaucrats Rewrite Laws\n\n                        (By John J. DiIulio Jr.)\n\n       As the historic 104th Congress draws to a close, scholars \n     have already begun to debate its legislative record. Some \n     stress that the first Republican Congress in four decades \n     enacted fewer major laws than any Congress since the end of \n     World War II. Others respond that it was only natural that a \n     new conservative Congress committed to restraining the post-\n     New Deal rise of national government activism would pass \n     fewer big-government bills. Likewise, while some interpret \n     President Clinton's bright re-election prospects as a \n     negative referendum on the GOP-led House and Senate, other \n     focus on how Republicans ended up setting the agenda on \n     everything from balancing the budget to welfare reform.\n       For at least two reasons, however, both sides in this early \n     war over the 104th history are firing intellectual blanks. \n     One reason is that it is not yet clear how much of the \n     legislation will stick politically. For example, Mr. Clinton \n     has made plain that, if reelected, he plans to ``fix'' the \n     new welfare law. And should the House fall to the Democrats, \n     ultraliberal committee chairmen will move quickly to undo \n     much of what the Republicans did legislatively on welfare, \n     crime, immigration and more.\n       The other and more fundamental reason is that, no matter \n     what happens in November, it is by no means certain that the \n     laws passed by the Republican Congress over the last two \n     years will survive administratively.\n\n\n                           bureaucratic wars\n\n       Victories won on the legislative battlefield are routinely \n     lost in the fog of bureaucratic wars over what the laws mean \n     and how best to implement them. One of many recent examples \n     is how the Federal Communications Commission has already \n     virtually rewritten the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n       On Feb. 8, President Clinton signed the first major rewrite \n     of telecommunications law in 62 years. To many observers, the \n     act represented the culmination of a series of political and \n     judicial decisions that began in 1974 when the U.S. Justice \n     Department filed an antitrust suit against AT, leading to a \n     breakup of the old telephone monopoly and the creation in \n     1984 of the seven regional ``Baby Bells.'' The bill-\n     signing ceremony, the first ever held at the Library of \n     Congress, was draped in symbolism. The president signed \n     the bill with a digital pen that put his signature on the \n     Internet. On a TV screen, Comedian Lily Tomlin played her \n     classic telephone company operator Ernestine, opening her \n     skit with ``one gigabyte'' instead of ``one ringle-\n     dinglie.''\n       During the debate over the bill and for weeks after its \n     enactment, the press played up the law's social-policy side-\n     shows, like the requirement that most new television sets \n     contain a ``V-chip'' enabling parents to lock out programs \n     deemed inappropriate for children. But its true significance \n     lay in removing barriers to competition in the \n     telecommunications industry, and devolving responsibility for \n     remaining regulation to the states. While its language is \n     often technical, you need not be a telecom junkie to \n     understand the letter of the law or the record of floor \n     debates in Congress.\n       For example, Sections 251 and 252 of the law promote \n     competition in local telephone markets, expressly giving \n     state commissions authority to decide, via a strictly \n     localized, case-specific process, what constitutes ``just and \n     reasonable'' rates. It affords the FCC no role whatsoever in \n     setting local exchange prices: ``Nothing in this chapter \n     shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission \n     jurisdiction with respect to . . . charges, classifications, \n     practices, facilities, or regulations for or in connection \n     with intrastate communication service.''\n       The law's devolutionary language and deregulatory intent \n     was so clear that groups such as the National Council of \n     Governors' Advisors quickly produced reports advising key \n     state and local decision makers to prepare for ``telewars in \n     the states.'' Soon, one NCGA report on the law explained, \n     ``governors' offices, state legislatures and state public \n     utility commissioners will be drawn into state debates on \n     how to ensure a `level playing field for competition' \n     among those firms seeking to provide local and intrastate \n     telephone service.'' The major battles, the NCGA \n     predicted, would be over the terms of price and \n     interconnection agreements. Telephone company rivals could \n     be expected to lobby governors, utility commissions and \n     state legislatures in search of allies.\n       But within six months of the law's enactment, the FCC \n     declared a victor in the ``telewars in the states''--namely, \n     itself. The commission produced a 600-page document \n     promulgating presumptive national pricing standards in local \n     telephone markets. The FCC insists that the order is \n     necessary to pry open local markets to long-distance carriers \n     like AT, small firms like Teleport, and cable and wireless \n     companies. Otherwise, the commission asserts, incumbent local \n     carriers like the Regional Bell Operating Companies will \n     remain invulnerable to real competition as potential entrants \n     to intrastate markets are forced to contend with 50 \n     different, localized state regulatory regimes.\n       But the FCC's rushed, revanchist rewrite of the \n     telecommunications law is based on a hypothetical pricing \n     scheme that only an armchair economist could love. In its \n     hundreds of pages of national regulatory dictates, the FCC \n     almost completely ignores the actual costs that local \n     companies incurred to create the system, and the regional and \n     other variation in how they operate.\n       On Aug. 28, GTE Corp. and Southern New England Telephone \n     Co. jointly challenged the FCC in court, arguing that the \n     FCC's order constitutes an uncompensated taking under the \n     Fifth Amendment by requiring them to sell their services \n     at below actual costs. The order, they claim, would almost \n     certainly enervate competition by permitting long-distance \n     giants like AT to buy up local phone networks at huge \n     discounts--an ironic potential outcome indeed given how \n     all this began in 1974. Moreover, not only giants like \n     AT but fly-by-night arbitrage artists could enrich \n     themselves at the expense of consumers on the spread \n     between actual operating costs and the prices set by the \n     FCC. In response to the suit, a federal appeals court \n     ordered a temporary stay of the FCC regulations and will \n     hear oral arguments in the case tomorrow.\n       At a recent press conference, GTE's senior vice president \n     and general counsel, former U.S. Attorney General William F. \n     Barr, demanded to know why the FCC believes that it is better \n     at making decisions ``for 50 states than the state \n     commissions are, who have done this historically, who have \n     all the data that are relevant to the state before them.''\n\n                               A Mockery\n\n       But whether or not the FCC is wiser than the states, but \n     regardless of who is right about the economics of the case, \n     the FCC bureaucrats' order mocks key provisions of a \n     democratically enacted law. The FCC's action is at odds not \n     only with the textbook understanding of ``how a bill becomes \n     law,'' but the first principles of limited government and \n     American constitutionalism.\n       The FCC's action should serve to remind us that the \n     devolution and deregulation of federal authority are always \n     in the administrative details. On telecommunications, \n     welfare, and almost every other major issue, big government \n     is the administrative state in which judges and unelected \n     officials, and not the elected representatives who debate and \n     enact the laws, govern us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12333-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12334-S12335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    1984 SINO-BRITISH JOINT RESOLUTION ON THE QUESTION OF HONG KONG\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, only 270 days of freedom remain for \nthe people of Hong Kong unless the principles of the 1984 Sino-British \nJoint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong are upheld and enforced. \nAlthough Governor Chris Patton proclaimed yesterday his intention not \nto go quietly from his post as last Governor of Hong Kong, his stated \ngoals do not go far enough. Martin Lee, Hong Kong's Democratic Party \nleader, correctly identified Patton's shortcomings on behalf of those \nwho will remain after Beijing takes control of the colony next July.\n  Governor Patton proclaimed yesterday that he intended to accomplish \nmany things during his remaining time in Hong Kong, but his proposed \nactions fall short of what is required. We see former Communist states \nall over the world transitioning to free market economies and forms of \ndemocratic governance. The United States and our friends and allies are \ninvesting a great deal of effort to aid and assist these transitions. \nWe cannot turn our backs on the only instance of a successful and \nshining free market democracy transitioning to the darkness of \ncommunism. I fear that this will happen on midnight of June 30, 1997.\n  The world must insist upon implementation of the Sino-British \nJoint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong signed in 1984. And then \nthe world must ensure Beijing upholds their agreement. Neither Beijing \nnor London should back down from this agreement now.\n\n  I commend Mr. Patton for his good work on freedom, stability, and \nprosperity during his tenure as Governor. He has pursued reforms while \nfacing resistance and indeed intimidation from Beijing. But he has been \nforced to compromise in order to maintain his relationship with \nBeijing. The price of this compromise is too great.\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\n  I must support Hong Kong's Democratic Party leader Martin Lee, who \nyesterday called on Patton to do more. I also call on the Government in \nLondon to do more. The people of Hong Kong should be asked to accept \nnothing less. The Joint Declaration of 1984 is an international treaty \nregistered in the United Nations. A violation of this treaty by either \nparty represents a violation of international law. London must hold \nBeijing to the terms of this treaty for the benefit of the people of \nHong Kong.\n  In assessing the situation today, we have Patton's speech and \nBeijing's promises, but we must focus not on words, but actions. I am \nprimarily concerned with actions taken by Beijing that undermine the \npromises made in the Joint Declaration. These include: harassing \njournalists by Beijing such as Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang; threatening \nto replace the democratically elected legislative council with an \nappointed provisional legislature; proposing to repeal Hong Kong's Bill \nof Rights; and assigning power of judicial interpretation to the \nnational People's Congress rather than Hong Kong's courts.\n\n  The United States must strongly urge Beijing to grant Hong Kong the \nlevel of autonomy promised in the Joint Declaration. United States \npolicy must acknowledge the Joint Declaration as an international \ntreaty possessing the force of law. It is a matter of international law \nthat the parties to the treaty abide by their solemn obligations \nundertaken in the Joint Declaration.\n  The United Kingdom should make a determination as to whether China's \nplans to replace the legislative council are a violation of the Joint \nDeclaration. But even if London fails in this responsibility, the \nUnited States cannot sit idly by when, by anyone's reasonable \ninterpretation, China violates its international treaty obligations, \nespecially when the stakes are as high as they are with Hong Kong.\n  Over the next 9 months, I intend to continue to raise the level of \nattention of the Hong Kong transition. The principles at stake touch \nthe core of the minimum standard of freedom upon which we must \ninsist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12334-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12335-S12336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, when I first came to the U.S. \nSenate, I was assigned to the Committee on Interior and Insular \nAffairs, which we of course know today as the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. As I prepare to finish my Senate career, I look back \non my years on that committee as the source of the most rewarding and \nintellectually stimulating challenges of my years here. From the Arab \nembargo of 1973 to the natural gas wars of 1978, from the complex \nAlaska land issues of the early 1980's to the National Energy Policy \nAct of 1992, we have been engaged in vitally important work that is \noften long on complexity and short on glamour.\n  I am proud of the record we achieved, not only during my 8 years as \nchairman, but throughout my service, and I wish today to say thank you \nto a professional staff unlike any other, one which has served the \ncommittee and the country so well over the years.\n  Some of the best minds in the country have served on the committee \nstaff over the years. Whatever their reasons for coming, I believe most \nstayed and relished their time there because they found themselves in \nthe company of other keen minds, and they knew that their mission would \nnot be mortgaged to politics and that their task was to find honest, \npragmatic, workable solutions to vexing problems. Almost all of them \nhave gone on to rewarding careers in government and business, and I can \nonly hope they were as enriched by their experience as the public \nproduct was by their service.\n  Luckily for me, some of the very best and brightest have remained to \nassist me as my service in this body comes to a close.\n\n\n                               ben cooper\n\n  One of those staff members who has served me the longest and with \nparticular distinction is the minority staff director of the committee, \nDr. Ben Cooper. About the time I joined the committee, we became \ninvolved in the development of national energy policy in response to \nthe crude oil supply interruptions in the Middle East that were \ndisrupting our domestic economy. The committee has continued to be \ninvolved deeply in this issue, as indicated by its current name, which \nwas attached to the committee during the reorganization of Senate \ncommittees that occurred in early 1977.\n  Shortly after I joined the committee, a long-haired doctor of physics \njoined the Democratic committee staff from Iowa State, where he had \nbeen an instructor. He first joined the staff as a congressional \nscience fellow employed by the then-chairman, our dear departed \ncolleague, Senator Henry M. Jackson. Since those early days, I have \nworked closely with Ben, who officially became part of my staff in \n1981, when I became ranking minority member of the committee. Ben has \ncontinued with me through my chairmanship of the committee and through \nour return to the minority.\n  Mr. President, there can be no better staff than Dr. Ben Cooper. He \nis perhaps the only remaining staff of either the House or Senate who \nhas a complete institutional memory of the evolution of modern Federal \nenergy policy. Ben has been active on energy issues that range from \ncrude oil pricing to natural gas deregulation to the current electric \nrestructuring debate. Ben is particularly an expert on nuclear policy, \nas would be expected from his physics background. I can say without \nreservation that Ben has played an active and, usually, key staff role \non every piece of legislation relating to nuclear matters that has been \nconsidered by Congress in the last 20 years. In addition, Ben has \nplayed a key role on non-energy-related legislation ranging from public \nlands legislation to the risk assessment legislation that has been \nconsidered by the Senate during the last two Congresses.\n  Mr. President, throughout his long career as Senate staff, Ben has \nearned a reputation for honesty and professionalism both among the \nstaff and Members of the House and Senate. Unfortunately for the Senate \nand, I believe, the process of developing sound public policy, Ben has \nindicated that he will be leaving the Senate by the end of the year to \npursue new challenges.\n  Mr. President, my friendship with Dr. Ben Cooper will continue, but \nour daily interaction is not likely to continue, and I will miss Ben's \ndaily good counsel tremendously. I commend Ben for a career well spent \nand well conducted, congratulate him on the contribution he has made to \nour Nation and wish him the best in his future pursuits.\n\n\n                              tom williams\n\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been fortunate \nto have a second long-term Democratic staff member who is as eminent in \nhis field as is Dr. Cooper in the field of energy policy. I refer, of \ncourse, to Tom Williams, who is without equal in his knowledge of \nFederal policy toward public lands, national parks, the U.S. Forest \nService and a variety of lands issues relating to the great State of \nAlaska.\n  Tom joined the Democratic staff of the committee in 1973 and has \ncontinued his service with the committee through today, except for a \nbrief interlude at the Department of the Interior early in the current \nadministration. During his service with the committee, Tom has served \nas key staff on every public lands and national parks bill that has \nbeen considered or enacted by the U.S. Senate. No staff member in the \nCongress has a greater institutional knowledge of these important, and \noften divisive issues that are often at once arcane and tremendously \nimportant both to the Nation as a whole and to individuals that may be \naffected directly by Federal policy.\n\n  I have had the pleasure of considering Tom ``my'' staff since I \nbecame ranking member of the committee in 1981. Throughout that period \nof time, I have valued Tom's counsel not only on the parks and lands \nissues, but on a host of other issues including the mining reform \nlegislation that has been considered by the committee in the past \nseveral Congresses. Tom has the ability to counsel wisely and honestly \non the various policy options available and on the often diametrically \nopposed arguments of industry and the environmental community. Tom has \nthat great ability, shared by Ben Cooper and many of my staff, to \nremain calm and\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\nprofessional in the midst of the hottest and most divisive debates. For \nthat reason, among others, Tom Williams has earned an excellent \nreputation among Members and staff alike in both the House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, I will miss my daily interaction with Tom, but I \nunderstand that Tom's talents will not be lost to the Senate or the \npublic. I understand that Tom desires to continue in his service and I \nam sure that my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, \nwho will become the ranking Democrat on the committee, will continue \nTom's service with the committee.\n  Mr. President, I extend my thanks to Tom for his service and counsel \nto me and for his friendship, and I am pleased that the committee and \nthe Senate will continue to have access to Tom's talents and service.\n\n\n                               SAM FOWLER\n\n  A uniquely talented attorney serves as minority chief counsel of the \ncommittee: Sam Fowler. Sam has a long history of distinguished public \nservice, first with the Smithsonian Institution, then with the \nPresident's Council on Environmental Quality, next with the House \nInterior and Insular Affairs Committee and, finally, beginning in 1991, \nwith our committee.\n  Mr. President, Sam is a lawyer's lawyer. If Sam says the law says X, \nthen you can be sure that the law says X. He is one of the most \nfastidious and careful researchers I have ever encountered. He has a \nspecial talent for expressing himself through the written word in a \nconcise and precise manner.\n  Sam has staffed many issues in which I have taken particular \ninterest. Perhaps in no area has his contribution been greater than in \nthe area of nuclear policy. Sam has exhibited the rare talent, at least \namong lawyers, for mastering the scientific terms and concepts \nassociated with the development of nuclear power and the safe disposal \nof nuclear waste.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not mention one \nother activity of Sam's that has enlightened and enriched my life and \nthose of the committee staff. Sam, on his own time, prepares incisive \nmemoranda that trace the history and development of various aspects of \nthe institution of republican government. Among his topics have been a \nhistory of gift rules, privileged motions, and the evolution of the \nmodern State of the Union address. This aspect of Sam's life \nillustrates his wonderful intellectual curiosity that is so vital in \ngood staff.\n  Mr. President, Sam is a treasure of the committee, a treasure I will \nmiss greatly.\n\n\n                              DAVID BROOKS\n\n  David Brooks came over from the House Interior Committee to join our \nstaff in 1989. He has played a major role in shaping much of this \ncountry's recent policy on public lands, national parks, and historic \npreservation. The California Desert Protection Act is one such example \nof David's craftsmanship. And there could be no more appropriate bill \nwith which to associate David--whom we often refer to as the third \nSenator from Arizona --than the Arizona Wilderness Act, to which he \ndevoted his unstinting attention. If we are fortunate enough to see \nenactment of the pending omnibus parks bill before the end of this \nCongress, it will owe in significant measure to David's determination \nand negotiating skills. His great knowledge and exemplary work ethic \nhave added so much to the work of our committee, and I am most \ngrateful.\n\n\n                               BOB SIMON\n\n  In 1993, I learned that Bob Simon of the Department of Energy would \nbe detailed to the Energy and Natural Resouces Committee. Bob had \nstarted working for the Department during the Bush administration, and \nmy staff director, Ben Cooper, told me of the high regard he had for \nBob's acumen and integrity. I can say now from the perspective of 3 \nyears later that Ben's endorsement, strong though it was, has turned \nout to be an understatement.\n  While many agency detailees treat their time with congressional \noffices as something like school without the examinations, Bob took his \nopportunity very seriously and began distinguishing himself almost \nimmediately by his deft and thorough handling of difficult issues. \nSince coming on board, Bob has won the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues on the staff and the trust of the members who rely on his \nwork, and he has demonstrated his possession of a rare combination of \nattributes--intellectual and technical mastery, outstanding political \nand strategic judgment, and complete reliability--which has made his \nwork extremely valuable.\n  In particular, Bob's knowledge and expertise in the area of the \nFederal Government's energy research programs is unrivaled. And on the \nissue of risk assessment, which is only matched in its importance to \nthe Nation by its lack of glamour and its complexity, Bob Simon \nprovided staff work that was truly remarkable for its thoroughness and \nincisiveness.\n  I want to express my sincere appreciation for Bob Simon's hard work \nand dedication, and I wish him the very best in the future.\n\n\n                              CLIFF SIKORA\n\n  No subject has presented more of a challenge to my committee or \nconsumed more of our time than the vast issue of electricity \nderegulation, and I am frank to say that the sterling work done by \nBetsy Moeller, Don Santa, and Bill Conway raised the bar significantly \non my expectations for staff work in this area.\n  I am pleased to say that Cliff Sikora, whom we enticed to come from \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has more than met those \nstandards. I am persuaded that no one in the country has a more \ncommanding overall grasp of the thorny issue of electricity \nderegulation than Cliff, and he has done an exceptional job of bringing \nthose talents to bear to assist me and other members of the committee \nin our deliberations in the scant year or so that he has been on the \nstaff.\n\n\n                              VICKI THORNE\n\n  Vicki Thorne, through her years as majority and minority office \nmanager and clerk, has performed the unsung, often unnoticed, but \nalways critical job of keeping the committee running, whether in \norganizing hearings, supervising publications, or playing den mother to \na large and diverse family of staff. Her efficiency has been matched \nonly by an equable temperament and warm smile that enabled her and us \nto get our way far more often than not. She has my deepest thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12335-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12336-S12338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. Cohen. Mr. President, I am submitting for the Record a \nWashington Post article about two young boys here on Capitol Hill, who \nrecently deliberately inflicted pain upon someone's pet dog just for \nthe fun of it. The Post article states that the dog was a friendly \nanimal toward people. Witnesses state they saw the dog wagging its tail \nand going up to the two youths, expecting to be petted. Instead, one of \nthe boys slapped the dog, took it to the top of an apartment building \nand hurled it to the ground.\n  Research suggests that people who abuse animals require immediate \nattention. They are involved in a cycle of violence, either as a \nvictim, perpetrator, or both. These violent symptoms manifested by a \ntroubled youth appear to be a particularly important and accurate early \nindicator of future violent behavior. Numerous experts cite the link \nbetween animal abuse and human violence as one early warning signal \nthat the people involved in such acts of violence may either be a \nvictim, or a perpetrator in some violent incidents. Experts state that \nthose who are abusive to animals lack empathy, compassion, and respect \nfor life. However, researchers agree that these personality attributes \ncan be taught. A successful example of such, is the country of Israel, \nwhere a national humane education program to reduce violent crime in \ntheir country has been implemented.\n  Research on this issue also compels us to take action to detect, \ntreat, and prevent perpetrators of animal violence before they turn \ntheir violent impulses toward humans. Many experts agree that animal \nabuse is not just a personality flaw of the abuser, but may be an \nindication of a deeply disturbed family. The Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation has conducted research on the correlation between people \nwho are abusers of animals to their committing future violent acts. In \nnumerous interviews with prison inmates convicted of violent crimes, \nthe deliberate infliction of pain on animals was a common link.\n  Last May, I advised Attorney General Janet Reno that cruelty to \nanimals is a particularly troublesome\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\nmanifestation of youth violence. I encouraged the Attorney General to \nreview the Justice Department's plan of action in exposing the \ncorrelation between animal and human violence, that prevention and \ntreatment may begin. Since that time, I have been working with the \nJustice Department, law enforcement officials, and others in evaluating \nthis linkage and how this knowledge can be used to decrease crime among \njuveniles.\n  Mr. President, today I wrote to Donna Shalala, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services Secretary, and encouraged her to begin a \nprogram to educate the social services communities about the \ncorrelation between animal and human violence. I also wrote to Richard \nRiley, the Department of Education Secretary, encouraging him to \nimplement an educational program among school guidance counselors, \nteachers, and school administrators in recognizing the signs of \nviolence. School officials and the social services communities are \namong the first to recognize and work with troubled youth. Many see \nfirst hand the early symptoms of abusive behavior toward animals. \nHowever, most of these officials do not realize the correlation between \nanimal abusers and the cycle of violence.\n  It is necessary for us to look at ways to reduce violence in this \ncountry. It makes good sense to evaluate further this correlation, \nwhich the FBI has used for almost two decades now in profiling serial \nkillers and other violent offenders. Implementation of a humane \neducation program in the school systems throughout the United States of \nAmerica offers some hope for reduction of violence among our youth and \nat this point, any sensible approach should not be dismissed.\n  Mr. President, I also submit for the Record an interview with an FBI \nagent and professor at the FBI Academy in Quantico, VA, with the Humane \nSociety of the United States. I believe it is time for Americans to \npursue seriously every avenue to address and eliminate the cycle of \nviolence.\n  I ask that these items be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n            Coco the Spaniel Is Sent Plunging Three Stories\n\n                           (By Linda Wheeler)\n\n       D.C. police are searching for two boys who walked a \n     neighbor's dog up three flights of stairs to the roof of a \n     Capitol Hill apartment building and then dropped her to the \n     hard earth below.\n       Coco, a liver-and-white Brittany spaniel, landed spread-\n     eagled, her right front leg shattered and the left limp from \n     nerve damage.\n       ``The [right] leg is blasted, what we call a high-energy \n     fracture,'' said veterinarian Peter Glassman, of Friendship \n     Hospital for Animals in Northwest Washington, ``Thank God we \n     don't see these kind of injuries very often.''\n       According to Washington Humane Society officials, most \n     animal cruelty cases in the city involve pets that have been \n     starved or beaten by their owners. Rarely are they \n     deliberately hurt by strangers, said Rosemary Vozobule, the \n     society's law enforcement officer.\n       ``This was a very sweet dog, and she just went up to these \n     kids,'' she said. ``We have reports that one boy yelled at \n     her and slapped her. Then he took her to the roof.''\n       The dogs owners, Nancy and Harold Smalley, live a block \n     from the Kentucky Court housing complex in Southeast \n     Washington, where the incident occurred Sept. 9. Nancy \n     Smalley said that Coco, adopted two years ago from the D.C. \n     Animal Shelter, was never allowed to roam. Coco must have \n     slipped out of the house, she said, when Harold Smalley left \n     for work early that morning.\n       ``He took the trash out. He was half asleep,'' she said.\n       When Nancy Smalley couldn't find Coco to join their other \n     dog--a black Labrador retriever named Mr. B--and five cats \n     for breakfast, she called her husband. Had he taken Coco with \n     him? No, he said. She then called the shelter to report Coco \n     missing. The dog had a collar and name tag, she told them.\n       About the same time, someone called the shelter to report \n     an injured dog. It was Coco, belly-down on the packed earth, \n     which is so hard that no grass grows there. Someone had \n     covered her with a tattered blanket. Humane officers took the \n     dog back to the shelter for evaluation and called Nancy \n     Smalley.\n       When she saw Coco a few minutes later, she said, ``my mind \n     went blank. It was impossible for me to believe anyone would \n     do this to a dog. I just couldn't understand it. I can't \n     understand it. These things aren't supposed to happen.''\n       Despite her trauma, Coco struggles to balance on three feet \n     and leans against a visitor's leg to have her head patted. \n     Her right leg is in a cast, and the left dangles almost \n     daintily. If she doesn't recover feeling in that leg, \n     Glassman said, it will have to be amputated, because she will \n     drag it and scrape it, leaving her vulnerable to constant \n     infection.\n       ``She's a very sweet dog,'' Glassman said, adding that she \n     would be able to get along fine on three legs.\n       Vozobule said she has received several calls from neighbors \n     who saw the incident or heard the boys talking about it. \n     There is a $1,500 award for information leading to the arrest \n     of the suspects, she said.\n       Vozobule said although what happened to Coco is ``tragic,'' \n     she is pleased that residents were willing to call in tips. \n     ``I think people are starting to realize treating animals \n     this way just isn't right,'' she said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                             Deadly Serious\n\n\n                  an fbi perspective on animal cruelty\n\n                  (By Randall Lockwood and Ann Church)\n\n       The HSUS has a long history of working closely with local, \n     state, and federal law enforcement agencies to combat cruelty \n     to animals. Many of these agencies have become acutely \n     interested in the connection between animal cruelty and other \n     forms of violent, antisocial behavior. They have found that \n     the investigation and prosecution of crimes against animals \n     is an important tool for identifying people who are, or may \n     become, perpetrators of violent crimes against people.\n       Earlier this year Sen. William Cohen of Maine formally \n     asked U.S. attorney general Janet Reno to accelerate the U.S. \n     Department of Justice's research in this area. On June 6 The \n     HSUS met with the staff of Senator Cohen and Sen. Robert \n     Smith of New Hampshire and with representatives of the FBI \n     and the Justice Department. One participant was Supervisory \n     Special Agent Alan Brantley of the FBI's Investigative \n     Support Unit (ISU), also known as the Behavioral Science \n     Unit. The ISU is responsible for providing information on the \n     behavior of violent criminals to FBI field offices and law \n     enforcement agencies worldwide. Special Agent Brantley served \n     as a psychologist at a maximum-security prison in North \n     Carolina before joining the FBI. He has interviewed and \n     profiled numerous violent criminals and has direct knowledge \n     of their animal-abuse histories. In his role as an ISU \n     special agent, he shares that information with agents at the \n     FBI Academy and law enforcement officers selected to attend \n     the FBI's National Academy Program. When we asked Special \n     Agent Brantley how many serial killers had a history of \n     abusing animals, his response was, ``The real question should \n     be, how many have not?''\n       As law enforcement officials become more aware of the \n     connection between animal abuse and human-directed violence, \n     they become more supportive of strong anticruelty laws and \n     their enforcement. We are encouraged by this development. We \n     were granted permission to visit the FBI Academy, in \n     Quantico, Virginia, to continue our discussion with Special \n     Agent Brantley.\n       HSUS: What is the history of the Behavioral Science Unit/\n     ISU?\n       Brantley: The Behavioral Science Unit originated in the \n     1970s and is located at the FBI Academy. Its purpose is to \n     teach behavioral sciences to FBI trainees and National \n     Academy students. The instructors were often asked questions \n     about violent criminals, such as, ``What do you think causes \n     a person to do something like this?'' The instructors offered \n     some ideas, and as the students went out and applied some of \n     these ideas, it was seen that there might be some merit to \n     using this knowledge in field operations. In the mid-1980s, \n     the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime was \n     founded with the primary mission of identifying and tracking \n     serial killers, but it also was given the task of looking at \n     any violent crime that was particularly vicious, unusual, or \n     repetitive, including serial rape and child molestation. We \n     now look at and provide operational assistance to law \n     enforcement agencies and prosecutors worldwide who are \n     confronted with any type of violent crime.\n       HSUS: You have said that the FBI takes the connection \n     between animal cruelty and violent crime very seriously. How \n     is this awareness applied on a daily basis?\n       Brantley: A lot of what we do is called threat assessment. \n     If we have a known subject, we want as much information as we \n     can obtain from family members, co-workers, local police, and \n     others, before we offer an opinion about this person's threat \n     level and dangerousness. Something we believe is prominently \n     displayed in the histories of people who are habitually \n     violent is animal abuse. We look not only for a history of \n     animal abuse, torment, or torture, but also for childhood or \n     adolescent acts of violence toward other children and \n     possibly adults and for a history of destructiveness to \n     property.\n       Sometimes this violence against animals is symbolic. We \n     have had cases where individuals had an early history of \n     taking stuffed animals or even pictures of animals and \n     carving them up. That is a risk indicator.\n       You can look at cruelty to animals and cruelty to humans as \n     a continuum. We first see people begin to fantasize about \n     these violent actions. If there is escalation along this \n     continuum, we may see acting out against inanimate objects. \n     This may also be manifest in the writings or drawings of the \n     individual affected. The next phase is usually acting out \n     against animals.\n       HSUS: When did the FBI first begin to see this connection?\n\n[[Page S12338]]\n\n       Brantley: We first quantified it when we did research in \n     the late 1970s, interviewing thirty-six multiple murderers in \n     prison. This kind of theme had already emerged in our work \n     with violent criminals. We all believed this was an important \n     factor, so we said, ``Let's go and ask the offenders \n     themselves and see what they have to say about it.'' By self \n     report, 36 percent described killing and torturing animals as \n     children and 46 percent said they did this as adolescents. We \n     believe that the real figure was much higher, but that people \n     might not have been willing to admit to it.\n       HSUS: You mean that people who commit multiple, brutal \n     murders might be reluctant to admit to killing animals?\n       Brantley: I believe that to be true in some cases. In the \n     inmate population, it's one thing to be a big-time criminal \n     and kill people--many inmates have no empathy or concern for \n     human victims--but they might identify with animals. I've \n     worked with prisoners who kept pets even though they weren't \n     supposed to. They would consider someone else hurting their \n     pet as reason enough to commit homicide. Also, within \n     prisons, criminals usually don't want to talk about what they \n     have done to animals or children for fear that other inmates \n     may retaliate against them or that they may lose status among \n     their peers.\n       HSUS: Where is violence against animals coming from? Are \n     criminals witnessing it in others? Convicted serial killer \n     Ted Bundy recounted being forced to watch his grandfather's \n     animal abuse.\n       Brantley: For the most part, in my experience, offenders \n     who harm animals as children pretty much come up with this on \n     their own. Quite often they will do this in the presence of \n     others and teach it to others, but the ones with a rich \n     history of violence are usually the instigators. Some \n     children might follow along to be accepted, but the ones we \n     need to worry about are the one or two dominant, influential \n     children who initiate the cruelty.\n       HSUS: What components need to be present for you to think a \n     child or adolescent is really in trouble?\n       Brantley: You have to look at the quality of the act and at \n     the frequency and severity. If a child kicks the dog when \n     somebody's been aggressive toward him, that's one issue, but \n     if it's a daily thing or if he has a pattern of tormenting \n     and physically torturing the family dog or cat, that's \n     another. I would look to see if the pattern is escalating. I \n     look at any type of abuse of an animal as serious to begin \n     with, unless I have other information that might explain it. \n     It should not be dismissed. I've seen it too often develop \n     into something more severe.\n       Some types of abuse, for example, against insects, seem to \n     be fundamentally different. Our society doesn't consider \n     insects attractive or worthy of affection. But our pets are \n     friendly and affectionate and they often symbolically \n     represent the qualities and characteristics of human beings. \n     Violence against them indicates violence that may well \n     escalate into violence against humans.\n       You also need to look at the bigger picture. What's going \n     on at home? What other supports, if any, are in place? How is \n     the child doing in school? Is he drinking or doing drugs?\n       HSUS: We are familiar with the ``classic'' cases of serial \n     killers, like Jeffrey Dahmer, who had early histories of \n     animal abuse (see the Summer 1986 HSUS News). Are there any \n     recent cases you have worked on?\n       Brantley: The Jason Massey case jumps out as being a \n     prominent one. This was a case from 1993 in Texas. This \n     individual, from an early age, started his career killing \n     many dogs and cats. He finally graduated, at the age of 20, \n     to beheading a thirteen-year-old girl and shooting her \n     fourteen-year-old stepbrother to death.\n       He was convicted of murder. I was brought in for the \n     sentencing phase to testify as to his dangerousness and \n     future threat to the community. The prosecutors knew that he \n     was a prolific killer of animals, and that he was saving the \n     body parts of these animals. The prosecutor discovered a \n     cooler full of animal remains that belonged to Massey and \n     brought it to the courtroom for the sentencing hearing. It \n     caused the jurors to react strongly, and ultimately the \n     sentence was death.\n       HSUS: Mr. Massey had been institutionalized at his mother's \n     request two years before the murders since she was aware of \n     his diaries, which recorded his violent fantasies, and his \n     animal killings, yet he was released. Do you think that \n     mental health officials have been slower than law enforcement \n     agencies in taking animal abuse seriously?\n       Brantley: We've made this a part of a lot of our training \n     for local police, and I think most police recognize that when \n     they see animal mutilation or torture that they need to check \n     it out; but police have to triage and prioritize their cases. \n     We try to tell people that investigating animal cruelty and \n     investigating homicides may not be mutually exclusive.\n       We are trying to do the same for mental health \n     professionals. We offer training to forensic psychiatrists \n     through a fellowship program and provide other training to \n     the mental health community. I think psychiatrists are \n     receptive to our message when we can give them examples and \n     case studies demonstrating this connection. The word is \n     getting out.\n       HSUS: Do you think more aggressive prosecution of animal-\n     cruelty cases can help get some people into the legal system \n     who might otherwise slip through?\n       Brantley: I think that it is a legitimate way to deal with \n     someone who poses a threat. Remember, Al Capone was finally \n     imprisoned for income-tax evasion rather than for murder or \n     racketeering-charges which could never be proven.\n       HSUS: Have you ever encountered a situation where extreme \n     or repeated animal cruelty is the only warning sign you see \n     in an individual, where there is no other violent behavior? \n     Or does such abuse not occur in a vacuum?\n       Brantley: I would agree with that last concept. But let's \n     say that you do have a case of an individual who seems not to \n     have had any other adjustment problems but is harming \n     animals. What that says is that while, up to that point, \n     there is no documented history of adjustment problems, there \n     are adjustment problems now and there could be greater \n     problems down the road. We have some kids who start early and \n     move toward greater and greater levels of violence, some who \n     get into it starting in adolescence, and some who are adults \n     before they start to blossom into violent offenders.\n       HSUS: Do you find animal cruelty developing in those who \n     have already begun killing people?\n       Brantley: We know that certain types of offenders who have \n     escalated to human victims will, at times, regress back to \n     earlier offenses such as making obscene phone calls, stalking \n     people, or killing animals. Rarely, if ever, do we see humans \n     being killed as a precursor to the killing of animals.\n       HSUS: How would you respond to the argument that animal \n     cruelty provides an outlet that prevents violent individuals \n     from acting against people?\n       Brantley: I would disagree with that. Animal cruelty is not \n     as serious as killing human beings, we have to agree to that, \n     but certainly it's moving in a very ominous direction. This \n     is not a harmless venting of emotion in a healthy individual; \n     this is a warning sign that this individual is not mentally \n     healthy and needs some sort of intervention. Abusing animals \n     does not dissipate those violent emotions; instead, it may \n     fuel them.\n       HSUS: What problems do you have in trying to assess the \n     dangerousness of suspect or a known offender?\n       Brantley: Getting background information is the main \n     problem. People know this person has done these things, but \n     there may be no record or we haven't found the right people \n     to interview.\n       HSUS: That's one of the reasons why we have put an emphasis \n     on stronger anticruelty laws and more aggressive \n     encorcement--to get such information in the record.\n       Brantley: A lot of time people who encounter this kind of \n     behavior are looking for the best in people. We also see \n     cases where people are quite frankly afraid to get involved, \n     because it they are dealing with a child or adult who seems \n     to be bizarre or threatening, they are afraid that he or she \n     may no longer kill animals but instead come after them. I've \n     seen a lot of mental health professionals, law enforcement \n     officers, and private citizens who don't want to get involved \n     because they are afraid . . . and for good reason. There are \n     very scary people out there doing scary things. That's \n     largely why they are doing it and talking about it: they want \n     to intimidate and shock and offend, sometimes regardless of \n     the consequences.\n       HSUS: Is there hope for such an individual?\n       Brantley: The earlier you can intervene, the better off \n     you'll be. I like to be optimistic. I think in the vast \n     majority of cases, especially if you get to them as children, \n     you can intervene. People shouldn't discount animal abuse as \n     a childish prank or childish experimentation.\n       HSUS: Have you ever seen any serial killers who have been \n     rehabilitated?\n       Brantley: I've seen no examples of it and no real efforts \n     to even attempt it! Even if you had a program that might \n     work, the potential consequences of being wrong and releasing \n     someone like that greatly outweigh the benefits of attempting \n     it, in my opinion.\n       HSUS: There is also a problem in trying to understand which \n     acts against animals and others are associated with the \n     escalation of violence, since police records, if they exist, \n     are often unavailable or juvenile offenses are expunged. \n     Sometimes only local humane societies or animal-control \n     agencies have any record. The HSUS hopes to facilitate \n     consolidating some of these records.\n       Brantley: That would be great.

All of the staff over these years have been \nexcellent, but at this time I want to especially recognize the three \nmost senior staffers in my Washington office for their special talents \nand contributions.\n\n[[Page S12339]]\n\n                              PATSY GUYER\n\n  When I arrived in Washington in November 1972, I was taken in tow by \nBill Cochrane of the Rules Committee, who gave me invaluable assistance \nand counsel in setting up my office. Like most new Senators, I was \nshort-handed and uncertain about the best way to staff my office and \ndeal with the avalanche of mail, telephone calls, and visitors. Bill \nmentioned to me that he knew of a young woman, Patsy Guyer, who had \nworked with him on the staff of Senator B. Everett Jordan of North \nCarolina, and who was available and was a prodigious worker. She was \nquickly hired, and I don't think her output has slowed one iota over \nthe 24 years she has been on my staff. As my executive assistant, Patsy \nhas handled a huge array of responsibilities over the years, ranging \nfrom supervising State offices to managing summer interns, to creating \nand overseeing an exceptionally efficient mail operation.\n  But if Patsy should be singled out for anything, it is her management \nof and deep personal commitment to a case work operation that is \nunmatched in the volume and quality of service it has rendered to \ncountless thousands of Louisianians in need. I am very proud of the aid \nmy office has given over the years to people who had nowhere else to \nturn, whether it was securing a visa, locating a loved one, or breaking \nan impasse on a disability payment or a VA widow's benefits.\n  We were able to be effective principally because Patsy Guyer has an \nastounding network of friends and colleagues throughout the Congress \nand among Federal agencies and, most of all, because she greeted every \ncase, no matter how routine, with the enthusiasm and commitment she \nbrought to her first day on the job in November of 1972. Whether the \nchallenge was to bring home from Abu Dhabi a tragically injured \nLouisiana businessman, locate a missing child in a Rwandan refugee camp \nor organize a food airlift to Cambodia, we always knew Patsy would have \nthe ingenuity and contacts to start the process and the absolutely \niron-willed determination and dedication to see it through to \ncompletion. I have never known a more selfless and giving individual, \nand I know I speak for untold thousands in Louisiana in expressing deep \ngratitude for the extraordinary service that this loyal daughter of \nNorth Carolina has rendered to Louisiana and our country.\n\n\n                              BECKY PUTENS\n\n  Mr. President, as many Senators know, Becky Putens has been my \npersonal secretary for the last 18 years. While that is her title, it \nhardly does justice to the multitude of roles that she has had to play \nin that time. She has been my gatekeeper, my scheduler, my right-hand \nperson; she keeps track of where I need to be, arranges how I will get \nthere, and generally has acted as a buffer between me and the enormous \nnumber of outside demands on my time and attention that go along with \nbeing a Senator. Most of all, though, Becky Putens is a fixer: she \ntakes care of problems, from the routine to the seemingly \ninsurmountable, with an aplomb and calmness that is remarkable, and \nthat has, in countless large and small ways, made my time as a Senator \nmore effective, more efficient, and generally more fun.\n  As my colleagues and her peers--a group of Senators' personal \nsecretaries who call themselves the Senior Babes--can attest, the small \narea just outside a Senator's personal office often takes on the aspect \nof Grand Central Station at rush hour. Becky is the person who keeps it \nall together and running smoothly. Through it all, and maybe because of \nit all, Becky displays a sense of humor and a way with people and with \nwords that is legendary among many of the longtime staff and Senators. \nFor someone in a position that is always demanding and often thankless, \nsuch an attitude and outlook is almost a requirement, and for me it has \noften served to make even the most tiring and demanding days and nights \nin the Senate bearable.\n  But, to me, the most fundamental aspect of Becky's personality is her \nunquestioning dedication. Whatever the circumstances, however late or \nearly, on weekends or during vacations, if I am there, Becky is there; \nif I am under the gun, Becky is at my side. In short, in a field of \nendeavor where loyalty is an often-invoked but seldom-realized ideal, \nBecky personifies it. I am grateful for her service.\n\n\n                              ERIC SILAGY\n\n  Mr. President, Eric Silagy has managed to pack more achievements into \nhis brief career than any young man I know. He came to my office in \n1987, fresh out of the University of Texas. In less than 2 years, he \nwas chief scheduler for a Senate campaign that was as politically \nsignificant and hard fought as any in this century. His intelligence, \ngood judgment and youthful energy were important factors in our \nvictory. For the next 4 years, he served as my legislative assistant \nwhile attending Georgetown University Law School, performing superbly \nin both capacities. Since 1994, he has been my administrative assistant \nand chief of staff. Thanks to his excellent organizational skills and \nhis tact and good humor, it is an office that has been a productive \nworkplace for a happy, hardworking, and extremely talented staff.\n  Just as important to me as his skill in running the office, however, \nhas been his remarkable political and policy judgment, which I rely \nupon in making all the most crucial decisions that come before me; and \nhis extraordinary effectiveness in getting the job done, no matter what \nthe odds against it. Once a legislative goal has been targeted, there \nis very little that can stand in the way of Eric's efforts to achieve \nit. In short, while some divide the world into thinkers and doers, Eric \nSilagy manages to combine the best aspects of both. I want to express \nmy gratitude for his diligence and devotion, and commend him for a job \nwell done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12338-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     VERMONT'S GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER CORP.

Mr. President, encouraging strong reading habits \nin schoolchildren is a goal that we all share. Reading skills are a \ncore element of the National Education Goals, and literacy is the \nsubject of a new Presidential initiative.\n  To highlight the importance of reading, I would like to take a brief \nmoment to describe the achievements of an innovative program at a very \nspecial school in New Mexico that I believe captures what we should all \nbe trying to do to promote reading.\n  This fall, the lunch period at Dolores Gonzales Elementary School in \nAlbuquerque will be satisfying a different kind of appetite: A hunger \nfor reading. Thanks to their Join-a-School Partners--Sunwest Bank, \nBueno Foods, the Albuquerque Zoological Park, and community members--\nmore than 50 students at Dolores Gonzales Elementary will have a \npartner to read with under a pilot program which I helped initiate at \nthe school last spring.\n  The Read-Write-Now program pairs an adult volunteer with a student \nfrom Dolores Gonzales for reading. The program has grown from a dozen \nor so volunteers last spring to more than 50 this fall. I commend \nprincipal Dora Ortiz and her dedicated staff and teachers for fostering \nthe Read-Write-Now program at their school.\n  I borrowed the idea from a similar program which originated in New \nYork City. Volunteers pledge 1 lunch hour a week for the entire \nsemester to read with the children. This one-on-one approach helps the \nchildren develop their reading ability and love of books, as well as \nmake a new friend. It is impossible to overestimate the value of this\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\nprogram because so much of one's educational and personal success is \nbuilt on one's ability to read.\n  If we are to be a nation of learners and achievers, we have to first \nbe a nation of readers. A recent National Educational Goals Panel \nreport indicated that students in New Mexico and many other States are \nnot achieving in reading comprehension as well as they need to do in \norder to succeed in school and work.\n  This initiative will help us improve, and I would urge other \nbusinesses in our communities in New Mexico and around the Nation to \ninitiate the Read-Write-Now program at their partner schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12339-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL MARKET IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate \npassed the conference report to H.R. 3005, the National Market \nImprovement Act of 1996, on Tuesday, November 1, 1996. This bill is a \ncritical piece of legislation that will streamline securities \nregulation and provide important investor and consumer protections--\nmaintaining the preeminence of the U.S. capital markets.\n  Section 102 of the bill will enable issuers whose securities are \nlisted or authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the \nAmerican Stock Exchange, the National Market System of the Nasdaq or a \ncomparable exchange (or tier or segment thereof) to register those \nsecurities only with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those \nissuers would not have to register their listed securities--or those \nsecurities that have been authorized for listing--with the 50 States.\n  The conferees intended for this provision to accord equal treatment \nto each of the exchanges explicitly listed in the statute (the New York \nStock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Market System \nof the Nasdaq) as well as any other exchange (or segment or tier \nthereof) with comparable listing standards.\n  The conferees are concerned, however, that a strict reading of the \nstatutory language may lead to the interpretation that the conferees \nintended the provision to accomplish something different than absolute \nparity of treatment among the eligible exchanges. Mr. President, this \nis unequivocally not the case.\n  In the future, I will seek to correct the drafting error to avoid any \nambiguity in the statute. Pending that legislative fix, I take this \nopportunity to make the record clear--the conferees intended for \nissuers whose securities are listed or authorized for listing on the \nNational Market System of the Nasdaq to be exempt from State \nregistration requirements under section 102 of H.R. 3005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12340-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. BILL WILEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have been privileged in my \ncareer in the U.S. Senate, through my work on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development, to work with many of the great scientific minds \nof this country. I rise today to pay tribute to one of those scientists \nwith whom I worked especially closely and who was a longtime close \npersonal friend before his death last summer.\n  Dr. Bill Wiley of the Battelle Memorial Institute built a monumental \ncareer and left a huge legacy first and foremost because of his special \ngifts and training as a fine scientist. His achievements over his 30-\nyear career with Battelle, beginning as a staff research scientist and \nending with his position as vice president for Science and Technology, \ncontributed significantly to this country's scientific understanding.\n  But I believe that the work for which Bill Wiley should and will be \nbest remembered is the concrete result of his vision which is now \nnearing completion on the banks of the Columbia River in Richland, WA, \nthe Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), which will be \nthe jewel of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and which may \nvery well hold the key to this country's Herculean effort to the \ncleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and other, similar sites \naround the country.\n  Armed only with this vision and his irrepressible charm and \nenthusiasm, Bill Wiley came to see me several years ago to lay out his \nplans for EMSL, undaunted by skeptics who had told him at every turn \nthat it might be a good idea, but the Congress was unlikely to embrace \nsuch a costly project. I must say that had it been anyone other than \nBill Wiley pushing the dream, the skeptics probably would have been \nright. But Bill not only convinced me that it was worth doing, he \npersuaded all the other relevant players that not only was it something \nwe could do, but that it was something a great nation should not fail \nto do. I visited the EMSL facility in its late stages of construction \nshortly before Bill's death last summer. Anyone who ever harbored \ndoubts about the wisdom of this research facility should go have a look \nwhen it opens its doors next month. It will be home to America's finest \nscientists employing the latest tools doing the best research in the \nworld today. And it is a point of special pride to those of us who were \nhis friends that they will be doing so in the building named in memory \nof William R. Wiley.\n  This African-American son of an Oxford, MS, cobbler served his Nation \nwell professionally and as a humanitarian who was never too busy in his \ncareer to help the less fortunate who were trying to work their way up \nthe ladder or merely to get to the first rung of the ladder. I know \nmany colleagues join me in expressing our condolences to Bill's loving \nwife Gus and to his daughter Johari Wiley-Johnson and in expressing our \ndeep gratitude for the paths that Bill Wiley charted and the mark he \nleft behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12340-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12340-S12341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNITION OF KEVIN PRICE\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before the 104th Congress adjourns, \nI want to take a moment of the Senate's time to thank someone who will \nbe leaving my office in a few weeks.\n  Four years ago, Kevin Price joined my staff as a legislative \nassistant for agriculture from Senator Kerrey's office, where he had \nserved as a legislative correspondent. Kevin quickly established \nhimself as one of the hardest working people on my staff. It seemed \nlike he was almost always one of the first here in the morning and one \nof the last to leave at night. And that was before serious preparation \nfor the 1995 farm bill had even begun.\n  Kevin also was very successful at reaching out to North Dakota \nfarmers and farm groups. Although he initially had to overcome some \nskepticism because he was from the northwestern Minnesota town of \nSteven, and not a native of North Dakota, he soon earned their trust, \nrespect, and friendship through his work for me on the 1993 budget, \ndisaster assistance, grazing, and many, many other issues.\n  At the same time, Kevin developed a strong working relationship with \nother staff on agriculture issues that made him a persuasive actor in \nall of the staff work that goes on behind the scenes around here. His \nties to both Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate staff, and key \nadministration players made him very effective at protecting the \ninterests of North Dakota farmers on myriad, small but often very \nimportant, issues that are effectively determined at the staff level.\n  For the past 3 years, Kevin immersed himself in the details of the \n1995 farm bill to ensure that my priorities were addressed. For North \nDakota, the farm bill is essential legislation. Its provisions, in \nlarge part, determine my State's economic future. During consideration \nof the farm bill, it is essential that I have accurate, timely \ninformation and thoughtfully prepared options. I ask a lot of my staff.\n  Kevin came through--for me, and for the people of North Dakota. He \nnot only worked incredibly long hours himself, he did a terrific job of \ncoordinating the many other members of my staff who also helped work on \nthe farm bill, and, despite the enormous pressure that he must \nsometimes have felt, Kevin was always a pleasure to be around. Although \nI believe the overall approach to farm policy taken by the Republicans \nin the 1995 farm bill is misguided and I could not support it, it does \ncontain numerous provisions that will make an important difference for \nNorth Dakota that would not be in the bill had Kevin not worked so hard \non my behalf.\n\n[[Page S12341]]\n\n  In a few weeks, Kevin will be going to work for the American Crystal \nSugar cooperative in Moorhead, MN. He has very big shoes to fill, \nbecause he is taking over from former Gov. George Sinner. But I have no \ndoubt that he will fill them well, because he also leaves behind big \nshoes for my next agriculture legislative assistant to fill.\n  On behalf of the people of North Dakota, I thank Kevin for a job well \ndone and wish him well in his new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12340-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about domestic \nviolence. This subject has quite literally been brought more clearly \ninto focus in recent days by photographs exhibited in the Russell \nSenate Building rotunda. As we begin the observance of October as \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month, the photographs of three Connecticut \nwomen who have lived through--and perhaps still endure--the pain of \ndomestic violence are on display in the Russell rotunda, along with the \nnames of many individuals from every state who have died as a result of \ndomestic violence.\n  Mr. President, the statistics on domestic violence are horrifying. \nWhile the victims are not only women, women are significantly more \nlikely to be victims of domestic violence than are men. Once every 15 \nseconds, a woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend, according to \nthe FBI's crime statistics. Four women a day are killed at the hands of \ntheir attackers, according to the National Clearinghouse for the \nDefense of Battered Women. And last year's National Crime Victimization \nSurvey, conducted by the Department of Justice, showed that 29 percent \nof all violence against women by a single offender is committed by an \nintimate--a husband, ex-husband, boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend.\n  In Connecticut in 1994, there were 18,768 incidents of family \nviolence that resulted in at least one arrest, according to the \nConnecticut State Department of Public Safety. And 29 people were \nkilled by family violence in Connecticut in 1994 according to the same \nsource.\n  But in the photographs displayed in the Russell rotunda, photographer \nAnnie Liebovitz captures more than just the grim statistics. She brings \ninto focus both the physical pain and emotional anguish suffered by \nvictims of domestic violence. One can see the hurt and the horror, the \nshame and the solitude, and the fighting and the fear.\n  And while this pain, hopefully, will diminish one day, it will never \ncompletely go away. The battered individuals, Mr. President, are not \nthe only victims. Domestic violence leaves scars on all those who live \nwith it--especially the children.\n  Domestic Violence Awareness Month is a time when we can step up the \neffort to prevent domestic violence. We must educate Americans about \nthis terrible problem and reach out to victims to let them know that \nhelp is available and that, sadly, they are not alone.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth and other measures to combat domestic violence, including a \nprovision in the omnibus bill recently passed by Congress and signed by \nthe President to prevent anyone convicted of any kind of domestic \nviolence from owning a gun. I look forward to the day when we will no \nlonger need to designate a Domestic Violence Awareness Month, but until \nthen, I remain committed to preventing and healing the wounds of \ndomestic violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12341-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEDICARE 50/50 ENROLLMENT COMPOSITION RULE WAIVER\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the \nplan to send an additional 5,000 troops to Bosnia over the next few \ndays. The report, which first appeared in articles in the Wall Street \nJournal and Washington Post earlier this week, came as a surprise to me \nand I am sure to many of my colleagues. Apparently, members of the \nmedia learned about this new troop deployment before Congress itself \nhad been notified. Now I learn that Secretary Perry will appear before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee--only after the chairman sent him a \nstinging letter of rebuke.\n  I have held strong reservations about United States troop deployment \nin Bosnia ever since it was initially announced last year. As many in \nthis Chamber will recall, I was one of the few Members of Congress to \nvote against the deployment of U.S. troops to support the Dayton \naccord.\n  I said then, and I reiterate today, that I doubted the value of a \nheavy U.S. investment in this region. I felt then, and I still feel \ntoday, that administration promises to have U.S. troops out of the \nregion within a year's time were unrealistic and would not be kept. And \nI questioned then, and still question today, whether or not the Dayton \nplan would truly level the playing field between Serbs and Muslims.\n  I recognize that the Dayton accord, and the deployment of the NATO \nImplementation Force [IFOR] to enforce it, has not been without some \nreal benefit. We can all be grateful that people are no longer dying en \nmasse in Bosnia. U.S. troops, in conjunction with troops from other \ncountries, should be applauded for having largely succeeded in \nenforcing the military aspects of the agreement.\n  In addition, many of the peacekeeping tasks delegated to IFOR troops \nalso have been completed, including overseeing the transfer of \nterritory, the demobilization of troops, and the storage of heavy \nweapons.\n  Furthermore, while they were not without problems, the September 14 \nelections have now created a new political structure in Bosnia, \nalthough its viability is yet to be tested.\n  In the past, I have raised concerns regarding compliance with the war \npowers resolution and the constitutional implications of troop \ndeployment without prior congressional authorization. I will not \nrevisit that larger issue now. In this case, I understood that there \nwas an implicit--if not explicit--understanding between the \nadministration and the Congress that the Congress would be consulted \nregarding any proposed changes in the mandate of United States troops \nin Bosnia. Certainly, this deployment of 5,000 more troops would fall \nwithin that understanding.\n  At a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on \nSeptember 10, several administration witnesses noted that, even though \nIFOR's mandate will expire in December, it was unclear what the \nsecurity needs on the ground would be in Bosnia at that time. But as \nThomas Longstreth, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and \nDirector of DOD's Bosnia task force, made clear during the hearing, \nfurther decisions would ``have to be made in concert with our allies \nand, obviously, in consultation with the Congress between the \n[September 14] elections period and the end of IFOR's mandate [on \nDecember 20].''\n  I understood this to mean that the Defense Department would--at the \nvery least--let the relevant congressional committees know about any \ntroop enhancements before releasing such information to the press.\n  On Tuesday, October 1, at a followup hearing in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee less than 24 hours before the Washington Post article \nappeared, no mention was made of this specific troop enhancement, but \nonly passing references to the possibility that additional troops might \nbe needed depending on the security situation on the ground in \nDecember.\n  Instead, at that second hearing, Assistant Secretary of State John \nKornblum told the Committee that\n\n       ``We fully understand and appreciate the need to work \n     closely with Congress on questions that involve the \n     deployment of U.S. troops. Clearly, the prospects for the \n     success of any such effort, if it occurs, depend \n     significantly on whether we have gained Congressional and \n     public support.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think releasing information to the press that \nhas\n\n[[Page S12342]]\n\nnot been released--formally or informally--to the Congress qualifies as \n``working with the Congress.''\n  There are a number of questions that I believe must be answered about \nthe mandate of these additional troops. How many additional troops are \nbeing planned for and what will they be doing? Will these men and women \nbe an additional part of the U.S. contribution to IFOR? Or will they be \ndeployed as part of a post-IFOR force of some kind? Will these new \ntroops be under the command of NATO, or of a U.S. commander, and what \nrules of engagement must they abide by? Is the timing of this \ndeployment at all related to NATO announcements last week that it was \nstudying the anticipated security situation in Bosnia over the next few \nmonths?\n\n  Then there continue to be questions on the political-diplomatic side. \nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE], the \ninternational body tasked with implementing the elections, recommended \nthe postponement of municipal elections because of security concerns, \nallowing only national elections to take place on September 14. These \nmunicipal elections are currently scheduled for November, but many \nobservers feel they should be postponed until the spring of 1997. My \nquestion is what kind of U.S. troop commitment will the Administration \nbe looking for if the elections are postponed? And when do they intend \nto notify the Congress of their plans?\n  I know that many of these questions will be answered at today's \nhearing before the Armed Service Committee. But I also would like to \nremind my colleagues here, and at the Department of Defense, that the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee continues to have a significant \ninterest in the details concerning any deployment of U.S. troops. I \nthink it is fair to assume that if the Administration expects to have \nCongressional and public support, as it has said in public testimony, \nthen it should make some effort to consult with all the relevant \ncommittees before its plans are announced in the morning newspaper.\n  A year ago--in October 1995--I asked whether or not the U.S. would be \nable to withdraw troops from IFOR in December 1996, as the \nadministration said then, even if the mission clearly had not been \nsuccessful.\n  I had my doubts then that the stated goal--ending the fighting and \nraising an infrastructure capable of supporting a durable peace--would \nbe doable in 12 month's time. I foresaw a danger that conditions would \nremain so unsettled that it would then be argued that it would be \nfolly--and waste--to withdraw on schedule.\n  My concerns and hesitations of 1 year ago can only be compounded by \nthe fact that additional troops are being deployed to Bosnia--perhaps \neven as I speak--without the Congress having been notified in \nadvance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12341-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE REPEAL OF CONTROLS ON INDEPENDENT COUNSEL COSTS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the appropriations bill we passed on \nMonday contained pleasant surprises, such as reasonable funding for \neducation and research programs. But there have also been some \ntroubling provisions. One was so troubling that I could not allow it to \npass without some expression of my dismay. This provision, section 118, \noverturns one of the reforms Congress made in 1994 to independent \ncounsel law to hold down costs.\n  The provision in the bill was never approved by any committee. It was \nnever voted on by either House. It was never included in a bill that \neither body approved. This provision appeared for the first time in the \nomnibus appropriations bill on Monday and was presented to the Senate \nunder rules that didn't permit a single amendment to the bill.\n  I first heard of this provision last week, when I was told that some \nHouse Republicans had added it to their wish list for the bill. Senator \nBill Cohen and I, as chairman and senior Democrat respectively of the \nSenate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the independent counsel law, \nimmediately expressed our joint opposition to the provision. We thought \nthat bipartisan opposition from the authorizing committee would be \nenough to prevent such a last-minute circumvention of the committee \nsystem. But we were wrong. The provision somehow got included in the \nbill and is now law.\n  It is a mistake in process and substance.\n  In simplest terms, the issue relates to holding down the cost of \nindependent counsel investigations. In particular, it has to do with \ncommuting costs--whether and how long independent counsels and their \nstaff can use taxpayer dollars to pay for transportation and living \nexpenses when they reside in one city and agree to prosecute one or \nmore cases in another city.\n  The issue arose in the context of the Iran-Contra case. In that case, \nthe independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh, chose to continue living in \nhis hometown of Oklahoma City, while prosecuting cases based in \nWashington, DC. There was no law against it, but when the bills came in \nfor his hotel, airfare, and other living expenses, plenty of loud \ncomplaints followed. Some pointed out that any other Federal prosecutor \nwho agreed to prosecute a case in another State would have to move \nthere--taxpayers would not be required to pick up their hotel and \ntransportation expenses. Then Senator Dole was in the forefront of the \ncritics calling for reform, criticizing Mr. Walsh for ``spend[ing] most \nof his time in Oklahoma.'' These commuting expenses were a prominent \npart of calls for legislation to tighten controls and reduce the cost \nof independent counsel investigations.\n  In 1994, the Congress responded to these criticisms by enacting \nlegislation which tightened controls over independent counsel expenses \nin a whole host of ways. One of the reforms we enacted was to limit \ncommuting expenses. We revised the law to allow independent counsels \nand their staffs a maximum of 18 months of commuting expenses. After 18 \nmonths, independent counsels and their staffs were expected either to \nmove to the city where the prosecutions were based or start picking up \ntheir own commuting expenses.\n  Section 118 of the omnibus appropriations bill effectively repeals \nthat limit on expenses. If effectively permits independent counsels and \ntheir staffs to charge taxpayers for unlimited commuting expenses. \nLawyers can live in one city, like New York or Los Angeles, prosecute \ncases in another city, and charge literally years of airfare, hotel \nmeals and other living expenses to the taxpayer. That's an expensive \nproposition. It's why we created the limit in 1994. It's why the \nomnibus appropriations bill was wrong to change it. It is wrong to \nchange it without any hearings, a consideration much less approval by \nan authorizing committee.\n  Limits on independent counsel expenses were enacted in the last \nCongress with bipartisan support. No case has been made for repealing \nthese limits. Many would say that limits on expenses are needed more \nthan ever. This issue needs to be revisited.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12342-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12342-S12344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FIVE CHALLENGES FOR PEACE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN FOREIGN POLICY\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, for the past 18 years, I have \nbeen privileged to watch the march of world history from the vantage \npoint of the U.S. Senate. The world has changed dramatically in my time \nhere.\n  We live in an era of great transition from a terrible cold war order \nwe understood to a new order we do not yet know. We are, to borrow from \nDean Acheson's trenchant phrase, ``present at the re-creation.''\n  As I prepare to leave the Senate, I want to offer some parting \nthoughts on unfinished business in American foreign policy and five \nchallenges we must meet in coming years.\n\n\n                      i. infrastructure for peace\n\n  The principal challenge of our time is to re-engineer the structures \nthat can sustain the peace we have won. From the institutions and \nalliances of the cold war, we have inherited an unprecedented \ninfrastructure for peace.\n  That infrastructure rests on three pillars. Each must be \nstrengthened.\n  The first pillar is the only worldwide institution focused on \ninternational peace and security--the United Nations.\n  We need to rebuild the consensus, both domestically and \ninternationally, on what we want the U.N. to be and what we want it to \ndo in the international system of the 21st century. I believe we must \nbuild this consensus among the major donor countries and powers.\n\n[[Page S12343]]\n\n  For too long, the United Nations has tried to do too much for too \nmany and, as a result, has outgrown the bounds of its legitimacy. I \nbelieve the basis for consensus is a return to the core functions that \nwe need the United Nations to do--refugees, nuclear inspections, \nhealth, and security, for example. And it may well be time for the \nUnited Nations to get out of the development business entirely and \nleave that work to other institutions better suited to the task such as \nthe World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n  When we have consensus on what the United Nations should do, we then \nwill need a dramatic restructuring of the U.N.'s institutions and \nbureaucracy to meet its new, narrow focus. This will be a dramatic \nshake-up of the United Nations that can only be driven by its most \npowerful member states. It will require the leadership of current heads \nof state and government, as well as other international figures of \nstature. I imagine this to be analogous to the process that led to the \nSan Francisco Conference in 1945 where the Charter was signed.\n  The second pillar consists of the institutions for international \neconomic development, reform and growth. The World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and the new World Trade Organization have \nimportant capacities that our bilateral development programs simply do \nnot. They can encourage and even compel the kind of fundamental changes \nin outdated and inefficient economic systems abroad that ultimately \npromote self-sufficiency. And they can set and police uniform standards \nfor economics and trade that promote America's long-term interests in \ncertainty and stability.\n  Yet, we have fallen behind sustaining our key contributions to these \norganizations. For example, we continue to lag behind in our \ncontribution to the World Bank's soft-loan window, the International \nDevelopment Association. As we consider trade-offs among our foreign \npolicy budget expenditures, I believe that sustaining our contributions \nto these organizations should move to the top of our priority list for \ninternational affairs spending.\n  The third pillar is America's alliances. I continue to believe that \nwe must find new consensus on the purpose of our principal alliance, \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The halting and ad hoc approach \nthat ultimately led to NATO intervention in Bosnia, is decidedly not \nthe type of shared purpose that can sustain a close alliance over the \nlong term. I, for one, remain skeptical that we should proceed with \nadmitting new members to NATO before the alliance finds its new role.\n  At the same time, the United States must give serious thought to the \nstructure of its alliances in the Pacific. Beyond our close alliances \nwith Japan and South Korea, we must consider what type of expanded \nalliance structures can best protect peace and stability throughout the \nregion well into the next century.\n\n\n                 ii. arms control and non-proliferation\n\n  In addition to repairing the institutions for peace, I believe we \nmust do more to control the weapons of war. That is our second \nchallenge.\n  I believe it is an indispensable element in America's long-term \nsecurity strategy. We face two types of challenges in dealing with the \nthreat posed by weapons of mass destruction.\n  First, we must reduce the numbers of these terrible arms that exist \non the face of the Earth. This means fully implementing START I and \nSTART II, both here and in Russia. It means establishing and \nimplementing a regime to control and destroy chemical weapons \nstockpiles. It means continuing to press for universal adherence to a \ncomprehensive ban on nuclear testing. It also means that America must \nbe willing to foot much of the bill whenever necessary--the cost of \ndestroying weapons abroad by agreement is far less than the cost of \nhaving to destroy them by war.\n  Second, we must contain and secure stockpiles and prevent the spread \nof these weapons. Our recent efforts to retrieve unsecured nuclear \nmaterial from abroad and bring them to the United States should be \nexpanded. We should remain committed to efforts of the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram to secure stockpiles throughout the former Soviet Union. And we \nmust always remain fully committed to strict enforcement of the nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\n  The threat to our security from weapons of mass destruction is \ngrowing, not declining. Critics of arms control in general, or of \nspecific arms control agreements, must always be held to answer a \nsingle difficult question: If you oppose our approach, then what would \nyou do to diminish the urgent threat to our country? In my view, that \nis where critics of the Chemical Weapons Convention have fallen short, \nand I hope the Senate will ratify that important agreement early next \nyear.\n\n\n                        III. tools of diplomacy\n\n  The third challenge we must meet is to maintain a diplomatic capacity \nstrong enough to secure our many national interests abroad.\n  We live in an age of exceptional nuance, diversity, and subtlety in \nforeign policy, and we must learn patience and the limits of our \ninfluence. This is particularly apparent in Africa--a continent of \nspecial interest to me--where America has many interests that can only \nbe defended by diplomatic means.\n  But our diplomatic interests are truly worldwide. In just the past 6 \nyears, 25 new states have entered the international community. The end \nof the Soviet empire has left us with many more power centers to deal \nwith and far more nuance to understand.\n  Yet, while the military had its Bottom-Up Review, and the \nintelligence community has undergone comprehensive review of its \nmissions and needs since the cold war's end, we have not undertaken \nsuch an authoritative review of our diplomatic interests and needs.\n  So we stumble along with no objective to guide our way, our debates \non diplomacy--to the extent we have any--driven largely by budget \nfactors and the vagaries of domestic politics rather than by any sober \nassessment of what diplomatic tools and structures we need to secure \nour national interests.\n  I believe our diplomatic spending should be driven by our interests, \nand I would urge a Bottom-Up Review of our diplomatic needs.\n  At the same time, I have come to fear that in recent years, the \nquality of the U.S. foreign service has slowly deteriorated. We have \ntoo often failed to attract and keep top-quality officers, rewarded \nmediocrity, and allowed ambassadors to be excluded from the \npolicymaking process. We have some tremendously capable foreign service \nofficers, but unfortunately we also have ample room for improvement. I \nbelieve comprehensive foreign service reform is long overdue.\n\n\n                       iv. national energy policy\n\n  Our fourth foreign policy challenge must be addressed here at home. \nThe time has come for America to devise and implement an energy policy \nthat will reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  We now rely on foreign sources for more than half our oil--\nsignificantly more than during the energy crisis of the 1970's. From \nNigeria to Central Asia, this dependence skews our foreign policy \npriorities--and, with many of the world's new oil fields in China and \nRussia, we can ill afford that pattern to be repeated.\n  The Middle East is the prime example. Our dependence has led, for \nexample, to American commitments in that region that far exceed what we \nwould undertake but for the 15 million barrels of oil that leave the \nPersian Gulf each day.\n  During my time in the Senate, we have sent Marines to Beirut, \nescorted Kuwaiti tankers through the Straits of Hormuz, fought a major \nland war in the region, and subsequently redeployed troops at least \ntwice. We also have established an ever-expending web of formal and \ninformal security commitments that may ultimately exceed our capacity \nto uphold.\n  And our commitments in that oil-rich region continue to grow. Before \nthe 1991 gulf war, we had only a few thousand troops in the region and \nno institutional presence. Today, we have nearly 20,000 troops in the \narea more or less permanently, including about 6,000 ground troops and \na carrier task force. We are expanding military facilities in Saudi \nArabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Emirates, and we have expanded our \npresence in Turkey. We are spending some $40 billion each year to \nsupport our military operations in the region.\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\n  The Middle East is an important region in its own right. But no \nhonest observers could believe that our tremendous commitments there \nwould exist without the region's oil riches. The risks we have \nundertaken because of oil are large indeed.\n  The answer to this difficult problem is not just drilling for more \noil here at home--for, at best, that can only delay the inevitable. The \nanswer is a significant and sustained effort to integrate alternative \nenergy sources into the mainstream of our national economy. The time \nhas come for America to promote development of conservation and \nalternative energy sources as a matter of national security.\n\n\n                        v. trans-national issues\n\n  The final foreign policy challenge is to come to grips with trans-\nnational threats, many of which have no human form. New diseases and \nlarge-scale environmental degradation may have origins far from our \nshores, but their effects touch the lives of Americans. Similarly, \ninternational criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, can \nassault our citizens and our security from locations outside the United \nStates.\n  Combating these threats will require that we work on many levels. We \nmust work together with friends and allies abroad. We must encourage \nand help countries that host these threats to combat them, which means \nwe must come to better understand the important relationship between \noverseas development and our own national interests. And we must better \nintegrate the work of different agencies of our own Government so that \nAmerica speaks with a single voice and acts decisively to protect our \ninterests.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, these are five daunting challenges. They come at a \ntime when the role of world affairs in American public and political \ndiscourse has diminished substantially.\n  All of us are tempted to focus less on foreign policy or to try to \nview it through a domestic lens. But I believe that would be a mistake.\n  The public may not be demanding a renewed focus on foreign policy, \nbut our national interest is. These challenges to America's future \ndemand serious attention from serious minds.\n  I am optimistic we will meet them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12342-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12344-S12349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BOUNDARY WATERS AND VOYAGEURS DISPUTES SHOULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH \n                         MEDIATION IN MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as we bring this Congress to a close, \nit is clear now that there will be no legislative action this year on \nchanges to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Voyageurs \nNational Park, even on a limited legislative rider which would allow \ntrucks back onto certain portages within the BWCAW. A Federal appeals \ncourt, overturning a series of decisions by the Forest Service and by a \nlower Federal court, ejected trucks from the portages several years \nago. This rider was designed to again allow anglers and others to \nportage boats by truck from one lake to another in the BWCA. Now, they \nare required to use alternative means to transport their boats across \nthese portages.\n  As I have said, I would be willing to consider changes to the current \nstatus of the portages, as long as it is part of an overall, agreed-\nupon resolution of the many BWCAW issues on the table in the Federal \nmediation process underway in Minnesota. I am hopeful that such an \nagreement can be reached soon.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. On many of the issues which have \narisen in the BWCA and Voyageurs disputes, I believe the people of \nnortheastern Minnesota have legitimate grievances, and that they should \nbe addressed as promptly and effectively as possible. I have worked \nover the years to make sure that when other land and lake use issues in \nthe region--including snowmobile use, lake levels, trails, and other \nmatters--have arisen, they are addressed as swiftly as possible.\n  For years, many of the people of northern Minnesota have believed \nthat the Park Service and Forest Service have not been listening to \nthem. Too many feel that they have offered constructive solutions to \ndisputes and problems which have arisen, and yet often those solutions \nhave been ignored, or rejected, by those who manage the wilderness and \nthe park. That's why I think it's important that some means of \nexpanding meaningful citizen input, which must be taken into account \nand then responded to by the Park Service and the Forest Service, is \nimportant. Months ago, I indicated that I would support a new mechanism \nto ensure that kind of regular, concrete citizen input, and I hope that \nthe negotiators will consider including a proposal on this issue in \ntheir package of recommendations to Congress.\n  There has been no action on any of the bills introduced this year on \nBWCAW and Voyaguers because they did not reflect a policy consensus in \nour own State, much less in the Nation as a whole. I am hopeful that in \nthe coming months, and certainly by early next year, there will be such \na consensus reached in our State, through the mediation process which I \ninitiated, convened by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, \nwhich has been making real progress in recent months.\n  That mediation process is broad-based, open and public, and includes \npeople representing all those competing interests which have made these \ndisputes so difficult to resolve over the years. One of the reasons, I \nthink, that they have been so tough to resolve is that too often those \ninvolved have chosen to try to fight it out, rather than to talk it out \nover a table in Minnesota, in a search for common ground. Some chose to \ntry to fight it out here in Washington. Some chose to fight it out in \nthe courts. I chose to initiate a process which would allow Minnesotans \nto talk it out, and then bring their recommendations to the Minnesota \ncongressional delegation for ratification.\n\n  I'm proud of that choice. I think it was the responsible thing to do, \nthe right thing to do. I think most Minnesotans agree with that, and \nthat the recent successes in mediation are bearing that out. I know \nthat some people in northern Minnesota disagree--some fiercely--and are \nconcerned that their interests won't be protected in the mediation \nprocess. I want to make them a guarantee today: your interests and \nviews are represented in mediation, and they will be carefully \nconsidered by me here in the U.S. Senate. I will press hard to make \nsure that every voice in my State, including those whom I respect and \nhave worked with for so many years in northern Minnesota, are heard in \nthis process. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service prepared \ncarefully for the process for months before it actually started, \ninterviewing hundreds of Minnesotans to make sure that all interests \nwere represented at the table, and to guarantee an open, broadly \nparticipatory process.\n  I am very grateful to the Mediation Service, and to all those \nMinnesotans who have volunteered their time and talents to this \nmediation effort. I know it is not always easy to put yourself on the \nhotseat with friends, neighbors, and townspeople who might disagree \nwith you, and to try to work out mutually agreeable solutions to major \ndisputes such as those which have brewed over the BWCAW and VNP for \nmany years. This kind of willingness to work at a local level to \nresolve disputes is an admirable act of responsible citizenship, an act \nof faith in the ability of neighbors to work together, and an act of \nhope that future generations will appreciate the legacy of a lasting \nsolution that protects these important resources. I will be talking at \ngreater length about these people shortly.\n  The BWCA mediation group met last Thursday and Friday, and will be \nmeeting again soon to address, among other matters, the portages. They \nhave already agreed on several recommendations to be made to the \ncongressional delegation, as part of a larger package of proposed \nchanges to be ratified by them later. I am hopeful they will make \nfurther progress on the portages, and other issues, in the coming \nweeks.\n  I have a few articles from last week's newspapers in Minnesota that I \nwill ask to have printed in the Record following my statement, along \nwith letters and other information on the dispute and on the mediation \nprocess which demonstrate the broad support mediation has garnered \nwithin our State as the most reasonable, sensible way to resolve these \ndisputes. These documents should be able to give people looking back on \nthis dispute a better understanding of the history of this\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\ndispute, and of how the mediation process is designed to work.\n  As I've said, this sensible mediation process, which enjoys the \nsupport of a large majority of Minnesotans, and of the Clinton \nadministration, is already producing results--including agreements on \nissues in Voyageurs and in the BWCA mediation groups--that many believe \nbode well for further agreements on both disputes.\n  In addition to the few agreements reached so far on the BWCA, just in \nthe last few days the mediation team on Voyageurs announced a couple of \nagreements on strategies to handle problems in the park having to do \nwith public safety, improved Park Service consultation with local \npeople, and other issues. It is becoming clearer each day that the \nmediation process is making real progress and has gained wide \nacceptance throughout the State.\n  I have opposed all of the earlier legislation introduced on the \nBWCA--including strongly opposing the bill offered by Congressman \nVento--because I thought a mediated solution was more likely to be \ndurable, and to gain broad acceptance by Minnesotans, than approaches \ndeveloped in Washington without broad, bipartisan support in Minnesota. \nAs I have said consistently, I agree with the large majority of \nMinnesotans who believe, as polls continue to show, that the mediation \nprocess underway in Minnesota is by far the more sensible and \nappropriate way to resolve these disputes, and to develop durable \nsolutions that will last not for weeks, or months, or even a few years, \nbut for a generation or more.\n  Let me publicly take a moment to specifically thank all of those who \nhave been involved in this mediation process, and who have already \ndedicated so much time and effort to resolving these disputes. They \nare, in a sense, the people who are helping to create a new future for \nthe BWCA and the VNP, helping to resolve longstanding disputes through \na process which ensures that all interests in Minnesota are \nrepresented.\n  First, let me thank those from Minnesota who are actually \nparticipating in mediation. I hope I have a complete list; if not, I \napologize in advance to anyone I may have missed. I will not go into \ndetail about the background and expertise of each person, but I know \nthey each have a story to tell about how and why they are involved in \nthis process, and each have made important contributions to the \nprocess.\n  Let me first list and thank publicly, on behalf of all Minnesotans, \nthe participants in the BWCA mediation: Barb Bergland, from Ely; Mitch \nBrunfelt, from Mountain Iron; Chuck Dayton, Minneapolis; Arthur Eggen, \nCrane Lake; Tony Faras, Grand Marais; Paul Forsman, Ely; Mike Furtman, \nDuluth; Bill Hansen, Tofte; Leon Jourdaine, Lac La Croix First Nation, \nFort Francis, Ontario; Alden Lind, Duluth; Ted Merschon, Grand Marais; \nGretchen Nichols, Minneapolis; Brian O'Neill, Minneapolis; John Ongara, \nDuluth; Stuart Osthoff, Ely; Bob Schultz, Ely; Paul Shurke and Laurie \nLarson, Ely; Barbara Soderburg, U.S. Forest Service, Duluth; George \nSundstrom, Duluth; Rolf Thompson, Ely; Rod Sando, Minnesota DNR.\n  And those involved in the Voyageurs National Park mediation: Beverly \nAlexander, Minneapolis; Phillip Byers, Long Lake; Chuck Dayton, \nMinneapolis; David Dill, Orr; Ron Esau, International Falls; Oliver \nEtgen, Virginia; Jeff Mausolf, Duluth; Brian O'Neill, Minneapolis; Paul \nStegmeir, Ely; Tim Watson, Ray; Barbara West, Voyageurs National Park \nSuperintendent; David Zentner, Duluth; Rod Sando, DNR.\n\n  From the mediation service, I am grateful to Director John Wells and \nhis very able and professional staff, both here in Washington and in \nthe midwest regional office in Minneapolis. They have dug into this \nproject with great skill and energy and commitment, and I believe the \npeople of our State owe them a great debt.\n  The U.S. Forest Service and Park Service have been most helpful in \nthis process as well, helping to fund the mediation effort, providing \ntechnical advice and assistance, and agreeing to have their principal \nrepresentatives in the state actually participate in the talks. I think \ntheir participation and cooperation have been essential, and that it \nwill make for a much more durable resolution of these disputes.\n  There are, of course, many others who have worked for countless hours \nto craft a balanced, fair, open mediation process and to make sure \nmediation provides a credible, effective forum for working out \ndisputes. I am grateful to all of them for helping with this effort. I \nwill be monitoring the mediation process closely in the coming weeks, \nand I hope they will be able to develop a sound set of recommendations \nto forward to Congress as soon as possible. I would like to be able to \nhave a package of agreed-upon legislative recommendations ready for \nintroduction early in the 105th Congress.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for this time. I hope this brief \nstatement, along with the accompanying information, will give my \ncolleagues some sense of what has been happening in my State recently \non BWCAW and Voyageurs National Park, and the significant progress that \nhas been made so far in the mediation effort to resolve disputes there. \nI hope they will work with me and my House and Senate colleagues from \nMinnesota to craft a comprehensive, durable solution to these disputes \nearly next year.\n  I ask that the material I referred to earlier in my remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Sen.

I believe there is a need for a \n     coordinated, statewide mediated dispute resolution effort to \n     bring Minnesotans together to identify mutually acceptable \n     approaches to these issues. We in Minnesota can do better \n     than we have in the past on these issues, and I intend to do \n     what I can to make sure that happens,'' Sen. Wellstone said.\n       FMCS will provide a team of experienced, neutral mediators \n     to craft a process that is fair, impartial, goal-oriented, \n     and that allows all interested parties in Minnesota a chance \n     to be heard--and to listen to one another--about the issues \n     in dispute, their goals, and their recommendations to resolve \n     longstanding controversies. Questions regarding who would \n     actually be represented in the process; the scope, timing and \n     format of the discussions; the ultimate result of the \n     process, including the nature and form of recommendations to \n     federal agencies and lawmakers; and other similar issues \n     would be answered through consultation with the parties.\n       ``I have discussed this idea with Congressmen Oberstar and \n     Vento, who as you know have been leaders on these issues for \n     decades,'' Sen. Wellstone said. ``No one should be surprised \n     that we now have competing legislative proposals from \n     Congressmen Oberstar and Vento representing their sharply \n     divergent views on these public lands issues. While they \n     differ on the best way to manage these public lands, they \n     have indicated their support for my initiative. The specific \n     legislation proposed by Congressmen Oberstar and Vento and \n     discussed by Senator Grams will not be the focus of the \n     mediation process. Rather, the process will focus on the \n     issues identified by the parties themselves. Like Congressman \n     Oberstar's bill, Congressman Vento's legislation could \n     undermine this mediation process, and therefore I do not \n     intend to support either bill.''\n       The mediation process, explains Wellstone in his letter, is \n     designed to prevent these historically contentious land use \n     issues from further diving the state. ``Throughout my time in \n     the Senate, I have held firm to the belief that locally-\n     developed recommendations are likely to be more effective, \n     and more durable, than those imposed from outside. Bringing \n     Minnesotans to the table as part of a participatory process \n     that takes in account the needs and interests of all in a \n     search for common ground is my goal.''\n       Wellstone observed that unlike 20 years ago, today there \n     are new tools available to help develop durable land use \n     solutions, including new forms of public, mediated dispute \n     resolution that have proven effective in some of our nation's \n     most controversial land use disputes, even those where people \n     believed at the outset that there was little chance for a \n     productive discussion between the parties, much less for \n     developing mutually agreed-upon solutions.\n       For example, in one particularly heated case, a strong \n     disagreement over the use of off road vehicles in the Cape \n     Code National Seashore in Massachusetts was successfully \n     addressed through dispute resolution. In another case, \n     ranchers and wilderness advocates in New Mexico and Arizona \n     used dispute resolution to help resolve fierce disagreements \n     on rangeland management.\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\n       Sen. Wellstone, who fully supports expanded citizen \n     participation in the management of these lands, observed that \n     a ``Minnesota solution'' is likely to be more effective than \n     one imposed from Washington. ``Given the current deep \n     divisions on these issues within our state, I believe that \n     proposals to resolve BWCAW and VNP disputes that are \n     developed in Minnesota, by Minnesotans, are more likely to be \n     accepted by all parties, and as a result be more durable, \n     than those developed in Washington without adequate efforts \n     to bring Minnesotans together first to try to develop a \n     consensus,'' Sen. Wellstone concluded.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1996.\n     John Calhoun Wells, Director,\n     Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: As we discussed recently by phone, I am writing \n     to formally request that the Federal Mediation and \n     Conciliation Service (FMCS) facilitate an alternative dispute \n     resolution process in my state regarding land use issues in \n     the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and in \n     Voyageurs National Park (VNP). I understand that your staff \n     have indicated a willingness to facilitate such a process; I \n     am writing to confirm that agreement and to outline briefly \n     my hopes for the process.\n       For many years, land use disputes in our state, especially \n     those focused on the BWCAW and VNP, have generated \n     controversy and pitted one group against another. Last year, \n     two congressional oversight hearings were held in Minnesota \n     on the use of these resources. From those hearings, and \n     numerous subsequent discussions with my constituents, it has \n     become clear that these land use issues continue to have a \n     tremendous potential to divide our state.\n       Minnesotans hold differing visions of how to be responsible \n     stewards of these resources, and how to manage them \n     sustainably with due attention to their varied uses. But \n     whatever their views on land use, Minnesotans can agree that \n     the BWCAW and VNP are unique, world-class natural resources \n     that must be preserved for future generations. That is the \n     common ground from which all discussions on these issues \n     should begin.\n       I believe there is a need for an effort to bring \n     Minnesotans together now to achieve mutually acceptable \n     proposed solutions to the land use problems that have been \n     identified. Such proposed solutions would then be forwarded \n     in the form of recommendations to appropriate federal \n     agencies, and to federal lawmakers in the state Congressional \n     delegation. In my judgment, proposed solutions developed in \n     Minnesota, my Minnesotans, are more likely to be accepted by \n     all parties, and thus be more durable, than those which might \n     be developed in Washington without adequate efforts to bring \n     Minnesotans together first to try to develop a consensus. \n     Without such a dispute resolution process, I fear that the \n     issue in dispute could quickly become a \n     ``political football,'' to be manipulated by those in the \n     state more interested in polarizing the debate than in \n     finding real and durable solutions.\n       I envision a straightforward mediated dispute resolution \n     process, to be initiated immediately. I would rely on the \n     expertise and experience of your staff to structure such a \n     process, ensuring that it is fair, impartial, goal-oriented, \n     and allows all interested parties in Minnesota a chance to be \n     heard--and to listen to one another--about the issues in \n     dispute, their goals, and their recommendations to resolve \n     longstanding controversies.\n       I would assume that questions regarding who would actually \n     represent interested parties in the process; the scope, \n     timing and format of the discussions; the ultimate result of \n     the process, including the nature and form of recommendations \n     to federal agencies and federal lawmakers; and other similar \n     issues would be answered through a consultative process that \n     would involve decisions arrived at by the parties. I have \n     instructed my staff to provide further background to FMCS \n     staff that would be helpful in getting the process underway, \n     and to help identify key stakeholders in the state who should \n     be consulted. My staff has contacted Administration officials \n     to discuss funding support for this process, and I will \n     continue to work to ensure that FMCS is compensated \n     appropriately for the process.\n       I believe this approach provides an opportunity to bring \n     Minnesotans together to develop mutually agreed-upon \n     solutions to some of our most complex and longstanding \n     controversies. I have dedicated much of my adult life to \n     ensuring broad local input in public policymaking, and I \n     believe this process is most likely to guarantee that result. \n     Bringing Minnesotans to the table as part of a broad-based, \n     participatory process that takes into account the interests \n     of all stakeholders in a search for common ground is my goal.\n       Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing \n     from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Paul David Wellstone,\n     United States Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Federal Mediation and\n\n\n                                         Conciliation Service,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Paul D. Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: In response to your recent letter \n     and confirming ongoing discussions between members of our \n     staffs, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service would \n     be pleased to serve as facilitators in the land use \n     Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process on the issues in \n     dispute regarding the use of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area \n     Wilderness (BWCAW) and Voyageurs National Park (VNP).\n       Considering the contentious history of some of these land \n     use issues, we agree that this multi-party dispute, with its \n     numerous interests, could lend itself quite well to the kind \n     of interactive, mediated ADR process which you described in \n     your letter. Alternative dispute resolution has been \n     successfully employed to resolve many longstanding natural \n     resource controversies across the country, including some \n     where many believed at the outset that there was little \n     chance for productive discussions between the parties, much \n     less for developing mutually agreed-upon solutions.\n       FMCS has helped to facilitate a number of such complex \n     multi-party land use dispute resolution processes in the \n     past, and we are hopeful that this process will lead to \n     similarly positive results. I understand that one of your \n     primary goals involves a set of formal recommendations for \n     action that would be forwarded from the group to appropriate \n     federal agencies and lawmakers once the process is completed.\n       My ADR Services staff have informed me that experienced \n     mediators from our Upper Midwest Region will make themselves \n     available to lead this project. I understand our staffs have \n     begun to lay the groundwork for this process; we appreciate \n     your willingness to assist us by offering key background \n     information and helping us to identify key interested parties \n     in these disputes. As we move forward, careful consideration \n     should be given to convening the process, subsequent \n     meetings, expected outcomes, recommendations, and appropriate \n     agency funding. I am sure you know that broad based support \n     and a willingness by all affected parties to participate in \n     open, honest, problem-solving dialogue focused on defined \n     objectives are some of the factors critical to the success of \n     these processes. Some of these matters can be coordinated \n     with your staff, our Washington ADR office and Minneapolis \n     regional headquarters; others will be worked out by the \n     parties themselves within the context of the ADR process.\n       I appreciate the confidence you have expressed in the \n     expertise and experience of our staff. We look forward to \n     working with the interested parties in Minnesota, helping \n     them to identify real, durable solutions to these ongoing \n     disputes.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               John Calhoun Wells,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Fifty Years of Conflict Resolution\n\n       The Federal Medication and Conciliation Service, (FMCS) is \n     an independent agency of the United States Government created \n     by Congress in 1947 to provide mediation and conflict \n     resolution related service to its clients. These services are \n     delivered by the agency's nearly 200 full-time mediators who \n     operate in 78 field offices located throughout the country. \n     The primary focus of FMCS's work is on labor-management \n     relations, mediating contract negotiation disputes between \n     companies and the unions representing their employees, and \n     providing training in cooperative processes to help build \n     better labor-management relations. Additionally, FMCS was \n     authorized under the Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 to share \n     its expertise in all aspects of mediation, facilitation and \n     conflict resolution with federal, state and local \n     governmental bodies and agencies.\n       With the increasing awareness of the concept and benefits \n     of conflict resolution in the general public, the terms \n     mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) have \n     become nearly synonymous. At FMCS, ADR is used to describe a \n     variety of joint problem-solving approaches which can be used \n     in lieu of more formal and often expensive courtroom \n     litigation, or as an alternative to agency adjudication and \n     traditional rulemaking. These processes usually involve the \n     use of a neutral third party to help disputants find \n     mutually-acceptable solutions. Services are based on the \n     specific needs of the parties, and can include dispute \n     resolution assistance, systems design and training for agency \n     personnel.\n       An area of our ADR practice receiving wider attention and \n     use is regulatory negotiation. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act \n     of 1990 authorizes the agency to use its mediation services \n     to improve government operations. FMCS assists American \n     citizens and government in the regulatory process by bringing \n     the regulators and those who will be affected by regulations \n     to work together in the formulation of proposed rules through \n     negotiation. As a neutral third-party, FMCS convenes and \n     facilitates complex, multi-party rulemaking procedures to \n     help produce draft rules by consensus.\n       FMCS's has been providing ADR service for over twenty \n     years, dating back to the early 1970's when the agency was \n     asked to mediate a land dispute between the Navajo and Hopi \n     Indian tribes. In the early 1980's, FMCS facilitated the \n     first regulatory negotiations held by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. Regulatory negotiation activity increased \n     throughout the decade, with FMCS involved in negotiations \n     held by the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture, Labor \n     and others. FMCS also began providing mediation services for \n     Home Owner Warranty disputes and in training volunteer \n     mediators\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\n     for the Farm Credit Administration. Since then, FMCS has \n     become a leading authority on the design, delivery and \n     implementation of dispute resolution techniques and systems. \n     FMCS has assisted Federal agencies in settling disputes in a \n     variety of fields, including complex regulatory and \n     environmental matters, equal employment, and educational \n     grant disputes and enforcement matters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                   fmcs and multi-party negotiations\n\n       The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) is an \n     independent agency of the United States Government created by \n     Congress in 1947 to provide mediation and conflict resolution \n     related services to its clients. These services are delivered \n     by the agency's nearly 200 full-time mediators who operate in \n     78 field offices located throughout the country. The primary \n     focus of FMCS's work is on labor-management relations, \n     mediating contract negotiation disputes between companies and \n     the unions representing their employees, and providing \n     training in cooperative processes to help build labor-\n     management relations. Additionally, FMCS is authorized under \n     the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 to share \n     its expertise in all aspects of mediation, facilitation and \n     conflict resolution with federal, state and local \n     governmental bodies and agencies.\n       Mediation is participation by a neutral third party in a \n     dispute or negotiation with the purpose of assisting the \n     parties to the dispute in voluntarily reaching their own \n     settlement of the issues. A mediator may make suggestions, \n     and even procedural or substantive recommendations.\n       FMCS has provided mediation services in numerous public \n     policy disputes and regulatory negotiations. The results have \n     been extremely positive. By formulating rules and policies in \n     a public negotiating process, potential or actual antagonists \n     can be motivated to participate, and become partners in \n     solving a policy problem or controversy over public issues. \n     Thus, the likelihood of subsequent challenges to the \n     agreement is greatly reduced.\n       The task of bringing together groups of people, often with \n     competing interests, to reach consensus on complex issues and \n     policies has proved to be a highly-productive use of FMCS' \n     mediators expertise in facilitation and joint problem-\n     solving. Not only are the results positive and the concept \n     gaining in use, but making policy and regulatory and \n     decisions in a public, participatory process is simply a \n     better way to resolve conflicts. FMCS mediators have been \n     involved in the resolution of many issues using this process, \n     including:\n       Disability Access to Airplanes (1988); Department of \n     Transportation, Vocational Education Issues (1990); \n     Department of Education, Appalachian Trail/Killington-Pico \n     Ski Resorts Mergers (1990-91), Developing Formula for Member \n     Contributions (1992); Farm Credit Administration, Usage of \n     Pesticides (1993); State of New York, Use of Public Waterways \n     (1993); State of Tennessee, Subsidized Housing Vacancy Rates \n     (1995); Department of Housing and Urban Development, Water \n     Resources Development in the Tuolumne River/San Francisco Bay \n     Area (1995); Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Rail \n     Repair Worker Safety Procedures (1995); Railway Safety \n     Administration (DOT), Indian Self Determination Act (1995); \n     Departments of Interior/HHS, Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (1995/96), and Disability Access to Play Areas \n     (1996); Architectural and Barriers Compliance Board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are about to conclude action on H.R. \n     1296, a bill to provide for the administration of certain \n     Presidio properties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer. \n     As you may know, a number of popular and also controversial \n     measures have become part of the conference discussion; \n     therefore, this bill is now known as the Omnibus Parks \n     legislation containing well over 100 specific legislative \n     provisions.\n       Among the controversial issues discussed for inclusion in \n     this conference report are the Senate-passed grazing reform \n     legislation, S. 1459; reforms to the management of the \n     Boundary Waters Wilderness, S. 1738; Sterling Forest \n     Protection Act, S. 223; S. 884, the Utah Public Lands \n     Management Act; S. 1877, the Ketchikan Pulp Company contract \n     extension; and S. 1371, the Snow Basin Land Exchange, which \n     is necessary for the winter olympics.\n       We are about to file a conference report on this omnibus \n     legislation, and it is important that we have your views. \n     Because of your Administration's long-standing opposition, we \n     are prepared to propose excluding the grazing reform \n     legislation, any Utah Wilderness proposals, and several other \n     controversial measures to which the Administration has \n     expressed opposition. Attached is a list of measures we \n     propose for inclusion in the conference report. Among these \n     measures, we feel the need to include two items which your \n     Administration has expressed opposition to in the past. One \n     is the extension of the Ketchikan Pulp Co. contract, S. 1877; \n     and the other is a proposed compromise on the Boundary Waters \n     Canoe Area which would allow motorization on three portages, \n     but nothing more.\n       It is important that we have your views on this conference \n     report prior to close of business on Wednesday, September 18. \n     We are ready and prepared to discuss any of the measures \n     proposed for inclusion in this conference report at any time, \n     and our staffs are prepared to provide any additional \n     information you may need in your consideration of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Young,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Resources.\n     Frank H. Murkowski,\n       Chairman.\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In light of potential activity by the \n     Committee on S. 1738, I would like to apprise you of the \n     Administration's deep concerns about S. 1738, a bill ``To \n     provide for improved access to and use of the Boundary Waters \n     Canoe Area Wilderness, and for other purposes.''\n       The Department of Agriculture strongly opposes enactment of \n     S. 1738. For the reasons outlined below, this bill is \n     unacceptable, and should it come to the President in its \n     present form, I would advise him to veto it.\n       While we are acutely aware of the controversy associated \n     with management of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness \n     (BWCAW) for at least the past 50 years, and we understand the \n     concerns of the various interests, we do not believe that S. \n     1738 offers a solution to that controversy. The provisions of \n     S. 1738 would not protect the wilderness resource itself or \n     protect the best interests of the national and international \n     communities which seek a voice in its management. In fact, we \n     believe that it will only serve to increase the polarization \n     of the various interests.\n       The BWCAW is the largest wilderness east of the \n     Mississippi, consisting of over one million acres of lakes, \n     streams, and forests. It extends nearly 150 miles along the \n     international boundary adjacent to Canada's Quetico \n     Provincial Park, creating a natural, water-based \n     international treasure, unparalleled in the world. It is also \n     the most heavily used wilderness in the United States.\n       S. 1738 would make several significant changes in the \n     current management of the BWCAW. The bill would expand the \n     area open to use of motorboats, exempt a certain class of \n     visitors from limits established on numbers of visitors, \n     provide for reopening three portages to motorized use, and \n     establish a planning and management council.\n       Section 3(a) would amend the 1978 law which established the \n     wilderness (P.L. 95-495) by removing limits on motorboat use \n     on five lakes. These are very large lakes and this change \n     would increase the average of water surface open to motor use \n     from approximately 21 percent to 31 percent of the total in \n     the wilderness. Allowing nearly one-third of the area to be \n     open to motorized use is a very large proportion for an \n     activity not normally allowed in units of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System, and would be a significant \n     change in the wilderness setting.\n       Section 3(b) would change the definition of a ``guest'' \n     from someone who stays overnight, to someone who is a guest \n     of a homeowner or has purchased or rented goods or services \n     from a resort owner. This change is significant because the \n     1978 Act exempts those who are ``guests'' of homeowners or \n     resort owners from limits on use. This change in definition \n     would, in effect, eliminate the current limits on motorboat \n     users.\n       Section 3(c) would provide for reopening three portages to \n     motorized use that were closed by court order several years \n     ago. Based on use data and informal discussions with \n     visitors, our experience since these portages were closed has \n     led us to conclude that access is not unduly restricted, \n     public needs are being met, and that the quality of the \n     wilderness setting is improved by the current status.\n       Section 4 would establish a ``Planning and Management \n     Council'' with broad authorities to ``develop a monitor a \n     comprehensive management plan for the wilderness.'' This is \n     the most disconcerting provision of the bill. This management \n     council would have overlapping and conflicting roles with the \n     agency, creating confusion about management of the \n     wilderness. Under this bill, the role of the resource \n     professional in managing a national resource under the laws \n     passed by Congress would be shifted to a council consisting \n     primarily of locally elected and appointed officials. A \n     management council would only serve to reopen issues, keep \n     the controversy alive, and further polarize the various \n     interests.\n       The Forest Service already has a public involvement process \n     in place, which was used extensively during development of \n     the new BWCAW plan, which is the culmination of several years \n     of seeking the best mix of management options for both the \n     nation and the wilderness resource. We need to keep on track \n     with implementing the plan which emerged from this process \n     and work through the remaining issues. Furthermore, the \n     Forest Service is participating in the Federal Mediation and \n     Conciliation Service process for the BWCAW, and I anticipate \n     this effort may help to resolve some of the long-standing \n     issues in the wilderness area.\n       Notwithstanding my objections to the bill in its current \n     form, I will work with the Committee to produce an acceptable \n     solution to this problem.\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From The Pioneer Press Editorial, May 9, 1996]\n\n                   Mediation Welcome in BWCAW Dispute\n\n       Like chicken soup for a bad cold, Sen. Paul Wellstone's \n     effort to initiate mediation over Minnesota's All-America \n     land dispute can't hurt. Seeking new approaches to settling \n     the emblematic environmental arguments over Voyageurs \n     National Park and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness \n     has attractive possibilities.\n       Up front, it is fair to acknowledge that the political \n     dynamic of the situation for an incumbent Democratic senator \n     in an election year is both deft and apparent. By bringing \n     the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in to approach \n     the old grievances about the BWCAW and Voyageurs as \n     professional mediation has done with other polarized \n     environmental policy cases, Wellstone doesn't have to \n     alienate, for now, the Up North Democrats or the Big City \n     environmentalists. Truth told, we'd be just as glad as most \n     other folks to let the mediation process carry these land-use \n     issues into 1997, softening the tendency to frenzy sure to \n     follow Congress' competing legislative approaches--neither of \n     which Wellstone supports.\n       We said earlier this week the delicate compromises that \n     created the BWCAW in 1978 still largely make sense and do not \n     need to be dramatically altered.\n       Local councils that control policy on federal lands are not \n     appropriate whether the federal lands are designated as the \n     nation's largest water wilderness or are Yellowstone National \n     Park.\n       If mediation can get to some of the festering unhappiness \n     Up North over communications failures between communities and \n     the feds, great, Running parallel to the inevitable political \n     wrangling of trying to legislate either expanding the \n     wilderness or ceding management to county and state forces, \n     the mediation process is, at minimum, comfort food.\n       It can't hurt to try something besides choosing sides and \n     fighting it out over access to the north's unique natural \n     treasures.\n\n                  [Wellstone Virginia, July 20, 1996]\n\n                     Time To Give Mediation Its Due\n\n                        (By Marshall Helmberger)\n\n       With the obituaries all but written for the Grams and \n     Oberstar bills, it should be clear to most people that \n     Senator Paul Wellstone's mediation proposal continues to be \n     the best hope for changes in Boundary Waters and Voyageurs \n     National Park management. That has been the case for the day \n     the senator announced the proposal last spring, and that fact \n     should be that much more obvious after the recent \n     congressional hearings.\n       The bottom line is this: Until Minnesotans can reach a \n     consensus on changes in management of these federal lands, \n     legislative quick fixes stand little chance of passage, and \n     even less chance of resolving the long-term conflicts over \n     these areas. The Grams and Oberstar bills would have pleased \n     some, but guaranteed many more years of heated controversy \n     and, very possibly, even worse legislation in the future. \n     Perhaps that's why prominent Minnesotans of both parties have \n     opposed the most recent legislation.\n       Yes, I, like many others, want to see a return of the truck \n     portages. But mediation is likely the only way to achieve \n     some of these changes.\n       While some local groups, such as Conservationists With \n     Common Sense, want to point fingers at Senator Wellstone and \n     conclude that he has somehow masterminded the downfall of the \n     Grams/Oberstar bills, such claims are wildly over stated.\n       The fact is, opposition to the Grams/Oberstar legislation \n     is overwhelming in Minnesota, and bipartisan in nature. A \n     StarTribune Minnesota Poll released Thursday showed that \n     three-quarters of Minnesotans said they opposed the Grams/\n     Oberstar bills, with just 18 percent voicing support. Compare \n     that to the 69 percent support the poll found for the Vento \n     bill, which further restricts motor use in the BWCAW and puts \n     much of Voyageurs National Park into wilderness status.\n       If supporters of the Grams/Oberstar bills had any \n     illusions. about passage, or about Wellstone's supposed role \n     in scuttling the bills, such poll results should prompt a \n     re-examination. Regardless of Wellstone's position, \n     legislation garnering the support of just 18 percent of \n     Minnesotans was dead on arrival.\n       Grams/Oberstar supporters might also consider the fact that \n     a majority of Minnesotans agree that mediation is the best \n     approach for dealing with the dispute and don't see \n     Wellstone's position as an attempt to duck the issue.\n       Wellstone didn't need to scuttle the bills. Despite the \n     claims of CWCS spokespeople, Paul Wellstone hasn't \n     masterminded public opinion, or the widespread and bi-\n     partisan opposition to the two bills. Paul Wellstone didn't \n     prompt Third District Republican Representative Jim \n     Ramstead's loud opposition to the bills during this week's \n     testimony. And he didn't coax Governor Arne Carlson to oppose \n     them either.\n       Nor did he mastermind the Interior Department's \n     recommendation of a presidential veto of the legislation.\n       Nor did he have to convince U.S. Senators, like Bill \n     Bradley and others, who have supported pro-wilderness \n     legislation for 20 years or more that they should object to \n     the current bills. There are plenty of people in Washington \n     happy to speak their mind. And you don't want to get between \n     them and a microphone.\n       Unfortunately, when groups like CWCS focus the blame on \n     Wellstone, they make their involvement in this issue look far \n     too political. There's been enough politics in this issue \n     already.\n       Indeed, a strong argument could be made that it was the \n     national Republican Party that scuttled any legislative deal \n     this year, by politicizing the issues through its anti-\n     Wellstone attack ads. Democratic senators made clear last \n     week that they weren't about to sign on to any deal that \n     smelled so strongly like a political smear campaign.\n       Of course the Republicans are smart enough to know that. \n     Those anti-Wellstone attack ads were the clearest possible \n     sign that the Republican Congress had no intention of passing \n     any Boundary Waters or VNP legislation. For the Republicans, \n     this was little more than a chance to attack a senator they \n     consider to be a major thorn in their side.\n       While the motivations of Representative Oberstar are \n     probably more honorable, he nontheless should have known \n     better than to raise political hopes in his supporters about \n     the chances of passage. And despite his official claims to \n     the contrary, he has made statements critical of mediation. \n     He should know better. Such statements provide political \n     cover for those who would like to sabotage any mediation \n     effort, apparently to achieve their political goal of hurting \n     Wellstone's re-election.\n       Sadly, the prospects for successful mediation are probably \n     less promising than before the congressional hearings. With \n     the apparent quick and easy death of the Grams/Oberstar \n     bills, environmental groups have the confidence of knowing \n     they can probably block any legislative efforts that don't \n     come from a mediated settlement. In other words, they now \n     have less incentive to bargain seriously than they did \n     before. It would have been far more effective to use \n     mediation first. That way, local interests could have still \n     held out the threat of the Grams/Oberstar bills, if \n     environmental groups showed little willingness to compromise.\n       As it stands today, the groups that pushed for the quick \n     legislative fix managed to get their names in the paper, but \n     little else. And unless they change their minds and give \n     mediation a chance, they have little role to play--other than \n     spoilers. And worst of all, that leaves most of their \n     members--who I believe never wanted anything more than the \n     right to use a truck portage or have relatively easy access \n     to a permt--out of luck once again.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [The Bemidji Pioneer, July 31, 1996]\n\n                         Mediation on the Mark\n\n       Minnesotans are the best position to decide a destiny for \n     the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs \n     National Park. And that process, fostered by federal \n     mediators, appears to be headed in the right direction.\n       U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, DFL-Minn., has taken a lot of \n     flack for his proposal for federal mediation, including \n     National Republican Senatorial Committee pressure that \n     Wellstone's call allows him to completely duck this volatile \n     election-year issue.\n       Plans outlined this week should prove Wellstone right. The \n     Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service recommendations \n     set up a framework for citizen panels for both BWCA and \n     Voyageurs issues from more than 200 interviews with \n     interested parties. The final panels will learn problem-\n     solving techniques and then it will be up to them--fellow \n     Minnesotans sitting around a table deciding what's best for \n     important Minnesota resources.\n       Current bills in Congress would put those forces at odds--\n     more likely creating a war than a mediated settlement all can \n     live with. Bills by GOP Sen. Rod Grams and DFL Rep. Jim \n     Oberstar obviously side with those who want little or no \n     restrictions for an important natural resource, while a bill \n     by Rep. Bruce Vento obviously sides with environmentally \n     conscious Twin Citians who would preserve both areas as their \n     private playground.\n       A recent Star Tribune/WCCO-TV Minnesota Poll shows that \n     most Minnesotans want federal mediators to resolve the \n     dispute. They will help, but it will be Minnesotans making \n     the decisions and not Congress. That's the Minnesota way.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [The Duluth News Tribune, July 17, 1996]\n\n                       BWCAW Bills Deserve to Die\n\n       Americans can relax more when their state legislatures and \n     Congress are not in session.

Contrary to what some partisans \n     continue to say, mediation would not let federal bureaucrats \n     dictate a solution.

Mr. President, I rise today to clarify a provision \nincluded in the credit reporting section of the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations Act.\n  Section 2403(a) clarifies existing law with respect to the \n``permissible purposes'' for which a consumer report may be obtained \nunder the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The provision establishes that \npurchasers and servicers are permitted to review a borrower's credit \nreport in connection with the decision of whether to purchase a loan \nobligation and/or its servicing. This allows a purchaser or other \ninvestor to value more accurately a portfolio of loans based on the \ncurrent credit characteristics of the borrowers of the underlying \nobligations. Servicers can also use the information to better value \nservicing rights that they are considering purchasing. In addition, the \nprovision would allow a current loan insurer to use credit reports in \nassessing its existing risk. By reducing uncertainty in the secondary \nmarkets, I am hopeful that consumers will be well served by lower \nprices.

Mr. President, in this time of two-worker \nhouseholds, working parents are increasingly faced with the difficult \ntask of balancing work and family.\n  Every day in this country, families must find a way to meet the \nchallenges that await them at home after a long day on the job. Some \ndays it seems impossible to maintain a career while trying to figure \nout a way to get the shopping done, put dinner on the table and pick up \nthe kids at soccer practice.\n  That is why today, Mr. President, I am proud to stand here to \nannounce that Delaware companies are taking the lead and making it \neasier for working parents to balance their careers and families.\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\n  One particular company, MBNA America, which is based in Wilmington, \nDE, was recently honored as one of the top 10 family-friendly companies \nby Working Mother magazine.\n  This is the second straight year that MBNA has been named as one of \nthe top 10 companies for working mothers and the fifth straight year \nthat it has been named in the top 100.\n  Also, in the September 16 issue of Business Week, MBNA was named as \none of the top 10 businesses in terms of their work and family \nstrategies. This is the first time that Business Week has rated \ncompanies for their family-friendly practices, and it shows that \nbusinesses are most successful if they take their work and family \nstrategies seriously.\n  Speaking about MBNA, Business Week stated that ``the bank won the \nhighest grades, from employees, who cited strong programs and job \nflexibility.''\n  MBNA is to be commended for instituting policies and programs that \nare sensitive to the realities of two-income families. None of this \nhappens without leadership--especially leadership at the top. And in \nthis case, it comes from Charles Cawley, chairman of MBNA and a \nrenowned business and community leader.\n  Let me tell you about some of the things that MBNA does for its \nworkers. MBNA offers three on-site day care centers that serve MBNA \nemployees. I have had the opportunity to visit one of the two centers \nthat are in Delaware, and I cannot stress enough what a benefit it is \nfor workers to be able to take advantage of these day care centers. In \nDelaware, these centers give the parents of around 400 children the \npeace of mind that their child is in good hands.\n  Also last year, 109 men and 264 women took advantage of childbirth \nleave of absences that averaged 13 weeks. This is a wonderful \nopportunity for parents to be there for those precious first weeks of \ntheir child's life.\n\n  Another important benefit that is offered by the company is adoption \nassistance of up to $5,000. This allows employees to provide a stable \nhome and family to a child who needs that love and stability so badly. \nJust another way that companies can help build strong families.\n  Employees can take advantage of $849,000 in company-sponsored college \nscholarships that allow those who wish to better themselves the \nopportunity to do so. After all, education is the greatest investment \nthis country can make.\n  Working Mother magazine also applauded MBNA for having flexible work \nhours by utilizing job-sharing strategies and compressed work weeks.\n  And, the study showed that women account for a high percentage of \nexecutive positions at MBNA. Women make up 39 percent of vice \npresidents at MBNA and 16 percent of all senior executives are women.\n  Besides MBNA, two other Delaware companies were honored recently as \nfamily friendly companies. DuPont and DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical were \nnamed as 2 of the top 100 companies by Working Mother magazine for \ntheir leadership in creating job strategies that are sensitive toward \nfamilies. DuPont was also named in Business Week's top 10 list, and \nother companies with facilities in Delaware, such as Hewlett-Packard \nand Nations Bank, have been praised for their family oriented policies.\n  Mr. President, these work strategies that take into account everyday \nfamily life do not just benefit the employees, but also the employer. \nThere is little doubt that recruitment, retention, morale, and \ntherefore productivity all increase when companies implement family-\nfriendly policies.\n  I am proud that MBNA and other Delaware companies have emerged as \nleaders in creating family work strategies, and I hope that this trend \ncontinues throughout Delaware and throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12349-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12350-S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE FOR LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on Monday I introduced S. 2167, the \nChildren's Health Insurance for Long-Term Development Act--the CHILD \nbill. In simple terms, this legislation will require private health \nplans to cover all necessary health and screening services for infants \nand children through age 3. But it has a broader purpose. It will close \nthe gap between two entities that serve America's children, the health \nsystem and the school system, by addressing an important health risk \nthat has implications for children's educational achievements and later \ndevelopment.\n  A significant body of research demonstrates that the first 3 years of \nlife are critical to children's development--mentally, physically, and \nemotionally. In particular, during the first 3 years of life the human \nbrain and central nervous system undergo their most rapid period of \nneurological development. This time period--the Infant Neurological \nRisk Exposure Period--provides both a substantial risk and an important \nopportunity. If we can ensure that children receive the health care, \nparenting, and environmental influences they need during their first 3 \nyears, we can give our children a strong start in life. If, however, we \nneglect their physical and mental development during this crucial \nperiod, we have lost an important opportunity to promote learning and \nprevent damage to brain functioning.\n  Obviously, there are many influences on a child's early development, \nsuch as parental influence and childrearing practices, comprehensive \nhealth care, environment, mental stimulation, and community support. As \na nation, we have an opportunity and an obligation to provide children \nwith a safe, healthy, stimulating environment during their early years. \nThis bill takes an important step toward this goal.\n  First, this legislation identifies a critical period in children's \ndevelopment--the Infant Neurological Risk Exposure Period [INREP]. \nBrain and nervous system development during this period has a long-\nlasting impact on the child's life. I hope that by singling out this \nparticular timeframe, this legislation will focus greater attention on \nimproving health care and supportive services during infancy and early \nchildhood.\n  Second, this bill will require private health insurers to cover \ncomprehensive preventive and curative services through age 3. These \nthird-party payors will therefore be financially responsible for the \ncare children need to be adequately monitored and treated through this \nimportant developmental period.\n  I was startled to learn that 86 percent of children who are privately \ninsured are not covered for comprehensive well-child care. Children who \nreceive health coverage through the Medicaid program are covered for a \ncomprehensive array of well-child care, diagnostic assessments and \ntreatment services through the EPSDT program, yet most children who are \nprivately insured do not have similar coverage. Health screenings and \nperiodic check-ups provide an important opportunity for physicians to \nensure that a child's neurological development is progressing along \nnormal patterns--and to intervene as appropriate if it is not.\n  This comprehensive approach will also address other problems in \npediatric health care, such as ensuring that children are completely \ncovered for immunizations through this time period. This coverage will \ncounter current immunization trends that leave 60 percent of children \nin most States with incomplete immunizations at age 2.\n  I should also emphasize that this bill, by its very nature, cannot \nhelp children who are uninsured. We need to pursue further legislation \nthat addresses this important problem. In a recent study on children's \nhealth insurance, the GAO noted that the proportion of children who are \nuninsured--14.2 percent, or 10 million children--is at the highest \nlevel since 1987. This decline in children's health insurance coverage \nhas been concentrated among low-income children.\n  Mr. President, all children should have health insurance that covers \ntheir complete developmental needs. We are the wealthiest, most \npowerful, and most advanced nation on this planet. But it is \ndiscouraging that we still have so far to go when it comes to caring \nfor our own children.\n  My friend and respected colleague Senator John Kerry has offered one \napproach to this problem using sliding-scale subsidies; we should \nexplore this option and others in order to ensure that America's \ninfants and young children achieve their highest potential.\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\nMy proposal represents the first step towards this important goal--the \nnext step is health coverage for all children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12350-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KIDS, GUNS, AND DEATH\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, last summer the Illinois Council \nAgainst Handgun Violence asked kids how their lives had been affected \nby guns and gun violence. Over 200 school-age children wrote and \nsubmitted essays. Last Sunday, the Chicago Sun Times printed the three \nwinning essays. The expression, out of the mouths of babes, has never \nbeen more true than when reading the three winning essays. These three \nwinners, a second-grader, a seventh-grader, and an eleventh grader, get \nwhat far too many of their elders do not: bullets, guns, and violent \ndeath should not be an increasingly routine part of these children's \nlives. I ask that the three winning essays printed in the Chicago Sun \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Sept. 29, 1996]\n\n                         Kids, Guns, and Death\n\n       It is a sad fact of life: Children today are profoundly \n     aware of the threat of gun violence. Last summer, the \n     Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence asked school-\n     children how this omnipresent danger touches their lives, and \n     what they thought should be done to end it. Asked to speak \n     for themselves, more than 100 children from nearly two dozen \n     schools submitted essays. It is powerful testimony. Many \n     wrote of their personal brushes with gun violence; far too \n     many told of losing family members and friends, and a few of \n     actually witnessing fatal shootings. Here are the winning \n     essays from three age categories. These young authors will \n     read their entries Oct. 5, when the 14th Annual Walk Against \n     Handgun Violence steps off from the Daley Center Plaza at 11 \n     a.m.\n\n\n                           Zachery Jefferson\n\n       Last week, when I layed down to rest for the night. I \n     couldn't sleep because I heard the sound of gunshots in the \n     air. My heart just pound and pound, until I heard the lock \n     turn and the door slam. After I heard my mommy's voice. I was \n     able to sleep.\n       I was worried about my mother walking to our building. I \n     live in a tall building called Stateway Gardens. My mother \n     Ms. Jefferson's work day begins in the afternoon and ends \n     late night about 12:30 midnight. I know it isn't safe for my \n     mom to walk the street in my neighborhood at night alone. She \n     has to work to take care of my sister and I.\n       When I grow up I want to be a policeman, not just a \n     policeman but the Chief of Police. I want to change things. \n     It should be against the law for people to just shoot. Those \n     bad people who are shooting guns like crazy mustn't realize \n     how it feels to worry, or maybe they don't have a mother who \n     works to take care of a family.\n       Well, my heart pounds and beats like a drum when I am upset \n     or worried. For those who don't know what it feels like, I'll \n     tell you. It's like losing something very special and that \n     moment when you realize it's gone, your heart races real fast \n     and sweat pops on your face and your knees shakes.\n       Please stop now. If you don't, watch out for me later! I \n     will be coming with my badge on.\n\n\n                              Rhea Jackson\n\n       Guns are something very serious. Many people think that a \n     gun is the answer to solving their problems that won't go \n     away. This isn't true. There are many other ways to solve \n     your problems. People today don't care if a younger child \n     gets injured, shot, killed or even paralyzed because all that \n     really matters to them is to kill their problem that won't go \n     away.\n       Today many boys are killing each other over some crazy \n     things like money, drugs, shoes, name-brand clothes and even \n     girls. That affects me a whole lot because that might be me \n     one day. Instead of the boy getting shot I might get shot in \n     his place.\n       I come from a very overprotective household with a father \n     who is on me like white on rice. Sometimes I feel that he \n     needs to give me a break and let me go to a friend's house. \n     However, when I go I see people who don't have fathers they \n     can turn to and I realize why my father is like that. He \n     doesn't want me to get caught between gangs cross-firing at \n     each other. Then I begin to see how lucky I am to have him \n     around.\n       I feel that it must stop because many youngsters, like \n     myself, want to live long, be able to live to see over the \n     age of 21. I think that the gangs should come to a truce and \n     live together in peace. If that doesn't work, then the police \n     should be more aware of the gang activity going on. I'm \n     saying these things because my cousin almost got in a \n     crossfire between two gangs. They don't realize that bullets \n     don't have names like they think. I think that the reason why \n     kids join gangs is because of peer pressure, for attention \n     and because they don't have anyone to turn to.\n       As you can see there are many things that scare me and \n     other kids. The gangs have little kids, even kids at the age \n     of 5, planning their funerals instead of dreaming about their \n     weddings or Sweet 16 birthday parties.\n       If my essay gets published in a popular magazine or \n     newspaper, please remember: ``Bullets Don't Have Names.''\n\n\n                              Claudia Ruiz\n\n       I personally experienced gun violence with the death of my \n     cousin. I grew up with him and when he died from seven bullet \n     wounds. I lost part of myself. Anyone who loves someone close \n     to them knows that the pain is incurable, except with the \n     dulling that time brings. It changes the lives of all those \n     who knew the victim because part of their life is gone and \n     there are no second chances.\n       Nothing is worth dying for, especially when the decision is \n     not yours. No one has the right to make that decision for \n     anyone. The anger that accompanies the pain is also \n     destructive. Often when a gang member is killed, his brothers \n     seek revenge. This brings further violence and loss of life. \n     No one gains, and the cycle of violence keeps turning.\n       The cause of gun violence is that teenagers are joining \n     gangs at an early age. Some of them join gangs because of the \n     lure of money from selling drugs. Perhaps their family is \n     poor and they need the money to support themselves and their \n     family. Selling drugs offers them an easy solution. More \n     often gang members come from families where they were \n     neglected. They are looking for somewhere to belong, \n     somewhere safe.\n       I believe in each cases that the blame lies largely on the \n     parents who do not give their children the support they \n     needed while they were young. However, that is not to say \n     that the parents are not facing tremendous odds trying to \n     raise their children in an environment where gun violence and \n     gang membership is prevalent. In large families, the older \n     children are neglected as the parents are busy looking after \n     the young. Unfortunately, the older children still need their \n     guidance. Often, elder children become lonely and depressed. \n     For these reasons, they may join a gang to find friendship \n     and belonging. Although the gang may feel like their \n     salvation, their only salvation is to be able to talk to \n     their parents instead of fighting against them. These youth \n     need someone to show them that their families are where they \n     may find safety. They need counseling so that they may talk \n     about their fears and the problems in their family and on the \n     street.\n       In addition, violence prevention counseling would educate \n     the youth to find other solutions to violence in resolving \n     their anger. They need someone to point them in the right \n     direction and to show them they have choices in the future if \n     they make the right decisions now. They need guidance to \n     learn how to be themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12351-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12351-S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE VANCOUVER NATIONAL HISTORIC RESERVE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to express my sincere \npleasure that the Vancouver National Historic Reserve will be \nestablished as a result of the enactment of legislation by this \nCongress.\n  We have worked for several years in a bipartisan fashion to establish \nthis important historic site in Vancouver, WA. This vision for \ncooperative management of the historic resources at Fort Vancouver \nbegan with the city of Vancouver and former Congresswoman Jolene \nUnsoeld. Congresswoman Unsoeld had the vision, leadership, and \ndetermination to develop a broadly supported plan to preserve and \npromote several chapters in the colorful history of the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  This proposal has been 10 years in the making. Throughout these \nyears, the vision has been for a collaborative effort between the city \nof Vancouver, the Army, and the National Park Service. In recognition \nof the opportunity to coordinate the management and interpretation of \nthe historic areas around Fort Vancouver, Congress in 1990 established \nthe Vancouver Historic Study Commission to develop a plan for the area \nand make a recommendation to Congress. In 1993, the five members of the \ncommission--representing the National Park Service, City of Vancouver, \nArmy, State Historic Preservation Office, and the public-at-large--\nunanimously approved a strategy for the area. The commission's report \ncalled for the establishment of a Vancouver National Historic Reserve. \nThe reserve would be cooperatively managed by the various public owners \nof the area through the Vancouver partnership. Key controversies such \nas the continued operation of Pearson Airpark were addressed and \nthoughtfully resolved.\n  Legislation to implement the commission's recommendations was \nintroduced in 1994 by former Congresswoman Unsoeld but was unable to \npass in the closing days of the 103d Congress. In an effort to maintain \nprogress on the historic area, the city entered into a memorandum of \nagreement with the National Park Service regarding the operation of the \narea on November 4, 1995. Nevertheless, legislation was still needed to \nimplement the MOA and the commission's recommendations.\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\n  During this Congress, we have worked with the city and the Park \nService in a bipartisan fashion to address outstanding concerns and \ndevelop legislation to effectively establish the reserve. Senator \nGorton and I, and Congresswoman Smith, introduced bills to establish \nthe reserve. When the committee began to develop an omnibus parks bill, \nSenator Gorton and I worked to include the Vancouver Historic Reserve \nand were successful. The simplified version of our bill included in the \nomnibus measure raised concerns for the Park Service and was improved \nduring the conference with the House.\n  As last-minute negotiations on this omnibus parks bill progressed, \nthere was some miscommunication regarding the administration's support \nfor the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. As is now clear, the \nadministration fully supports the establishment of the reserve and \nsupports it's inclusion in this omnibus measure. And so do I. I look \nforward to the development of the Vancouver partnership and the \ncoordinated management it will bring to the historic treasures of \nVancouver, WA. Treasures of the entire Pacific Northwest that must be \npreserved for future generations.\n  The Vancouver National Historic Reserve is truly ``Once Place Across \nTime''. From the Native American cultures and communities that lived \nand traded in the region for over 100 centuries to Lewis and Clark's \nexpedition and the Hudson Bay Company's fur trade, the areas of the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve are at the foundation of the \nhistory and the legacy of the Pacific Northwest and the great State of \nWashington. Our journey from these beginnings through the decades is \nalso visible through Fort Vancouver, the Vancouver Army Barracks and \nOfficer's Row, and Pearson Airfield.\n  The multiple layers of history tells us so much about our region and \nourselves. I look forward to the sense of continuity the reserve will \nbring to the history of this place. The connection of people and places \nacross the span of time will bring an improved sense of place to this \nwonderful area of our region and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12351-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHILDHOOD HUNGER DAY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commend the American \nCulinary Federation for its efforts to combat the problem of childhood \nhunger in the United States. Although we are the richest nation on \nEarth, each day 1 out of 12 children under the age of 12 goes to bed \nhungry. In my own State of New Jersey, 91,000 children must endure \nhunger as their constant companion. Children are our most valuable \nnatural resource, and as a nation we cannot tolerate a situation where \nour youngest citizens are deprived the most basic necessity.\n  Mr. President, I know that we all agree that steps must be taken to \nend the epidemic of childhood hunger. If we do not condemn this \nsituation by our actions, then we condone it by our inaction.\n  Mr. President, in New Jersey, the Jersey Shore Chapter of the \nAmerican Culinary Federation is dedicated to fighting this scourge. \nAmong its many activities, on October 16, the federation will again be \nholding its Childhood Hunger Day Forum in Washington, DC. The event is \ndesigned to increase awareness of the problem of childhood hunger, and \nit will give voice to the millions of small children who suffer in \nsilence.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the foundation's efforts, and I wish it \nevery success on Childhood Hunger Day and for all of their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12352-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STANISLAV REMBSKI\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

He taught himself to draw--and he teaches us all \nhow to enjoy and appreciate art through his writings and lectures.\n  Stanislav Rembski is one of America's premier portrait painters. He \nhas painted over 1,000 commissions--including well-known portraits of \nPresident Woodrow Wilson and President Franklin Roosevelt. He has \npainted five of Maryland's first ladies and these paintings hang in \nGovernment House in Annapolis.\n  Stanislav Rembski is known for capturing the spirit and personality \nof his subjects. That is why so many of his portraits are used in \nhistory books--they tell us more about the subject than any photograph \never could. I encourage everyone to see this for themselves. A \nretrospective of his work is now on display in the Enoch Pratt Library \nin Baltimore.\n  Mr. President, Stanislav Rembski honors his Polish heritage and his \nadopted American homeland. His paintings are a gift that will grace our \nmuseums and public buildings forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12352-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of H.R. 4236.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4236) to provide for the administration of \n     certain Presidio properties at minimal cost to the Federal \n     taxpayer, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Omnibus \nParks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, H.R. 4236. I rise to \nspeak in support of this important legislation and to urge my \ncolleagues to render their support.\n  H.R. 4236 evidences a Herculean effort by the entire membership of \nthis Congress as the provisions of the legislation will touch and \naffect the width and breadth of our great Nation. The Washington Post \nnoted in an editorial today that\n\n       [i]t's amazing what a Congress finally comes down to. The \n     members spend two years making speeches and otherwise taking \n     positions on the great issues of the time, whatever those may \n     be. Then it turns out that what they really care about are \n     not those lofty issues at all but lesser items. . . . this \n     year's case in point involves the parks bill still before the \n     Senate.\n\n  Contrary to the cynical and negative view of the Washington Post, I \nam of the belief that this legislation is of primary importance to the \npeople of my great home State of Mississippi and to the people of this \ngreat Nation. Why do I say this? Clearly, the thousands of phone calls \nand letters that I have received expressing the importance of the many \nworthy projects and goals as set forth in this bill--projects such as \nthe Corinth, MS, battlefield interpretive center and the Natchez \nNational Historical Park visitor's center--are evidence of the support \nthese projects have received and of their importance. The support in my \nhome State has been overwhelming as many individuals and groups have \nworked tirelessly to preserve and protect the heritage of our great \nState as well as to provide the proper surroundings and facilities for \nvisitors to these cities from Mississippi and from other States.\n  What could be a more worthy goal of our efforts and what could \nprovide our people with better examples of what is right with America? \nOur parks are a refuge from the tediousness of our daily work lives \nand from the sense of frustration we feel as we watch the world change \naround us. Our parks reassure us that this country will preserve the \nheritage that has made our country great.\n\n  And where do these attitudes develop from which we seek this refuge? \nWhy, from the media's constant highlighting of the negative factors we \nface rather from the hope and optimism that produces change and \nimprovement, of course.\n  A famous American once remarked that he preferred death to a loss of \nliberty. Mr. President, I prefer the worthy goals envisioned in this \nlegislation and the efforts to achieve those goals to the negativism of \nthe media--give me the enjoyment, serenity, and educational \nopportunities provided by our parks and permit me to pass on the \nnegativism provided by the Washington Post.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend the people \nof the Corinth and Natchez areas of Mississippi for their dedication to \nthe goals that we achieve by the passage of this legislation today. To \nthem I say, well done, good and faithful servants and protectors of the \npublic interest.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend \nthe leadership and tenacity of my friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski. He has represented his State well in this \nmatter and has never lost sight of the best interests of the country as \na whole.\n  Mr. President, I have concerns that we have not adequately addressed \nprivate property rights in this bill as we could and should have done. \nWe could and should have done more to adequately address private \nproperty rights protection in every aspect as those rights are affected \nby Federal law. I pledge my continued support to those efforts in the \nnext Congress. However,\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\ndespite such failure, the worthiness of this legislation and the good \nit will do for the people of Mississippi and the rest of the United \nStates has convinced me to strongly support this bill and to urge my \ncolleagues to give H.R. 4236 their strong support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation which addresses the urgent needs of many national parks \nacross our country.\n  This bill is important to maintaining the historical integrity of \nVirginia's national parks and provides additional protections and \nrecognition for 10 historically significant Civil War battlefields in \nthe Shenandoah Valley.\n  This legislation also includes a provision I have sponsored for many \nyears authorizing a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the \nDistrict of Columbia. The Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the oldest \npredominately African-American fraternity in the United States, will \nestablish this memorial without cost to the Federal Government.\n  Freestanding legislation sponsored by Senator Sarbanes and myself has \nbeen favorably reported from the Committee on Rules and Administration \nlast year and in prior Congresses. This memorial will live as tangible \nrecognition of Dr. King's remarkable contributions to our Nation. It \nensures that his message of nonviolence and freedom for all must be \npassed from generation to generation.\n  In accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, Dr. King said:\n\n       Nonviolence is the answer to crucial political and moral \n     questions of our time; the need for man to overcome \n     oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and \n     violence.\n\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss not to commend Chairman Murkowski of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the ranking member, \nSenator Johnston for their determination to forge a bipartisan package \nand for their continued attention to the protection of Virginia's \nhistoric resources.\n  Throughout this Congress, the members of the Energy Committee have \nworked with me to advance the protections of the Civil War battlefields \nin the Shenandoah Valley and to provide for a modest expansion of both \nthe Colonial National Historic Park and the Cumberland Gap National \nHistorical Park.\n  The conference report on the Omnibus Parks bill before the Senate \nlast week included additional provisions relating to the management of \nthe Richmond National Battlefield Park and the boundaries of the \nShenandoah National Park.\n  Mr. President, these provisions had the bipartisan support of the \nVirginia delegation and permitted the Park Service to improve the \nmanagement and to expand the boundaries to include historically \nsignificant lands in these parks.\n  I am very disappointed that the administration did not concur with \nthe views of the Virginia delegation and raised significant objections \nto these two provisions. While updating the boundaries of the \nShenandoah National Park and expanding the boundaries of the Richmond \nNational Park are very important to me and to those host local \ngovernments and citizens, I understand the need to move forward with \nthis bill today.\n  Let me be clear, that I look forward to bringing these two matters \nback before the Senate next year. I know that with further discussions \nwith the administration, the Park Service will understand our intent to \nrespond to the resource needs of these parks.\n  Mr. President, despite these omissions, the matter before the Senate \nincludes three provisions for Virginians that represent years of hard \nwork, dedication, and commitment by many individuals at the local \nlevel.\n  I am very pleased that this bill provides for the expansion of the \nColonial National Historic Park and the Cumberland Gap National Park, \nand brings long overdue national recognition to the Civil War \nbattlefields in the Shenandoah Valley.\n  The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District is the \nproduct of an in-depth study by the National Park Service which was \nauthorized by the Congress in 1990. The Park Service conducted field \nsurveys of fifteen battlefields in the valley and concluded in their \nanalysis that ``because of their size and unprotected status, the \nbattlefields of the Shenandoah Valley were its most important most \nneglected, and most threatened resource.''\n  The legislation before the Senate today provides for the preservation \nand visitor understanding of the significant battlefields of McDowell, \nCross Keys, Port Republic, Second Winchester, New Market, Fisher's \nHill, Tom's Brook, Cedar Creek, Kernstown, and Opequon. The historic \ndistrict also incorporates the historic transportation routes utilized \nby both Union and Confederate troops during the pivotal valley \ncampaigns of 1862 and 1864.\n  Mr. President, throughout my service in this body, I have been \nactively involved in the preservation of Virginia's historic resources. \nOne of my first initiatives in 1980 was to sponsor legislation to \nexpand the boundaries of the Manassas National Battlefield Park by \n1,522 acres. I am pleased that the Congress continues it's recognition \nof Virginia's rich history and contributions to our national heritage \nwith the designation of the valley's battlefields as a historic \ndistrict.\n\n  Many citizens committed to fostering the protection of these \nbattlefields have worked diligently since the Park Service study began \nin 1990 to craft a consensus proposal that recognizes the limits of the \nFederal Government's resources to acquire substantial acreage in the \nvalley and balances the needs of property owners and local governments \nto provide for their economic future.\n  I have remained committed to this effort because of the steadfast \nsupport and leadership by many local citizens, property owners, \npreservationists, and local government officials in the valley. They \nhave given generously of their personal time to organize local \nmeetings, testify before Congress, and work with the Park Service to \nadvance our proposal. It is clear that our efforts today would not be \npossible without their firm resolve and passion to preserve these \nbattlefields.\n  According to the Park Service, the areas in the valley possess \nsignificant historical integrity and remain in excellent condition for \npreservation.\n  The citizens of the valley are to be commended for their responsible \nstewardship over the years to protect these battlefields for future \ngenerations to enjoy and understand the tragedy of the Civil War in the \nvalley. Today, this bill ensures that they will no longer be \nshouldering this effort alone. Today, the National Park Service becomes \na full partner in this task.\n  The central feature of the historic district designation is to \nencourage and promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the Federal \nGovernment, State and local governments, property owners, and \npreservations groups.\n  We have been fortunate that the valley's predominately agricultural \nland uses have provided protection for these battlefields. This rural \nlandscape, however, is rapidly changing.\n  Now is the time for the Federal Government to become a full partner \nwith local and private efforts to bring national recognition and to \ndevelop a coordinated preservation strategy for these battlefields.\n  As noted in the Study of Civil War Sites in the Shenandoah Valley of \nVirginia ``no single alternative is best suited to these sites. A \nbalance must be achieved between preservation, the Valley lifestyle, \nand economic development * * *''.\n  In keeping with these recommendations, I believe the historic \ndistrict designation with specific duties for the Park Service and \nCommission provides the right balance for preserving these \nbattlefields.\n  With direct Federal assistance and resources, a commission comprised \nof local representatives and historians to devise a plan for \nstewardship, the authority for the Secretary and the commission to \nenter into cooperative arrangements with local governments and private \nlandowners, we are achieving enormous protections for these national \ntreasures and promoting compatible economic growth through heritage \ntourism.\n  Mr. President, the provision on the Colonial National Historic Park \npassed this body earlier this year and in prior Congresses. It \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey land and sewer lines \nto the County of York and authorizes the necessary funding to \nrehabilitate the Moore House sewer system to meet current Federal \nstandards.\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\n  The necessity for this legislation is evident based on the growing \nneeds of the county and the limitations of the National Park Service's \nability to continue to provide sewer services to the local community.\n  In 1948 and 1956 Congress passed legislation which directed the \nNational Park Service to design and construct sewer systems to serve \nFederal and non-Federal properties in the area of Yorktown, VA. In \n1956, the National Park Service acquired easements from the board of \nsupervisors of York County and the trustees of the town of York. At \nthat time, York County was a rural area with limited financing and \npopulation. Now, York County has a fully functioning Department of \nEnvironmental Services which operates sewer systems throughout York \nCounty.\n  Negotiations to transfer the Yorktown and Moore House systems have \nbeen ongoing since the 1970's. This provision fulfills the commitments \nmade between the Park Service and York County to provide for the full \ntransfer of ownership to York County.\n  Equally important, is another element of the Colonial provision which \npermits the acquisition of a small parcel of land along the Colonial \nParkway near Jamestown. This 20-acre parcel is critical to protect the \nscenic integrity of the parkway. This area has the narrowest right-of-\nway of any portion of the parkway.\n  The acquisition includes one row of lots adjoining the parkway in a \nrapidly developing residential neighborhood known as Page Landing. \nDevelopment of those lots would have a severe impact on the scenic \nqualities of the parkway. In order to prevent any disturbances to this \nland, the conservation fund responded quickly to purchase this parcel. \nThe Park Service identified this property as a high priority and the \nconservation fund intends to transfer title to the land to the Park \nService.\n  The Colonial Parkway was authorized by Congress as part of the \nColonial National Historic Park in the 1930's to connect Jamestown, \nWilliamsburg, and Yorktown with a scenic limited access motor road. \nAccording to the 1938 act of Congress, the parkway corridor is to be an \naverage of 500 feet in width. In most areas, the roadway was built in \nthe middle of the corridor. In the area between Mill Creek and Neak \nO'Land road, however, the parkway was built closer to the northern \nboundary to avoid wetlands, placing the roadway very close to the \nadjoining private property.\n  This segment is the only area along the parkway where the National \nPark Service owns only 100 feet back from the centerline of the road. \nThe Park Service owns 250 feet or more from the center line in all \nother areas of the 23-mile parkway in James City County and York \nCounty.\n  Mr. President, this bill ensures that the Colonial Parkway provides a \nconsistent level of scenic integrity along the entire parkway that will \nwell-serve the purpose of the parkway for years to come.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about provisions in \nthe omnibus parks bill that affect my State, Virginia. Our Commonwealth \nis rich in historic and natural resources and I am pleased to support a \nparks bill that establishes a national historic district in the \nShenandoah Valley and authorizes improvements to the Colonial National \nHistorical Park.\n  Mr. President, establishing a national historic district in the \nShenandoah Valley will help preserve the legacy of the Civil War in the \nvalley. We worked with people at the grassroots level to balance the \ninterests of property owners, local and State government officials, and \nhistoric preservationists while providing a Federal presence to protect \nthe battlefields from development. This new designation means the \nhistoric district will have the national recognition and resources of a \nnational park unit, but it will enjoy complete local control.\n  This legislation also establishes a commission made up of landowners, \npreservationists, and local and State government officials to work \ncooperatively with the Park Service to preserve the battlefields. The \nCommission will have the power to administer and manage the park, while \nthe Park Service will help with technical assistance and land \nacquisition.\n  Mr. President, we have also been working for years to make \nimprovements at the Colonial National Historical Park, and this bill \nfinally permits two actions that will improve the park's management. \nThe parks bill authorizes a boundary adjustment to permit the Park \nService to acquire property adjacent to the Colonial Parkway, the \nscenic 23-mile road connecting Jamestown Island, Williamsburg, and \nYorktown.\n  The Colonial provision also allows the Park Service to transfer a \nsewage system to the appropriate service authority, York County. \nManaging the sewer system does not fall under the responsibilities of \nthe Park Service and the transfer should have been completed years ago.\n  Mr. President, work remains on resolving boundary concerns for \nShenandoah National Park and the Richmond Battlefields Park, and I am \nhopeful that the Virginia congressional delegation will work to achieve \na solution in the 105th Congress. The progress we've made will provide \na framework for the next Congress so we may finally address the \nconcerns of private landowners, local governments, and \npreservationists.\n  In addition, Congress should move forward next year and pass \nlegislation that highlights the special historical significance of the \nNew Market Heights battlefield. Preservation of this area is important, \nfor it marks the area where 14 black Federal soldiers won the Army \nMedal of Honor for Valor. The sacrifices of these soldiers were so \nnotable that they helped ensure passage of the 13th amendment, which \nabolished slavery.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am proud to represent a State \ninterested in the protection of our natural, cultural, and historic \nresources. And that is why I stand in support of the Virginia \nprovisions in this bill. The passage of this bill demonstrates our \nconcern and commitment to preserving our national parks.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that today the \nSenate is acting to ensure the preservation of Sterling Forest, a \nnationally significant tract of land in the Highlands area of New York \nState on the New Jersey border. This bill authorizes $17.5 million for \nestablishment of a Sterling Forest Reserve and designates the Palisades \nInterstate Park Commission [PIPC] to manage the new entity. The over \n15,000 acres of Sterling Forest we protect today is the last link \nneeded to form an unbroken chain of 100,000 acres of parks and \nprotected lands in the New York-New Jersey region--one of the biggest \nparcels of protected land east of the Mississippi River.\n  Not only do these lands contain a wide variety of wildlife and \nplants, but they also protect one-fourth of the drinking water for New \nJersey and provide needed open space for about 20 million people in the \nNew York-New Jersey metropolitan region.\n  The land will be purchased from willing sellers through a unique \npartnership of State, Federal, and private interests and will be \nmanaged by the PIPC, a New York-New Jersey parks management body. Since \nthe PIPC currently manages 23 other parks, visited by over 8 million \npeople each year, we can be assured that the reserve will be well cared \nfor.\n  The Federal contribution authorized by this bill amounts to only a \nsmall portion of the total needed, but it is the crucial piece that \nmakes the rest of the plan come together. Enactment of this bill also \nfrees up $9 million for Sterling Forest land acquisition, contained in \nthe recently-enacted Continuing resolution.\n  Although located entirely in New York State, the area affected by the \nbill represents some of the most critical New Jersey watershed still \nleft undeveloped and in private hands. It also contains the largest \nunbroken tract of forest land still remaining along the New York-New \nJersey border. This 20-square-mile parcel represents a complete range \nof wildlife habitat, hills and wetlands, and is home to a large number \nof threatened and endangered species.\n  The forest is crossed in the north by the Appalachian Trail, a unit \nof the National Park System, which is used heavily for hiking. Even \nbetter, this area provides a taste of the outdoors for a region where \nsuch experiences are at a premium. In fact, 1 in every 12\n\n[[Page S12362]]\n\nAmericans lives within a 2-hour drive of its boundaries.\n  Most important for New Jersey, though, are the billions of gallons of \nfresh, clean drinking water that flow from within its boundaries. The \nMonkville/Wanaque reservoirs, which draw from the Sterling Forest \nwatershed, serve one in four New Jerseyites and many New Yorkers as \nwell. To threaten this watershed is to threaten the health and \nlivelihood of millions of Americans or force taxpayers to pay many \ntimes the cost of this land for expensive water treatment facilities.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, it gives me great satisfaction to rise today \nin support of HR 4236, the Omnibus Parks bill. Although this bill \nbecame entangled in several battles on other issues, I think everyone \nwill agree that passage of this legislation in its final configuration \nrepresents the Senate's commitment to passing small, yet locally very \nimportant legislation that otherwise could have gotten lost in the \nshuffle. In particular, I am pleased to see one provision that will \nreform the Forest Service's fee structure for ski area permits on \nForest Service land. Last year, Senator Murkowski and I introduced this \nbill to simplify the process of collecting fees from ski areas for use \nof Forest Service land.\n  When I introduced the bill with Senator Murkowski, I emphasized the \nimportance of this bill for ski areas across the country, but also the \nenvironmental importance of this bill. Skiing is one of the best uses \nthat we have today on our national forests. The ski industry brings \nmillions of people to the mountains to enjoy fresh air, scenery and the \nmountain environment. Few other national forest activities are able to \nhost such intense public use with relatively minimal impact.\n  By refining the structure of the fee structure, operators of ski \nareas will be able to continue in this productive relationship with the \nForest Service. The streamlined fee structure will also enable the \nForest Service to move towards a fee system that is closer to fair \nmarket value. It also will save the Forest Service and the ski industry \nconsiderable time and money in collecting these fees.\n  It is my hope that through reforms such as this, the private sector \nand the Federal agencies that manage our public lands will continue to \nbuild a cooperative and productive relationship in protecting and \nproviding access to our public lands.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Omnibus Parks \npackage and I would like to note the inclusion of two very important \ncomponents in this package for my State.\n  The first is authorization of $17.5 million for the Secretary of the \nInterior to purchase over 15,000 acres of the Sterling Forest. This \nland, located in New York, is the source of drinking water for 25 \npercent of New Jersey households. Located just 35 miles from New York \nCity, Sterling Forest contains excellent recreational and scenic \nopportunities and is habitat to hundreds of animal species. The \ndeveloper of this land, a Swiss company, had plans to develop thousands \nof residential units and millions of square feet of commercial space. \nThis legislation will ensure that these plans do not go forward. The \nSterling Forest Corp. agreed to sell the property for $55 million. The \nFederal contribution will complement a commitment of $20 million from \nthe governments of New York and New Jersey, and several million dollars \nfrom numerous private contributions.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, and I \nsponsored legislation to protect the Sterling Forest and I am pleased \nto see it included in the package before us today.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the bill before us contains \nanother important piece of legislation that Senator Bradley and I \nintroduced--S. 188, to designate the Great Falls Historic District in \nPaterson, NJ. Mr. President, the Great Falls area of Paterson is known \nas the birthplace of the industrial revolution. In 1791, Alexander \nHamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, founded the Society for the \nEstablishment of Useful Manufacturers at the Great Falls. He used the \nGreat Falls to supply power to various mills and factories, thereby \nallowing Paterson to become one of the world's great industrial cities.\n  This legislation allows the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \ncooperative agreements to preserve and interpret Paterson's history. \nThis historic and cultural recognition would provide a great boost for \njobs and economic development in Paterson and will complement an urban \nrevitalization program under the leadership of Mayor William Pascrell.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important package.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this omnibus parks legislation is a \ntremendous victory for the entire Nation.\n  This landmark bill will protect natural and historic resources in 41 \nStates, including four areas of particular importance in Massachusetts. \nSenator Kerry and I have worked closely on these provisions with Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski and \nSenate Parks Subcommittee Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell and the \nranking members of the committee and subcommittee, Senators Bennett \nJohnston and Dale Bumpers. We commend them and thank them for their \ngreat assistance and support.\n  The omnibus legislation establishes a new Whaling National Historical \nPark in New Bedford, which will preserve and showcase dozens of \nhistoric buildings that will appear much as they did in the whaling \nindustry's heyday. The park will include the Seamen's Bethel--the \nchurch in Moby Dick where the narrator heard Father Mapple offer \nprayers for sailors before setting out to sea. It will also include the \nErnestina, the restored, century-old vessel that is the oldest Grand \nBanks schooner in existence and is now moored in New Bedford's port.\n  Another important feature of the park is the Old Dartmouth Historical \nSociety's Whaling Museum, which houses the world's premier whaling \narchives and art collection. The museum's library contains thousands of \nship logs, charts, maps, photos and other records documenting the \nhistory of whaling in America.\n  Another important feature and demonstration of the strong private \nsector commitment to this park is the Visitor Center, located in an \nhistoric building that was donated last year by the Fleet Bank.\n  I'm also pleased that the park will encourage cooperation with a \nNorth Slope Cultural Center being developed in Barrow, AK where whaling \nis still a way of life.\n  The New Bedford National Whaling Historical Park will provide a \nsignificant boost to the economy of the region, as more and more \nvisitors come to New Bedford to learn about its extraordinary history.\n  The omnibus parks legislation also creates a Boston Harbor Islands \nNational Recreation Area, which will preserve historic and cultural \nsites, expand recreational opportunities, and improve public access to \nthe 31 picturesque islands that are found throughout Boston harbor.\n\n  Each of these islands bears an indelible mark from past eras of the \nNation's history. Their names alone capture the imagination--Hangman \nIsland, Bumpkin Island, Moon Island, Castle Island, Spectacle Island, \nHog Island, Raccoon Island, Snake Island, Nut Island, World's End \nIsland, each with its own story and tradition.\n  During the past three centuries, the islands' lighthouses and \nRevolutionary War-era fortifications have played a strategic role in \nthe defense of Boston communities. Boston Light, which began operation \nin 1716 and is now the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the \ncountry, is located on Little Brewster Island.\n  Today, the islands offer abundant opportunities for visitors to enjoy \nswimming, fishing, camping, digging clams, picking berries, catching \nbutterflies, watching birds and whales, and hiking on well-maintained \ntrails. All of the islands offer spectacular views of the modern Boston \nskyline and the Atlantic Ocean.\n  The preservation of the Boston Harbor Islands has long-standing \nbipartisan support, and I am confident that the Boston Harbor Islands \nNational Recreation Area will serve as a magnet to attract visitors to \nthe many other cultural attractions in the Boston area.\n  The omnibus parks bill also creates the Essex County Heritage \nDistrict to protect the region's natural resources and emphasize its \nhistoric role in the\n\n[[Page S12363]]\n\nNation's development. Essex County already includes 23 National \nHistoric Landmarks, nearly 80 historic districts, and wharfs, \nshipyards, meeting house, textile mills, and numerous shoe factories \nthat bear witness to the early settlements of the United States, and \nthe area's emergence as a maritime and industrial power.\n  The region also has extensive natural and scenic resources--\nmarshlands, beaches, harbors, rocky farmlands and islands--which amply \ndemonstrate why maritime pursuits and water-powered industrial \ndevelopment first began here. The National Heritage Area will help \nensure that visitors discover the many historic assets throughout Essex \nCounty.\n  Finally, the omnibus parks legislation enables the Blackstone River \nNational Heritage Corridor to continue to ensure that this region's \nunique heritage as the cradle of America's Industrial Revolution is \npreserved for generations to come. It adds five more communities to the \nCorridor--Worcester and Leicester in Massachusetts and Burrillville, \nGlocester, and Smithfield in Rhode Island. In addition, the bill \nextends the life of the Commission overseeing the Corridor for an \nadditional 10 years, through 2006. The Blackstone Valley program has \nbeen a remarkable success and deserves this vote of confidence by \nCongress to continue this important work.\n  The Nation will benefit immeasurably from the important parks \nprovisions in this legislation. The omnibus parks bill is a significant \ninvestment in our Nation's natural and historical resources, and I \ncommend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their skillful \nwork in developing this impressive bipartisan legislation. I urge the \nSenate to approve it.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the omnibus \nparks and public lands legislation which is expected to pass the Senate \ntoday, clearing the way for the President's signature. This legislation \ncontains numerous important provisions to preserve and protect our \nNation's scenic rivers and historic land areas. I am pleased that, \nafter many days of negotiations, we have reached agreement on this \nimportant environmental legislation.\n  Included in this comprehensive package is a bill to designate the \nLamprey River in New Hampshire as part of the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System. Recognizing the window of opportunity was closing, I \nrecently fought to bring the Lamprey bill to a vote in the Senate, but \nunfortunately, I was blocked by the Democratic leader on two separate \noccasions. I continue to express my disappointment with the Clinton \nadministration and Senate Democrats for holding up legislation that is \nso important to New Hampshire and many other States around the country.\n  Even though the Lamprey River bill received unanimous support out of \ncommittee in the Senate, and it has passed the House of Representatives \nunanimously, the Democratic Party had objected to its passing in the \nSenate simply on the basis of partisan politics. I think the people of \nNew Hampshire deserve better than that. They deserve to have partisan \npolitics put aside for the sake of our environment.\n  On August 10, 1995, Senator Gregg and I introduced S. 1174, the \nLamprey Wild and Scenic River Act, to designate a segment of the \nLamprey River in New Hampshire as part of the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System. Since introduction, a hearing was held on the \nlegislation in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and soon \nthereafter, the bill was reported unanimously out of the committee.\n\n  The history of this legislation goes back almost 5 years when Senator \nRudman and I introduced the Lamprey River study bill in February 1991, \nwhich was subsequently signed into law by President Bush later that \nyear. Once the National Park Service determined the Lamprey River's \neligibility for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, a local \nadvisory committee was formed to work with local communities, \nlandowners, the National Park Service and New Hampshire's environment \ndepartment in preparing a comprehensive management plan. This \nmanagement plan was completed in January 1995.\n  The Lamprey River Management Plan was subsequently endorsed by the \nadvisory committee as well as the local governments affected by this \ndesignation. The primary criteria for my sponsorship of this \nlegislation was the support of the local communities. If the affected \ntowns did not vote in favor of designation, it would not have received \nmy enthusiastic support.\n  In fact, the town of Epping had expressed some reservation about \ndesignating the segment of the Lamprey which runs through the town and, \nout of respect for their concerns, the bill excludes that segment of \nthe river. However, that segment was studied and found to be eligible, \nso we have included a section in our bill that would allow the town of \nEpping to be involved in the implementation of the management plan and, \nupon the town's request, be considered for future designation.\n  The Lamprey River is well deserving of this designation for a number \nof reasons. Not only is the river listed on the 1982 National Park \nService's inventory of outstanding rivers, but it has also been \nrecognized by the State of New Hampshire as the ``most important \ncoastal river for anadromous fish in the State.'' Herring, shad and \nsalmon are among the anadromous species found in the river. In fact, \nNew Hampshire fishing maps describe the Lamprey as ``a truly exeptional \nriver offering a vast variety of fishing. It contains every type of \nstream and river fish you could expect to find in New England.''\n\n  The Lamprey is approximately 60 miles in length and serves as the \nmajor tributary for the great Bay, which is part of the National \nEstuarine Research Reserve System. The Great Bay Refuge is also nearby, \nwhich was established several years ago following the closure of Pease \nAir Force Base. The preservation of the Lamprey is a significant \ncomponent to protecting this entire ecosystem.\n  The 11.5-mile segment, as proposed by our legislation, has been the \nfocus of local protection efforts for many years. The towns of Lee, \nDurham, and Newmarket, local conservationists, the State government, as \nwell as the congressional delegation have all come together in support \nof this legislation. I believe the management philosophy adopted by the \nadvisory committee best articulates our goals for this legislation: ``* \n* * management of the river must strike a balance among desires to \nprotect the river as an ecosystem, maintain the river for legitimate \ncommunity use, and protect the interests and property rights of those \nwho own its shorelands.''\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senate \nmajority leader Lott, Senator Murkowski, and others in negotiating an \nagreement on this comprehensive legislation. In addition, I want to \nespecially commend two members of the Lamprey River Advisory \nCommittee--Judith Spang of Durham, NH, and Richard Wellington of Lee, \nNH--who have worked very hard on the Lamprey River legislation and have \ntraveled to Washington to testify on its behalf. I am very pleased \nthat, at last, the fruits of their labor will be rewarded with the \nadoption of the omnibus parks bill. I urge the President to sign this \nimportant environmental legislation as the 104th Congress adjourns.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the bill be advanced to third \nreading and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nall without further action or debate.\n  The bill (H.R. 4236) was deemed read a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Chief of Staff of the President, Mr. Leon Panetta, \naddressed to me as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, and a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Dan \nGlickman to Mr. Mark Suwyn, president of the Louisiana-Pacific Corp.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  October 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Murkowski: The Administration is aware of \n     your deep concerns regarding the problems of the Ketchikan \n     Pulp Company (KPC). Given your interest in these matters, we \n     propose that the government begin discussions on these issues \n     immediately. Those discussions must take place in\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\n     the context of the Administration's long-standing policies, \n     namely: we will not consider an extension of the KPC's \n     contract until the Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) is \n     complete; we cannot accept conditions reversing any part of \n     the Tongass Timber Reform Act; and, we will accept nothing \n     less than full compliance with all environmental laws.\n       You have stated the company is considering closing the pulp \n     facility, which we would consider a material breach of the \n     contract. We understand that the company has a different \n     view. Based on our previous discussions we will agree to an \n     immediate mutual cancellation of the contract and give KPC \n     all of the timber and logs released under contract to them. \n     This should equal nearly 300 million board feet of timber. If \n     there is no mutual agreement on contract cancellation, timber \n     sales will be made available on a competitive basis in \n     Southeast Alaska in a sufficient supply to operate the two \n     sawmills for 24 months, and in accordance with applicable \n     law.\n       The parties would cancel the contract based on their mutual \n     desire to avoid litigation over whether the government is \n     providing sufficient timber and over whether closure of the \n     pulp mill is a breach. The agreement would define the \n     respective litigation rights of the parties regarding \n     contract claims.\n       We understand the importance of these issues to Southeast \n     Alaska. The Administration is committed to working with the \n     Governor, the Alaska Congressional delegation, and all \n     interested parties to ensure sustainable and diversified \n     opportunities for the workers, families, industries, and \n     communities of Southeast Alaska. We look forward to effective \n     joint coordination of our State and Federal resources through \n     the auspices of the State of Alaska and the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Leon Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                                  October 3, 1996.\n     Mark Suwyn,\n     President: Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Portland, OR.\n       Dear Mark: I appreciate your coming to Washington to meet \n     with me, the Governor, and Alaska's congressional delegation \n     and for the proposal you conveyed in your September 19 \n     letter. Let me preface my reply by affirming the long-\n     standing policy of the Administration within which further \n     discussions must take place. We will not consider an \n     extension of Ketchikan Pulp Company's (KPC) contract until \n     the Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) is complete; we \n     cannot accept conditions reversing any part of the Tongass \n     Timber Reform Act; and we will accept nothing less than full \n     compliance with all environmental laws.\n       You have stated you are considering closing the pulp \n     facility, which we would consider a material breach of the \n     contract. We understand that you have a different view. Based \n     on our conversations, we will agree to an immediate mutual \n     cancellation of the contract and give KPC all of the timber \n     and logs released under the contract to them. This should \n     equal nearly 300 million board feet of timber. If there is no \n     mutual agreement on contract cancellation timber sales will \n     be available in southeast Alaska on a competitive basis in a \n     sufficient supply to operate the two sawmills for twenty-four \n     months and in accordance with applicable law. The parties \n     would cancel the contract based on their mutual desire to \n     avoid litigation over whether closure of the pulp mill by KPC \n     is a breach and over whether the government is providing \n     sufficient timber under the contract. The agreement would \n     define the respective litigation rights of the parties \n     regarding related contract claims.\n       In view of your proposal to close the pulp facility, I \n     intend to begin immediately to determine steps the Department \n     can take, unilaterally and with the State of Alaska, to \n     mitigate the effects of the closure on the affected workers, \n     their families, ancillary industries, and the communities of \n     southeast Alaska. We understand the importance of these \n     issues to southeast Alaska. We are prepared to begin \n     discussions immediately so that we may resolve these issues, \n     while providing strong and meaningful support for the people \n     and communities of southeast Alaska.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding that the statement in the second \nparagraph of the Panetta letter to Senator Murkowski and the Glickman \nletter to Mark Suwyn, president of Louisiana-Pacific Corp.--October 3, \n1996--regarding the provision of timber to southeast Alaska for 24 \nmonths will only apply if, due to a breach of contract, timber is no \nlonger available to KPC under the contract and there is no mutual \nagreement on contract cancellation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, that is my understanding also.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, that is my understanding also.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, Congress today has given its final \napproval to legislation I have worked to enact for much of my Senate \ncareer. It will, for the first time in the history of our Nation, \nestablish a unit of the national park system that is devoted to \nteaching about and preserving the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.\n  This legislation is not sweeping, In fact, it allows the Federal \nGovernment to acquire by donation only 180 acres of prairie. Certainly, \nthis is nowhere near as vast and expansive as other units in out \nnational park system. It is, however, an important milestone. For about \n50 years, Kansans have argued about the need for and size of a \ntallgrass prairie park. Debate over past legislative proposals, some \nattempting to establish a park through the use of eminent domain, tore \napart Kansas communities. I remember when this was a topic one avoided \nin conversation for fear of angering a friend or neighbor.\n  I am pleased that those days are behind us. By bringing an array of \ninterests to the table and initiating face-to-face discussions, the \nKansas congressional delegation has over the past 5 years hammered out \na proposal to establish a national preserve that pleases nearly \neveryone. The legislation is unique for the National Park Service in \nthat it provides the Federal Government with a core area that it will \nown and use to educate the American people about the tallgrass \necosystem and grazing that began with buffalo and is now used to raise \nsome of the finest beef cattle in the world. The bill keeps more than \n10,000 acres within the preserve's boundaries in private hands, owned \nby the conservation organization the National Park Trust. It provides \nfor cooperative agreements to be reached between the private property \nowner and the Federal Government to give the American public an \nopportunity to bike across and enjoy vast undeveloped stretches of \nvirgin tallgrass prairie.\n  When I leave the Senate in a few weeks, I plan to return to my farm \nabout 20 miles from this preserve. The topography of my ranch is much \nlike that of this preserve, and I often find it difficult to explain to \nmy colleagues what this part of the country is like and why I love it. \nWilliam Least Heat-Moon in his best-selling book about this area titled \n``PrairyErth'' claims the beauty of this land is contained in its \nsubtlety and vast expanses--sometimes easily overlooked by outsiders \nwho quickly pass.\n  When the wind blows, as it almost always does in this part of the \ncountry, one can look out from the top of the region's gentle rolling \nhills and watch a sea of grass bending and waving across one's entire \nline of sight. Ungrazed, this grass can stretch ten feet high. For \ngrazing, one can find no nutritionally richer land in the country. It \nwill add more than 2 pounds a day to steers left to graze on its rich \nmixture of grasses.\n  It is not difficult to let the mind wander when standing alone and \nlooking out across the prairie, absorbing its shades of greens in the \nspring and summer and its browns through the fall and winter. It is not \ndifficult to get a sense of what the Native Americans must have felt \nhundreds of years ago when they crossed this land hunting for the great \nbuffalo herds. One can also appreciate how the pioneers must have felt \nwhen they crossed this same land a century ago, carrying their dreams \nand possessions in covered wagons. Walt Whitman aptly called this \nprairie ``our characteristic landscape, the center of our national \nidentity.'' It is appropriate that we Americans set aside at least a \nportion of it for perpetual use and protection by the American people. \nThis legislation will finally do that.\n  The passage of the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act would not \nhave been possible without the countless individuals who have worked \nover the years to see this idea become a reality. Former Kansas \nCongressman and current Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has \nattempted for more than a decade to create this Federal preserve. It \nwas his persistence and willingness to bring opposing conservation and \nagriculture interests together to work out their differences that built \nthe foundation from which this current legislation evolved. Similar and \nsteadfast support also came from Senator Bob Dole, Representative Jan \nMeyers, and former Representative Jim Slattery. Controversy over a \ntallgrass prairie park stymied many previous Congresses, and it was \nthrough the commitment and unique talents of each of\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\nthese members that we were able to make meaningful and lasting progress \non this legislation.\n  I would also like to thank Governor Bill Graves and former Governor \nMike Hayden, both of whom publicly lent their support to this effort \nand helped shape public opinion in Kansas and beyond in favor of \ncreating this preserve.\n  Representative Pat Roberts, in whose district this preserve will be \nlocated, deserves special accolades. For the past 4 years, Pat has \nworked tirelessly to reassure skeptics that this unique approach to \ncreate the preserve would work. No one should underestimate how much \nhis word meant to many in the agriculture community. His sponsorship of \nthis bill in the House further added to the credibility necessary to \nget this bill passed by the House of Representatives.\n  There are too many Kansans who have worked diligently to see this \nbill enacted to name each, but a few should be noted. Ron Klataske of \nthe National Audubon Society was the first champion of creating the \npreserve on land known as the Z-Bar or Spring Hill Ranch. He and \nmembers of the Flint Hills National Monument Committee, led by Lee \nFowler, Charles Rayl, Ken Harder, and Larry Bayer, were early and \nconsistent supporters of this effort. Five years ago, another group of \nthoughtful Kansans came together in an effort to find common ground \nbetween agriculture and conservation interests and look for ways to \nprivately acquire and preserve the ranch. Led first by Ross Beach and \nthen by Jan Lyons, this commission helped bring thoughtful, reasoned \ndeliberations to this issue, and for that I am indebted.\n  When the idea of creating a tallgrass preserve faded from the front \npages of Kansas newspapers, I could always depend on the editorial \nwriters from almost every Kansas newspaper to lend their support to \nthis legislation. Leading the charge was always the editorial staff of \nthe Wichita Eagle, who time and time again, both in their editorial \ncolumns and in their sometimes biting cartoons, remind Kansans why \ncreating a tallgrass prairie preserves is so important to the state.\n  Efforts to embrace a public/private partnership to create this \nnational tallgrass prairie preserve may have remained nothing but an \nidea if it had not been for the involvement of the National Park Trust, \nwho in 1994 purchased the property that will become the preserve. They \nimmediately approached the Kansas congressional delegation and said \nthey were ready to work with us to make preservation efforts a success. \nPaul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation, and NPCA board members Gordon Beaham, Eugene Brown, Dolph \nSimons Jr., and Bill Watson, all played an important role in this \neffort. The same is true for Paul Duffendack, a board member for the \nNational Park Trust. I extend a special thanks to Laura Loomis of the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association and Peggy O'Brien Marsh of \nthe National Park Trust for the time they spent assisting me and my \nstaff on this legislation.\n  Officials at the Department of the Interior spent hours helping my \noffice fine tune this proposal Ed Cohen, deputy solicitor at the \nDepartment of the Interior, Denis Galvin, associate director, \nprofessional services at the National Park Service, Mike Tiernan, \nattorney at the National Park Service, and Linda Potter, legislative \naffairs specialist at the National Park Service, all lent their help, \npatience, and expertise to this effort. Equally helpful have been the \nsupport of Don Castleberry, former regional director of the National \nPark Service's Midwest Region, David Given, deputy field director of \nthe Midwest Field Area, and Steve Miller, superintendent of the Fort \nScott National Historic Site.\n  In 1990, the Kansas congressional delegation directed the National \nPark Service to conduct a study on the feasibility of making this area \na unit of the national park system. Randall Baynes, superintendent of \nthe Homestead National Monument in Beatrice, NE, was assigned to \nundertake this task. Randy did this job professionally, but he \nunfortunately felt the angry wrath of some who opposed creating a \npreserve. He handled the furor with dignity and grace. Randy died \nunexpectedly in 1993, and I want his wife, Judy, and his children, \nMelissa and Keith, to know how much I appreciate the contribution he \nmade to this effort. Creation of this preserve is an appropriate legacy \nto Randy's love of the prairie and his belief that this preserve should \nbe created.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the hard work of several \ncongressional staffers including: Mike Horak of my staff, Brian \nSweatland, Heidi Cashman, and Tom Hemmer with Representative Pat \nRoberts; Keith Yehle with Representative Jan Meyers; Mike Torrey and \nKeira Franz with Senators Bob Dole and Sheila Frahm; and Sherry Ruffing \nwith former Representative Dan Glickman. I would also like to express \nmy gratitude to Jim O'Toole, John Piltzecker, and Julia Gustafson of \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for their help in \ngetting this bill through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation will be the last piece of \nlegislation to become law during my 18-year career in the Senate. It is \nan accomplishment that I am quite proud of. Let me assure my colleagues \nthat as private citizen Kassebaum, I will work to ensure that this \npreserve meets your high expectation. I have joked for some time that I \nplan to spend my retirement volunteering as a docent at this preserve, \nso I encourage my colleagues to stop by if they ever find themselves \ndriving through the beautiful rolling prairie of east-central Kansas. \nCome and see one of the Nation's newest units of the national park \nsystem. I assure you that it will be well worth your time, and I will \nbe happy to show you around.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that language agreed to by the \nKansas delegation for inclusion in a committee report on this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record. This language, agreed to by the \ndelegation, the owner of the Spring Hill Ranch, its leasee, and \nreviewed by the National Park Service, is our attempt to give the \nNational Park Service direction on future grazing policy. This \nlegislation will become law without a committee report, and I want the \nCongressional Record to reflect the delegation's views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The conference agreement includes language to create a \n     tallgrass prairie national preserve in the Flint Hills of \n     Kansas. The preserve will be created through a unique \n     private/public partnership between the federal government and \n     a private conservation group. The partnership is the \n     culmination of decades of discussions between agriculture and \n     conservation interests who, until now, have disagreed over \n     issues such as federal ownership and cattle grazing as part \n     of a tallgrass prairie preserve in Kansas. The language \n     drafted in this legislation is the result of consensus \n     building and compromise between these various groups.\n       While the conference agreement only provides for federal \n     ownership, by donation, of 180 acres of land on the preserve, \n     it is hoped that the National Park Service, through the \n     cooperative agreement language contained in this bill, will \n     be able to work with the private land owners (and its leasee) \n     of the rest of the 10,894-acre ranch to provide interpretive \n     and recreation opportunities within the boundaries of the \n     preserve, but beyond the federally owned core.\n       The stated purposes of this bill remain broad to give the \n     National Park Service maximum flexibility in determining land \n     use practices within the preserve through the general \n     management planning process, with input from an advisory \n     committee created by this bill. We believe a public planning \n     process, with input from all Kansans, including local \n     citizens and adjacent landowners, will enable the National \n     Park Service to identify the best use for the 180 federally \n     owned acres and provide guidance for possible cooperative \n     agreements between the federal government and the private \n     owner and its leasee.\n       The conferees note that the Kansas congressional delegation \n     is united in its belief that a strong emphasis of the \n     preserve should include the management of range lands through \n     historic and contemporary ranching practices. While the \n     conferees are unwilling to include language in the act that \n     would require any predetermined use of private property \n     mentioned within this bill, the conferees agree with the \n     Kansas congressional delegation that current cattle ranching \n     activities, consistent with the ecologically sound and \n     sustainable management of this property, should continue \n     after the preserve is created. Cattle ranching, as practiced \n     under the current grazing lease, is consistent with the \n     interpretation of the history and culture of the Flint Hills \n     region of the tallgrass prairie.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the closing minutes of the 104th \nCongress, I just want to express my deep appreciation for all of those \nwho worked so\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\nhard to pass the parks bill. As everyone knows, that omnibus parks bill \ncontains the Presidio trust legislation which I sponsored in the \nSenate, and which is so important to my State of California, to the \ncity of San Francisco, and to so many people who care about the \npreservation of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n  If I may, I would like to thank the majority leader at this time, and \nthe minority leader. I thank my colleagues and friends relative to the \neffort that has been put in here.\n  This is a major environmental bill. It has approximately 136 titles \nthat affect a broad area of America's public lands, and it is very, \nvery important.\n  I am sorry that Senator Boxer can't be here. Senator Feinstein worked \nvery hard. The merits of the Presidio speak for themselves.\n  Senator Bradley has been a champion representing the interests of the \nSterling Forest in both New Jersey and New York, Bob Bennett, of Utah, \nand Orrin Hatch, on Snowbasin.\n  And I thank my staff, Gregg Renkes, Mark Rey, Gary Ellsworth, Andrew \nLundquist, and Alex Polinksy.\n  And, particularly the majority leader again for accommodating the \nextraordinary hard work, effort, and time to resolve it.\n  This is a very meaningful piece of legislation.\n  I want to congratulate all of you who have been a party to it.\n  I want to pay tribute to Senator Johnston, my good friend who is \ndeparting. And I look forward next year to working with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, as we pursue our obligations on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, with the presumption of \ncontinued chairmanship and his position in the ranking position.\n  Thank you, Mr. Leader.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Bradley and Senator Boxer.\n  I, of course, thank the whip.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief because Senator Lott \nand I do have some other business to tend to, and then to call the \nPresident at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take just a moment to congratulate Senator \nMurkowski for his efforts on the omnibus parks bill just passed. As he \nhas indicated, this has been one of the most difficult and contentious \nand complicated sets of negotiations I think we have had in the whole \n104th Congress. That success we now have is only possible as a result \nof the extraordinary efforts made by a number of people.\n  I want to cite, in particular, Senators Bradley and Boxer for their \nremarkable efforts over the last couple of days. They were instrumental \nin making this happen. Senator Boxer and Senator Bradley worked with \nSenator Murkowski and brought this about through cooperation and a \ntremendous amount of persistence.\n  But, as Senator Murkowski has indicated, there are others as well who \nhave been very much a part of this effort. Senator Bumpers and Senator \nFeinstein also have been very helpful; Senator Nickles and a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have been committed to this bill.\n  So this is an achievement of some magnitude affecting, as the Senator \nhas indicated, perhaps 136 projects in 41 States. It is long overdue. \nThis has been an effort that has been underway now for a long period of \ntime.\n  Let me also thank and congratulate the administration for their \nefforts over the last couple of days. As he tends to do in these \nmoments of crisis, Leon Panetta, in particular, has made this work. He \ndeserves special commendation, along with a number of other members of \nthe administration staff.\n  So we are very appreciative of the cooperation and the effort made. \nAt long last we have passed a parks bill of great magnitude and great \nimportance. And I appreciate the work done on all sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n    expanding the blackstone river valley national heritage corridor\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it seems to me that protecting and \npreserving our Nation's special places, like the Blackstone Valley, is \none of the Federal Government's most important functions. That is why I \nam so delighted that my bill to reauthorize and expand the Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor was included in the omnibus \nparks bill that was agreed to today.\n  There are few other areas in the country that have had as rich and \ndiverse a history as the Blackstone Valley. For centuries, the \nBlackstone River has been the center of life in the valley. The Native \nAmericans who first inhabited these shores enjoyed abundant fishing and \nhunting along the river. Settlers came in search of farmland and \ninstead found that the river provided a powerful new source of energy. \nBy the late 1700's, bustling towns appeared up and down the river. They \nwere joined by sawmills, and in 1793, Slater's Mill, the river's first \ntextile mill, opened, signalling the birth of the Industrial \nRevolution.\n  When the Blackstone Corridor was created in 1986, it represented an \nentirely new approach for the National Park Service. The corridor is \nnot at all like the typical national park, where the Federal Government \nowns and manages the land. Its boundaries span two States; it contains \nwhole cities, towns, and villages; half a million people live in the \nBlackstone Corridor. It truly represents a partnership between the \nFederal Government and State and local governments and communities in \nRhode Island and neighboring Massachusetts.\n  Under the umbrella of the Corridor Commission, individuals from \ndifferent communities, levels of government, and walks of life are \nworking together toward a common vision--and with impressive result.\n\n  In the early 1970's, the Blackstone River, like so many rivers and \nlakes throughout our Nation, was in deep trouble. It was apparent that \nmany years of pollution had wiped out much of the river's wildlife. The \nonce polluted river has been cleaned up. A beautiful greenway for \nbicyclists and hikers is underway. Historic mills have been restored. \nNational Park rangers and volunteers are giving tours and educating \nvisitors about the valley's rich history. The Blackstone Valley area is \none of Rhode Island's environmental and historical jewels. With its \nrestoration, this area's strong sense of price and community spirit has \nbeen revitalized.\n  All this is being done with relatively little money from the Federal \nGovernment, because every Federal dollar that goes into the corridor is \nleveraged many times over.\n  I introduced S. 1374, which established the corridor, on June 27, \n1985, and on November 10, 1986, the bill became law. Since then, the \nRhode Island congressional delegation, and the Massachusetts \ndelegation, have worked together each year to strengthen the corridor. \nToday, the corridor stretches 46 miles along the Blackstone River, from \nWorcester, MA to Providence, RI. The corridor encompasses 20 cities and \ntowns over a 250,000-acre area. Efforts to interpret and preserve the \nvalley's historical and scenic resources are coordinated by the \nBlackstone Corridor Commission and the National Park Service works \nclosely with the commission, providing invaluable technical assistance \nand guidance.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 601 to reauthorize the commission and \nexpand the corridor with Senators Pell, Kennedy, and Kerry. This bill \nextends the life of the Blackstone Corridor Commission--which, under \ncurrent law, would expire in November--for another 10 years. In \naddition, it adds to the corridor five new communities--three in Rhode \nIsland and two in Massachusetts--which are culturally and historically \ntied to the existing corridor and contain the headwaters of the \nBlackstone River. This logical expansion will allow the commission to \ninterpret and protect the region's resources in a comprehensive and \nunified fashion. Finally, my legislation increases the commission's \nannual authorization from $350,000 to $650,000, in recognition of its \ntremendous success and new responsibilities.\n\n  The Senate Energy Committee held hearings on my bill, and it was \nreported out of the Commission on April 7, 1995. It was included in the \nomnibus parks bill and attached to the Presidio Management bill which, \nafter some setbacks, was unanimously approved by the full Senate.\n  Since that time, Members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have been engaged in a lengthy and difficult \nconference, attempting to work out the differences between the \nproposals. Many highly controversial provisions that would have led \nboth to opposition in the Senate and the possibility\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\nof a veto by the President have been dropped.\n  I commend Senate Murkowski for his efforts to accommodate the \ninterests of so many colleagues and greatly appreciate his work to \nrestore my version of the Blackstone Reauthorization bill. I know the \nHouse fought hard to replace my bill with the House Resources Committee \nproposal which would have authorized a lesser appropriation and would \nhave extended the life of the commission for 5 years only. This would \nnot have give the commission enough time to complete its work.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We just passed the resolution congratulating him, but \nI personally would like to congratulate him for outstanding leadership \nsince he has assumed majority leadership of the Senate. I believe this \nhas been a very, very productive legislative session.\n  There is an article in Rollcall today that talked about the Senate, \nthis Congress, spending more time than any Congress since World War II. \nI think the record would show, for the last couple of months, this has \nbeen a very, very productive Congress, whether you are talking about \nwelfare reform--historic welfare reform, or whether you are talking \nabout reaching back and passing line-item veto. Whether you are talking \nabout actually trying to rein in the growth of Government--we have seen \nthe size of Government deficits actually declining, I think primarily \nbecause of some restraints on discretionary funds that passed this \nCongress.\n  So, I add my accolades to those of others, to say I think Senator \nTrent Lott, as majority leader, has done an outstanding job, and also \nto say the minority leader, Senator Daschle--we have had a lot of \nconflicts. It has been a tough session, maybe a lot more partisan than \na lot of us would like. Maybe we will be able to improve upon that next \nyear. Certainly, I have enjoyed my working relationship with Senator \nDaschle and have always found him to be cordial. We have worked well \ntogether and, hopefully, the next Congress will be even more cordial, \nless partisan, and more productive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I recall Senator Daschle's able assistance \nworking for 5 years in the office of my friend, Senator Abourezk of \nSouth Dakota. I knew then that this young man was destined to greater \nheights.\n  Senator Daschle was elected to the House of Representatives in 1978 \nand served four terms before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986. \nHe became the first South Dakotan ever to hold a Senate leadership \nposition when he was named cochairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee in 1988.\n  During his Senate career, Senator Daschle has provided capable \nleadership on the following Committees: Finance, Agriculture, Veterans' \nAffairs, Indian Affairs, and Ethics. His work on the Agriculture \nCommittee has helped farmers across the country as he wrote the 1985 \nEmergency Farm Credit Act to aid farmers during the depths of the farm \ncrisis.\n  Mr. President, Senator Daschle has proven to be an effective \nDemocratic leader and strives for cooperation with all of his \ncolleagues. He works closely with our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Lott, to facilitate the legislative process. His calm but \ndetermined demeanor is appreciated on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this resolution commending \nthe distinguished minority leader Tom Daschle, and I extend best wishes \nto his lovely wife, Linda, and their three fine children, Kelly, \nNathan, and Lindsay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nresolution to commend the exemplary leadership of the distinguished \nmajority leader, the Honorable Trent Lott of Mississippi.\n  Senator Lott is the 16th majority leader in the U.S. Senate and the \nfirst Mississippian ever to hold the Senate's top leadership post. He \nwas elected to serve as majority leader on June 12, 1996.\n  The majority leader has earned the respect of his colleagues in both \nthe House and Senate, having served in the House of Representatives for \neight terms. While serving in the House, Senator Lott was elected \nchairman of the House Republican Research Committee and for 8 years he \nserved as the Republican Whip. The personal friendships he developed in \nthe House have contributed well to his recent dealings with the other \nchamber.\n  Senator Lott was elected to the Senate in 1988 and continued his \nleadership service as Secretary of the Senate Republican Conference. In \n1995, he was elected Senate Majority whip and is the first person to be \nelected to the position of whip in both the House and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, since assuming the challenging responsibilities as \nmajority leader, Senator Lott has shown a penchant for moving \nlegislation and a willingness to do so in a bipartisan manner. The \nmajority leader has solid footing in the Senate's top post and it is \nnot on the backs of his colleagues. Rather, Senator Lott has worked in \ncooperation with the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, \nand has been at our side in the trenches of this legislative arena. The \nMajority Leader has cooperated with all Senators to facilitate the \norderly procession of the Senate's business.\n  Mr. President, Senator Lott has a wonderful family and I extend my \nbest wishes to his lovely wife, Tricia and their two fine children, \nChet and Tyler. They are justifiably proud of Senator Lott as a \nhusband, father, and dedicated public servant. I am honored to call him \nmy leader in the U.S. Senate and my good friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of tributary praise \non the floor of the Senate in the last few days. We have heard praise \nfor Members, praise for spouses, and praise for the Senate itself. We \nhave also heard a great deal of praise for staff members, and I want to \nadd to that by taking a moment to say thanks to the many staff members \nI have worked with over the years.\n  It is easy to take staff for granted. Much of what they do is carried \nout in such a way that we might not be aware always of what they are \ndoing. But they put in long hours just like Senators do. They are \ndedicated not only to us, but to the States we serve. My staff has \nhelped thousands of Alabamians and other citizens with problems ranging \nfrom lost Workmans' Compensation benefits to delayed retirement checks \nto securing visas for overseas travel at the last minute.\n  I have been fortunate to have many long-time staff members who have \nbeen with me for many years, some since my first year in the Senate. \nOthers have not been here as long, but have still made valuable \ncontributions. Most have come from Alabama or had some connection to \nthe State, such as being an alumnus of a university or college there, \nbut others have come from the Washington area and other parts of the \neast coast.\n  I am proud of my staff, both here in Washington and in my four State \noffices. They have done an outstanding job for the Senate, for the \nState of Alabama, and for the Nation. Rather than name any one of them \nindividually, at this time I ask unanimous consent that a list of my \ncurrent staff with their hometowns and date of joining the office be \nprinted in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

As we wrap up \nthis session of the 104th Congress, I am constrained to commend, in a \nvery sincere way, the work that has been done by my distinguished \ncolleague, who I serve with, from my State of Mississippi, Trent Lott.\n  As he has taken the reins of majority leader and discharged the \nduties of that important office, I have been very proud of him, and our \nentire State has been proud of him, in the way he has managed these \nchallenges, handled this job in good grace, with a good sense of\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\nhumor, with a keen insight into how to get things done in the U.S. \nCongress, and with a great deal of integrity.\n  He has reflected credit on the U.S. Senate and on the State of \nMississippi, and I congratulate him very sincerely. I thank him for the \nhonor of serving with him as his colleague from our State.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished senior colleague \nfrom the State of Mississippi for his comments this afternoon, and I \nthank him also for the relationship we have had together in Congress \nnow over the last 24 years. We were in the House together, I believe, \nfor 6 years, and then he came to the Senate in 1978. We continued to \nwork together across the Capitol, and it was my great honor to join him \nin this body beginning in January 1989.\n  It has been a great relationship, one that I treasure very much. We \nnot only enjoy working together on behalf of our State, I enjoy his \ncompany, and we quite often have lunch together. I have sidled in next \nto him in that historic desk he has as the senior Senator from \nMississippi, and we talk about our families, our wives, our football \nteam, our future and our country, and I enjoy it always. We even tell a \nfew stories, a few Mississippi jokes along the way to each other, but \nmore than anything else, when the going gets rough, when I want real \nserious, steady, reliable advice given to me straight up, I go to my \nSenator from Mississippi who I work with from our delegation, and he \ngives me very good advice.\n  He has been a member of the leadership of the Senate now for many \nyears. He has done an excellent job as chairman of our Republican \nconference. He is in our leadership meetings, and invariably, again, \nhis advice and counsel is very good, and it is worth listening to. I \nfound when I listen to it, I do OK, and when I don't, I usually mess up \nsome way or the other.\n  I thank him for his comments today, but I also thank him for the fine \nrelationship we have. We will continue to work together for our State \nand our country, and I look forward to that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12370-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on September 26, the Senate failed to \noverride the President's veto of a bill to ban a procedure known \ncommonly as partial-birth abortion. Toward the end of that rollcall \nvote No. 301, I changed my vote to nay. At the time, I am sure all my \ncolleagues realized why I did so. I immediately entered a motion to \nreconsider the vote by which the veto was sustained. In order to be \nable to make that motion to reconsider, it was, of course, necessary \nfor me to cast my vote on the prevailing side. It was, indeed, my \nintention to return to the motion to reconsider the override vote, in \nthe hope that continued public discussion and consideration might cause \nsome of our colleagues to rethink their position and, in fact, vote to \noverride the President's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban.\n\n  But the 104th Congress has run out of time, and it has been clear \nthat no constructive purpose would have been served by yet another \nvote. While I am sure some Senators are having some serious second \nthoughts about that vote, there has been no indication that there has \nbeen a sufficient number change to reverse that earlier vote on the \noverride.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent to withdraw my motion to reconsider \nrollcall No. 301 and that the permanent Record of the 104th Congress \nnote my intention to be included with the 57 other Senators who voted \nto override President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say just a few words about the partial-birth \nabortion issue.\n  This is a matter that has touched the conscience of America. I note \nthat, on both sides of the aisle, there are now several pro-choice \nMembers who support the ban on partial-birth abortions.\n  I will not soon forget the dramatic moment when Senator Coats read \nthe letter from our Coloradan colleague, Senator Campbell, written from \nhis hospital bed, telling us he would vote to override the veto, even \nthough he supports abortion rights.\n  This is clearly an issue that will not go away. Indeed, I anticipate \nearly action on it in the 105th Congress. By which time, continuing \npublic education about the partial-birth procedure will, I believe, \nchange many congressional minds.\n  Here is just on example. Most of the debate on both sides of this \nissue, has concentrated on the use of partial-birth abortion in late-\nterm pregnancies. That may, indeed, be the most shocking aspect.\n  But interviews with abortion doctors by the Washington Post, the \nAmerican Medical News, and the Bergen County, N.J., Record reveal that \nthe great majority of partial-birth abortions--thousands every year--\nare performed in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy. And almost \nall of them are performed for entirely nonmedical reasons.\n  When President Clinton vetoed the partial-birth abortion ban, he \nsuggested an alternative. It turns out that his alternative would be, \nin practical terms, nothing more than the status quo.\n  In the first place, it would not ban a single one of the thousands of \npartial-birth abortions performed in the second trimester of pregnancy.\n  In the second place, its ``serious health'' loophole, as ``health'' \nhas been interpreted by the courts, would render meaningless \nrestrictions even in the last months of pregnancy.\n  When the Senate returns to this issue in 1997, as indeed it must, I \nhope we will find sufficient unity to ban the partial-birth procedure \nat all stages of pregnancy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee had a hearing. It happened to be that the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were our \nprincipal witnesses, and the subject was the ongoing controversy in \nBosnia.\n  Seated next to me, as he has been for these many years of joint \nservice on that committee, was Senator Bill Cohen. It is hard for me to \nexpress in words my respect for this great American and this great U.S. \nSenator, a man who truly is a global thinker. And today he was as \nprofound and as incisive as he has been for all these years that I have \nbeen privileged to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee.\n  He has occupied, somewhere in this area of the Senate floor, the \nchair that he has selected for Maine. But Maine's chair is the chair \nfor the United States of America when it comes to the matter of \nnational security, foreign policy.\n  We may have differed on some occasions, but more often we have been \ntogether. And he has been a fearless speaker, an absolutely fearless \nspeaker and advocate for what he believes is best for the United States \nand, indeed, the world.\n  We have taken trips together. I have seen him in the presence of \nworld leaders, heads of State, heads of Government, and within moments \nafter entering a room, whether it is Europe, Asia, or the Middle East, \nhe is greeted and accepted and listened to as an equal.\n  He is a very hard worker, diligent in his representation for his \nState, a prodigious student of history. But he always found time, Mr. \nPresident, he always found time to spread his great intellect on the \nwritten pages of books, be they novels, or, more importantly, for this \nSenator, be they poems. Lucky\n\n[[Page S12372]]\n\nis the Member of the Senate, or perhaps an observing staffer, who found \nat Senator Cohen's seat, more often at a committee hearing, a doodle. I \nam not much for doodling, but he is an expert, and it is not some \nscribble.\n  What surprises me, having studied engineering and particularly \nengineering drawing and architecture drawing myself--I am a man who \nobserves a straight line or the French curve or whatever--these are \ndrawings that challenge the best of engineering drawings, very precise, \na balance, perspective, and I defy anyone to interpret the meaning. And \ntherein is the real genius.\n  He is able to take these drawings and capture the meaning of the \ndebate in the committee hearing. I have never seen him doodle in the \nSenate--maybe he has--not in the Chamber, but certainly as I sat next \nto him in the Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Aging. \nThey are absolutely magnificent.\n  I asked him one time, ``Are these your ideas of caricatures of other \nSenators?''\n  ``No. They are caricatures of the debate that is taking place, and \nhow I see that debate, where it starts, where it goes, whether it is \nconclusive or inconclusive, whether it is fair and whether it is \nobjective.''\n\n  I have one or two, and I treasure them.\n  He is a meticulous researcher. Perhaps above all, that research to \nbear on legislation that he sponsored--and for a while I was not \ntotally in favor of that legislation--but it was legislation that \neventually put into law the special operating forces of the United \nStates.\n  Much of the work of those forces is highly classified, and therefore \nI cannot discuss it on the floor of the Senate. But the essence of his \nlegislation was to enable our Nation and our Armed Forces to have a \ncadre of men and women in uniform who were able to perform the most \ndifficult of military tasks, whether it is a task that challenges two \nor three or a task that challenges a company-sized group of military. \nAnd those challenges could come at any time, any moment, anywhere on \nthe globe.\n  Because of this man's foresight, we have that capability here in the \nUnited States. My only suspicion at the time that we used to debate it \nwas whether or not it was not already present in the Armed Forces of \nthe United States and whether or not the command and control should be \nunder, say, the Chief of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the \nMarine Corps. And he was right; this should be a separate CINC, a \nseparate four-star officer, whose sole responsibility was not to the \nother services, but to see that this cadre of service persons had the \nequipment, had the training, had the skills and the fortitude to take \non any challenge anywhere in the world.\n  So I join the others who expressed a note of sadness of his \ndeparture, but also a sadness of joy that he and his lovely wife have \nreclaimed--reclaimed--their lives from public service. He, with nearly \na quarter of a century, 24 years in the Congress of the United States, \nhas reclaimed it to go on and have other challenges. I do not doubt for \na moment that he will accept the challenges which will enable him to \nenter into the global policy discussions and other forums of the world \nas it relates to foreign policy and national security, but also to \nreclaim perhaps a little more time to spread his genius upon the paper \nthat all of us can share, be it fiction, be it prose, be it poetry, or \nbe it a foreign policy decision. I wish him well.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12371-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12372-S12373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intended to address the Senate and I \nshall address the Senate with respect to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama who has joined the ranks of those reclaiming his balance of \ntime pursuant to a manner that most befits the desires and the goals of \nthe Senator and his lovely wife.\n  I did not realize you would be here, Senator. I would not suggest \nthat you deviate from whatever you intended to do while I just have a \nfew words here about my dear friend, but I envy you in many ways.\n  We could always start out with the thought that he brought to the \nSenate and to public service for his Nation and his State a knowledge \nof the law and a respect for the law and an understanding of the law, \nand an understanding that the Congress of the United States has the \nresponsibility under the Constitution to enact the law. How many times \nhave I heard him say, and others have heard him, that enacting the law \nis our responsibility--not that of the bureaucrats, the vast army of \nbureaucrats--to write the regulations. Tenaciously, he has fought for \nstrict adherence of the Constitution in the law of the land and not to \ndelegate it to the army of bureaucrats. Yes, I admire him for that, but \nI suppose I admire him because of the tremendous admiration and warmth \nof feeling that other Senators have for him.\n  I have enjoyed several trips to remote places of the world in \nconnection with military matters, I think, on most occasions, the focal \npoint of the trip. Perhaps that focal point was generated by the \nsomewhat disproportionate size and stature of this great Senator, but \nmore often than not it was because of his display of intellect and \ngrasp of the mission on which we were sent to some remote place on \nbehalf of the interests of the United States and the Senate.\n  I was always interested when he would come to the floor in connection \nwith appointments to the Federal judiciary, particularly as it related \nto the Supreme Court of the United States. He, in a very tough, I \nbelieve, fair, and objective manner, laid out the qualifications or the \nabsence of qualifications, in his judgment, and the Senate listened. \nThe Senate listened out of profound respect for our colleague. There \nwere times when his great sense of humor and his sense of camaraderie \nwould give away to a parochial interest.\n  I have seen him exhibit such fervor, particularly in the well of the \nSenate, as to alarm other Senators to the point that they would go in \nopposite directions rather than confront him. That happened, Mr. \nPresident, more often than not on peanuts. No one in the contemporary \nhistory of the Senate has fought harder for the peanut farmer than the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. He would seize us by the arm and \nmake certain that we had commitments from fellow Senators as related to \npeanuts. I enjoy eating peanuts, but there were times in the intensity \nof that debate that I lost all interest and appetite for peanuts. But \nthere he was, and for good reason. The peanut farmers are small. Nobody \nhas made a fortune in peanuts; never have and never will, in my \njudgment; that is, the farmer. It represents to him the spirit of \nAmerican agriculture.\n  He has served on the Senate Agriculture Committee throughout his \nentire career in the U.S. Senate. He has a great respect for those who \ntill the soil and love the land that produces the bountiful harvests \nthat we all enjoy, and really accept almost as a matter of right, in \nthis country.\n  Agriculture is our principal export as it relates to improving the \nbalance of trade.\n  There sits a Senator like a stone wall to defend the role of the \nAmerican farmer and the agriculture of this great land. There sits a \nSenator like a stone wall to protect the freedoms of people, especially \nthose freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\n  We will miss you, my dear friend. And I thank you for the opportunity \nto have spoken a few words from the heart in the deepest of gratitude \nfor your friendship and your wisdom that you have so willfully given \nthis country during your distinguished career.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am deeply humbled to hear the kind words \nof the distinguished gentleman from Virginia--and he is truly a \ngentleman from Virginia. I appreciate them very deeply.\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\n  My mind goes back, as I think about our friendship, to the early days \nwhen we both came to the Senate. On one snowy day in which there were \n24 inches of snow on the ground, the scheduled speaker for the reading \nof George Washington's Farewell Address was Senator John Warner of \nVirginia. In order to be here, he had to walk some 2 miles in the snow \nto get here. I was the Presiding Officer of the Senate on that \noccasion. I got a ride in a jeep and came about a mile. But Senator \nWarner walked all of that way.\n  Since that time I have been following in his footsteps. He has trod \nthrough many minefields, and he has always come out with a great sense \nof feeling for his fellow man and for his State of Virginia.\n  So I appreciate very deeply his remarks. I know that he is going to \nhave a long career here in the Senate. I hope that when he does leave, \nthere will be another Senator who will speak words pertaining to \nagriculture concerning him because he has been a true champion of \nagriculture and a true champion of Virginia peanut farmers, too.\n  So I deeply appreciate everything that he said, and I will look \nforward to many days in the future of having some sort of way of having \na connection with him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may slightly revise and correct the \nrecord of my good friend, the distance was 4 miles. But, more \nimportantly, the last one-tenth of a mile I was on the back of a \ntractor. You may recall that the farmers of America had assembled \nbetween the Capitol and the Washington Monument and were encamped in \nthat snow with their tractors here on a protest. As I came along \nPennsylvania Avenue, one spied me, not knowing I was a Senator but in \nthe true spirit of an American farmer just extended a hand to help, and \nhe put me on the back of the tractor and drove me up the Hill. I \narrived in front of the Capitol of the United States on the back of a \nfarm tractor to walk into a Chamber, Mr. President, that was totally \nempty. No one came from afar except my dear friend from Alabama to hear \nme deliver George Washington's Farewell Address.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for commenting on my career, which \nI fervently hope is not a farewell address.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for many years I was privileged to sit in \nthe back row of this side of the Senate next to the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. That was a privilege for this \nSenator because, as one knows, you often have the opportunity in the \ncourse of debate and other times in the Senate to engage in \nconversation with your colleague that adjoins you. Senator Lugar was \nthere.\n  I shall most dearly miss her departure from the Senate. We came to \nthe Senate together. She virtually decided to reclaim her life from \npublic service after a long and distinguished period in the Senate and \nother responsibilities. I have to recount with some reluctance a story \nabout my first encounter with the distinguished then junior Senator \nfrom Kansas. I had been in the Senate only a year or so, and she \napproached me one day and asked if I would travel to Kansas to give a \nspeech to a local university or college, as the case may be. Memory \ndims, but memory does not dim on the events of that visit because I was \nlooking forward to meeting her distinguished father, Alfred M. Landon, \nwho was the nominee of the Republican Party for the Presidency of the \nUnited States in 1936.\n  So I had done my homework about her father and very much looked \nforward to meeting that historic figure. We arrived. I do not recall \nmuch about the speech, but we were invited to have lunch with her \nfather.\n  Now, I have to add that at that time I had a very unusual and \nbeautiful wife, and upon arriving at the Kassebaum-Alfred M. Landon \nhousehold, it quickly became evident to me that I was not invited to \ncome to Kansas to give a speech; it was immaterial whether I was to \ncome or not. What Alfred M. Landon wanted was to meet my wife. That was \nhis sole ambition, sole reason that Senator Kassebaum invited me out \nthere.\n  We stepped on to the front porch of that wonderful, old, quaint \nhouse, very unpretentious. The candidate, the Presidential candidate, \ncame out, greeted us and then he took command of the situation. He \npointed his finger at me, and he said, ``You sit there on the front \nporch,'' and pointed his finger at his daughter and said, ``You sit \nthere and entertain the Senator. I'm going inside and I'm going to \nvisit with a really historic figure, his wife.''\n  The two of them disappeared. So Nancy and I engaged in some idle \nconversation, and pretty soon we heard the level of laughter rising \nsteadily to where it was a roar. The noise was rolling out the door of \nthe house, and Nancy said to me, ``Something unusual must be taking \nplace.'' And she walked in to find that--I hesitate to tell the story \nbut it is a true fact --Alf Landon had secreted, shall we say, a bottle \nthat contained certain vapors, certain elixir of life, which he was \nprecluded from enjoying but he secreted for this occasion, and both had \ntaken liberally and were enjoying the benefits of a very excited \nconversation.\n\n  I shall always remember that day. I hardly got a word into the \nconversation and went back home thinking that perhaps I was not a very \nimportant U.S. Senator. But I remember that warm greeting of her father \nand how well she handled it, and we have been close friends all these \nmany years in the Senate.\n  I was proud to join other Senators when she broke the logjam and put \nthrough historic legislation time and time again relating to matters \nwithin the purview of her expertise, particularly the health \nlegislation.\n  What a gentle person; what a thoughtful person; what a sensitive \nperson. I do not think I ever saw her without a smile on her face. \nMaybe once. but that was her hallmark, civility--civility that she felt \nso important for this Chamber and for personal relationships. Yes, a \nvery distinguished legislative career, set of accomplishments, of which \nher father would have been very proud had he lived to see this, her \nlast day as a U.S. Senator.\n  We say a fond goodbye to our colleague and wish her well in the next \nchapter of challenges of life, and hopefully she will, like others, \nreclaim a little bit of that personal life to share with others of her \nfamily, to pursue some joys she has earned through her contributions to \nour country and to the great State of Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted.

Mr. President, today I rise to offer the Commemorative \nCoin Act of 1996, an amendment to H.R. 1776, the Black Revolutionary \nWar Patriots Act.\n  This measure incorporates the commemorative coin initiatives that \nhave not only successfully garnered overwhelming support in the Senate, \nas well as the endorsement of the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \nCommittee, but coin initiatives that have also been unanimously agreed \nto by the House of Representatives.\n  Commemorative coins are collectibles that raise the public's \nawareness of events that molded our Nation, of the personal sacrifice \nand contribution from outstanding leaders, and of historic sites and \nfantastic natural monuments.\n  We have already been successful in achieving our goal of \nCommemorative Coin reforms. These reforms are the result of the outcry \nfor boycotts among numismatists nationwide and the losses commemorative \nprograms have been experiencing over the last few years. I called for a \nstudy of the commemorative coin program by the Government Accounting \nOffice in July 1995. The report was not issued until August 1996.\n  The message in the report was simple--either take steps to reform \ncommemorative programs or continue on the same path of burdening the \ntaxpayer. After negotiations with the House, we were able to reach an \nagreement that had the full support of the House, the Senate, the \nCitizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee and the U.S. Mint.\n  The reforms we now have are based on those sponsored by \nRepresentative Michael Castle, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic \nand International Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and \nFinancial Services. Congressman Castle's bill, H.R. 2614, which was \nsupported overwhelmingly in the House, served as an appropriate \nfoundation for the reforms. I commend Mr. Castle on his guidance and \nperseverance as it relates to commemorative coin program reforms.\n  The coin programs that this bill authorizes will give recognition to \ndeserving, influential American citizens and historic figures such as \nJackie Robinson, George Washington, Dolley Madison and Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. For the first in the history of the Mint's commemorative \ncoin program, we will honor not only the sacrifices and contributions \nmade by African Americans during the Revolutionary War period, but \nCrispus Attucks, the first African American Revolutionary War patriot \nand colonist killed during the Boston Massacre.\n  In addition we will celebrate the 125th anniversary of our country's \nfirst national park--Yellowstone National Park. And on a more somber \nnote, we will salute the selfless contributions that our Nation's law \nenforcement officers and their families have made in preserving \npublic safety. These men and women are not enlisted for battle, yet \nthey risk their lives everyday. And tragically enough, lives are lost \nso that others may live without the threat of crime.\n\n  The production and sale of commemorative coins allows the Treasury a \nmeans of decreasing the national deficit. Worthy causes also benefit \nfrom funds raised for worthwhile projects.\n  Yet we are well aware that as the commemorative coin market becomes \nmore and more saturated, it is becoming more and more common for coin \nprograms to post losses, significant losses--in millions of dollars. \nProfits realized through well received programs end up covering these \nlosses. That is essentially how the Mint's Public Enterprise Fund \noperates. But, we cannot and should not become completely reliant upon \nthe safety net of the Public Enterprise Fund.\n  In addition to the commemorative coin provisions, this legislation \nauthorizes a study for the 50 States Circulating Commemorative Coin \nPrograms. This temporary change to our currency could make history as \nwell as teach history. Each State of the Union would be represented on \nthe quarter in the order in which it joined the Union. Representation \nof all States would end 10 years from the inception of the circulating \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to assure that the American taxpayer \nis protected from losses that commemorative coin programs may \nexperience. The reforms we have adopted will accomplish just that. \nSimultaneously, those reforms will revitalize the commemorative coin \nprogram and preserve the hobby of collecting coins.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \namendments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe REcord, as follows:\n\n                          Summary of Amendment\n\n\n                                title I\n\n                      Commemorative Coin Programs\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of two \ncommemorative coins that honor the memory of two great Americans and \nVirginians--George Washington and Dolley Madison. I have had the \nopportunity to speak at length in support of the George Washington \ncommemorative coin and refer to my statement in the Record  on June 20, \n1996. However, I have not had the opportunity to speak in support of \nthe Dolley Madison commemorative coin and so I will do so today.\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\n  The Dolley Madison commemorative coin will honor the 150th \nanniversary of her death in 1999. It is remarkable that this will be \nthe first commemorative coin to honor a First Lady and only the third \nto honor a woman. It is fitting that Dolley Madison will be the first \nFirst Lady so honored.\n  Dolley Madison was, by all accounts, the originator of the role of \nfirst lady. She was such a compelling and popular figure that she acted \nas hostess for the widowed President, Thomas Jefferson, while her \nhusband served as his Secretary of State. Thus, Dolley Madison's term \nas First Lady effectively extended from 1801 to 1817--over 16 years. \nHistorians have maintained that Dolley Madison is the most famous and \nbeloved of all the first ladies of the 19th century. She was the most \nimportant women in Washington through the years of Thomas Jefferson's \nadministration as well as Madison's. By nature kind, ebullient, and \ngracious--and married to a very shy man--Dolley Madison took on the \nresponsibility of organizing the social activities that are essential \nto the affairs of state. In so doing, she set the standard for every \nfirst lady to come. This was more than throwing nice parties--it was \nthe bridge between the work of official Washington and the private \nsocial life of the President and his family.\n  Dolley Madison was also a woman of action and decisiveness. During \nthe War of 1812, when invading British troops burned the White House, \nDolley Madison, at great personal risk, saved many important documents, \nbooks, and other materials from the White House, including an historic \nportrait of George Washington which she saved by rolling it up in a \ncurtain as she departed. Dolley Madison's patriotism and civic bravery \nduring this crisis of war were an inspiration to all and provided a \nmuch needed boost of morale to our beleaguered capital.\n  Dolley Madison was forced to sell the 2,700 acre estate at Montpelier \nin 1844. The estate changed hands 7 times before being bequeathed to \nthe National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1984. Today, Montpelier \nconsists of 2,700 acres: the 75 room main house, over 130 outbuildings, \nsignificant garden and landscape features, 800 acres of pasture and \nwoodlands, and 200 acres of old-growth forest which have been \nidentified as a national natural landmark.\n  Funds from the Dolley Madison commemorative coin, after the U.S. Mint \nrecovers all its costs, will be used to preserve James and Dolley \nMadison's estate, Montpelier. The 5-year plan envisioned by the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation will include a Montpelier \nmuseum and the Madison center which will join forces to serve and \neducate the visiting public.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge all Members to support this important \nlegislation honoring these two great Americans and making possible the \ncontinued education of the American people about their accomplishments \nand contributions to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12374-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12375-S12376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to note the passage of \nlegislation I introduced with Senator Moseley-Braun to authorize the \nU.S. Mint to create a coin commemorating Crispus Attucks and the more \nthan 5,000 African-American patriots who fought and died during the \nRevolutionary War. Our bill, S. 953, known as the Black Revolutionary \nWar Patriots Commemorative Coin Act, was cosponsored by 63 Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle and every region of our Nation. After \napproval by the Citizens' Commemorative Coin Advisory Commission, the \ncompanion bill, introduced by Representative Nancy Johnson, was \napproved unanimously by the House of Representatives.\n  In 1986, Congress approved construction on the National Mall of a \nmemorial celebrating the lives of the African-American men and women \nwho served, fought, and died during our Nation's Revolutionary War. \nIronically, many of these brave Americans never experienced the freedom \nand independence for which they fought. A portion of the proceeds from \nsales of the coin will help to pay for construction of a memorial \nrecognizing the contribution of these brave Americans.\n  As children in school, we all learn that Crispus Attucks was the \nfirst person to lose his life at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, \nbut few of us learn about the valor and sacrifice of thousands of \nothers who willingly fought to free a land that deprived them of \nfreedom. Harriet Beecher Stowe put it this way,\n\n       They served a nation which did not acknowledge them as \n     citizens and equals * * *. It was not for their own land they \n     fought, but for a land that enslaved them. Bravery under such \n     circumstances, has particular beauty and merit.\n\n  The vast majority of African-Americans who served in the Continental \nArmy were from New England, and a great number were from my State of \nRhode Island. In fact, in 1778, Rhode Island approved the first slave \nenlistment act and the Black Regiment of Rhode Island was formed. This \nwas one of only two all African-American regiments. The other was the \nBucks of America of Boston.\n  Not only did these men serve our Nation, they served with \ndistinction. Regrettably throughout our history, their valor has been \noverlooked and nearly forgotten. Men like Jack Sisson of Rhode Island, \nwho expertly steered one of five boats involved in the daring capture \nof British Maj. Gen. Richard Prescott at Newport in 1777, are barely \nmentioned in historical reports of the incident.\n  Jack Sisson went on to join a regiment of some 200 African-American \nsoldiers from my State, who, at the battle of Rhode Island, held their \nground against several fierce attacks by British-Hessian forces, \nthereby allowing 6 American brigades to retreat. With scant training, \nbut abundant courage, the First Rhode Island Regiment inflicted \ncasualties of 6 to 1 on the professional troops of the Redcoats.\n  Like African-American soldiers throughout the colonies, however, the \nsoldiers of Rhode Island's First Regiment faced tragedy as well as \ntriumph. In May, 1781, the unit suffered a surprise attack by the \nBritish cavalry at Pines Bridge, and 40 soldiers lost their lives. Two \nyears later, the regiment was disbanded unceremoniously in Oswego, NY. \nAccording to the historian John Harmon, the soldiers were told to find \ntheir own way home, and many died while making the trip. Further, \ndespite the promise of freedom which had been made in order to entice \nthem to enlist, tragically, some of the soldiers were actually re-\nenslaved after their return.\n  Now, with the passage of this commemorative coin legislation, a \nmonument honoring these forgotten patriots can be constructed on our \nNation's Mall. The design for the memorial was approved recently, funds \nare being raised by the Patriots Foundation, and the recognition that \nthese brave Americans deserve is near at hand.\n  I would like to give special thanks to Chairman D'Amato and the \nmajority leader who recognized the importance of this coin bill and \ntook the steps necessary to enable its passage.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments \nregarding H.R. 1776, the commemorative coin bill which has recently \ntaken a great deal of the time of a number of Senators. In an effort to \ncome to agreement on this package which contains coins for a number of \nvery worthy causes, the bill directs that a marketing study be \nundertaken prior to the commencement of the Fifty State Coin Program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify to my colleagues that this \nlanguage is intended to ensure that this coin program will be \nsuccessful. To that end it is very important that the U.S. Mint, which \nhas the expertise in coin marketing, direct the study. In addition, \nlanguage has been included in the package that directs that funds to \npay for this study come from discretionary funds of the Department of \nthe Treasury, and not from the U.S. Mint. Many Senators have not been \nsatisfied with the conduct of the debate on this issue, and this \nlanguage makes it clear that funds for this compromise study will not \ncome from proceeds of the coin programs used to fund U.S. Mint \noperations, but rather from the Treasury Department.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank all the people who worked \nhard on this issue. It sounds like a fairly simple process, to \nauthorize the issuance of a commemorative coin. We have all found it is \nnot such a simple process.\n  One of those coins with which I am particularly involved relates to \nissuing a coin on the 200th anniversary of the\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\npassing of our first President, George Washington, the proceeds to be \nused for the restoration and enhancement of his home at Mount Vernon.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator D'Amato and the others who have \nworked to see that this legislation is adopted. There are many \nthousands of people who will be very pleased at this action we are \nabout to take.\n  I thank my colleagues for this very significant step.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator D'Amato, who, as chairman \nof the Banking Committee, has certainly been intimately involved in \nthis. As a general rule, they do not let a lot of these coin bills go \nthrough without a lot of very serious consideration and careful thought \nand preparation. But these are good ones. You have certainly done an \nexcellent job bringing it to this point, and we congratulate you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his patience and \nhelp, and our Democratic leader as well, for joining Senator Graham and \nall those Senators who worked to bring us to this point.\n  This legislation not only accomplishes some magnificent goals in \ncommemorating some wonderful Americans and various events--Jackie \nRobinson, among those--but, in addition, will raise money for some very \nworthy causes like the Jackie Robinson Foundation to help needy \nstudents. It has already provided scholarships for 400 children.\n  One last thought. This package is a very carefully worked out reform \npackage that Congressman Castle, our colleague in the House, has worked \non to achieve what I think will streamline this process so it will be a \ncredit to the Congress in future deliberations as they relate to which \ncoins should we be commemorating and how do we go about this, instead \nof a haphazard scattergun manner.\n  I thank both of the leaders. Not only do we mint various coins--it \ndoes provide for that--but also sets up a procedure which will bring \nmuch more order to this House as well as to the House of \nRepresentatives. I thank both leaders.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has spoken, I think, \nwell for all of us. This was a major undertaking. I applaud the \nleadership of the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Florida, and so many others who have had a part to play in making \nthis happen.\n  This was the first of a series of bills that we are able to pass this \nafternoon. It is passing in large measure because of the extraordinary \nwork and cooperation on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is a good bill. It is important that we pass it today. I am \ndelighted that one of the last things we are doing is passing H.R. \n1776.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate one and all who have been \ninvolved in development of this legislation--Senator D'Amato, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Graham of Florida. They have all been very \ninterested in this. We are glad we were able to get it cleared and \nthrough this process.\n  I think it is good legislation and a good effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill be deemed read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The amendment (No. 5428) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1776), as amended, was deemed read for a third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12375-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12376-S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DRUG-INDUCED RAPE PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the bill we are considering today is a \nsubstitute offered by Senators Coverdell, Biden and myself to the \nHouse-passed Drug-Induced Rape Prevention and Punishment Act, H.R. \n4137, authored by my good friend and colleague, Representative Gerry \nSolomon of New York, chairman of the Rules Committee.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides, and is acceptable to the House, so I am hopeful it can quickly \nwin final approval and be sent to the President for signature.\n  Mr. President, it is clear to this member that the Congress must \naddress the horrible problem of date rape before we adjourn for the \nyear. Reports of date rapes appear to be on the rise. These cases are \nnot confined to Rohypnol--other drugs have also been implicated--but \nmany of the instances brought to our attention do involve ``roofies,'' \nas they are called on the street. These offenses are violent crimes \nagainst women. I find the situation deplorable.\n  Our amendment is a strike back at those who would use controlled \nsubstances to engage in what can only be considered a most \nreprehensible crime, to sedate, then violate, unsuspecting women. We \nmust redouble our efforts to discourage and punish illegal behavior \nthat can have such drastic consequences.\n  Accordingly, the bill provides new penalties of up to 20 years \nimprisonment, and fines in accordance with Title 18, U.S.C., for \npersons with the intent to commit a crime of violence--including rape--\nby distributing any controlled substance to another individual without \nthat person's knowledge.\n  In addition, additional penalties are also imposed with specific \nreference to flunitrazepam, sold under the trade name Rohypnol. In \ngeneral, these penalties are equivalent to those of Schedule I \ncontrolled substances, which include the possibility of imprisonment up \nto 20 years for individuals who knowingly or intentionally manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense one gram of flunitrazepam, or 5 years for 30 \nmilligrams. The bill also enhances penalties for the simple possession \nor illegal importation of flunitrazepam.\n  Since many versions of this bill have been proposed, I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to review the history of this legislation. As my \ncolleagues are aware, on August 2, Senator Hutchinson and I introduced \nS. 2040, the Drug-Induced Rape Prevention Act. Our bill was cosponsored \nby Senators Moseley-Braun and Specter.\n  During consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, \nSenator Biden offered an amendment to reschedule Rohypnol to schedule I \nof the Controlled Substances Act. Senator Coverdell and I--believing \nthat it was inappropriate to reschedule Rohypnol, a drug legally \nmarketed in over 60 countries, to a category defined as ``no medical \nuse,'' offered a substitute amendment to that bill, neither of which \nhad been voted upon when the Senate suspended debate on the Treasury-\nPostal bill and subsequently folded it into the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  On the topic of reschheduling, it is important for my colleagues to \nbe aware that Rohypnol is not sold legally in the United States. \nHowever, it is sold legally overseas. A unilateral effort on the part \nof the United States to reschedule the drug to the category of ``no \nmedical use'' could negatively affect the legitimate access to this \ndrug oversees. Since schedule I is the most restrictive category, which \nis reserved for the drugs which have a high potential for abuse, drugs \nwhich have no currently accepted medical use in treatment, and drugs \nfor which there is a lack of accepted safety for use under medical \nsupervision, I believe it would be improper for Congress to place \nRohypnol in schedule I. The regulations and controls placed on schedule \nI substances--controls, I might add, which are warranted for drugs \nwhich fall into this category--effectively remove these substances from \nthe health care market.\n  The schedule I standards clearly do not apply to Rohypnol, a member \nof the benzodiazepene class, which generally falls within the less \nrestrictive schedule IV. Congressional rescheduling--an action seldom \ntaken--of this drug would indicate to other countries that the United \nStates believes there is no medical use for Rohypnol. In fact, there \nare legitimate medical uses for Rohypnol. So, too, are there legitimate \nmedical uses of many other drugs not currently approved for sale in the \nUnited States. To make any medically accepted drug a schedule I \nsubstance because it is being used illegally would be a troubling \nprecedent for our Nation's health care system. What drugs would be \nnext? What other drugs will be put beyond the reach of doctors and \ntheir patients because Congress chose to act hastily?\n  On September 26, the House passed, 421 to 1, H.R. 4137, a compromise \nbill authored by Representative Solomon, which many of us on this side \nof the aisle respected for its tough penalties.\n  However, as we encountered with the recently passed bill to curb \nmethamphetamine abuse, certain Senators on the Democratic side refused \nto clear any bill with mandatory minimum sentences, and thus we were \nforced to amend the House bill.\n  For the record, I continue to prefer mandatory minimum sentences as a \nsure deterrent to crime. However, in this case as with the meth bill, I \nbelieve it is preferable to yield temporarily on that point in order to \nget a final agreement before adjournment.\n  The bill we consider today contains the text of the Hatch/Coverdell \namendment from September 12, with three provisions taken from the House \nbill. It includes the House language requiring the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to review and amend the sentencing guidelines for offenses \ninvolving Rohypnol. It also includes the House provision calling for a \nstudy on rescheduling of Rohypnol, and an educational program for \npolice departments on the use of controlled substances in the \nfurtherance of rapes and sexual assaults.\n  The substitute is similar to the House-passed measure, in that it \nincreases penalties for possession of Rohypnol and use of the drug in \nviolent crimes, including rape. It does not, however, reschedule the \ndrug, or impose mandatory minimum sentences.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I must underscore that the intent of our \neffort is simple: to fortify our arsenal so that law enforcement has \nthe tools it needs to fight the heinous crime of date rape. The Federal \nGovernment must show that it will not tolerate the use of any drug to \nfacilitate rape. It is necessary and prudent that the Congress act on \nthis important legislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their work on this important, \nbipartisan bill. I urge the Senate to pass this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nlegislation which passed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of H.R. 4137, the Drug-Induced Rape Prevention and Punishment \n              Act as Passed by the Senate, October 2, 1996\n\n       Short title: The title of the bill is the ``Drug-Induced \n     Rape Prevention and Punishment Act of 1996''.\n       Provisions relating to use of any controlled substance with \n     intent to commit a crime of violence: The bill provides new \n     penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment, and fines in \n     accordance with Title 18, U.S.C., for persons who intend to \n     commit a crime of violence (including rape), by distributing \n     a controlled substance to another individual without that \n     individual's knowledge.\n       Specific penalties for rohypnol: Additional penalties are \n     also imposed with specific reference to flunitrazepam, sold \n     under the trade name Rohypnol. In general, these penalties \n     are equivalent to those of Schedule I controlled substances, \n     which generally include the possibility of imprisonment up to \n     20 years for individuals who knowingly or intentionally \n     manufacture, distribute, or dispense one gram of \n     flunitrazepam, or up to 5 years for 30 milligrams. [Note: the \n     penalties are higher if the person has a prior conviction or \n     if death or serious bodily injury results from the use of the \n     substance.]\n       Penalties for import and export of flunitrazepam: The \n     Controlled Substances Act provision relating to import or \n     export are also amended, so that penalties for violations \n     involving Rohypnol, are equivalent to penalties for Schedule \n     I drugs.\n       Sentencing guidelines: The United States Sentencing \n     Commission is directed to review and amend, as appropriate, \n     the sentencing guidelines for offenses involving \n     flunitrazepam so that the guidelines reflect the serious \n     nature of such crimes.\n       Simple possession of Rohypnol: A new penalty is added of up \n     to three years' imprisonment, or a fine, or both, for simple \n     possession of Rohypnol.\n       Education program for police officers: A new program is \n     established to provide police\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\n     departments with educational materials on the use of \n     controlled substances during rapes and sexual assaults.\n       Study: A Federal/State study on whether Rohypnol should be \n     scheduled in a more restrictive category under the Controlled \n     Substances Act will be submitted to the Congress within six \n     months of the bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute \nlanguage offered by myself and Senator Hatch. This substitute is \noffered for a simple reason, the House-passed bill cannot and will not \npass the Senate. I must also point out that while I obviously support \nthe language I am co-sponsoring with Senator Hatch and others, this \nbill leaves a serious shortfall that must be addressed next year.\n  This shortfall is the failure of this legislation to take the single \nmost important step we can to combat the rise of Rohypnol, the ``date-\nrape'' drug--that step is to shift this drug to schedule 1 of the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act. Why is rescheduling so important?\n  Rescheduling is important for three simple reasons: First, Federal \nrescheduling triggers increases in State drug law penalties, and since \nwe all know that more than 95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted \nat the State level, not by the Federal Government, it is vitally \nimportant that we re-schedule. Second, Federal rescheduling to schedule \n1 triggers the toughest Federal penalties. And, third, rescheduling has \nproven to work, in 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes, Congress \npassed the law, and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced and, in \n1990, I worked to re-schedule steroids, Congress passed the law, and \nagain a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed.\n  Still, despite the fact that this bill does not reschedule Rohypnol, \nI believe that it is important to pass this legislation because it \ntakes the necessary and needed step of adding a new Federal offense for \nthe crime of using a drug to commit any crime of violence--an offense \nthat is punishable by up to 20 years behind bars.\n  This bill also calls on the DEA Administrator to make a \nrecommendation on rescheduling Rohypnol to the Congress within 180 \ndays. I am confident that the DEA Administrator will recommend the step \nI have been calling for more than a year--rescheduling Rohypnol to \nschedule 1. The fact is that the DEA Administrator has already formally \nrecommended schedule 1 to the Department of Health and Human Services \nwhich is now beginning the lengthy process of its formal review of the \nrecommendation. This is the standard process for an administrative \nrescheduling, and in most cases, I believe it is appropriate--but, when \nwe are faced with immediate and clear dangers, I do not believe that it \nis wise for Congress to refuse to take action.\n  To offer a few more details about the importance of rescheduling \nRohypnol, allow me to make a few more points.\n  First, rescheduling Rohypnol is the most effective way to get State \nand local law enforcement to focus on Rohypnol--given the limited \namount of resources for fighting drugs, cops focus on those deemed most \ndangerous and these are the drugs found in schedules 1 and 2.\n  Second, and as I have stated, many State drug laws are triggered by \nthe Federal Government's scheduling system. The Uniform Controlled \nSubstances Act provides that when the Federal Government reschedules a \ndrug, the States which have signed this Uniformity Act will \nautomatically have their State drug penalties changed to match the \nFederal penalties.\n\n  In other words, without action on our part to reschedule, many States \nwill not be able to address this problem until it is too late and \nRohypnol has already infiltrated their communities.\n  Third, I have heard some critics of my rescheduling proposal argue \nthat rescheduling is wrong because Rohypnol is a medically accepted \ndrug in other parts of the world. In response, I would simply point out \nthat in 1984 when Congress rescheduled Quaaludes, they were a medically \naccepted drug right here in the United States.\n  What is more, unlike the action taken on Quaaludes--in which Congress \nsaw fit to go so far as to ban previously legal sales of the drug in \nthis country--the rescheduling of Rohypnol in the United States will \nnot hurt medical use here in America because there is no legal use of \nRohypnol in America now. Doctors cannot prescribe this drug.\n  The bottom line is that the Congress will be debating the \nrescheduling issue all over again in 6 months. I regret this delay. I \nabhor this delay. This delay has the potential of leaving more children \nin danger. But, this is the reality of the situation we face because of \none simple reason--a huge, foreign company that manufactures Rohypnol \ndoes not want America to reschedule their drug, even though this \ncompany does not--indeed cannot--sell this drug in America.\n  It is just as simple as that, because a company is afraid of losing \nsome money, the effort to bring the maximum power of Federal law \nagainst the date rape drug has been defeated. I think we should take \nthe partial step we are taking today, I think it is a positive that the \nCongress has agreed to accept a formal recommendation from the DEA \nAdministrator, I believe that will ultimately be persuasive enough to \ngain a majority to support rescheduling, but let no one be under any \nmisunderstanding that what we do today is all we should be doing to \ncontrol the epidemic of the date rape drug.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am gratified that the U.S. Senate today \npassed S. 1612, a bill I introduced on March 13, 1996, stipulating that \na 5-year mandatory minimum sentence shall be imposed upon any criminal \npossessing a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a \nviolent or drug trafficking crime.\n  I'm informed that this bill will be approved by the House this \nafternoon, unless there is strong opposition by a Member of that body. \nIf and when signed by the President, it will obviously crack down on \ncriminals who possess a gun while committing violent felonies and/or \ndrug trafficking offenses. In short, it will ensure that criminals \npossessing a firearm while committing a violent or drug trafficking \nfelony shall receive stern and inescapable punishment.\n  This is common sense, Mr. President; violent felons who possess \nfirearms are more dangerous than those who don't\n  This legislation builds upon existing Federal law providing that a \nperson who, during a Federal crime of violence and/or drug trafficking \ncrime, uses or carries a firearm shall be sentenced to 5 years in \nprison, a law that has been used effectively by Federal prosecutors \nacross the country.\n  However, a December 1995 U.S. Supreme Court decision undermined the \nefforts of prosecutors to use this statute effectively--the Supreme \nCourt's decision, Bailey versus United States, interpreted the law to \nrequire that a violent felon actively employ a firearm as a \nprecondition of receiving an additional 5-year sentence. The Court in \nBailey held that the firearm must be brandished, fired, or otherwise \nactively used before the additional 5-year sentence may be imposed. So, \nif a criminal merely possesses a firearm, but doesn't fire or otherwise \nuse it, he gets off without the additional 5-year penalty.\n  Mr. President, this Supreme Court decision posed serious problems for \nlaw enforcement. It weakened the Federal criminal law and lead to the \nearly release of hundreds of violent criminals. Before this Supreme \nCourt's error of judgment--in the Bailey versus United States \ndecision--armed criminals committing violent or drug trafficking \nfelonies were jailed for an additional 5 years, regardless of whether \nthey actively employed their weapons.\n  But when the Court's decision was announced, hardened criminals \nacross America were overjoyed by the prospect of prison doors swinging \nopen for them. And sure enough, since the Bailey decision last December \n6, hundreds of criminals have indeed been set free.\n  As a result of the Court's decision, any thug who hid a gun under the \nback seat of his car, or who stashed a gun with his drugs, escaped the \nadditional 5-year penalty. But in fact, Mr. President, firearms are the \ntools of the trade of most drug traffickers. Weapons clearly facilitate \nthe criminal transactions and embolded violent thugs to commit their \ncrimes.\n\n  I believe that mere possession of a firearm, during the commission of \na violent felony--even if the weapon is not actively used--should \nnonetheless be punished--because of the heightened risk of violence \nwhen firearms are present. In its opinion, the Supreme\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\nCourt observed, ``Had Congress intended possession alone to trigger \nliability * * * it easily could have so provided.'' That, Mr. \nPresident, is precisely the intent of this legislation--to make clear \nthat possession alone does indeed trigger liability.\n  So this legislation retains the 5 year mandatory--repeat, mandatory--\nsentences for violent armed felons, and it expands the penalty to apply \nin the case of possession. In addition, it directs the United States \nSentencing Commission to consider strengthening the penalty when a \ncriminal discharges a firearm in furtherance of a heinous crime.\n  As originally introduced, S. 1612 would have boosted the mandatory \nsentence to 10 years; 20 years if the weapon was discharged; and the \ndeath penalty or a mandatory life sentence if someone was killed during \nthe crime. However, some Senators--perhaps responding to blandishments \nfrom the lobbyists at A.C.L.U.--objected to heightened mandatory \nsentences. So I scaled them back--reluctantly--and with the leadership \nand expertise of the distinguished Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], this \nessential legislation was passed. Representative Sue Myrick's guidance \nin the House of Representatives also has been indispensable.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a necessary and appropriate response to \nthe Supreme Court's judicial limitation of the mandatory penalty for \ngun-toting criminals. According to Sentencing Commission statistics, \nmore than 9,000 armed violent felons were convicted from April, 1991, \nthrough October, 1995. In North Carolina alone, this statute was used \nto help imprison over 800 violent criminals. We must strengthen law \nenforcement's ability to use this strong anti-crime provision.\n  Fighting crime is, and must be, a top concern in America. It has been \nestimated that one violent crime is committed every 16 seconds in the \nUnited States. We must fight back with the most severe punishment \npossible for those who terrorize law-abiding citizens. Enactment of \nthis legislation removes one of the roadblocks between a savage \ncriminal act and swift, certain punishment. It is a necessary step \ntoward recommitting our Government and our citizens to a real honest-\nto-God war on crime.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the bill before us, S. 1887, entitled \n``The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996'' is sponsored by myself, \nalong with Senator Hatch and Senator Heflin. A first version of the \nbill, S.1101, was introduced in August 1995 at the request of the \nJudicial Conference.\n  In October of last year, we held a comprehensive hearing on that bill \nin the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, which I chair, at which both judges and lawyers testified at \nlength on the substance of many of S.1101's provisions. The present \nbill was crafted after many months of detailed discussions and intense \ncollaboration between myself, Senators Hatch and Heflin, and the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts. More importantly, we \nhave worked closely with the other members of the Judiciary Committee \nto address their concerns and include their suggestions, making this \ntruly a bi-partisan bill.\n  At the onset, I would like to elaborate on the spirit in which this \nbill was crafted. I am sure my colleagues are well aware, many of my \nefforts have focused on saving the federal government's sparse \nresources and making the most of taxpayer dollars. As Chairman of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I am also \nconcerned that the federal judicial system be administered in the most \nefficient and cost-effective manner possible, while maintaining a high \nlevel of quality in the administration of justice. In fact, I sent out \na judicial questionnaire earlier this year requesting assistance from \nindividual judges on their ideas and views of the needs of the federal \njudiciary. I hope some of you have had the opportunity to review my \nSubcommittee's two reports on this survey, which were released this \nyear. I found it enlightening to communicate with the individual \njudges, and hope that these lines of candid and constructive \ncommunication with the individual judges and the Administrative Office \nremain open and continue to produce beneficial results in terms of \nefficiency, cost savings and other improvements within the federal \njudiciary.\n  In drafting the Federal Courts Improvement bill, we worked closely \nwith the Administrative Office to assess and address the needs of the \nfederal judiciary. As a result, the bill contains both technical and \nsubstantive changes in the law, many of which were carried over from \nprevious Congresses and/or originally proposed in S.1101. During our \nworking sessions on the bill, some of the provisions in S.1101, such as \nthe sections dealing with federal defender services matters, were \ndetermined to warrant further inquiry or additional hearings. Other \nprovisions were dropped to help process the bill more smoothly through \nthe House since the session is coming to a close in a day or two.\n  On the whole, the bill is broad-reaching, and contains provisions \nconcerning judicial process improvements; judiciary personnel \nadministration, benefits and protections; judicial financial \nadministration; Federal Courts Study Committee recommendations; and \nother miscellaneous issues. Almost all of the provisions have been \nformally endorsed by the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the \nFederal courts.\n\n  Many provisions contained in this bill streamline the operation of \nthe Federal court system. A good example of our attempt to render the \njudiciary more efficient is a provision which abolishes a special \ntribunal with narrow jurisdiction, the Special Court, which the \nRegional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, established in the early \n1970's to oversee the reorganization of insolvent railroads. The work \nof this court is basically concluded, with the court's docket \ncontaining 10 largely inactive cases. This section transfers the \nSpecial Court's jurisdiction over those cases and any future rail \nreorganization proceedings to the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia, where the court's records and a majority of its judges are \ncurrently located, and makes other technical and conforming changes \nincidental to the court's abolition. The elimination of this court will \nproduce budgetary and administrative economies and, according to the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts, result in an annual \ncost savings of approximately $175,000.\n  The bill simplifies the appeal route in civil cases decided by \nmagistrate judges with consent by confining appeals of judgments in \nsuch cases to the court of appeals and eliminating an alternative route \nof appeal to the district judge. A single forum of appeal in civil \nconsent cases simplifies court procedures and recognizes the existing \npractice in most districts. The Judicial Conference recommended such \naction in the Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts. Also, this \nsection would not alter the role of magistrate judges as adjuncts to \narticle III courts since district judges would still control the \nreferral of consent cases to magistrate judges.\n  We also change the reappointment procedure for incumbent bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S12386]]\n\njudges. Rather than requiring the judicial council for a circuit or a \nmerit selection panel to undergo a lengthy and time-consuming screening \nprocess, this section streamlines the reappointment process for judges \nwhose performance has previously been reviewed. In this manner, the \nsection eliminates unnecessary expenditures of time and money.\n  Additional sections facilitate judicial operations. One of these \nprovisions authorize magistrate judges temporarily assigned to another \njudicial district because of an emergency to dispose of civil cases \nwith the consent of the parties. Another section that deputy clerks may \nact whenever the clerk is unable to perform official duties for any \nreason, and permits the court to designate an acting clerk of court, \nwhen it is expected that the clerk will be unavailable or the office of \nclerk will be vacant for a prolonged period.\n  We also require an annual report by the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts on the number and nature of orders relating to \njudicial misconduct or disability under section 332 of title 28 of the \nUnited States Code. This reporting requirement was recommended by the \nReport of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal of \nAugust 1993, which found that reliable information concerning council \norders was difficult to obtain.\n  In conclusion, this bill is the result of careful consideration by \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, in close collaboration with the \nAdministrative Office, who have all worked long and hard in attempting \nto produce a strong, bi-partisan piece of legislation. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill. When the Judiciary Committee voted \nthe Federal Courts Improvement Act out of committee it was with an \namendment offered by Senator Kohl dealing with the use of secrecy \norders in Federal courts. The version of the act that we are passing \ntoday does not include that particular provision because Senator Kohl \nhas generously agreed to an amendment that will remove it. Senator Kohl \nand I stand on opposite sides of the merits of his amendment, but I \nappreciate his commitment to the provision and his willingness to allow \nus to pass S. 1887 without it.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator. We do think differently about this \nmatter, but understand how important it was to you and to Senator \nHeflin that the Federal Courts Improvement Act pass this year. And I \nunderstand that if this provision regarding court secrecy, modeled on \nmy legislation S. 374, The Sunshine in Litigation Act, were still part \nof S. 1887 it would keep that legislation from moving ahead. Although I \nbelieve that the problem of the excessive use of protective orders \nneeds urgently to be addressed, I also will not let it hold up a \nmeasure so important to Senators Grassley and Heflin.\n  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the Judicial Committee \nhas favorably recommended my court secrecy legislation and that this \nreal problem will not vanish. I hope that the Judicial Conference might \nfinally see fit to address this problem, but if it does not, I will \ncontinue to press this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The amendment (No. 5430) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1887), as amended, was deemed read for a third time and \npassed, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 4283 be \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works, the bill be \nimmediately discharged and referred to the Committee on Science, \nCommerce and Transportation, and the bill then be immediately \ndischarged and the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4283) to provide for ballast water management \n     to prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous \n     species into the waters of the United States, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to support adoption of H.R. 4283, \nthe National Invasive Species Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, this bill addresses a nationwide problem--\nnonindigenous species invading new habitats. This has tremendous \nimpacts not only on natives species in the aquatic environment but, in \nsome areas, our communities as well.\n  This bill would control nonindigenous species by establishing a \nvoluntary national ballast water management program, and funding for \nresearch and implementation.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Glenn had introduced S. 1660, a similar \nbill to that of the House. Under an earlier unanimous-consent \nagreement, S. 1660 was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works. Following action in that committee, the bill would have \nbeen referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nsince the Commerce Committee shares jurisdiction on this issue. \nLikewise, H.R. 3217, a bill introduced by Congressman LaTourette was \nadopted by the House, sent to the Senate and referred to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. This bill, if acted upon, would \nhave also been referred to the Committee Committee.\n  Mr. President, while this procedure is somewhat different than our \nnormal order for legislation, Senator Abraham, a member of the Commerce \nCommittee, has been very interested in addressing this issue. I am \npleased that we are able to accommodate his desires by adopting this \nbill today.\n  The bill that the House adopted addresses a concern of the Commerce \nCommittee on vessel safety that the shipping industry has raised. It \nwould simply allow vessels to continue to discharge their ballast water \nin a harbor if during their voyage they could not exchange their \nballast water on the high seas due to safety concerns. This provision \nand the bill itself has the support of the shipping industry, port \nauthorities and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nadoption of H.R. 4283.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say a few \nwords on final passage of H.R. 4283, the National Invasive Species Act \nof 1996.\n  The threat posed by nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species was first \nbrought to this Nation's attention in the 1980's when we witnessed the \ndevastating effect of the zebra mussel infestation in the Great Lakes \nregion. It was then that we learned such nuisance species are typically \nintroduced through the ballast water exchange of vessels. Congress \nresponded to this threat with the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act of 1990--legislation which established a \nprogram to research, prevent, and control the unintentional \nintroduction of nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes.\n  Clearly, the problem of nuisance species is not limited to the Great \nLakes. Invasions of nonindigenous species into marine and fresh waters \nof the United States can have significant economic and environmental \nconsequences. That is why the legislation approved by the Senate today \ngoes beyond the Great Lakes region and establishes a voluntary program \nfor ballast water management that is national in scope.\n  Mr. President, I was deeply distressed to learn that non-native \nspecies have invaded the Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island. Recently, a \nnumber of invasive plant species have been discovered. Also, there is \ngrave concern that the Japanese shore crab may have arrived. If that is \nthe case, Rhode Island's oyster beds will be greatly disrupted.\n  That is why the original version of this bill, H.R. 3217, was \nmodified at my request to include an amendment authorizing the \nappropriation of $1 million for use by Rhode Island's Department of \nEnvironmental Management to address this problem. The pending bill, \nH.R. 4283, includes my amendment. These funds will allow the department \nto carry out research on the prevention, monitoring, and control of \naquatic nuisance species in Narragansett Bay. It is imperative that we \nhave a full inventory of the non-native species that have invaded the \nBay. Once we have done so, we can work to manage the situation and \nhopefully, avoid future infestations.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill and I applaud the Senate for its \nprompt action. It is my hope that the National Invasive Species Act of \n1996 will stem the tide of invasive species in our Nation's waterways.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for passage \nof the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 [NISA]. NISA reauthorizes \nand amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control \nAct of 1990, a measure that passed with wide bipartisan support in \nresponse to concern over the potential impact of the Eurasian ruffe on \nthe Great Lakes fishery [NANPCA]. NANPCA set forth a national program \nfor preventing, researching, monitoring, and controlling infestations \nin U.S. waters of alien aquatic species. NISA continues these important \nmeasures, and includes some additional important provisions.\n  NISA directs the Department of Transportation to develop voluntary \nguidelines, recordkeeping and reporting procedures, and sampling \ntechniques to prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous \nspecies into U.S. waters. Since, the primary means of prevention are \nmeasures addressing the exchange of ballast water, this legislation \nwill develop suggested direction for ballast exchange outside the U.S. \nexclusive economic zone and will authorize ecological and ballast \ndischarge surveys to be conducted in highly susceptible waters. In the \neffort to develop other ways to repel these unwelcome intruders, the \nInterior and Transportation Secretaries will undertake a demonstration \nof technologies and practices which may prevent the introduction and \nspread of such species. Finally, if the spread of the zebra mussel has \ndemonstrated anything, it has shown us how important regional \ncoordination is to the control of invasive animals. Therefore, this act \nencourages the formation of regional panels to participate in \nactivities to control the introduction of aquatic nuisance species.\n  Mr. President, the impact of invasive species in the Great Lakes has \nbeen enormous. In 1950, the Great Lakes fishery nearly collapsed under \nits assault. Were it not for the constant efforts of the Great Lakes \nFisheries Commission and the Great Lakes Environmental Research \nLaboratory, a similarly dire situation could occur. Michigan in \nparticular has suffered greatly from the effects of nonindigenous \nplants and animals. In my State, the uncontrollable spread of the zebra \nmussel shut down the Monroe city water supply for 2 days in 1990 and \ncontributed to sewage overflow in Lake St. Clair. Without steps to curb \nthe introduction and spread of such invasive species, the Great Lakes \nregion, and other coastal States, can expect similar incidents in the \nfuture.\n  The spread of the zebra mussel, the sea lamprey, and other invaders \nhave had a proven, negative impact on Great Lakes native species. Mr. \nPresident, I was happy to join as a cosponsor of legislation to control \ntheir spread, and I hope that the Senate can pass this reasonable, \nvoluntary approach to curbing these species today.\n\n[[Page S12399]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4283, the \nNational Invasive Species Act of 1996 and urge my colleagues to join me \nin approving this measure. I authored and introduced S. 1660, the \nNational Invasive Species Act, in cooperation with a broad community of \ninterest groups and regional delegations. Nineteen fellow Senators, \nfrom both sides of the aisle joined me in gaining passage of this \ncritical bill. I am particularly grateful to my Ohio colleague, \nCongressman Steve LaTourette, for his skilled leadership in introducing \nand gaining House passage of H.R. 4283, the companion to my bill, S. \n1660.\n  The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 addresses the growing \nproblem of the unintentional introduction of aquatic nuisance species \ninto the waters of our Nation via the ballast water of vessels. The \nNational Invasive Species Act will prevent the introduction of these \npest species through the establishment of a national ballast management \nprogram. In addition, it will set up a national program of monitoring, \nmanagement and control of invasive species already established in U.S. \nwaters. The bill before us represents a consensus among interest \ngroups. The environmental programs it sets forth are both reasonable \nand effective.\n  In the Great Lakes region, we spend millions of dollars annually to \nbattle sea lamprey and zebra mussel infestations, I can attest that \nsuch biological spills can and do happen elsewhere, their impacts on \nthe receiving system are additive, and the resource degradation is \npermanent. The zebra mussel, a native species of Eastern Europe, has \nspread throughout the United States from the Great Lakes where it was \nunintentionally introduced in ballast water of commercial vessels. \nWherever it becomes established, the zebra mussel threatens the economy \nand the environment. It clogs intake pipes, fouls drinking water, and \ncovers swimming beaches with sharp shells. It has cost $120 million \nover 5 years in direct costs to the raw water industry of our region. \nThe zebra mussel also contributed to the loss of many highly valued \nnative species of freshwater mussel in both the Great Lakes and the \nMississippi River.\n  The Great Lakes are not the only entry way for invasive species into \nU.S. waters. In March, I hosted a National Forum on Nonindigenous \nSpecies Invasions of U.S. Marine and Fresh Waters. At the day-long \nevent, experts from around the country cited serious species invasion \nin just about all of America's fresh and marine waters. Biodiversity \nand economic well-being are suffering due to invasions of nonindigenous \nspecies in the Pacific Northwest, San Francisco Bay, the Pacific \nIslands, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River, the Atlantic \ncoasts, the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. In particular, studies show \nthat a new species of aquatic organism invades San Francisco Bay every \n12 weeks. A crab which is the host of a dangerous parasite has been \nfound in U.S. waters within the Gulf of Mexico, fortunately not yet \nestablished.\n  In 1990, I authored and Congress enacted the Nonindigenous Aquatic \nNuisance Prevention and Control Act to begin to address the tremendous \nproblem of unintentional invasions of aquatic species into the Great \nLakes and other U.S. waters. The 1990 act consisted of two basic parts: \nA regional program to prevent new introductions of species into the \nGreat Lakes by the ballast water; and a national program of monitoring, \nmanagement and control of invasive species once established in U.S. \nwaters. Most of the revisions contained in H.R. 4283 revise the \nprevention portion of the act.\n  As you know, ballast water is the leading vector for unintentional \ntransfers of nonindigenous species into U.S. waters. Ships carry \nballast water to maintain trim when they are empty or partially empty \nof cargo. They discharge this water at their ports of call. An \nestimated 21 billion gallons of ballast water from vessels from foreign \nports is discharged into U.S. waters each year. That's 58 million \ngallons per day, and 2.4 million gallons per hour. This ballast water \ncontains just about everything and anything that was in the harbor from \nwhich the water was drawn. It is estimated that 3,000 species of \naquatic organisms are in transit in ballast tanks around the world in \nany given 24-hour period. Most of these organisms will come to nothing \nin the receiving ports, but any one of them could cause billions of \ndollars of damage. It's a huge gamble. Even human cholera is \ntransported in ballast water and has been detected in ships visiting \nMobile Bay and the Chesapeake, among other regions.\n  Fortunately, a ballast management practice known as high seas ballast \nexchange can greatly reduce the transfers of dangerous organisms \nthrough ballast water. This technique is not applicable in all \ncircumstances; it cannot be employed in stormy weather and with some \ntypes of vessels. However, if applied where it can be employed safely, \nit would result in a substantial reduction in the risk of invasive \nspecies transfers into our waters. It is for this reason that the \nInternational Maritime Organization already encourages ballast \nmanagement practices for commercial vessels.\n  The 1990 law included a voluntary ballast management program for the \nGreat Lakes which automatically became regulatory in 1992. The act \nassigned the Coast Guard the task of consulting with the maritime \nindustry and Canada to develop voluntary guidelines, conducting \neducation and outreach, and, after 2 years, promulgating regulations to \nhelp reduce the probability of new introductions of alien species by \ncommercial vessels into the Great Lakes. This program has been highly \nsuccessful.\n  My 1996 proposal establishes a national ballast management program to \nbegin to address concerns of other U.S. coastal regions. The Coast \nGuard is directed to issue ballast management guidelines for all \nvessels visiting U.S. ports after operating outside the exclusive \neconomic zone. Consistent with the Great Lakes program, I want to \nstress that this program puts safety first. The guidelines will protect \nthe safety of vessel and crew, whatever that may entail.\n  There will be no penalty against vessels which do not participate in \nthe initial national program, though recordkeeping by vessels to \ndocument participation is required. However, in the interest of \nmaintaining a level playing field nationally, the Coast Guard has \nauthority to issue the same guidelines as regulations in regions where \na review of ship records reveals poor cooperation with the voluntary \napproach. Thus, the maritime industry would see only one set of rules \nnationally. However, over time, there may be enforcement associated \nwith the guidelines in certain regions. Of great interest to the Great \nLakes community, the successful Great Lakes regulatory program remains \nin place.\n  For better prevention of invasions in the future, a demonstration \nprogram is established in the act. Over time new technologies and \npractices may replace ballast exchange as safer and more effective \nmeans of prevention. Other changes to the 1990 program which are \ncontained in our National Invasive Species Act of 1996 include (1) the \nauthorization of research in several coastal regions--including the \nChesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain, the Mississippi River and the Gulf of \nMexico--which are at particular risk of degradation by species \ninvasions; (2) voluntary guidelines to help recreational boaters to \nprevent unintentional transfer of zebra mussels; and (3) provisions to \nencourage more regions to set up coordinating panels and develop State \nmanagement plans for invasive species prevention and control. Though \nnow much broader in scope, I am proud to announce that the overall cost \nof the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 does not exceed that of \nthe 1990 law.\n\n  Recent discussions with interest groups have revealed gaps in S. \n1660, which I have urged the lead sponsor of the House companion \nlegislation, Congressman  Steve LaTourette, and my Senate colleagues to \naddress. I am pleased that H.R. 4283 accommodates these concerns. For \nexample, H.R. 4283 addresses the need for research on the fragile and \nprecious natural resources of California, Rhode Island, and the \nColumbia River. Establishment of an ecological baseline and \nidentification of alien species impacts in these regions will help us \nto ascertain whether our protection efforts are adequate.\n  A second set of concerns arose from the maritime industry. Senator \nJohnston and I convened the leaders of this industry in Washington \nabout a month ago to explore their position on the legislation and seek \nways to increase\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\ntheir level of support without compromising the effectiveness of the \nlegislation. While their initial response was skeptical and critical of \nthe potential for regulation within NISA, ultimately they agreed to the \nlegislation if certain clarifications were made in the legislative \nlanguage. These clarifications--already a matter of Coast Guard \npolicy--concern the priority on vessel safety, international \nconsistency, and he equitable treatment of foreign and U.S.-flag \nvessels.\n  With respect to ship safety, the bill now explicitly gives sole \ndiscretion over safety to the ship master. The Coast Guard does not \nwant to be put in the position of second-guessing the ship's master on \nsafety, unless the call is not made in good faith. While the safety \nexemption clearly could still be exploited by those who simply do not \nwant to undertake an exchange, ship masters have highly responsible \npositions and we would expect them to act responsibly with respect to \nthese guidelines. In addition, by measuring the rate at which the \nsafety exemption is utilized, we can gauge the extent to which the use \nof it may impede effective prevention of new invasions. We may find \nthat alternative technologies should replace ballast exchange. H.R. \n4283 also assures that additional requirements will not be imposed upon \nvessels that exercise the safety exemption from national ballast \nexchange requirements. This provision does not affect the Great Lakes \nregion, where an alternative exchange zone is already identified and \nconvenient for vessels. For the national program, because alternatives \nare not yet identified, the Coast Guard is likely to encourage a vessel \nmaster using the safety exemption to attempt alternative actions to \nreduce the amount of unexchanged ballast that is discharged into one of \nour harbors, but leave the exercise of them to the master's discretion. \nIn addition, the bill now explicitly requires the equal treatment of \nUnited States and foreign-flag operators and encourages consistency of \nour guidelines with any international regulatory regime established \nthrough the International Maritime Organization.\n  Finally, to benefit all of us in assessing the adequacy of the \nprogram, the legislation includes a report to Congress by the Coast \nGuard after 2 years of implementation of the national guidelines. While \nit will consume some time, this report will assess for all to see, \nthe rate of compliance by vessels, the extent to which the safety \nexemption has been utilized, the effectiveness of the guidelines at \npreventing new introductions of exotic species, and the regions--if \nany--in which the Coast Guard intends to enforce the guidelines due to \npoor compliance. The report will give Congress and the public a chance \nto review prevention program implementation and its effectiveness at \nmeeting our resource protection and ship safety needs.\n\n  In a last minute change, the House also included an exemption for \ncrude oil tankers engaged in coastwise trade. Most of this trade takes \nplace along the West Coast and while coast-wise, some of these vessels \nwill exit the exclusive economic zone and ply the high-seas on their \nway to Alaska from Hawaii or California. I am happy to say Senator \nStevens has included an amendment reflected in H.R. 4283 which \nevaluates the potential for upgrading a shore-side treatment facility, \ncurrently targeted at removing hydrocarbons from ballast water, for use \nin preventing non-native species transfer.\n  I would like to close by pointing out that biological pollution of \nU.S. waters, so far, has not had serious public health implications. \nBut the 1992 transfer of human cholera from South American ports to the \nshellfish beds of Mobile Bay via ballast water of commercial vessels \nreminds us that our luck may not hold forever. It is in everyone's \ninterest to improve our Nation's precautions against invasions of \naquatic nuisance species.\n  Clearly, at this juncture, we do not have all the answers necessary \nto solve the problem of unintentional transfer of species via ballast \nwater. H.R. 4283 has been carefully crafted to both generate and \naccommodate new information that will lead to rapid progress in \nprotecting the natural resource wealth of our coasts. Unusual in the \nenvironmental arena, this issue offers us ``low-hanging fruit'' and \nbipartisan enthusiasm. I am grateful to my colleagues for joining in \nsupport of the National Invasive Species Act and urge enactment of this \nlegislation this year.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in order to protect our native aquatic \nplants and animals, we seek to pass H.R. 4283, the National Invasive \nSpecies Act of 1996. This bill amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic \nNuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-646), to \nestablish a voluntary program to prevent the unintentional introduction \nof non-native invasive species through ballast water management. And, \nwe will take one more step to manage to the best of our ability a \nparticularly bad actor, the zebra mussel.\n  By passing this bill, we will be one step closer to taking control of \nthe most common way that non-native species come to the United States--\nballast water. Ballast water is carried in the holds of ships for \nstability as they travel empty or partly empty on the high seas. When \nthe ships get to port, they discharge the water to make room for cargo.\n  When ballast water is discharged, all of the species that were picked \nup in a foreign port are discharged with them. The zebra mussel came to \nthe Great Lakes in this manner. And, the zebra mussel has now colonized \nthe Mississippi River drainage and is headed both east and west.\n  It turns out the zebra mussel, like many non-native invasive species, \nhas ecological implications far wider than just its mere presence. This \ntiny clam--like organism attaches itself to any solid surface, \nincluding the shells of our native snails and clams. The natives are \nsmothered by the newcomer. The newcomer, in its multitudes, feeds on \nmicroscopic plants and animals from the water, and thereby filters away \nall of the food for the native species.\n  I am told that with the 2.4 million gallons of ballast water \ndischarged into U.S. ports every hour comes every organism that was \npicked up elsewhere and that survived the trip. Fortunately for all of \nus, very few of the estimated 3,000 species of organisms in transit \nevery day survive when they are discharged. But, when they do, we have \nthe makings of serious trouble on our hands as in the case of the zebra \nmussel.\n  Nearly every part of the country has been affected by this game of \nchance. From the Chesapeake Bay, to Honolulu Harbor, including San \nFrancisco Bay, and many places in between the problems created by \ninvasive non-native species are immense.\n  This bill has been developed with the cooperation of the U.S. \nmaritime industry and the U.S. port authorities. We have assured \nourselves that the voluntary program for ballast water exchange will \nnot cause unsafe conditions for our ships at sea. And we have been \nassured that this bill be extremely important in protecting our ports, \nwater systems, and waterways from the economic impacts of invasive \nspecies.\n  There is no intent to try to control intentional introductions of \nuseful organisms, or invasive species in terrestrial environments \nthrough this bill. We recognize that non-native species have been \ntremendously beneficial to us by enhancing recreational opportunities \nsuch as sport fishing, providing reliable sources of protein through \nmariculture and aquaculture, and by improving human existence through \nthe pet and aquarium trade.\n  We understand perfectly well that intentional introductions are one \nthing, if they have been well studied, and have been introduced for a \npurpose. But, the game of roulette that is represented by ballast water \nintroductions is something we cannot let continue.\n  For example, late last year a 2-inch predatory shrimp native to China \nwas found near Portland, Oregon in the Columbia River. What effect this \nnew species will have on the Columbia and Snake River insect life is \nstill to be determined. My fear is that they will deprive the migrating \nsalmon smoults of important food sources while they work their way from \ntheir native streams to the sea. One thing the beleagured salmon and \nsteelhead do not need at this time is another competitor for their food \nsources.\n  There is evidence that unintentional introductions of non-native \nanimals cause the endangerment of native species. One fisheries \nbiologist, D.R. Lassuy estimates that non-native species contributed to \n68 percent of the\n\n[[Page S12401]]\n\nfish extinctions in the past 100 years, and the decline of 70 percent \nof the fish species listed by the Endangered Species Act.\n  But what is known about the effect of non-native invasive species is \ngreater still. For example, it is thought by many accidentally \nintroduced New Zealand mud snails have contributed directly to the \ndecline of the native fauna in the Snake River, and led to the proposal \nto list at least one of the Snake River snails as endangered.\n  We hope that the Senate will quickly pass H.R. 4283. By passing this \nbill we will take one very important step to protect our aquatic \nhabitats from non-native species.\n\n\n                            ballast exchange\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, a priority for me in the National Invasive \nSpecies Act has been to establish a ballast technology demonstration \nprogram to usher in the development of safer and more reliable \nalternatives to ballast exchange. I note that in H.R. 4283, the \nSecretary of Interior and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration implement this important program in \ncooperation with the Secretary of Transportation Administration. I \nbelieve the Secretary of Transportation should involve its Office of \nShipbuilding and Technology which already has years of experience in \nballast technology in this program.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Involvement of that office will be important to build \nupon past experience in ballast technology development and I also urge \nits involvement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, which \nprovides for the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, be deemed read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The bill (H.R. 4283) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12398-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1281) to express the sense of the Congress \n     that it is the policy of the Congress that United States \n     Government agencies in possession of records about \n     individuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes \n     should make those records public.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1281, the War Crimes Disclosure Act, which expresses the sense of \nCongress that Government agencies in possession of records documenting \nNazi war crimes should declassify such records and release them to the \npublic.\n  Ideally, in a democracy, all government information belongs to the \npeople, excepting such information as would be harmful to the body \npolitic if made publicly available. Knowledge of wartime atrocities \npresents no threat to the American people. To the contrary, accurate \ninformation about the Nazi regime, and those who ruthlessly carried out \nits barbaric policies, can only serve to deepen our understanding of \nhistory's darkest chapter, and strengthen our resolve that it never be \nrepeated.\n  On August 2, 1996, I introduced the War Crimes Disclosure Act (S. \n2048), which would have amended the Freedom of Information Act to \nprovide for disclosure of information relating to individuals who \ncommitted Nazi war crimes. This bill, cosponsored by Senators D'Amato \nand Dodd, is the Senate companion to a similar measure sponsored in the \nHouse of Representatives by my colleague from New York, the Honorable \nCarolyn Maloney.\n  Inexplicably, that measure has met with some opposition and, due to \nthe impending adjournment of Congress, we will not be able to adopt it \nin its original form. Nevertheless, with the passage of this amended \nlegislation, Congress makes an important statement in support of public \ndisclosure of documents relevant to Nazi war crimes. This is a first \nstep. I do hope that we can revisit this issue in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\nthe bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3864, the \nGeneral Accounting Office Management Reform Act of 1996. The Congress \nhas reduced spending for GAO by 25 percent over\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\n1996-97. H.R. 3864 will allow GAO to make the best use of limited \nresources by modifying or terminating a number of activities and \nreporting requirements that are no longer central to their mission.\n  For example, section 102(d) of H.R. 3864 will eliminate a requirement \nplaced on GAO by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985, also known as Gramm-Rudman. Gramm-Rudman currently requires \nGAO to report whether the final sequestration order from the Office of \nManagement and Budget complies with the law. GAO has issued their \nreport every year, even though in the 10 years since Gramm-Rudman has \nbeen enacted large-scale sequestrations have only been a concern in two \nof those years. H.R. 3864 would make this report contingent upon \nrequest of the Budget Committees, who no doubt would request such a \nreport if the situation warranted.\n  Although section 102(d) is clearly within the jurisdiction of the \nBudget Committee, I will not object because the Budget Committee \nsupports the change that is being made.

Mr. President, today the Senate passed a bill which I \ncosponsored with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. It \nis designed to address a serious problem facing health care providers \nand patients in rural and inner city areas. Specifically, the \nlegislation provides a 1-year visa extension for foreign nurses under \nthe expired H-1A Program. It is supported by the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, the American Health \nCare Association, and the American Business Council for Fair \nImmigration Reform.\n  In 1989, Congress passed the Immigrant Nursing Relief Act which \ncreated the H-1A Visa Program to address a nationwide nursing shortage \nwhich existed at that time. The H-1A Visa Program expired in September \n1995. As a result, many rural and inner city hospitals, nursing homes, \nand other health care facilities will lose the valuable services of \nforeign nurses who enable\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\nthese facilities to meet the health care needs of their communities.\n  While the shortage has subsided in most parts of the country, \nshortages continue in many rural and inner city areas. Foreign educated \nnurses holding H-1A visas fill an important void which continues to \nexist in certain areas. Without their professional services, the \nquality of patient care would dramatically decrease. In addition, I \nhave heard from many rural health care providers in North Carolina who \ninformed me that, without the services of foreign nurses, they would be \nunable to meet Federal and State staffing requirements.\n  While a long-term solution to this particular nursing shortage \nproblem has not been developed, a short-term solution is needed to \naddress the existing realities in rural and inner city areas. The \nlegislation which passed the Senate today is a carefully crafted short-\nterm compromise. It affects only those H-1A nurses who are currently \nresiding in the United States and extends their length of stay until \nSeptember 30, 1997. Importantly, this legislation does not allow \nadditional foreign nurses to enter the United States under the expired \nH-1A Visa Program, nor does it change any of the current requirements \nfor an H-1B visa.\n  This legislation was introduced and passed by unanimous consent \ntoday. Thus, there was no committee action and no legislative history \nrelating to the bill. As the author of the legislation, I wish to \nclarify section 1(b) governing ``Change of Employment.'' It is my \nintention that a change in an employer's ownership does not constitute \na prohibited change of employment for a nonimmigrant affected by this \nact. For example, if an employer changes its name as a result of a \nmerger or acquisition, I intend that the nonimmigrant be eligible to \ncontinue employment for the new owner. In such circumstances, it is my \nintention that this legislation permits the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to process an I-129 petition to reflect this \ntechnical change. The same rules should apply to circumstances in which \na nonimmigrant changes work locations with the same employer.\n  Finally, I wish to thank Senator Simon for his assistance in passing \nthis legislation. It has been a privilege to work with him to address a \nserious problem confronting both Illinois and North Carolina. In \nparticular, I am glad to have had this opportunity to work with him one \nlast time before he retires at the end of this Congress. I congratulate \nhim on a distinguished career and wish him well in the future.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12403-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 74\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, the Senate today will pass a bill to \neliminate an unfortunate double standard that has remained in the \napplication of our civil rights and labor laws.\n  James Madison wrote that an effective control against oppressive \nmeasures from the Federal Government on the people is that Government \nleaders ``can make no law which will not have its full operation on \nthemselves and their friends, as well as the great mass of the \nsociety.''\n  Last year, this Congress--under Republican leadership--passed the \nCongressional Accountability Act, requiring the Congress to live under \nthe laws it passes--and oftentimes imposes--on the rest of the Nation. \nThe White House, however, has remained exempt from these laws. After \nprodding from this Congress, the White House now agrees that this \ndouble standard should no longer exist, and our negotiations this week \nhave led to final passage of the White House Accountability Act.\n  For many years I supported the Congressional Accountability Act, and \nwas glad to see this important legislation become law. For me, this was \nan issue of fundamental fairness. Congress should live under the laws \nit passes, and the White House should be no exception. H.R. 3452 will \nallow all lawmakers--on Capitol Hill and in the Office of the \nPresident--to learn firsthand which laws work, and perhaps more often \nthan not, which laws are overly intrusive and burdensome.\n  I think America's labor leaders will agree with me when I say that \nemployees of the White House should be protected by the same laws that \nthe President approves for the rest of the country. Employees should \nhave the same rights and protections regardless of where they work--\nwhether the individual labors in the private sector, the Congress, and \nyes, even in the White House.\n  The White House Accountability Act applies to all workers at the \nWhite House except those appointed by the President with Senate \nconfirmation, those appointed to advisory committees, and members of a \nuniformed service. This legislation requires the White House to enforce \n11 civil rights and labor laws for its workers as a matter of law, not \njust a matter of policy. These standards include the Civil Rights Act, \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nOSHA, and the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  This is a bipartisan bill that passed the House of Representatives \nlast week on a vote of 410-5. The White House asked for some \nmodifications to the House legislation, and while I did not agree with \nall of their requests, we have reached an accommodation that will--for \nthe first time in our history--give White House employees protection \nunder the law. I also am encouraged that we were able to persuade the \nWhite House to accept a provision ensuring that White House employees \nwill not lose their jobs if they take time off under the Family and \nMedical\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\nLeave Act to care for a newborn or sick child, a spouse, or a parent. \nThis is a significant victory for the families of employees who work in \nthe Executive Office of the President.\n  Mr. President, American workers deserve the right to be free from \ndiscrimination, the right to work in a safe and healthy work \nenvironment, the right not to be harassed or fired simply because or \nrace, sex, disability, or age. White House workers deserve the same \nrights and protections that now extend from our Nation's assembly lines \nto our Nation's general assembly. The bill we are passing today ensures \nthat those rights will be enforced for employees of the White House.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5434\n\n     (Purpose: To improve the remedial and enforcement provisions)\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3219, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3219) to provide Federal assistance for Inidan \n     tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of tribal self-\n     governance, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of prompt \nenactment of H.R. 3219, the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf-Determination Act of 1996. The bill we have received from the \nHouse just 2 days ago will separate Indian housing from public housing \nand transform HUD-assisted native American housing programs into tribal \nblock grants that will, for the first time, provide this Federal \nfunding directly to native American Indian tribal governments.\n  First, I want to recognize and commend Congressman Rick Lazio for \nspearheading the development of this legislation in the 104th Congress \nand for his efforts to involve the Indian tribes and the National \nAmerican Indian Housing Council in the development of the bill. I also \nwant to pay tribute to the steady and strong leadership of Senators \nD'Amato and Mack, the respective chairmen of the Senate Banking \nCommittee and its Housing Opportunities Subcommittee, and for their \ncooperation this past year in working with the Committee on Indian \nAffairs to ensure that the housing needs of Indian people would be \nappropriately considered and included in the public housing reform \nlegislation. One public example of this cooperative effort is the joint \nhearing held earlier this year between the Committee on Indian Affairs \nand the Senate Banking Committee to review the provisions of the Native \nAmerican Housing Act and to receive comments from Indian Country on how \nbest to draft Indian housing reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, the housing problems confronting Indian people are far \nmore serious than those facing non-Indians. Recent studies indicate \nthat 28 percent of all American Indian and Alaska Native families live \nin substandard, overcrowded housing that lacks the basic amenities of \nindoor plumbing, electricity, or heating. By way of comparison, less \nthan 5\\1/2\\ percent of all Americans live in similar conditions. \nAdditionally, more than 90,000 native American families are estimated \nto be underhoused or homeless.\n  The severe housing problems facing Indian people are compounded by \npoverty and unemployment levels in native American communities that are \nof epidemic proportions. The number of Indian families with incomes \nbelow the poverty line is nearly three times the average rate for \nfamilies throughout the rest of the Nation. The average income of \nnative Americans is less than $4,500 per person per year.\n  HUD programs have been the major source of housing assistance \navailable to Indian communities. Regular mortgage financing has not \nbeen available on Indian reservations because of the unwillingness of \nthe private sector to broaden investment and lending opportunities in \npart because of the challenges presented by the unique status of Indian \ntrust lands.\n  The statistics on Indian housing reveal an overwhelming need to \nchange the status quo on HUD assistance to Indian tribes. For these \nreasons, I strongly support the transformation of existing HUD programs \ninto tribal block grants and the separation of Indian housing from \nHUD's urban-oriented public housing programs. Tribal block grants are \nconsistent with long-standing principles of Indian self-determination \nand tribal self-governance and should enhance the long-standing trust \nrelationship between the United States and Indian tribal governments.\n\n  Mr. President, I am asking that my colleagues support immediate \nconsideration and enactment of H.R. 3219. I am pleased with the \nprogress that we have made this year to fashion an Indian housing bill \nthat will best fit the needs of tribal communities. However, while I \ncan support this bill as passed by the House on the eve of adjournment, \nI must express my serious concerns with the House-passed provisions \nwhich retreat from previous Senate-House agreements reached during \nconference on public housing reform legislation. Unfortunately, the \nCongress was unable to complete work on the larger public housing \nreform bill this year, but real progress on Indian housing reform \nshould not be forfeited because of this inability.\n  H.R. 3219 reflects many of the agreements reached between Indian \ntribes, Indian Housing Authorities, the administration and the \nCongress. But, as typically happens in the last remaining days of a \ncongressional session, changes were adopted to the bill in order to \npave the way for House passage. I am particularly disturbed by \nprovisions adopted by the House regarding the application of the Davis-\nBacon wage requirements to the entire Indian housing bill, including \nprograms which previously had limited exemptions from Davis-Bacon. The \nHouse changes will result in a loss of direct funding to Indian tribes \nfor housing development.\n  As long as I have worked with Indian affairs, I have heard from \nIndian tribes, time and time again, overwhelming opposition to the \napplication of Davis-Bacon wage requirements on Indian reservations. As \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I have an obligation to \nprotect tribal sovereignty and fight the age-old paternalism of the \nFederal Government to impose policies on Indian tribes that are not \nappropriate and that undermine the ability of tribal governments to \nmake their own decisions about how to protect their people and manage \ntheir own affairs. I realize that a complete exemption of Davis-Bacon \nis not politically feasible in this Congress. However, for practical \nand policy reasons, I believe that the Secretary of HUD should have the \nauthority to grant waivers to Indian tribal governments, at their \nrequest, who can provide clear evidence of the impracticality of Davis-\nBacon.\n  In my view, the wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act inhibit the \nability of Indian tribal governments to provide safe and affordable \nhomes to their tribal members. I understand that for some\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\ntribal areas, Davis-Bacon may actually provide some benefit, but these \nsituations are few and far between. For most of Indian Country, which \nis largely rural and isolated, Davis-Bacon inordinately raises the cost \nof construction of a typical housing unit and delays many Indian \nhousing projects, thereby diminishing the efficiency of tribal housing \ndevelopment.\n  As applied on reservations, Davis-Bacon rates are much higher than \nthey would otherwise be due to the fact that Indian reservations are \nlocated in largely rural areas which are not unionized and little or no \neffort is made to compute Davis-Bacon rates that are specific to each \nreservation setting. Factors such as geographic isolation, high poverty \nand unemployment levels, and the restricted status of Indian trust \nlands have demonstrated that Davis-Bacon is unworkable and inefficient \nfor Indian housing. Under the block grant approach, unfortunately, \nthese problems will only be exacerbated. As one tribal member pointed \nout to me, ``we are being forced to pay Cadillac prices for \nVolkswagens.''\n  I realize that Indian tribes, Indian Housing Authorities, the \nNational American Indian Housing Council and the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians support the separation of Indian housing from public \nhousing and view this legislation as an important and historic step to \naccomplish this long-awaited goal. Despite my strong reservations about \nsupporting a bill that is less than what I believe can be accomplished, \nI support prompt enactment of H.R. 3219. I share the views of Indian \ntribes who are convinced that this is the best available opportunity \nfor us to reform HUD-assisted Indian housing programs. It is imperative \nthat we should not continue the status quo of housing conditions in \nIndian Country any longer than is necessary.\n  For years, I have worked to turn over authority and funding to Indian \ntribes for their direct management of housing programs, consistent with \nlong-standing principles of Tribal Self-Determination and Self-\nGovernance. With much effort and work by Indian tribes, H.R. 3219 will \nbring Indian country closer to these goals. Next year, I will continue \nto work to exempt HUD-assisted construction activities on Indian lands \nfrom the application of the Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements, because \nthose requirements simply undermine tribal authority and waste \ncritically-needed housing funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters from \nthe National Congress of American Indians and the National American \nIndian Housing Council be printed in the Record. I thank my colleagues \nfor their support of prompt enactment of this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                               September 30, 1996.\n     Re Indian Housing reform provision.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: I am writing with regard to the \n     Indian Housing reform provisions passed in the House on 28 \n     September 1996, and now being considered in the Senate. As \n     you know, our tribes have gone on record in support of the \n     ``Lazio bill'' introduced by Rep. Lazio in the House earlier \n     in this session. Enclosed find Resolution No. TLS-96-101C in \n     support of that legislation. Nonetheless, we have serious \n     concerns with several provisions in the current version of \n     the bill. When I testified on the Native American housing \n     reform bill in June, consistent with tribal sovereignty the \n     legislation contained a tribal ``opt-in/opt-out'' provision \n     regarding the federal Davis Bacon Act. The new labor \n     standards section does not contain this tribal option, and \n     contradicts even existing limited exemptions for the \n     application of this Act.\n       In addition, the old version of the housing reform bill \n     contained a $650 million authorization to fund this critical \n     reform legislation. The current version of the housing bill \n     does not contain a specific provision regarding \n     authorizations and funding, but rather a general \n     authorization statement.\n       Mr. Chairman, having noted our strong opposition to these \n     provisions, the NCAI supports this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     W. Ron Allen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          National American Indian\n\n\n                                              Housing Council,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain, Chairman,\n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: The National American Indian Housing \n     Council (NAIHC) is requesting that you support the Native \n     American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of \n     1996 (HR 3219). On Saturday, September 28, 1996, the House of \n     Representatives passed HR 3219 as amended. NAIHC has reviewed \n     the House-passed version and continue to support this bill.\n       This historic legislation was introduced by Congressman \n     Rick Lazio, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and \n     Community Opportunities, earlier this year. Congressman Lazio \n     has worked very closely with the Native American community \n     since the bill's introduction and has continually sought our \n     input. The bill incorporates many changes that have created \n     problems in our communities and encourages our right to self-\n     determination, a goal you have long supported.\n       In June, NAIHC's membership passed Resolution 96-01 \n     supporting this legislation. The resolution passed with a \n     vote of 125 for to 12 opposing. As you can see, there is an \n     overwhelming majority of our people who believe the changes \n     HR 3219 will bring are greatly needed and long overdue. NAIHC \n     recognizes that the version of HR 3219 that Resolution 96-01 \n     supports was somewhat revised as it made its way through the \n     legislative process. Resolution 96-01, however, supports the \n     concepts of HR 3219 which have remained in-tact.\n       Please pass this historic legislation before Congress \n     departs for recess. Thank you for your continued support of \n     Native Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Jacqueline L. Johnson,\n                                                      Chairperson.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support passage of the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (H.R. \n3219). I would like to express my appreciation to Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs Chairman John McCain, Senator Ted Stevens, Senator Pete \nDomenici and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell for their commitment and \ndedication to reforming Indian housing policy. In addition, I would \nlike to commend the House of Representatives for taking the initiative \nin developing and passing this important legislation.\n  This legislation originally passed the House of Representatives as \ntitle VII of H.R. 2406, the United States Housing Act of 1996. On June \n20, 1996, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nand the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a joint hearing on this \nbill and the future of Indian housing policy for our Nation.\n  The cornerstone of H.R. 3219 is the promotion of the essential \nFederal-Indian policy of tribal self-determination and self-governance. \nIt recognizes the unique government to government relationship between \nthe Federal Government and Indian tribes. The bill also makes a long \noverdue recognition that the conditions of American Indian and Alaska \nNative housing are very different from those of urban public housing \nand responds by separating the programs from each other.\n  This legislation is supported by the majority of Indian tribes and \nIndian Housing Authorities across America. It responds to tribal \nrequests for reduced Government regulation, greater flexibility, and \nthe consolidation of funding sources into block grants. In addition, it \nrecognizes the reluctance of the private sector to provide housing on \ntrust or restricted land by broadening the scope of the loan guarantee \nprogram and providing for 50-year leasehold interests on such lands.\n  Importantly, the bill maintains maximum rent restrictions to protect \nrecipients of housing assistance. The monthly rent or homebuyer payment \nmay not exceed 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of such \nfamily. However, a tribally designated housing entity may choose to \nrequire a monthly housing payment which is less than 30 percent.\n  Although this bill is not perfect, it represents a strong beginning \nin the process of devolving control of housing policy from the Federal \nGovernment to the States and localities, in this case the tribally \ndesignated housing entities. The Senate Committee on Banking stands \nready to legislate any necessary improvements which may be required \nprior to final implementation of the legislation. I rise to support the \nadoption of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act of 1996.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to say just a few words \nabout H.R. 3219, The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act, which, if passed and signed into law, could become a \nlandmark in the development of responsive\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\nand responsible housing for Indians and other native Americans \nthroughout this country.\n  To say that the time has come for legislation like H.R. 3219 is to \nindulge in understatement. For far too long native Americans have been \nrequired to look to the U.S. Government--especially HUD, for direction \nand funding in the essential area of housing. Passage of H.R. 3219 will \nenable Native Alaskans and other native Americans to become responsible \nfor their own housing decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly proud of the fact that Ms. Jackie \nJohnson, a Tlinqit from Juneau, AK, who is Chair of the National \nAmerican Indian Housing Council, played such an important role in the \ninitiation and development of this historic legislation. Ms. Johnson \nhas poured an enormous amount of work into this effort as has the \nentire National American Indian Housing Council. I also want to thank \nmembers of the Association of Alaska Housing Authorities and its \npresident, Kristian N. Anderson, all of whom contributed so much toward \nthe development of this legislation. All these fine Alaskans have \nreason to be proud.\n  I am hopeful, Mr. President, that passage of H.R. 3219 will mark the \nbeginning of a new era in native and Indian Housing that is responsive \nand responsible--and most importantly, by and for native Americans.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act, H.R. 3219, will pass the Senate. \nI would like to enter into a short colloquy with Senator Mack, the \nsubcommittee chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and \nCommunity Development.\n  In Nevada, there are a number of small Indian tribes which are very \ndependent upon the funding they receive from Department of Housing and \nUrban Development for their local housing programs. Under this bill, \nthe funding for native American housing assistance will be provided to \ntribes through block grants for operation, modernization, and new \ndevelopment through a new funding formula. For fiscal year 1997, this \nlegislation provides for hold harmless funding for small tribes like \nthose in Nevada. During fiscal year 1997, the tribes will work with HUD \nthrough a negotiated rulemaking procedure to implement this act, and \ndevelop the funding allocation.\n  Tribes in my home State have raised concerns that the current hold \nharmless provision might disadvantage small tribes that received no \nmodernization funding in fiscal year 1996, and that a technical \ncorrection may be necessary to ensure their funding level is indeed \nheld harmless.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada stated, H.R. 3219 \nincludes language to specifically require the allocation formula will \nprovide for the continuing operation and modernization needs of \nexisting housing units. This provision is to hold harmless all native \nAmerican housing authorities or tribes from unanticipated consequences \nof a new formula, while the tribes are guaranteed the opportunity to \nparticipate in determining the funding allocation through negotiated \nrulemaking with HUD.\n  If a technical correction is needed to ensure that small tribes and \nIndian housing authorities are held harmless during this negotiated \nrulemaking process, I will work with the Senator from Nevada to seek \nsuch correction early in the next Congress.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Senator \nfrom Florida to deal with this issue expeditiously in the next \nCongress, if it is necessary to ensure that tribes which might be \nnegatively affected by this bill will have their concerns addressed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthe appropriate point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3219) was deemed read a third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12405-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADVISORY COMMISSION ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, before the 104th Congress does come to an \nend, I want to take this opportunity to thank all Senators for their \ncooperation and hard work with regard to many accomplishments of this \nCongress. This is one of the most productive Congresses in recent \nmemory, maybe not in terms of absolute numbers but in terms of historic \nlegislation. There is a long list.\n  I personally was involved and enjoyed working on such bills as the \ntelecommunications reform legislation, which was a mighty effort that \nhad been in the making for 10 years. We had good bipartisan cooperation \non that. We did get small business tax relief and, of course, we have \nall talked about welfare reform, health insurance reform, illegal \nimmigration and the monumental task of putting together the omnibus \nappropriations bill without extensions of time, and we got it done.\n  I think we should rightfully take pride as we went along with more \nand more bipartisan effort, not always cooperation but we were working \ntogether and we were able to get an agreement on a number of issues \nthat looked as if we might not be able to just days or weeks ago.\n  When I was first elected majority leader in June, the Senate was, \nfrankly, in a logjam situation with regard to several key issues. It \nwas with great cooperation and patience of all Senators, and especially \nmy Republican colleagues, our leadership team, and, quite frankly, with \nthe leadership on the other side of the aisle that we were able to \nresolve many of those outstanding issues in an orderly fashion.\n  However, with triumph does come disappointment. That goes to the fact \nthat the Senate was not able to address some of the issues that I \nreally had hoped that we would address in a different way--the partial-\nbirth abortion ban veto vote which was disappointing, and I fully \nexpect that matter will be considered again in the next Congress. But \nwe had ample opportunity to debate and make our case. We had a vote, \nand in that one we just did not have enough votes to prevail, to \noverride a veto.\n  All in all, I believe that the entire membership of the 104th \nCongress can leave today proud of their accomplishments and return in \nJanuary ready to take on the many new challenges that face us.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of remarks \nprior to the time we finish our work today.\n  Let me first begin by again congratulating the majority leader on his \nfirst few months in his new position. I would not characterize this \nCongress quite as he has, but I think we need to end on as positive and \nas bipartisan a note as we can.\n  I congratulate him on many of his efforts over the last several \nmonths. I do believe this has become a more bipartisan and more \ncooperative and a more productive session in part because of the \nleadership that Senator Lott has demonstrated. I hope that we can work \nas successfully together in the new Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12409-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STAFF CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we watch them work, I am reminded \nagain of the remarkable contribution made by our staff, the floor \nstaff, our clerks, so many of the people in the cloakrooms and in every \nfacet of the operation of the Senate. I admire them for their amazing \ndedication to this institution and for their hard work each and every \nday they come to work. We do not thank them enough. They are hard \nworkers on both sides of the aisle.\n  I will not begin to name names except John Doney only because we know \nhe is retiring, but we thank him, we applaud him, and we admire his \ngreat work--and their great work and contribution to our effort each \nand every day.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues and I thank our leadership, and I \ncertainly thank my personal staff for the great job they have done in \nserving me and working with us in the last 2 years.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota, the \nDemocratic leader, for observing the fine work that we do receive from \nour staff. Some of them are on the back rail today. They work long \nhours. They produce a lot of good legislation on both sides of the \naisle. Our own personal staffs in our offices work long hours, but the \npeople here at the desks in front of us, they are here when the doors \nopen and they are the last ones out. We would not dare presume to \nproceed without their very capable and efficient work. As we have seen \nhere in the last few minutes, there has been a real scramble to get the \nwork done, but it is always done very professionally and accurately, \nand I also extend my thanks to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12409-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE OF SENATE FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Senate Resolution 324.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 324) to provide funding for the \n     Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices to carry out \n     certain transition responsibilities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the resolution is \nagreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 324) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to join other colleagues in wishing \nAl, Ann, and their children the best for their future. Senator Simpson \nhas wisely reclaimed his life, the balance, for them.\n  I have waited until this moment, as the Senate ``retires'' from the \n104th Congress to make my statement on behalf of one of the most valued \nand respected friends I have ever had.\n  A fearless advocate for what he believed. Integrity that could never \nbe doubted.\n  As the ``whip'' of our side of the aisle, his leadership reconciled \nthe ``mountainous'' Senate egos--ambitions--when all seemed \nunreconcilable. Leadership is ``background and backbone.'' He was truly \na son of the Senate, a son of a proud father, himself a Senator from \nWyoming.\n  By his side, to steady his hand, often to protect, on occasion, \nfellow Senators from the ``whip,'' to temper his flowing humor, to \ncorrect his record, was his wife--loved and respected by all. I shall \ndearly miss the Simpson family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12409-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12409-S12410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, does the Senator from Alabama have anything? \nIs he willing to allow us to wrap this up? I know he is enjoying these \nlast few moments that he is sitting here as a Senator. We all have \nenjoyed working with him so much. I found it interesting that he is \nhere watching these last few moments. Would you like to leave one last \nword for posterity?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. It has sort of been a historical sine die session. This \nbeing my last few moments in the Senate, I though I would be here and \nwatch this historic event. Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. We felt you presence.\n  Mr. HEFLINN. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S12410]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We wish you Godspeed in all you do.\n  Does the Senator from Florida wish to speak?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice, first to the great \nwarmth of which we feel towards our esteemed colleague from Alabama and \nhow much we will miss his presence. And I appreciate the leadership \nthat has been provided by both the majority and minority leaders during \nthe session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12409-5", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2026\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to keep on this historical plane as we \nconclude, what would be more appropriate than to conclude the session \nby adopting singularly a bill that we already adopted as part of the \ncoin bill package, and that is the one to recognize our first \nPresident, George Washington?\n  So, Mr. Leader, with your permission, I ask unanimous consent that we \nproceed to a bill, H.R. 2026, which is at the desk, which is the bill \nto commemorate, by coin, President Washington. I ask unanimous consent \nto proceed to that bill.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it falls as our responsibility as leaders \nsometimes to object when we really would rather not. I would like to do \nthis. I would like to accommodate the Senator from Florida. I would \nlike to accommodate him on this particular bill. But there are a number \nof Senators who have very important coin bills that they would like to \nmove freestanding, and they had objected to moving them individually \nand objected to them being moved unless they were moved in a group. I \ndo not agree with that analogy. I do not quite understand it, but I am \nconstrained, unfortunately, to object, as much as I prefer not to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. There being no further business to come before the Senate--\n--\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Virginia wish to add one final \nword?\n  Mr. WARNER. I just----\n  Mr. LOTT. You do not have a unanimous consent request, do you?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. Just to speak on behalf of retiring Senators. But I \njudge that has now come to an end.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe it has. The bewitching hour is \nbefore us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/03/senate-section/article/S12410-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
