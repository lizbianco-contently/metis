Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since I made a \nspeech in Hollywood suggesting that our entertainment industry has a \nresponsibility to look beyond the bottom line and to not pollute our \nculture and our children.\n  That speech ignited a national discussion--a discussion which has \ncontinued to this day.\n  This discussion will take what I hope will be an important step \ntomorrow, when a delegation of entertainment industry leaders will meet \nwith the congressional Republican leadership here at the Capitol, and \nthen with President Clinton at the White House.\n  It is reported that the industry leaders will use these meetings to \ninform us of their decision to voluntarily create a rating system for \ntelevision programs.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  I certainly hope these reports are true, and that the meetings are \nnot just publicity stunts for all involved.\n  While previous commitments will prevent me from attending tomorrow's \nmeeting, I did want to take a moment to add a few thoughts to the \ndiscussion.\n  First, I wish to congratulate the entertainment industry leaders for \ntheir decision. Every parent knows that some television programming \ngoes over the line--way over the line--of decency.\n  And I believe a voluntary rating system, if honestly implemented, \nwill help parents in making informed decisions about what programs \ntheir children should and should not watch.\n  Second, let me urge the entertainment industry not to spend too much \ntime patting themselves on the back.\n  It is one thing to produce programs that children should not watch, \nand to inform parents of the content of those programs.\n  But it is another thing entirely to produce programs that parents are \nproud to let their children watch.\n  That is an important distinction I hope Hollywood understands, and \none they can respond to only by producing quality, family friendly \nprogramming.\n  Third, let me emphasize that if a rating system is to work, then it \nmust be designed and implemented without any Government meddling or \ninterference.\n  While I have taken Hollywood to task, I have also made clear that the \nanswer is good corporate citizenship, and not Government censorship.\n  If the era of big Government is truly over, then the President, the \nCongress, and the Federal Communications Commission cannot be in the \nbusiness of reviewing and rating television programs.\n  Finally, I believe it is very worthwhile to note that the industry's \ndecision to voluntarily rate television programs is proof that the \nvoice of concerned Americans is being heard.\n  We learned that when outraged citizens forced the Calvin Klein Co. to \nwithdraw ads that were nothing more than child pornography, and we \nlearn it each time a movie that assaults our values sinks at the box \noffice.\n  The bottom line is that shame does work, and it will continue to \nwork, as long as concerned Americans speak out.\n  And I am just one of countless concerned Americans who intend to \ncontinue to speak out for decency, for civility, and for the future of \nour children.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention \nof the Members what I honestly feel is an overlooked issue relative to \none of the highest responsibilities that our Government has, and that \nis the full accountability of those armed services personnel who have \nbeen lost in action.\n  We have always demanded the fullest possible accounting in Vietnam \nfor those listed as missing-in-action, and the question that I pose \ntoday is, why not North Korea as well?\n  The fate of more than 8,100 American servicemen from the Korean war \nremains unresolved. At least 5,433 of these were lost north of the 38th \nparallel. In Vietnam, by contrast, the number of unresolved cases is \n2,168, and Vietnam has cooperated in 39 joint field activities.\n  I have a small chart here, Mr. President, that shows the unaccounted \nfor in our foreign wars. Beginning in World War I, we have 1,648 \nunaccounted for; World War II, 78,794; Korea, 8,177, and Vietnam, \n2,168. As I have said, out of the 8,177, 5,433 were lost north of the \n38th parallel.\n  One can see that public opinion has prevailed in demanding a full \naccounting in Vietnam, and while we must maintain our commitment for \naccountability of all Americans who are lost, clearly, we have made \nsignificant progress in Vietnam as a consequence of a commitment and \ndedication to do so. So it seems strange that we would still have in \nNorth Korea a significant number of servicemen whose fates are unknown.\n  The United States Government recently announced plans to contribute \n$2 million, through U.N. agencies, to relieve starvation in North \nKorea, certainly a worthy cause. The donation was consistent with other \ninstances where the United States seeks to relieve human suffering \ndespite disagreements with various governments in the receiving \ncountry.\n  But what is inconsistent with United States policy is our failure to \nensure that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea addresses the \nhumanitarian issue which is of great concern to the American people: \nthe resolution of the fate of servicemen missing in action since the \nend of the Korean war, those lying north of the 38th parallel.\n  Relations between the United States and Vietnam--I give you this \nbackground as a reference--our relations with Vietnam did not begin to \nthaw until the Government of Vietnam agreed to joint field operations \nwith United States military personnel to search for missing servicemen \nin Vietnam. We knew the general areas where conflicts had occurred or \nwhere aircraft had gone down. The pace and scope of normalization was \ncommensurate with Vietnam's cooperation on the MIA issue and other \nhumanitarian concerns.\n  In virtually every discussion that our Government had with their \nVietnamese counterparts, the MIA issue was paramount. I know that on \nthe numerous occasions that I visited Vietnam, that was the one message \nwe sent loudly and clearly: You have to cooperate with us on the MIA \nissue; you have to allow us to bring in our personnel in the joint task \nforce teams; and you have to cooperate with us for a full \naccountability, otherwise our relationship will not go any further.\n  So the Vietnamese received clear signals that progress and \nnormalization of relations with the United States would come only after \nsignificant progress was made on the MIA issue.\n  In contrast to our Vietnam policy, United States policy toward North \nKorea seems to lack this same focus with no explanation. The recent \nannouncement regarding food aid for North Korea did not mention our \ninterests in the MIA issue. There was no explanation as to why.\n  The agreed framework between the United States and the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea does not talk about cooperation on MIA's, \neven though the framework commits the United States to give the North \nKoreans free oil and to supply two highly advanced light water \nreactors, a total package that exceeds $5 billion, $4 billion alone for \nthe reactors and some $500 million for the oil, not counting potential \nfuture aid for a grid system to distribute the power that the reactors \nwill produce. North Korea simply does not have the transmission \ncapability to handle the new reactors, so we can expect to be asked for \napproximately another billion dollars so that the power can go out and \nbe distributed throughout the countryside.\n\n  The agreed framework also envisions that the United States would lift \nits trade restrictions and normalize relations, regardless of, \nevidently, any movement on the MIA issue. The most obvious difference \nbetween Vietnam and North Korea is North Korea's nuclear program; the \nUnited States has \n\n[[Page S1381]]\nan overriding national security interest in stopping the North Korean \nnuclear program. Nevertheless, I do not believe that we should have \nignored the MIA issue. That is why I have introduced Senate bill 1293, \nlegislation that would prevent establishing full diplomatic relations \nor lifting the trade embargo until the North Koreans have agreed to \njoint field operations.\n  I recently had an opportunity to sit down with our dedicated armed \nservices personnel in Hawaii, who are responsible for negotiating with \nthe North Koreans on the issue. These are the people that actually \nnegotiate relative to Americans missing in action. These are the people \nthat identify the remains. They are very dedicated and knowledgeable \npeople, doing a tremendous service for our country. It was clear from \nthat briefing that joint field operations would have a high probability \nof success because, unlike in Vietnam, the United States has concrete \nevidence of the sites of mass U.N. burial grounds and prisoners of war \ncamps located in North Korea. But United States personnel have had no \naccess to those North Korean sites. The only thing preventing our \npersonnel from going in and making these identifications is the \nGovernment of North Korea.\n  The North Koreans have been unilaterally turning over some limited \nremains. Unfortunately, the North Koreans, without training in the \nproper handling of remains, have turned over excavated remains that \nhave not been properly handled, that have been mixed, making \nidentification vastly more difficult, if in some cases not impossible. \nOf the 208 sets of remains that have been turned over since 1990, \nunfortunately, only 5 sets have been identified.\n  Despite the United States aid flowing to North Korea, the Koreans \nhave repeatedly attempted to link progress on the remains issue to \nseparate compensation. In other words, Mr. President, they expect \nrepayment above and beyond their out-of-pocket costs. These amounts of \nmoney seem far in excess of the reimbursement costs for recovery, \nstorage, and transportation of remains.\n  The U.S. Government must stand by its policy not to buy remains. This \nwould degrade the honor of those who died in combat on behalf of our \ncountry. Instead, the United States has offered to reimburse the North \nKoreans for reasonable expenses, as we have done in Southeast Asia over \nthe last couple of decades. Talks to move the MIA remains and the \nreparation issue seem stalled at this moment. We have reason to believe \nthat the progress is not what it should be relative to our ability to \ngo into North Korea, to the sites where we know we are likely to find \nremains.\n  Now, the United States has been careful not to link the nuclear issue \nwith other policy concerns in North Korea. But it is not unreasonable \nfor the United States to consider North Korea's behavior on other \nissues, such as the MIA issue, when considering whether to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to this isolated, closed nation.\n  I was over in Pyongyang last year and can say that, clearly, this is \na country that is probably as isolated as any country on Earth. As a \nconsequence, our inability to develop a dialog, other than that which \nwas necessitated after the conversations concerning their efforts to \ndevelop a nuclear capability, has brought this whole picture into \nfocus. But the bottom line is that in our negotiations we should demand \nthat we have access so that we can address our responsibility and ask \nfor the fullest possible accounting for those missing, those 5,433 that \nwe believe are still unidentified in North Korea, for the families of \nthose airmen still missing more than 40 years after the end of the \nconflict. There is no more humane action that North Korea could take \nthan to let Americans have sufficient access to try to resolve as many \ncases as possible.\n  Mr. President, we have demanded the fullest accountability from the \nGovernment of Vietnam on the MIA issue, and we should demand the same \nof the Government of North Korea.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the merits of the legislation I \nhave offered, Senate bill 1293, that would prevent establishing full \ndiplomatic relations or lifting the current trade embargo until the \nDPRK, the Government of North Korea, has agreed to joint field \noperations that would allow us to have access to those sites where we \nbelieve we can identify and find remains.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1380-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1381-S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEREK J. VANDER SCHAAF: A MODEL PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to today to honor a \nFederal bureaucrat.\n  Now I know that Republicans, myself included, have been bashing \nbureaucrats lately--mostly with good reason.\n  Most bureaucrats could care less about the taxpayers. They have \nforgotten who they serve and who owns the money.\n  Well, I would like to talk about a different kind of bureaucrat. This \none is the exception. He is unique. He is a model civil servant. He \ncares about the taxpayers.\n  His name is Mr. Derek J. Vander Schaaf.\n  We know him affectionately as Derek.\n  Derek was born and raised in a small farm town in northwest Iowa--the \ntown of Hull.\n  Hull is where his Dutch parents taught him to be so thrifty, to \nskimp, to penny-pinch, to be honest and work hard.\n  Mr. President, that's what Derek is all about: being honest and fair, \nworking hard, and saving a penny here and a penny there. But zero \ntolerance for waste. His Motto is: There shall be no waste, period.\n  This is Derek to a ``T.'' This is what made him dedicate his life to \ncontrolling waste at the Pentagon.\n  This is what led him into the Office of the Inspector General.\n  Today, Derek is the Deputy Inspector General at the Department of \nDefense (DOD). He has occupied that position since it was created in \nDecember 1981.\n  After 33 years of dedicated service, Derek is leaving the government.\n  He is retiring in March.\n  Derek first earned a reputation as a junior junk yard dog back in the \n1970's as a staff member over on the House Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  He was known for doing his homework.\n  But he was best known for plowing through mountains of DOD audit \nreports.\n  Now, Mr. President, nobody else in the whole world paid much \nattention to those reports--even though they were produced at great \nexpense and contained some beautiful little nuggets.\n  DOD audit reports are hard to read. You have to read and re-read them \n10 times or more before you can begin to understand what they say.\n  Well, Derek made a living reading and acting on those reports over in \nthe House.\n  He would turn the nuggets into savings.\n  He would find a way to save a penny here and a penny there.\n  Pretty soon Derek was helping to save big bucks--billions of dollars, \nI am sure.\n  Derek's junk yard operation over in the House used to drive the \nPentagon brass absolutely nuts.\n  The generals and admirals used to parade in and out of his office, \ntrying to ``correct his thinking.''\n  Even an occasional blow with a ball-peen hammer didn't help much.\n  Derek was never affected by all the high-level attention. He just \nwent about his business like a real professional.\n  Derek's beefs with the Pentagon always rested on firm ground.\n  He would skewer the brass with their own reports.\n  It was very hard for the brass to avoid getting nicked once Derek \nzeroed in on a problem.\n  The only thing that saved them was a full-court press lobbying effort \nwith the Committee's members.\n  The end-run lobbying maneuver didn't faze Derek one bit.\n  He just read more audit reports and made more cuts. He stayed way \nahead of the DOD posse and all the tinhorn deputies.\n  He just kept right on trucking--saving a penny here and a penny \nthere.\n  When the DOD IG opened shop in 1981, Mr. Joe Sherick was put in \ncharge. Joe Sherick was the original junk yard dog. He picked Derek to \nbe his deputy dog.\n  Derek was the perfect choice. He had been a foot soldier in the war \nagainst \n\n[[Page S1382]]\nPentagon waste for 10 years. He had proven his mettle in combat, so to \nspeak.\n  Derek was ready to begin leading the war on military waste. He was \nready to go out on the ``point.''\n  As one of the ``defense reformers'' in Congress, I often turned to \nDerek for help when we uncovered problems at the Pentagon.\n  We usually turned to Derek in the heat of battle.\n  We usually turned to him after getting stonewalled by the big wheels \nover at the Defense Department.\n  So right off the bat, we put Derek in the hot seat.\n  We asked him to investigate. We asked him to document and verify.\n  We asked him to tell us what really happened. We asked him for the \ntruth.\n  Mr. President, I wish I knew how many times Mr. Vander Schaaf's name \nhas been used right here on the Senate floor to prove a very important \npoint.\n  I have done it myself many times.\n  But my opponents have done it too. They have also used his work--in \nmany instances to hammer me--and to hammer me with great success.\n  That is one of the reasons I admire Derek so much.\n  He does not always do what we want him to do.\n  At times, we have felt anger, frustration, and even disappointment \nover his work.\n  We have even accused him of whitewashing. But that is fine. That is \nthe way it should be.\n  He runs an independent operation.\n  Derek is his own man. He lets the chips fall where they may.\n  When he looks at the evidence, he first searches for the truth.\n  But he also thinks about protecting the interests of the taxpayers.\n  He thinks about the needs of the men and women serving in the Armed \nForces.\n  He thinks about what is right.\n  And, he thinks about how to succeed without getting knocked off by \nthe brass. And that is no small feat.\n  Derek is a tight-rope artist.\n  He does a balancing act on the high wire.\n  He has made the trip across the high wire many times without \nhestitation. He never wavered and never took a fall.\n  Mr. President, Derek is a model civil servant. He is honest. He is \ntough but always fair. He knows his stuff. He dedicated his life to \nprotecting the taxpayer's money.\n  Mr. President, if his parents were alive today, they would be proud \nof Derek's service to the people. But they would not make a big fuss \nabout it.\n  They would know that he was no more and no less than what they \nexpected him to be.\n  Mr. President, Derek has always set a good example--an example of \nexcellence.\n  Derek is a leader. He is a man of courage. He is a man of integrity, \nand the people will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I wish him good luck and Godspeed.\n  And I pray that there is someone just as good ready to take over.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am speaking today, once again, about the \nurgent priority we have to develop and deploy adequate defenses against \na ballistic missile attack.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and Intelligence \nCommittee, I feel it is my duty to call relevant aspects of this issue \nto the attention of my colleagues and the American people.\n  This month, we are marking the 5-year anniversary of the gulf war. \nWhile the war was, in many respects, a great triumph, there are \ncertainly many lessons that we should learn from that war. One of these \nlessons is that future conflicts will, very likely, include attacks on \nAmerican forces by ballistic missiles. It is our obligation to our \ntroops--not to mention the American people, generally--to do all we can \nto prepare for this reality.\n  Five years ago this past Sunday, a primitive Iraqi Scud missile \ncarrying a conventional explosive warhead slammed into a barracks \nhousing American troops in Saudi Arabia, and 28 Americans were killed, \n98 Americans were injured. It was the single largest loss of lives \nduring that war.\n  In recalling this event the other day, the Washington Post Style \nsection recounted the horror of how these brave young Americans, well \nbehind the front lines, were coldbloodedly attacked and murdered \nwithout warning. As the Post described it:\n\n       It was simply a freak of war. No ground was gained, none \n     was defended, no tactical purpose was served, people were \n     assassinated in their beds as they dozed or lounged or \n     clowned with buddies. They were in a converted warehouse in \n     the suburbs of Saudi Arabia, 200 miles behind the front line, \n     in a neighborhood that included a supermarket, a hotel, and \n     other buildings. The war was winding down. Two days after the \n     attack, it would be over.\n\n  I was particularly struck by the Post's description of the victims of \nthis incident as the ``forgotten fatalities of the Persian Gulf war.''\n  Now, it is understandable that a lot of the American people did not \nsee this happening because, understandably, the television crews were \nup there in the front lines, and they were filming the last 2 days of \nthis war. Nonetheless, it happened. I think there are a lot of people \nwho think that perhaps it would go unnoticed. But I am here to remind \nmy colleagues that, as policymakers and overseers of our national \ndefense preparedness, we cannot and will not ever forget what happened \nin this incident. This was an unprovoked, cowardly, and feeble \nballistic missile attack that gives us a glimpse of the future.\n  My concern is that, with a lot of people not having known and \nremembered that this happened, these 28 Americans will have died in \nvain. On the other hand, if this can be very visibly laid out in front \nof the American people--and I do applaud the Washington Post for \nbringing this to public attention this week--then perhaps this can be \nused to get a very meaningful, sophisticated, theater missile defense \nin place as everyone in Congress has asked the President to do.\n  Ballistic missiles are fast becoming the weapons of first choice of \nthose who seek to harm to American interests abroad. We know, and our \nintelligence confirms now, that 25 nations have ballistic missiles of \ndifferent degrees of technology, but the capability is there. Keep in \nmind, the one that murdered 28 Americans was a very primitive Scud \nmissile. These 25 nations all have missiles that are more sophisticated \nthan that.\n  Now, to illustrate this directly, I call the attention of my \ncolleagues to recent news reports concerning communications between the \nUnited States commander in Korea, General Luck, and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili. In this astonishing \nexchange, General Luck's urgent request for advanced missile defenses \nto protect his troops was rejected. General Luck and his forces are on \nthe front lines facing an increasingly hostile and menacing adversary \nin North Korea. According to the Washington Times, General Luck warned \nin December that the threat to United States forces from North Korean \nmissiles is growing and advance theater missile defenses were needed as \nsoon as possible.\n  Specifically, General Luck requested that the development of our most \ncapable ground-based theater missile defense system, the THAAD system, \nthe theater high altitude area defense, be accelerated to facilitate \nrapid deployment to Korea of at least 2 THAAD batteries including up to \n18 launchers. Such a system would have the potential to provide some \nadequate protection for our forces in the entire Korean theater. In \nother words, this is the very minimum that General Luck says we have to \nhave to protect the lives of our Americans in South Korea. We have \n37,000 Americans in South Korea. The report states that General Luck's \nurgent request for THAAD batteries was rejected. Instead, General \nShalikashvili reportedly informed him that THAAD development would \nactually be further delayed by a period of 3 to 5 years so that limited \nfunds could be diverted to smaller and less capable missile defense \nsystems such as the Patriot PAC 3 system and to what was called \ncritically underfunded areas of recapitalization.\n  Mr. President, I find this story to be absolutely incredible. The \nCongress has \n\n[[Page S1383]]\nbeen wringing its hands all year to accelerate the vital missile \ndefense programs, especially advanced theater missile defense programs, \nto help commanders like General Luck. We have just passed, and the \nPresident has signed, a Defense authorization bill which expressly \ncalls for more funding and more priority to such theater missile \ndefense systems such as THAAD and the Navy Upper Tier.\n  We are not talking about a national defense system. That is very \ncontroversial. I have stood on this floor over the past year and \ntalked, collectively, many, many hours about a national missile defense \nsystem. We are not talking about that, Mr. President. We are talking \nabout a theater missile defense system to protect our troops who are \ncurrently over in places like South Korea from missile attack. At the \nvery least, the threat we face is from missiles that are using what we \nconsider right now to be very primitive technology, such as the Scud \nmissile.\n  While I have been trying to carry on the debate on the national \nmissile defense system--I am very much concerned about it--we have been \nlosing the battle with the administration. They are convinced that we \nwill have to adhere to the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty was put together \nin 1972, not by a Democratic administration but by a Republican \nadministration. That was President Nixon.\n  Henry Kissinger felt at that time it was in the best interests of the \nUnited States of America to have a program of what was referred to as \n``mutual assured destruction.'' That is a program that would say there \nare two superpowers in the world. We have U.S.S.R. and we have America. \nIf we agree not to defend ourselves, then, in theory, if one would fire \na missile at the other superpower, that superpower would fire one back \nat us, everyone would die and everything would be fine. That was our \nstrategy at that time. I did not agree with President Nixon and Mr. \nKissinger at that time. At least it made sense because at that time we \nhad two superpowers.\n\n  We are not talking about that now. We are not talking about a \nnational missile defense system. What we are talking about is a theater \nmissile defense system, and I think that America needs to know that \nGeneral Luck in South Korea made the request to continue the technology \nadvancements so that we would have somewhat of a sophisticated system \njust to protect those people.\n  These field commanders know what they are talking about, Mr. \nPresident. They are not like we are here, talking in theory and \ndebating on these things in the abstract. They are on the ground facing \nthe threat that exists. I remind my colleagues that the last time the \nClinton administration turned down a field commander's similar request \nfor needed equipment was in Somalia in 1993, and it cost 18 American \nlives. All they asked for was armored vehicles. For some reason, we \nfelt that was not what they needed. But, in retrospect, we now we know \nthe field commander was right, and Americans died.\n  I urge General Shalikashvili, the Pentagon, and the policymakers in \nthe Clinton administration to reconsider what is going on here. Our \ntroops in the field are facing a threat. That threat is real. That \nthreat is now. It has been 5 years since the devastating Scud missile \nattack in Saudi Arabia. We should have no illusions about what we are \nup against. We know hat we have to do. We should do it and do it now. \nWe have the technical know how.\n  The only other thing we have that would stand in the way, deterring \nus from responding to the urgent needs of General Luck and other field \ncommanders, is the money. I have to say, Mr. President, I have said \nthis many times before, I am very much disturbed over what is happening \nright now. We have an administration that is sending troops all \nthroughout the world--Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia--on humanitarian \nmissions. Then they come back to us for emergency supplementals that we \ngive to them. That is all we need here, to come for an emergency \nsupplemental and give General Luck that which he needs to protect \n37,000 American soldiers.\n  My fear is that people will think that we will forget those 28 \nAmericans who lost their lives. The President may think we will forget, \nbut he is wrong again. Now is the time to reverse that policy of delay \nin the Pentagon and continue the development of a sophisticated theater \nmissile defense system, and do what is right.\n  I notice my colleague from North Dakota is on the floor. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was thinking perhaps the Senator from \nOklahoma was talking about the proposals for a national missile defense \nsystem. Since there is no Senate business pending, I thought it would \nbe a good time to discuss the building of a $48 billion boondoggle \ncalled star wars, but you were not talking about that, and this is not \nthe time for that discussion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think this might be an appropriate time to have that \ndiscussion because the Senator understands that I am talking here about \ntheater missile defense, which we all agreed we needed when we voted in \nfavor of the second go around on the DOD authorization bill. In \naddition, as I said, I believe we need to proceed with a national \nmissile defense.\n  Let me correct the Senator from North Dakota. It is not a $48 billion \nproposition. We already have a $40 billion investment in the essential \nelements a limited, but effective, national missile defense system. It \nwould take about 10 percent of that to make the upgrades necessary to \nmake such a system work. For example, we have 22 Aegis ships with \nlaunching capability floating today. That technology is here. It is \npaid for. All we need to do is upgrade it, giving it the capability to \npenetrate the upper tier so that if a missile does go forth from North \nKorea, Iran, Syria, Russia, China, or any place throughout the world, \nwe could protect American lives. I think any time is an appropriate \ntime to discuss that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the Senator is talking about theater missile \ndefense. We have had robust research and development funds for theater \nmissile defense. I have supported some of that. We have had robust \nresearch and development funds for national missile defense. I have \nsupported some of that. What I do not support is this notion that we \nought to, on an urgent basis, deploy in 1999 a national missile defense \nthat has a star wars component, a space-based component, multiple sites \naround the country. If you wanted to waste the taxpayers' money, that \nis an awfully good way to waste it.\n  To those who advocate creating now this new star wars or national \nmissile defense system, I would say that if this country were \nthreatened by a rogue nation, Qadhafi from Libya, Saddam Hussein from \nIraq, or any other rogue nation, we are far more likely to be \nthreatened by a nuclear device stuck in the trunk of a rusty Yugo \nparked at the docks of New York City than one delivered by a \nsophisticated missile. Or it is far more likely we will be threatened \nfrom another country by a small glass vial, no bigger than my hand, \nfull of deadly biological agents.\n  I just think this notion of building an Astrodome over America--and \nit will cost $48 billion incidentally, for something we do not need--I \nthink we ought to think long and hard before we do that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware that the Taepo Dong missile in North \nKorea, it is believed, will be able to reach the United States by the \nyear 2002, and actually can reach Alaska and Hawaii by the year 2000? I \nthink that is something which the Senator would agree that our \nintelligence has indicated would be a threat to the United States in \nthose time limits.\n  We can talk about all these other things, these social areas in which \nto invest our money. But if we do not stay on line and finish what we \nhave started, what we have paid for, to develop a national missile \ndefense system, I believe we will regret it. I agree with Jim Woolsey--\nand certainly Jim Woolsey is not a Republican; he was the CIA Director \nappointed by President Clinton--when he said our intelligence confirms \nthere are between 20 and 25 nations that currently have, or are in \nvarious stages of developing, weapons of mass destruction, either \nchemical, biological, or nuclear, and are working on the missile means \nto deliver them.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is fully aware that such technology is \nout there, and that many of those countries who want to sell that \ntechnology may do so and we might not have any way of knowing what is \ngoing on. \n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator, a much greater threat than an \nICBM from North Korea is the likelihood that some rogue country will \nget a hold of an air-launched cruise missile from an air platform not \ntoo far offshore, or a sea-launched cruise missile, or a ground-\nlaunched cruise missile. That would be a far more likely delivery \nvehicle to get. The national missile defense system is not going to \nshoot down cruise missiles.\n  In any event, we should debate this question of what is an adequate \ndefense for this country, what are the threats, and what do we do to \nprepare to meet those threats. I do not disagree at all with the \ncontention of the Senator that we should have such a debate.\n  The difficulty I have is there seems to be a tendency for some to \nembrace the biggest, most expensive, and broadest possible defense \nprogram to respond to a threat. There are many threats to this country, \nand I think the Senator from Oklahoma and others do a service when they \nraise on the floor of the Senate a whole series of defense issues and \ndo it in a thoughtful and persuasive way. It is also helpful for others \nof us who switch roles sometimes and say, ``Wait a second, who are the \nbig spenders now? Where are you going to get all this money?''\n  We have had some experience with national missile defense. In North \nDakota, they built the only antiballistic missile program in the free \nworld's history. It was decommissioned 30 days after it was declared \noperational. I do not know how many billions of dollars went into that, \nbut it was wasted because the system was closed down. It was closed \ndown within a month after it was declared operational.\n\n  I am not suggesting that we should not invest in a lot of these \nissues. I supported investing $370 million in research and development \non the national missile defense system. But when the defense bill came \nto the floor, and the Senator from Oklahoma and others insisted on \nincreasing that funding by over 100-percent in this year's \nappropriation, I said, ``Wait a second, where are we going to get the \nmoney? Where on Earth are we going to get the money to increase the so-\ncalled star wars, as I call it, the national missile defense, as you \ncall it, by over 100 percent in this year and demand it be deployed, \nearly deployment, in 1999?''\n  The Senator quoted some defense and intelligence folks he knows. The \nSenator will recall that I held up on the floor of the Senate a chart \nshowing letters from the Secretary of Defense, who thought that funding \nincrease was very unwise. He did not support a 100-percent increase for \na star wars program, demanding early deployment in 1999, and suggesting \nthat we use multiple sites on the ground and possibly systems in space. \nThe Secretary of Defense did not support that. He said that was not in \nthis country's interests.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, we have talked about this on the floor \nmany, many times. A number of us who are on both the Intelligence \nCommittee and on the Senate Armed Services Committee believe that this \nthreat is imminent and real. If our intelligence confirms that we could \nbe reached by a missile from North Korea within 6 years of right now, \nthis is something to be called to the attention of the American people.\n  You might say, the big spenders, what are they spending this on? Yes, \nwe were asking for more money to stay on course so we would have a \ndefense system in place by the year 2000 or 2003.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, no, it was 1999. If I might reclaim my time, the \nSenator is mistaken. The legislation that came to the floor of the \nSenate demanded early deployment by 1999 of a national missile defense \nsystem. The way to waste the taxpayers' money is to----\n  Mr. INHOFE. But that bill, of course, was vetoed by the President. \nAnd the President, in his veto message, said we do not need a national \nmissile defense system on the timeline we are talking about. He is \ntalking about 15 years out in the future.\n  I would ask the Senator, does he remember what Saddam Hussein said \nduring the Persian Gulf war, when he stated that if he could have \nwaited another 5 years, he would have had the missile technology to \nreach the United States, and that he would not have hesitated to use \nit? I think there should be no hesitation to conclude that some of the \nmadmen around the world like Saddam Hussein would act the same way.\n  Then, only 3 weeks ago, in an article in the New York Times, \nreferences were made to statements from top Chinese officials \nconcerning direct missile threats on Taiwan. They indicated that they \ncould make such threats with little concern about how the Americans \nwould react because, they said, the Americans are more concerned about \nprotecting Los Angeles than they are about protecting Taipei.\n  When you get top officials talking like that, you get a sense of what \nwe will be facing in the future. Let us just assume for a minute that \nmaybe you are wrong. Maybe the Senator, who is very knowledgeable, the \nSenator from North Dakota, might be wrong. What are the consequences? I \ncome from Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, just last April, we had the most \ndevastating terrorist attack in the history of terrorism in this \ncountry, in the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. The \nbomb that went off was a 1-ton bomb, the equivalent to 1 ton of TNT. \nThe smallest nuclear warhead known right now is 1,000 times the \ndevastation of that bomb.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time on that point, because I think the \nSenator makes the point I am trying to make. Tragically, the terrorist \nattack in Oklahoma City was a fertilizer bomb. The tragic terrorist \nattack in Oklahoma City was with a fertilizer bomb in the back of a \nRyder truck. Not even a very large one, but large enough to destroy \nthat building and kill so many wonderful Oklahoma people and others. It \njust breaks your heart to see that happen.\n  But my point is this. My point is, terrorism does not come, \nnecessarily, as a warhead on an ICBM.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Terrorism finds its form in dozens of different areas. \nThe Japanese confronted a terrorist attack that could have been of such \na nightmare quality that it would have been unheard of previously, with \nthis deadly chemical agent which killed, tragically, a good many \nJapanese. The human toll of that attack in Tokyo could have actually \nbeen much worse than it was. Fortunately, certain circumstances \nintervened.\n  But my point is this. There are a lot of rogue nations out there. \nThere are people with the capability to build a nuclear device. There \nare some with the ability to deliver the nuclear device. You can \ndeliver a small nuclear device in a suitcase these days. You can \ndeliver it with an ICBM. You can put it on a cruise missile. You can \ndrive it in a car. You can plant it in a truck. Or you can create a \nnonnuclear device, a deadly biological agent, in a very small bottle. \nThere are dozens and dozens of ways to terrorize this country.\n  One thing that anybody out there ought to understand in this world is \nthis. If a Saddam Hussein or if a rogue country decides to launch a \nnuclear attack on our country, they would be vaporized instantly. We \nhave intercontinental ballistic missiles with Mark 12 warheads. The \nfact is, with our combined triad of nuclear power in the sea, nuclear \npower in the air, nuclear power on the land, anyone who harbors the \nthought of engineering that kind of attack on our country will \nunderstand that they will be gone from this Earth.\n  That has been what for many years has prevented a nuclear attack on \nour country. The Senator makes the point that there are other ways to \nensure our safety. We can essentially create a catcher's mitt to catch \nICBM's that may be aimed at us. The catcher's mitt over America will \nnot catch cruise missiles. But it will not deal with the other elements \nof terror, including fertilizer bombs or deadly biological agents.\n  The question is whether we should build this astrodome over America \nfor roughly $48 billion. And it is not a case of spending 10 percent \nmore because we already spent 90 percent. I should mention that the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 1995 that \nthe cost of a six-site ground-based national missile defense system \nwould be $48 billion. You go down this road and I guarantee you that \nyou will spend tens of billions of dollars. And at the end you will \nhave not devised a system that gives you any more cause to \n\n[[Page S1385]]\nsleep better at night than you did yesterday.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Up until that statement, I suggest to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota that we are almost in agreement on a couple of things. We \nneed to do what we can to defend against terrorist attacks, whether it \nis fertilizers bombs in suitcases and any other way. But just because \nthat is also a threat does not mean we should abandon our national \nmissile system because that threat is there. The Senator talks about \nwhat our capabilities are today. The Senator talks about a dome. I am \nnot talking about a dome. I think it is demeaning to the American \npeople to keep using over and over again the statement ``star wars.'' I \nknow the President does that quite often.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reclaim my time. This is my time. The reason I use \n``star wars'' is because the proposal that the Senator and others \npushed is a proposal that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I really came to the floor to speak for \nabout 5 minutes about an economic task force. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to speak for 7 additional minutes, and for the next 2 \nminutes let us deal with this and let me give the statement I intend to \non the economic task force.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The bill the Senator supported last year included both \nmultiple sites on the ground and the possibility of space-based laser \nsystems.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are talking right now about going into that position. \nWe have something in space we are concerned about, and that is our \nsatellite technology that warns us in advance 30 minutes before it \nreaches the United States. If one should come from North Korea, that \ngives us adequate time. That technology is here now. Brilliant Eyes \nwould tie into our ground-based radar and give us warning so we would \nbe able to project and hit it. But we are not talking about that at \nthis point. We are talking about a bad missile that would reach the \nstratosphere. We have 22 Aegis ships that we have a tremendous \ninvestment in, and I am sure the Senator maybe disagreed with the \namount of money that we invested in that to begin with. But it is here. \nWe were in this body at the time that decision was made. They have now \nthose out there floating. We want to get in the position that we can \nuse that investment by having maybe three ships on the east coast and \nthree ships on the west coast to reach into the atmosphere and hit \nmissiles coming toward the United States. That is hardly an umbrella \nover the United States. But it is common sense--I still contend--that \nyour figures are not accurate. And for approximately 10 percent more in \ninvestment than we have already made we could have a system that would \ndefend Americans against missile attack.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I respect the Senator's views. And he comes with great \nenergy, as do many of his colleagues when we have this discussion on \nthe floor. I will be here when it comes again this year on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I am not suggesting that we ought not be involved \nin these kinds of questions or issues. I could have supported a level \nof $370 million of R for a national missile defense. I think that is \na little high. But the fact is that was in the administration's budget. \nWe agreed with that. We disagreed with adding over 100 percent to that, \nor increasing by 100 percent.\n\n  Interestingly enough, this comes at a time when the workhorse of our \nstrategic defense are still effective. The B-52 bomber, for example, is \na wonderful airplane. It has lots of life left. The Air Force does not \nhave enough money. So they are putting B-52's in storage. We are going \nto draw down that bomber force? Why? Because we do not have enough \nmoney to retain the bomber force. You can run 25 B-52's for I think 5 \nyears for the cost of one new B-2 bomber, as I recall.\n  The tradeoffs here are what I am talking about. I am not suggesting \nthat we should not make good investment to defend this country. I am \nsaying let us make sure that what we are doing represents the right \nkind of tradeoffs in the things that are necessary for this country's \ndefense in the future.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree. I cannot think of anything more valuable when \nyou are talking about tradeoffs than defending the lives of Americans.\n  The reason I brought up the thing in Oklahoma City was I was there \nfor the 168 people who were killed, and many were dear friends of mine. \nThe point there is that the smallest warhead known could kill 1,000 \ntimes that many. That is a real threat to Americans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understood the point the Senator was making. I think \nall of us in this Chamber understand the heartbreak and the sadness \nwhich was visited on Oklahoma and Oklahoma City and this entire country \nby that tragedy, by that senseless violence that happened. It maybe in \na lot of ways reminds us all again of how fragile things are and how \neasy it is for someone deranged, or some group deranged, to want to \nvisit great damage on a country, or a region, or a city, or a people. \nWe need to be vigilant about that. But there are a whole range of \nthreats. We need to consider the entire range.\n  As always, I enjoyed the visit with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, thank you for indulging us and sitting and listening \nto this exchange. But you will hear much of this exchange again when we \nhave the Defense authorization bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak for the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1382-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1385-S1386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TASK FORCE ON JOBS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we had this morning a task force that \ninvolved its work on the issue of jobs over in the Dirksen Building.\n  I and Senator Daschle and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, who is \nchairman of this task force, were a part of it. I wanted to point out \nsome of what we are trying to do.\n  This issue of Pat Buchanan moving around this country talking about \njobs is not an accident. He understands what many of us understand--\nthat the center pole of the tent for the economic debate in this \ncountry ought to be jobs. I happen to think Pat Buchanan has a few dark \nsides to his debate. I do not like some of the influences which I see \nand some of the references. But the fact is on the issue of jobs, it \nseems to me, the voters of New Hampshire and others responded to the \nissue of jobs and economic opportunity. And it is something that we \nhave been working on in our caucus under the leadership of Jeff \nBingaman now for about a year. Today, we are unveiling a series of \nrecommendations on the issue of creating jobs in our country.\n  We have an interesting economy in America. America is still a strong \ncountry, and a wonderful place. Nobody wants to leave. People want to \ncome here. We have some folks running for the Presidency who I think \nwant to build a fence down there to keep people out of our country. \nWhat does that say about our country? It has a lot of problems but it \nis also a wonderful place and a magnet where a lot of people want to \ncome to. We have an economy, however, where economists measure economic \nprogress by taking a look at car wrecks, heart attacks, and \nearthquakes. There are economists down at the Federal Reserve who are \nmeasuring economic strength by examining car accidents, heart attacks, \nand earthquakes. Hurricane Hugo added one-half of 1 percent of GDP to \nthis country because this country measures its economic health by what \nit consumes and not what it produces.\n  In the long run the question of whether this country has a strong, \nvibrant, healthy economy will depend on how we produce, what we \nproduce, and whether we have a strong manufacturing base. We have an \neconomic system that has been redefined in our country in recent years \nby large international economic organizations. And they have redefined \nit by saying we choose to want to produce. Whether it is to produce and \nsell in established markets, we choose to access 20-cent an hour labor, \nor $1 an hour labor, and sell the shoes, or the products from that \nlabor, the shirts, the belts, the cars in Pittsburgh, or Tokyo, or \nFargo, or Denver. The problem is that disconnects. That is a global \neconomic circumstance that we probably cannot \n\n[[Page S1386]]\nchange very much in the broader sense but that we address with respect \nto additional rules because it disconnects the income from the source \nof production from the consumers who are going to be consuming the \nbenefits, or the fruits of production.\n  The engine of progress in this country, in my judgment, is how do we \ncreate new, good-paying jobs? When people sit at the dinner table at \nnight and talk about their lives as a family, the only question that \nmatters is, ``Are we increasing our standard of living?'' And, \nregrettably for 60 percent of the American families, the answer is, \n``No. We are working harder.'' And over the last 20 years we are making \nless money, if you adjust it for inflation. There is no Government \nprogram, none that is as effective as a good job, or a substitute for a \ngood job, that pays well.\n  Now, the question is, Why are we losing manufacturing jobs? Why are \njobs moving out of our country? Why are jobs going overseas? And what \ncan we do about it?\n  First, fair trade and fair competition. Our country ought not be \nashamed ever to stand up and say we demand fair trade. We expect to \ncompete, but we demand the competition be fair as well. When I was a \nkid walking to school, I knew every day that our country could win just \nby waking up; we were the biggest, the strongest, the best, and we \ncould win the economic contest with one hand tied behind our back. But \ntimes are different, and we cannot do that today. And we ought to \ninsist that fair competition and fair trade be hallmarks of our \neconomic circumstances in this country.\n  Second, it seems to me we ought to change our Tax Code. I introduced \nsome legislation, and I am introducing more that says let us stop \nsubsidizing movement of jobs overseas, this insidious, perverse \nprovision in our Tax Code that says, if you close your plant here and \nmove your jabs to a tax haven overseas, we will give you a little \nbonus. We will give you a tax break. We have already voted on that on \nthe floor of the Senate, and I was unable to pass closing the tax break \nthat says we will reward you if you move your jobs overseas. But guess \nwhat. You are going to get a chance on a dozen more occasions this year \nto vote on the same thing. We ought to shut down the tax breaks in our \nTax Code that say to people: Move the jobs overseas and we will reward \nyou.\n  Third, we ought to provide some basic incentive to create jobs here, \nand I propose a 20 percent payroll tax credit for those who create new \nnet jobs in this country. Let us shut off the incentive to move jobs \noverseas and create incentives to create new jobs in this country.\n  I am not much interested in how many jobs exist in Japan or how many \njobs exist in Germany or how many jobs exist in Mexico. I am interested \nin how many jobs exist in our country. This is an economic competition \nin which we are involved. It is a competition with winners and losers. \nIt is not a circumstance where everybody wins. It is a circumstance \nwhere, if the rules are unfair and the competition is not fair, there \nare winners and losers. We are losing our manufacturing base in this \ncountry, and we can do something about it, the quicker the better. The \ntask force that was headed by Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico is a task \nforce that makes serious and specific recommendations that will try to \ncreate the incentives to create new jobs in this country--not \nelsewhere; in this country--in the future. The currency of ideas that \nare represented by the recommendations of that task force will be a set \nof ideas we will discuss over and over again in this Congress in 1996.\n  It will not surprise anyone to understand the anxiety that exists in \nour country today. People are worried. They know that they are less \nsecure in their jobs. You can work 20 years and be laid off without a \nblink by some enterprises. Their jobs pay less adjusted for inflation \nthan they did 20 years ago in many cases. So they are worried about \nfewer jobs, jobs that pay less, and jobs with less security, and they \nwant something done about it that increases the standard of living in \nthis country.\n  Government cannot wave a wand to make that happen, but the rules and \nthe debate about how you create good jobs and how you stop the \nhemorrhaging of jobs from our country moving overseas is a debate that \nwe ought to have right here in the center of the Senate.\n  We are going to have an Olympics in Atlanta in August, and everybody \nis going to be rooting. We will root for all the wonderful athletes all \naround the world, but especially we will decide as Americans that those \nmen and women wearing the red, white and blue are our team and we want \nthem to do well. There is another competition that is not on the field \nof athletics. It is in the field of economics, worldwide economic \ncompetition to decide who wins and advances with new jobs and better \nopportunity and who suffers the turn-of-the-century British disease of \nlong economic decline, who wins and who loses.\n  Frankly, I want us to have a plan. I want our team to win. I want our \nteam to decide that we will compete and we will win, and we will make \nsure the rules are fair as we compete. That is the purpose of trying to \nput together a series of steps that say our intent is to try to \nencourage new jobs created in this country and try to discourage, \nthrough the insidious provisions in our Tax Code, the export or the \nshipment of good jobs in America overseas. We ought not pay for that. \nWe ought not provide incentives to move jobs elsewhere. I tell you \nwhat. Anybody who thinks that makes sense is not thinking. And I hope \nwe will get the Senate to think a lot about that in 1996.\n  Mr. President, we will be discussing at some greater length the \nlegislation that I have introduced, and we will discuss at greater \nlength the recommendations of the high wage task force of Senator \nBingaman in the future as well. I look forward to those discussions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the immigration bill which is scheduled to come before the \nJudiciary Committee tomorrow and, first of all, an amendment which will \nbe offered by a number of Senators, including the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, Senator DeWine of Ohio, under the leadership of \nSenator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, to divide the appropriations bill \ninto two parts, that relating to legal immigration and that relating to \nillegal immigration.\n  I think it is important to do so, that the bills have independent \nstatus and that there not be an effort made to tie either bill to the \nother. The bill on legal immigration has no more to do with the bill on \nillegal immigration than, say, the telecommunications bill has to do \nwith the crime bill. Illegal immigration is a major problem in America.\n  I picked the telecommunications bill not at random but because the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee walked in for a \nmoment. \n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\n  The bill on illegal immigration is a very important bill. We ought to \nprotect our borders. We ought to take it up, in my view, separately. On \nthe bill on legal immigration, I have already stated my intention to \nintroduce an amendment, but I think it worthwhile to make this \nstatement in the Chamber of the Senate so it will appear in the \nCongressional Record and my colleagues and others will have notice as \nto what I intend to do.\n  But the amendment would make the following changes. First it would \nincrease the worldwide level of employment-based visas from 90,000 to \n135,000 a year. Second, it would eliminate the fee that employers must \npay for each immigrant employee they sponsor, which is now $10,000 or \n10 percent of the employee's compensation annually, whichever is \ngreater. Third, my amendment would eliminate the fee that certain \nemployers must pay for each temporary foreign worker that they employ.\n  Next, it restores the maximum length of the H visa to 6 years and the \nmaximum length of the L visa to 7 years. Next, it restores the \n``Outstanding Researchers and Professors,'' which is a category that is \nexempt from the labor market screening requirement. It also eliminates \nthe requirement that employers must pay foreign workers 105 percent of \nprevailing wages.\n  Mr. President, there has been an effort made to limit legal \nimmigration under the general guise of protecting American workers. But \nI believe this bill is exactly wrong and exactly counterproductive \nbecause the kinds of people who are going to be excluded from this bill \nare Ph.D.'s, scientists, M.D.'s, and those who have great proficiency \nand capability for adding much to employment potential in this country.\n  In 1989-90, I sponsored the lead amendment to add people to come in \npeople who were in demand in industry. I did that because the chamber \nof commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers were \ninterested in that as a job-producing approach. Again, this year, after \nhaving meetings with extensive numbers of my constituents in \nPennsylvania, both in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, I have found that \nthere is a tremendous demand for these highly skilled people, and that \nthe people are not available in the United States to take the jobs. \nRather than decreasing employment opportunities for American workers, \nthe bringing in of these additional people will increase the employment \nopportunities.\n  I also say, Mr. President, that Americans should never lose sight of \nthe fact that this is a nation of immigrants. It is something that I \nfeel particularly strongly about since both of my parents were \nimmigrants.\n  My father came to the United States at the age of 18, literally \nwalked across Europe from the Ukraine with barely a ruble in his \npocket, rode steerage, the bottom of the boat, to come to America for a \nbetter life for himself and his family.\n  My father was a great contributor to the United States. He did not \nknow when he came over steerage he had a round-trip ticket back to \nEurope, back to France, not to Paris and the Follies Bergere, but to \nthe Argonne Forest, where he served with great pride in the United \nStates Army. He rose to the rank of buck private. I say that somewhat \nfacetiously because my dad was at the bottom of the totem pole in rank \nbut at the top of the totem pole in dedication, loyalty, bravery.\n\n  In the Argonne Forest, he sustained shrapnel in his legs, wounds he \ncarried with him until the day he died. But he was a great American, a \ngreat contributor to this country. He was an immigrant. If he had been \nbarred from the United States, I would not be in the U.S. Senate today. \nIn fact, I would not be.\n  My mother, too, came as an immigrant, as a child of 5 with her \nparents from a small town on the Russian-Polish border. She, too, was a \ngreat American, raising a family. My brother, two sisters and I have \nhad the advantage of an education in America and have been able to \nshare in the American dream, as have so many Americans. More than \nsharing in the American dream, the immigrants have created the American \ndream. This is a factor that I think has to be borne in mind.\n  I talked to my distinguished colleague, Senator Simpson, about this \nbill. Senator Simpson made the unusual effort of coming to see me \ntwice. When Senator Simpson walked in, he said, ``I've been here for \nlunch frequently with the Wednesday Group, but I never looked at the \npictures.'' I showed Senator Simpson a picture of Mordecai Shem, my \nmother's father, who came in 1905, another great American. I showed him \na picture of my father in military uniform marrying my mother in St. \nJoe in 1919.\n  I said to Senator Simpson, ``I'm going to agree with you on just \nabout nothing on this immigration bill.'' I think the future of our \ncountry is wrapped up in inviting these highly skilled, highly trained \nimmigrants to create more jobs and more prosperity in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1386-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1387-S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am optimistic today that the Congress \nwill move forward with an omnibus appropriations bill to cover the \ndepartments now not covered in existing legislation. I have been \nparticularly concerned about what has happened to the subcommittee of \nAppropriations which I have the honor to chair, the Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education. The absence of an \nappropriations bill in these departments has been very, very, very \nproblemsome.\n  It has been impossible for the Secretary of Labor to plan on worker \nsafety and impossible for the Secretary of Education to advise various \nStates as to the allocation of their funding. It has been impossible \nfor the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make allocations on \nvery important items, although we have taken some items out like the \nNational Institutes of Health, where we have maintained, again, an \nincreased appropriation on that very important line.\n\n  I had scheduled last week a hearing of the three Secretaries to \noutline the needs of their Departments and to the approaches which they \nmight be able to take. I deferred that hearing because, in the absence \nof knowing how much the additional funding would be, it was impossible \nto have that hearing in a meaningful way.\n  I had been in touch with the Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, on a \nnumber of occasions spreading over several weeks trying to push ahead \nto see to it that we had an opportunity to construct this legislation \nwell in advance of the March 15 date when the current continuing \nresolution would expire.\n  As a matter of fact, I even made an effort to talk to Chief of Staff \nPanetta when he was traveling with the President recently, when he \ntraveled Friday to Wilkes-Barre, where the President was due to stop to \nlook at flood damage in Pennsylvania, which was very extensive. There \nis flood damage all over the State, not only with the Susquehanna in \nWilkes-Barre, the Lackawanna River in Scranton, and the Susquehanna \nthrough central Pennsylvania, very great damage off Dauphin and \nCumberland counties, other places, Pittsburgh as well, and western \nPennsylvania.\n  When the President came to Wilkes-Barre, he was scheduled to have Mr. \nPanetta with him. I thought I would be able to get the facts there. But \nChief of Staff Panetta had left the party, so I had a chance to talk \nwith the President about the additional funding. The President was in \nagreement we needed to do just that.\n  Yesterday I was advised that there would be an additional $4.5 \nbillion in budget authority, slightly in excess of $1.7 billion in \nbudget outlays, so we can go ahead.\n  I am looking forward to rescheduling the hearing with Secretary of \nLabor Reich, Secretary of Health and Human Services Shalala, Secretary \nof Education Riley, to make a determination as to where those funds \nought to be added.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to \nChief of Staff Leon Panetta dated February 20, 1996, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Leon Panetta,\n     Chief of Staff, the White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leon: I called again this morning to try to find out \n     from you the possible offsets to add approximately $3.3 \n     billion for appropriations for my Subcommittee on Labor, \n\n[[Page S1388]]\n     Health and Human Services and Education. As you know, when we talked \n     the week before last, you expected to be able to identify \n     those offsets by last Tuesday. When I caught up with you on \n     Friday, you thought the offsets could at least be identified \n     by today.\n       As I had mentioned to you, a Subcommittee hearing has been \n     scheduled for February 21 to hear from Secretary Reich, \n     Secretary Shalala and Secretary Riley to try to structure an \n     appropriations bill which the President would sign with the \n     additional funding.\n       I believe it is advisable to defer that hearing until we \n     can identify the amount of the additional funding and the \n     offsets so that we can pass a bill in advance of the March 15 \n     expiration of the continuing resolution.\n       As I have said on many occasions, I think it is very \n     important that we move ahead on these preliminary steps \n     forthwith because I anticipate many controversial issues in \n     the Senate floor debate and then a House-Senate conference \n     which could take considerable time.\n       As I mentioned to you when we talked Friday afternoon, I \n     had hoped to see you in Wilkes-Barre with the Presidential \n     party, but I understood you had to leave in advance of that \n     stop.\n       At Wilkes-Barre, I discussed with President Clinton the \n     urgency of identifying these offsets. The President said he \n     had already discussed the offsets with you and agreed on the \n     importance of moving ahead promptly to identify additional \n     funding for these three important departments.\n       As soon as you can advise me on the additional funding and \n     the offsets, we shall move ahead to reschedule the hearing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of any other Senator on the floor, Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 226\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of our society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the nation;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in \n\n[[Page S1389]]\n     personal relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by youth-influencing \n     institutions and individuals to help young people develop the \n     essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas character development is, first and foremost, an \n     obligation of families, efforts by faith communities, \n     schools, and youth, civic and human service organizations \n     also play a very important role in supporting family efforts \n     by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of our nation, and \n     to recognize that character is an important part of that \n     future;\n       Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``Effective \n     character education is based on core ethical values which \n     form the foundation of democratic society'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and \n     fairness, caring, civic virtue and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``The character \n     and conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate proclaims the week of October 13 \n     through October 19, 1996, as National Character Counts Week, \n     and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     embrace the 6 core elements of character and to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me open this by sending a resolution \nto the desk and asking that it be appropriately referred. It is now \nsponsored by 10 Senators. It will have the requisite 50 or 60 \nsignatures within a month and thus can get reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The original cosponsors of this resolution have been consistent \nsupporters of this resolution.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Nunn, Dodd, Cochran, Mikulski, \nBennett, Lieberman, Kempthorne, Dorgan, and Frist, as members of the \nSenate Character Counts Working Group, are again joining me as original \ncosponsors of this resolution.\n  This resolution requests that the President of the United States \nproclaim the week of October 13 through 19 as ``National Character \nCounts Week.'' I want to discuss with the Senate and those interested \nin what we say here what Character Counts is all about in our country \nand what the movement for Character Counts is all about.\n  I send the resolution to the desk as previously requested, and I ask \nfor its referral to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Many exciting and unique character education programs \nhave taken place over this past year. As important, thousands of young \npeople, local and national organizations, schools, parents and citizens \nhave participated in efforts to make their communities aware of the \npositive benefits of character education.\n  One example is 12-year-old Carrie Beeman from the Roswell, NM \nMountain View Middle School. Carrie will be coming to Washington, DC as \n1 of 104 young Americans to be recognized for their service to their \ncommunities in the national Prudential Spirit of Community youth \nvolunteer awards program. She received a $1,000 for her work in the \nChain of Character contest by helping organize and selling 14,000 chain \nlinks to raise funds for the local character education efforts in \nRoswell. By calling businesses and other interested citizens, she \nhelped raise $400 for her school's student council and $2,000 for her \ntown's local Character Counts program.\n  Carrie's effort personifies the great national grassroots movement to \nsupport character programs: No matter the age, everyone can participate \nat the local level to help promote good character in their schools and \nin their communities. All of us in New Mexico who are working at the \nlocal and State level to promote character education programs are very \nproud of Carrie and are deeply appreciative that the selection \ncommittee for the Prudential awards recognized her fine efforts.\n  There are many reasons why the character education movement is \ngaining such momentum, and let me mention just a few that bear \nattention.\n  First let me talk about violence on television and a recent study of \nthat. Let me take a couple of moments of time to talk about this to the \nSenate.\n  A recent comprehensive study commissioned by the National Cable \nTelevision Association--National Television Violence Study--articulates \nsome disturbing statistics. Among the study's finding were that: \nPerpetrators of violent acts on TV go unpunished 73 percent of the \ntime; 47 percent of all violent interactions show no harm to victim, \nand 58 percent depict no pain. Longer term consequences--such as \nfinancial or emotional harm--were shown only 16 percent of the time; \nfew programs containing violence, just 4 percent, emphasize nonviolent \nalternatives in solving problems.\n  As depicted on television, violence inflicts little pain and minimal \nconsequences for actions that hurt, maim, and kill. Such actions \nglamorize abhorrent behavior that shouts ``it's OK'' to be \nirresponsible, dishonest, and violent. Responsibility, respect, \nor caring apparently do not have enough public appeal to ensure high \nviewer ratings.\n\n  Another example of why so many are concerned about the values of \nAmerica is the findings of a 3-year study just completed by the \nJosephson Institute of Ethics for their 1996 Report Card on American \nIntegrity. Anonymous, written surveys were administered nationally in \nschools and during various programs conducted by the institute that \nincluded responses from 5,740 high school students, 2,289 college \nstudents, and 3,190 adults not in school. Basically, the survey \nrevealed that very high percentages of young people, as well as adults \nover 25, have fallen into such habits as lying, cheating and stealing. \nFor example: 42 percent of high school male respondents and 31 percent \nof high school females said they had stolen something from a store \nwithin the previous 12 months; nearly half the high school males and \none-third of the high school females--41 percent of high-schoolers \noverall--said they would lie if they thought it necessary to get or \nkeep a job; 1 in 4 adult respondents, 2 of 5 collegiate respondents, \nand over half the high schoolers said they would or probably would lie \nabout their debts to get a badly needed loan; and more than half the \nmales and one-third the females said it is sometimes justified to \nrespond to an insult or verbal abuse with physical force, with nearly \nhalf of all high school respondents saying they had struck another \nperson or used physical force within the previous year.\n  And, adding another dimension to these findings, it is likely that \nthe real percentage of those actually engaging in dishonest conduct is \nhigher than that reflected in the Josephson Institute's study. Why? \nBecause 41 percent of high school respondents, 37 percent of collegiate \nrespondents, and 25 percent of those respondents not in school admitted \nto giving a dishonest answer to at least one or two survey questions.\n  Just these two studies alone suggest that good character habits are \nnot being emphasized or practiced by significant numbers of young and \nadult Americans. At the same time, the Josephson Institute's survey \nshowed that 96 percent of not-in-school adults said that being ethical \nin all aspects of their lives is very important, but only 64 percent of \nthe high schoolers said they place such a high value on ethics. I would \nsuggest that while the high schoolers numbers are not nearly as high as \nthey should be, at least there is acknowledgment that being ethical is \ndesirable and important. \n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\n  I do not believe that America is made up of liars, cheats and \nthieves. In fact, I believe that most Americans want to do well by \ntheir fellow citizen. At the same time, exemplary behavior is not a \ngenetic trait--it needs to be taught. Being responsible, caring, \nhonest, or trustworthy needs to be reinforced by parents, schools, \ncommunity organizations, and adults. This is what we mean by character \neducation. And, it takes everyone's participation to make it work.\n  Mr. President, about 3\\1/2\\ or 4 years ago, as I stated here on the \nfloor before, a group of Americans from all walks of life--from various \nreligions, from commerce, from labor organizations, housewives--met in \nAspen, CO. They issued a declaration, which is now known in some parts \nas the Aspen Declaration. The Aspen Declaration is the result of 3\\1/2\\ \ndays of intensive evaluation by this broad spectrum of Americans.\n  The conclusion that they reached is that there was a serious shortage \nand diminution of basic character among the American people which was \nfrightening, and in particular they were frightened about what was \nhappening to young people, who did not seem to have any values nor any \nidea of what character was all about.\n  The conclusion of the declaration was that we should promote across \nAmerica what is now known as ``the six pillars of character.'' There \nare many organizations and many institutions who are looking at \ncharacter building.\n  We chose here in the Senate to pass a resolution 2 years ago--and it \nhas been done 2 years in a row--asking Americans to recognize for 1 \nweek in October a week promoting Character Counts. While for many of us \nwe have gone further, there are no laws to be passed. This is not a \nlegislative function. But many of us have chosen to exercise our \nleadership in conjunction with others to establish in our communities, \nor our States, the idea that a community and the schools should be part \nof promoting Character Counts.\n  There are six pillars of character, the six words that are being used \nacross this land, in our schools, in businesses, in institutions like \nthe YMCA, and myriad organizations: ``Trustworthiness,'' that is a root \nword that carries with it such things as honesty, integrity, living up \nto your commitments; and the words respect, responsibility, fairness, \ncaring, and citizenship.\n  While the ultimate goal of these six principles is being celebrated \nin parts of America, it is catching on and taking hold more than \nanywhere else in the schools of America. I will just tell you, Mr. \nPresident, in New Mexico, on a volunteer basis, without a mandate, we \nnow have 11 communities and 2 counties that have adopted Character \nCounts as community goals with an emphasis on the six pillars.\n  I say to my friend who will speak soon, who is an advocate of \nCharacter Counts, there are now scores of public schools in New Mexico. \nYou can tell whether they are a Character Counts school because if you \ndrive by and if they have anything out front that indicates messages \nabout the school, you will find on that message board the character of \nthe month, and you will see up there ``responsibility.'' You can then \nfind out and be assured that if you attended that public school for \nthat month in all the classes, be it math, English, geography, or \nwhatever it is in the grade schools, you will find teachers have been \nempowered to insert into the classroom that word ``responsibility.''\n  It is a marvel to observe, to go to a school and talk with the \nteachers who have been empowered on a volunteer basis to promote as \npart of their education mission character and the six pillars of \ncharacter. There are innovative ways of involvement that are occurring, \nbut let me suggest that we have not yet received in my State and a few \nStates I have visited, any objections from the adult community to \npromoting these six pillars of character.\n  Now, is there going to be an objection raised to trying to define \n``trustworthiness'' and get it across to our young people? Is there \ngoing to be an adult objection to ``respect,'' to ``responsibility,'' \nto ``fairness,'' to ``caring,'' to ``citizenship''? We have found \nnothing.\n  So what we have done by using the Aspen Declaration and the current \nidea of six pillars of character is to open the window and let into our \npublic schools, if they want to, on a volunteer basis, principal by \nprincipal, empower our teachers to bring into the classroom some very \nfundamental things that most Americans are excited to think about. \nThere is much being said about anxiety in the current political \ncampaign, and I submit there may very well be the anxiety spoken of \nabout jobs and whether or not jobs are in jeopardy because of a \nchanging American economy, but there is another anxiety that is very \nbig and very powerful, and it is the anxiety of adults over what is \ngoing to happen to our children if somehow or another values or pillars \nof character are not brought into their lives to compete with the \nbombardment of ideas coming from whatever source young people are \ncurrently subject to, from television to what they see and what they \nread. And ultimately in a State like mine, we have concluded that you \nneed to bring adults and kids together and you need to have adults \nconcerned about the same six pillars of character which I have repeated \nnow several times in this Chamber.\n  In our State, it is contagious. Teachers have gone to classes to get \nthe basic principles of how you promote these in the classroom. They \nhave been given that education free by various groups that have raised \nmoney. They have all committed to teach another teacher. And the work, \nhow they put this together, is beginning to evolve with little \ndirection from the national organization which is more like an \numbrella. This is all going to be done locally by schoolteachers and \nprincipals and boards of education and business leaders who want to \nchange the character of the community. It is exciting. It is not the \nanswer to everything, but it is a start. I am certain the Senate and \nthe House will once again declare the week as Character Counts Week, \nbut it is more interesting to note that from that seed a few years ago, \na number of Senators and Congressmen have decided to work with mayors \nand Governors to begin to promote not 1 week but all year long, not 1 \nday but every day in the classrooms of our schools one of these pillars \nof character to be brought into the common language of the children and \ntheir daily experience. The innovativeness of teachers who are \nempowered to do this is absolutely magnificent. They are out there with \nnew and better ideas on how to instill such a thing as responsibility \nin young people, or such a character trait as fairness, or such a \nquality as trustworthiness. It is truly exciting.\n  Actually, in our State, in the city of Albuquerque and its public \nschool system, the largest in the State by far, it has been approved by \nthe board of education and they say any principal and school that wants \nto do it, do it. We have gone down to two other areas next in size, the \ncounty where the principal city is Las Cruces and they are starting it, \nin the county of Dona Ana. The adults get together from all walks of \nlife under our format and start a council. The schools are then \ninvolved, the churches are involved, and other organizations.\n  I do not want to overstate the case because this is a complicated \nworld that our young people are being raised in. It is a fearsome and \nfrightening world for young people. Some around here know I raised a \nvery large number of children. I have eight, the youngest of which, \ntwins, are 28. I am quick to say to groups that they would have a very \ndifficult time today, much more difficult today than even 15 years ago. \nThe pressures are enormous.\n  This Character Counts idea, this idea of promoting the six pillars \nand getting them out there as a buttress to the disorder that is around \nour children, is exciting. There are many comparable things occurring, \nand by these comments I do not mean to belittle any others. But it \nworks. Character Counts education works.\n  As experience has shown in my home state, New Mexico, character \neducation can be embraced by the young and old and the public and \nprivate sectors in a way that transcends political, cultural, \nreligious, and socioeconomic differences. Because like our Federal \ndeficit, what I would call a national ``character deficit,'' transcends \nall differences. And, as I know we can and must bring our Federal books \ninto balance, we can and should work to end \n\n[[Page S1391]]\nour national character deficit, especially among our younger citizens.\n  In New Mexico, I am proud to say that Character Counts is growing by \nleaps and bounds. The State of New Mexico received one of the four \ngrants from the Department of Education to States to develop character \neducation pilot programs. This pilot program came about as a result of \nan amendment we offered last year to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and I thank my good friend and colleague Senator Dodd \nfor his assistance in helping pass this amendment. The communities of \nNew Mexico want character education and they have brought it into their \nschools, local social and civic organizations, city governments, \nchurches, and parent-teacher organizations to develop Character Counts \ncommunity programs.\n  There are 11 cities and 2 entire counties who have adopted the \nprogram, with 3 more on-line to start-up in a few months. These efforts \nconsist of leadership councils that develop programs that encompass \nevery aspect of community life to reinforce the Character Counts \nmessage. The schools develop their curriculums to accommodate character \ntraining in each class; there are billboards on the streets that \nproclaim the support and importance of the program; there are public \nevents to raise money to support the programs; and there are media \nevents to publicize the programs. Let me cite just a few examples of \nactivities in New Mexico. I just received a letter from the University \nof New Mexico's Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of their letter be printed at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Department has many plans to emphasize the \nCharacter Counts Program by promoting the messages on the university \narena message boards for the men's and women's basketball games, \nputting the message on marquee boards on our major highways, and \nthrough public address announcements at the basketball, baseball, and \nsoftball games.\n\n  A letter from Janice Argabright, the teaching principal of the San \nAntonio Elementary School, who said:\n\n       We stress a family atmosphere at our school where we all \n     help each other. Many of our students are farm/ranch kids, \n     who have many chores to do after school. We would like to \n     continue to instill these values. We recently began the \n     Character Counts Program in our school. The parents and \n     students applauded this action. Our Social Studies teacher \n     has been going over the six fundamental core elements of good \n     character. In fact, the students do character analysis on \n     certain prominent people and TV role models. They found out \n     that Bart Simpson isn't so cool after all.\n\n  Moreover, the San Antonio Elementary School incorporated this \nCharacter Counts in the DARE program and as the principal said, the \nstudents saw the words every day and practiced them and they came to \n``understand the meanings and the traits that show a person of \ncharacter.'' As an attachment to the letter, the students signed an \ninvitation to come visit their Character Counts Program, even though \nthey knew I was very busy in Washington, DC. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The ethics officer for the Sandia Laboratory in New \nMexico, John Dickey, sent out a message to the employees seeking \nvolunteers who are interested in introducing Character Counts to kids \nages 2 to 12 in their churches, social clubs, and community activities. \nWithin 48 hours, Mr. Dickey received 36 responses from employees who \noffered their help.\n  The Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development held its \nState conference for educators in Las Cruces. The theme of the meeting \nwas ``Character Education for Entire Communities.'' And, the New Mexico \nState Education Department is conducting character education and \nCharacter Counts in a series of four 1-day workshops throughout the \nState.\n  The Albuquerque public school system is instituting middle school \nathletic programs. Character Counts is being used as the underlying \nbasis for this citywide athletic program as coaches and referees are \nhired and players recruited. The Character Counts logo will be \ndisplayed on the sports uniforms.\n  Terry Linton of the State Referees Association instituted a \n``Character Counts Code of Conduct'' for players, parents, coaches, and \nreferees. This code will be instituted into the local soccer and little \nleagues.\n  Last year, Character Counts in Chavez County, NM, was featured on a \nnationally televised program with Peter Jennings entitled ``Children \nFirst--Real Solutions for Real Problems.'' As a result of the \noutstanding success of the Roswell and Chavez County efforts, over \n1,000 telephone calls flooded into my local office from all over the \ncountry and Canada about how to set up a communitywide Character Counts \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, Character Counts in New Mexico is a statewide and \ncommunitywide effort. This is a program that has unbelievable energy \nbecause everyone that hears about it believes in it and wants to make \nit work. This is a program for our children with thousands of committed \nadults working to make it a reality. This is the best example of \ngrassroots dedication and participation I have seen in many years.\n  As in the past years, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring \nand passing National Character Counts Week. It supports America's \nchildren, families, and the entire community. It is one of the best \nthings we can do to encourage and promote something that is good and \nright.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                            Lobos,\n\n\n                                 The University of New Mexico,\n\n                               Albuquerque, NM, February 21, 1996.\n     Marty Wilson,\n     APS Coordinator for Character Education, Albuquerque Public \n         Schools, Albuquerque, NM.\n       Dear Marty: I am pleased to inform you that the University \n     of New Mexico Department of Athletics is extremely excited \n     and willing to help promote the Character Counts program. In \n     response to your request for our participation, the \n     Department of Athletics, as of February 13, 1996, is \n     supporting this program by running messages on the following \n     advertising/promotional vehicles:\n       (1) University Arena Message Boards (UNM Men's & Women's \n     basketball games).\n       (2) Marquee Board on University & Stadium Boulevards.\n       We are also mentioning this program through public address \n     announcements at:\n       (1) UNM Men's basketball games.\n       (2) UNM Women's basketball games.\n       (3) UNM Men's baseball games.\n       (4) UNM Women's softball games.\n       This is a tremendous program that we are pleased to support \n     and we hope our efforts will help to communicate the message \n     of the Character Counts program within our community. Please \n     contact me if there is any way we can help to further promote \n     this program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Sean Johnson,\n\n                                     Assistant Marketing Director,\n     UNM Athletic Department.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                San Antonio Elementary School,\n\n                                                  San Antonio, NM.\n     Senator Pete Domenici,\n     Sunbelt Plaza Complex,\n     Las Cruces, NM.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: San Antonio Elementary is a small \n     rural school located in San Antonio, New Mexico, about 75 \n     miles South of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The population of our \n     school averages about 80 students, Kindergarten thru Fifth \n     Grade. We stress a family atmosphere at our school, where we \n     all help each other. (You visited our school about 8 or 9 \n     years ago). Many of our students are farm/ranch kids, who \n     have many chores to do after school. The community of San \n     Antonio still believes in the ``family''. We would like to \n     continue to instill these values. We recently began the \n     Character Counts Programs in our school. The parents and \n     students applauded this action. Our Social Studies teacher \n     has been going over the six fundamental core elements of good \n     character. In fact, the students do character analysis on \n     certain prominent people and T.V. role models. (They found \n     out that Bart Simpson isn't so cool after all).\n       Our school emphasizes the good in all. We try to build \n     self-esteem in each student. We do this through different \n     programs, like the D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) \n     program. The students have even painted pillars with the 6 \n     core elements--Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, \n     Fairness, Caring and Citizenship in our hallway. The students \n     thought that if they saw the words everyday, they would \n     practice them. They have come to understand the meanings and \n     the traits that show a person of character.\n       We would very much like to have you visit our school in the \n     near future to foster Character Development in our students. \n     It would \n\n[[Page S1392]]\n     mean so much to them to have someone in your position visit. It would \n     also be nice to have a representative from the Character \n     Counts Coalition visit. I read a while back that Tom Selleck \n     visited an Albuquerque Elementary school with you. San \n     Antonio Elementary School is just as important!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Janice Argabright.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Mexico for \nthe substantial amount of leadership he has provided on Character \nCounts for some long while now.\n  I had a friend ask me, ``What province is it of the Senate to be \nteaching about pillars of character? That is not the job of the \nSenate.'' I said, ``No, that is not the job of the Senate. It is the \njob of everyone in this country. Every single American, especially \nevery single American parent, ought to be preaching the pillars of good \ncharacter.''\n  I have a couple of young children, so I know firsthand how difficult \nit is for children to navigate through the influences of today's \npopular culture, trying to understand what is right and what is wrong. \nAnd there is nothing that is more important to children than example, \nthe example set by their parents, the example of their neighbors, their \ncommunity, their churches, and so on. Sadly, the evidence is all around \nus that our children apparently do not have the good examples they \nneed. There is coarser language. There is more violence. There is more \ntruancy. There seems to be less respect.\n\n  I am not going to describe all of the villains that cause that. Much \nof it is, I assume, caused by a lack of attention at home and a lack of \ngood example. George Will wrote a column this past Sunday, titled \n``With `Friends' Like These . . .'', in which he described the dialog \non the popular Thursday evening show ``Friends,'' which is shown at a \ntime when children are watching. I ask you, look at the language in \nthis television show and then ask yourself, what is a 12-year-old or \n14-year-old to make of popular culture that sends them these messages?\n  I wrote a letter in October to the president of a television network \nin America. I was prompted to write because, the night before, our \ntelevision had been tuned in to the most popular sitcom. During that \ntelevision program, which showed at 9 o'clock here in Washington, but \nat 8 o'clock in my home State of North Dakota, when presumably a lot of \nchildren would be watching, they used the full word that is abbreviated \nby SOB 12 times during the half-hour program.\n  I was so angry about this that I wrote to the president of the \nnetwork and received a letter back from him; I wrote back and received \nanother letter, and I have since talked to the president twice at \nvarious meetings. I asked him, by what standard do you decide to send \nthis into living rooms across the country at a time when children are \nwatching television? What has happened that says to us that it is all \nright to entertain adults even if it hurts our kids?\n  I have been more interested in television violence and in fact, I \nhave introduced legislation along with the Senator from Texas, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, to address this problem. But I am also concerned \nabout language and other things, especially on television, that say to \nour children that it is all right to be a smart aleck and all right not \nto be respectful and all right to use this kind of language.\n  I worry a lot about that. So I simply say what all of us are saying \nwith this resolution, that character does count. Those organizations \nthat are involved in the Character Counts effort have taken the Aspen \nDeclaration and said, here are the pillars of character that should be \nvalued in our country. We want everyone in our country--parents, \nteachers, churches, business leaders--to be working to try to teach \nthese pillars of good character.\n  Those who say that this is not the Government's job are right, this \nis everybody's job. This effort is not about legislation. It is not \nabout creating rules. It is not about saying to anyone, ``Here is what \nthe Government thinks.'' It is about encouraging the teaching by \neveryone of the pillars of good character.\n  The Senator from New Mexico described what those pillars of good \ncharacter are. But let me just mention them again because I do not \nthink we can mention them often enough--trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  Over the last 30, 40, 50 years things have changed a lot. Kids in \nAmerica used to watch ``Leave It To Beaver'' on television. Now it is \n``Beavis and Butthead.'' Compare the contents of these two programs and \nask yourself, what are our children listening to? What kinds of things \nare they seeing? What are they learning about the way adults act and \nthink and behave? And then ask yourself, is there not a reason for all \nof us to want to support and welcome the efforts of the Senator from \nNew Mexico and the many groups that are promoting the teaching of the \npillars of good character?\n  This effort asks parents and teachers and everyone in this country to \ncare a little more about what our kids are hearing and seeing and to \nsuggest to school leaders and others that teaching the pillars of good \ncharacter will build a better country.\n  Mr. President, I know there are others who want to cosponsor this \nresolution. And I will end as I began by thanking the Senator from New \nMexico for providing leadership on this issue here in Congress. But the \nissue did not start here. The issue started with some thinkers and some \nconcerned people around this country who got together and evaluated the \nproblem, and developed a solution in which we to try to create and \nnurture an environment for teaching the pillars of good character. Let \nme congratulate all of these leaders and pledge my support and \ncontinued work to further their efforts.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico and a bipartisan group of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this Senate resolution designating October 13-19 as \nNational Character Counts Week.\n  This morning, like every morning before it and every morning to come, \nyoung Americans are headed off to learn their three R's--reading, \nwriting, and arithmetic--in our Nation's schools. But as we know, the \nschool day involves more than just the transmission of facts or the \nrelaying of concepts. It's also about character. In the best classrooms \nin America our children are given the opportunity to learn and practice \nbasic character traits such as sharing, cooperation, and respect.\n  The Character Counts initiative calls on all Americans to embrace the \ndevelopment of six attributes--trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship--as a fundamental aspect \nof our children's education and as a critically important means of \nstrengthening our Nation. The lessons our young people learn as \nchildren are the ones that will stay with them the rest of their lives. \nAs Eleanor Roosevelt once said: ``Character building begins in our \ninfancy, and continues until death.''\n  We live in a time when teenage pregnancy and juvenile crime are \nspiraling out of control. A recent poll suggests that two-thirds of \nAmericans believe most people can't be trusted, half say most people \nwould cheat others if they could and in the end are only looking out \nfor themselves. These statistics and the seeming erosion in the basic \nnorms of civility, even among our Nation's children, are ample evidence \nof the need for programs that promote character development.\n  No one would argue that Character Counts is a panacea for these \ncomplex problems. First and foremost, we need better education, \nstronger families, and healthy doses of individual responsibility.\n  Clearly the primary obligation for the building of our children's \nvalues and belief systems lies with our Nation's families. There is \nonly so much government can do. But, with parents being forced to spend \nmore and more time out of the house, our Nation's schools can and \nshould play a positive role in helping to build character among \nAmerica's children.\n  There is nothing inappropriate or heavy-handed about teaching \ncharacter in our schools. These programs don't impose morality or any \none group's world view. These programs teach honesty, courage, respect, \nresponsibility, caring, citizenship, and loyalty, attributes that I \nbelieve all Americans agree upon.\n  These principles transcend religion, race, philosophy, and even \npolitical affiliation. For those Americans who \n\n[[Page S1393]]\nshare the goal of energizing our democracy and strengthening our \nNation's character these initiatives are simply common sense.\n  What's more, these programs garner tangible benefits. In Connecticut, \nthe Southwest Elementary School in Torrington implemented a character \neducation program in September and has already seen positive results \nfrom its students. Attendance is up, students are more respectful \ntoward their teachers and school administrators are convinced that \nCharacter Counts is responsible. The school engages parents in the \neffort, who along with educators and the students themselves, love the \nprogram.\n  While character education may not be a magical solution to all \nAmerica's problems, it represents a positive effort to make a real \ndifference in our children's lives. Character development programs for \nour children strengthen our lives, our communities, and our Nation as a \nwhole.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for all of his work \nin this area. And I invite all my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to join us in supporting character education as a vital means of \nmolding better individuals, strengthening families, and creating a \nresponsible American citizenry.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, both \nRepublican and Democrat--and especially Senator Domenici--in submitting \nthis year's resolution to designate the week of October 13 through 19 \nas Character Counts Week.\n  The Character Counts Coalition is gaining momentum across the \ncountry, and I am proud to be a part of that effort.\n  With core members such as the American Red Cross and the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, Character Counts now includes over 80 member \norganizations whose efforts are reaching more than 40 million children, \neducators, and youth development professionals.\n  Mr. President, the Character Counts movement--which emphasizes \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship--seeks to teach the core elements of good character to our \nNation's young people.\n  In today's world of widespread abortion, rape, divorce, illegitimate \nbirths, and violent crime, such a movement has never been more timely.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, many citizens have joined the call for \ncharacter renewal.\n  In the Franklin and Bradley County school systems, my friend, Mr. \nSkeet Rymer, has responded the Lessons of Life essay program, based on \na model developed by Mr. John Templeton of the Templeton Foundation.\n  In that program, students write essays examining their own lessons of \nlife, and develop values that will lead them to fulfilled and \nproductive lives.\n  Reactions from teachers and school board members, such as Lois \nTaylor, show just how important this program is. She tells us that \nthrough the essay contest, students learn to identify their own values \nand to lay the foundation for good choices throughout their lives.\n  Another teacher, Janis Collins says, ``I just can't sing the \nprogram's praises enough.'' The Templeton Lessons of Life Essay \nScholarship contest is just one example of the conscientious effort \nTennesseeans are making to educate young people on the importance of \nmoral decisionmaking and conduct.\n  Mr. President, I also want to commend the city of Greeneville, TN, \nwhich has put together a character education program featuring 10 \ncommunity virtues: self-respect, respect for others, perseverance, \ncourtesy, fairness and justice, responsibility, honesty, kindness, \nself-discipline, and courage.\n  Greeneville's character education team--concerned teachers, \nprincipals, parents, ministers, school psychologists, and education \nboard members--asked themselves what kind of qualities they would like \ntheir students to have, and they have volunteered their time to make \nsure these characteristics are nourished.\n  I think that the good people of Greeneville have shown the kind of \ncharacter--the kind of selfless giving--of which America needs so much \nmore.\n  Mr. President, Tennesseeans have joined the national effort to save \nour children from the moral decay we see all around us because they \nrecognize that the only way to preserve this great democracy--this \nsystem that requires so much from each of us--and our American way of \nlife, is to instill virtue and moral fortitude in the next generation \nof Americans.\n  This will not happen without our effort, and without the incredible \nleadership of movements like Character Counts. Again, I commend Senator \nDomenici, and all those who are working so hard, to make character \ncount once again in the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1388-6", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 227--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED FROM THE COMMITTEE \n                 ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO, from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, reported the following original resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I have long been active in issues \nof importance for individuals suffering from a mental illness or \ndisability. Through my efforts in this area, I have become familiar \nwith the vast spectrum of these disorders, and I have found that we as \na society have much to learn about both the causes and cures for these \nillnesses. Knowledge of the medical conditions underpinning these \ndisorders has only recently begun to make progress by leaps and bounds, \nand I fear that public awareness and knowledge has not grown in step. \nBecause society is still unfamiliar with these advances, an aura of \nfear and suspicion persists with regard to any one of the illnesses or \ndisorders which afflict so many Americans. It is because of this \nwidespread lack of knowledge and understanding that I rise today in \nrecognition of the Autism Society of America's designation of January \nas ``National Autism Awareness Month.''\n  Autism is a neurological disorder that interrupts the brain's ability \nto process and understand information. Nearly 400,000 Americans suffer \nfrom this disorder, making it more prevalent than Down's syndrome or \nmuscular dystrophy.\n  Autism is a complex, spectrum disorder that manifests itself in many \nways. Symptoms and characteristics present themselves in a variety of \ncombinations, and no two children or adults are affected in the same \nway.\n  Autism is not curable, but it is treatable. Many types of treatments \nhave proven effective in combating this disorder, and improvements are \nbeing discovered every day.\n  A generation ago, nearly 90 percent of those suffering from autism \nwere placed in an institution. Today, group homes, assisted living \narrangements, and home care are much more common. Thanks to the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, many children with autism \nreceive appropriate education and go on to become contributing members \nof the work force.\n  In April 1995, in response to direction from Congress, the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH] held a State-of-the-Sciences Conference on \nAutism. Conference participants included scientists, clinicians, and \nparents. The conference highlighted how far we have come in diagnosing \nand treating autism, but also illuminated how far we have yet to go. \nNational Autism Awareness Month is designed to bring attention to these \nissues, and seeks to further the Nation's understanding of this \ncomplicated and debilitating disorder. I fully support the Autism \nSociety of America's designation of January as National Autism \nAwareness Month, I share their goal of teaching America more about this \ndisorder, and I welcome my colleagues' support as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1394-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1394-S1395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AID'S INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, about a month ago when we passed \nthe last continuing resolution, I spoke about the damage a provision \nincluded in the CR by the House of Representatives would cause to our \ninternational family planning programs. Senator Hatfield, the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, also spoke at that time. We both \nexpressed real concerns about what the House had done, and the effect \nit would have on the lives of millions of couples around the world \nespecially women.\n  We also pointed out that the House had essentially handed us a fait \naccompli, since it recessed immediately thereafter and our only \nalternative to passing what they sent us in the form they sent it was \nto close down the Federal Government again. We passed the CR under \nprotest, and I have been very encouraged by the strong stand the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee has taken on this issue. He \nhas always been a strong opponent of abortion, but he has also \nsupported family planning and has made the point as eloquently as \nanyone that the way to reduce the number of abortions is to give \ncouples the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n  I am not going to repeat all that I said back then. Suffice it to say \nthat as a result of the House action, millions of couples will be \ndenied family planning services, including contraceptives, who want \nthem, need them, and have no other access to them. It does not take a \ngenius to realize that the result will be many more unwanted \npregnancies, and many more abortions. In the countries where these \nfamily planning programs are carried out, abortion is often unsafe and \nthe incidence of maternal death is alarmingly high.\n  I cannot believe that was the intent of the authors of the House \nprovision, but how they could have failed to anticipate that result is \nbeyond me. I can only conclude that they do not want the U.S. \nGovernment to provide assistance to couples who want to limit their \nnumber of children, even though these people want the assistance and \nmany of them live in countries where millions of people go hungry each \nday.\n  A February 16, 1996, article in the Baltimore Sun made this same \npoint. Not only does it discuss the steps AID Administrator Atwood has \ntaken to improve efficiency at his agency, it notes that Congress \nrewarded him by cutting several hundreds of millions of dollars in \nAID's budget, cuts that I opposed. It cites the example of AID's family \nplanning program, and points out that what the House has done will not \nonly hurt mothers and infants, it will increase the very redtape \nCongress has been urging AID to cut.\n  As the article indicates, once again ideology won out over common \nsense. That seems to be a recurring theme around here.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 16, 1996]\n\n            AID Learns That Good Deeds Do Not Go Unpunished\n\n                            (By Sara Engram)\n\n       When the Clinton Administration preached ``reinvention'' of \n     government the State Department's Agency for International \n     Development (AID) heeded the call.\n       Along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, AID \n     became one of two federal ``reinvention laboratories'' where \n     all the talk about more efficient more effective and less \n     costly management turned into reality.\n       AID has shed some 70 senior level positions, each paying \n     about $100,000 a year. It \n\n[[Page S1395]]\n     has slimmed total staffing levels by 16 percent--from 10,800 people to \n     9,050. It has cut regulations by 55 percent, cut the time it \n     takes to award competitive contracts from a year to 150 days, \n     cut project-design time by 75 percent and overhauled its \n     program operations, procurement, accounting and budget \n     procedures.\n\n\n                        Virtue is its own reward\n\n       And what thanks does it get for doing more with less?\n       A whopping budget cut, along with potentially devastating \n     restrictions on some programs.\n       The saga of the 1996 AID budget is one of the grimmer tales \n     of the budget stand-off. The agency never expected an easy \n     ride, given the Republican-controlled Congress' zeal for \n     slashing the budget and the difficulty of defending aid to \n     other countries when we have plenty of poor, homeless and \n     hungry people right here at home.\n       But the fact is that foreign aid is crucial to advancing \n     U.S. interests around the globe and to making the world a \n     safer place. From nurturing economic activity that raises \n     living standards and slows the rate of illegal immigration, \n     to helping emerging democracies set up a system of law, to \n     providing medical care and family-planning assistance to \n     countries with burgeoning birth rates and high rates of \n     infant and maternal mortality--the agency's programs plant \n     seeds that, eventually, can help forestall political unrest \n     or hostilities that spill over into wider wars.\n\n\n                               tiny share\n\n       Foreign aid is a tiny share of the budget--less than 3 \n     percent (1.2%), and AID gets only a sixth of that. But a \n     recent poll showed an alarming number of Americans assumed \n     that the government spent more on foreign aid than on \n     Medicare.\n       Under the compromise finally reached by the Congress and \n     the White House, the agency's budget will be cut 11 percent. \n     Since some aid programs, such as assistance to Egypt and \n     Israel, must hold relatively steady, other programs took an \n     especially hard hit.\n       None, however, got the shabby treatment reserved for family \n     planning assistance. Those programs, a favorite target of a \n     small House group of zealous opponents of abortion and \n     family-planning, were cut 35 percent, a loss of more than \n     $200 million from 1995 funding levels. Even worse, these \n     opponents succeeded in requiring that no funds for 1996 be \n     spent before July 1--and then that the allocation be dribbled \n     out in 15 monthly increments, most of which would come, \n     absurdly, after the end of the year for which the money is \n     appropriated.\n       Since the budget impasse had blocked expenditures after \n     October 1, that requirement creates a nine-month gap--an \n     ironic length--in U.S. aid for family-planning services for \n     some of the poorest families in the world. Clearly, the \n     restrictions are aimed at interrupting these programs, many \n     of which are administered by private, non-profit \n     organizations in countries receiving the aid.\n\n\n                          defeat for families\n\n       The victory for ideology is a clear defeat for tens of \n     thousands of families who, as a consequence, will experience \n     higher rates of unplanned pregnancies and more deaths among \n     mothers and infants. Pregnancy is a high-risk undertaking in \n     countries where nutrition is poor and health care is \n     unaccessible or primitive.\n       It's also a defeat for efficient government--and an \n     illustration of how Congress can talk one game and play \n     another. Despite its calls for effective government, Congress \n     can't resist an ideological power play. What else explains a \n     requirement that must have been dreamed up in red-tape \n     heaven?\n       Instead of one, clean transaction, we'll now have 15 checks \n     and 15 contracts for a program that is underfunded to begin \n     with. Reinventing government? The bureaucrats are hearing the \n     message. It's the ideologues who, it seems, couldn't care \n     less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1394-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1395-S1397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECRETARY PERRY'S WEHRKUNDE ADDRESS\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, earlier this month, I again had the \nhonor of leading the U.S. delegation to the annual Wehrkunde conference \non security policy in Munich. This conference serves as a valuable \nopportunity for policymakers, security analysts, and defense industry \nleaders from both sides of the Atlantic to exchange views on pressing \nEuropean security issues and to build the relationships that are the \nsinews of an alliance.\n  This year's conference was notable both because it was held as NATO \nforces were breaking new ground with the IFOR mission in Bosnia and for \nthe participation of senior officials from Central Europe and Russia, \nincluding the Russian Deputy Defense Minister, which provided for \nproductive, if sometimes heated, dialog on NATO enlargement.\n  The conference thus offered an appropriate setting for a speech by \nSecretary of Defense Perry in which he outlined a vision for the future \nof the Atlantic alliance and its relationship with Russia, based on the \naccomplishments of the past and the current cooperation in Bosnia. \nSecretary Perry is to be commended for laying out a thoughtful and \nchallenging agenda for addressing the issues currently facing the \nAlliance. I also want to commend him for not only weaving the words of \nT.S. Eliot into his remarks, but for ferreting out the little known \nfact that Eliot was on the stage half a century ago when George \nMarshall gave the speech that became the Marshall plan.\n  Mr. President, I think all Senators would benefit from reading \nSecretary Perry's Wehrkunde address and ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The address follows:\n\n            Remarks by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry\n\n       Behind my desk at the Pentagon hangs a portrait of the \n     great statesman, George C. Marshall. Marshall, who was the \n     third Secretary of Defense in the United States, is a role \n     model of mine. He had a great vision for Europe--a Europe \n     which from the Atlantic to the Urals was united in peace, \n     freedom and democracy; and a strong trans-Atlantic \n     partnership sustained by bipartisan political support in the \n     United States.\n       Marshall not only had this vision, he also had a plan to \n     make this vision a reality in post-war Europe. And in a \n     famous speech at Harvard University in 1947, he outlined what \n     came to be called the Marshall Plan.\n       A little known fact is that joining Marshall on the dais \n     that day was the famous poet, T.S. Eliot, who 10 years \n     earlier had written:\n\n     Footfalls echo in the memory\n     Down the passage we did not take\n     Towards the door we never opened.\n\n       These words by T.S. Eliot foreshadowed the fate of \n     Marshall's plan in Eastern and Central Europe. Because on \n     that day, 50 years ago, as the footfalls of World War II \n     still echoed across a shattered continent, the Marshall Plan \n     offered Europe a new passage toward reconstruction and \n     renewal. Half of Europe took this passage, and opened the \n     door to prosperity and freedom. Half of Europe was denied \n     this passage when Joseph Stalin slammed the door on \n     Marshall's offer. And for 50 years, the footfalls of what \n     might have been echoed in our memories.\n       Today, as the Cold War becomes an echo in our memory, we \n     have a second chance to make Marshall's vision a reality: To \n     go down the passage we did not take 50 years ago, towards the \n     door we never opened. Behind that door lies George Marshall's \n     Europe. To open this door, we do not need a second Marshall \n     Plan, but we do need to draw on Marshall's vision.\n       Marshall recognized that peace, democracy and prosperity \n     were ultimately inseparable. And Marshall understood that if \n     you identify what people desire most, and provide them with a \n     path to reach it, then they will do the hard work necessary \n     to achieve their goals.\n       In the late 1940s what Western European countries desired \n     most was to rebuild their societies and economies. And the \n     Marshall Plan provided a path for achieving this goal. By \n     taking this passage, the nations of Western Europe built an \n     economic powerhouse. And along the way, they built strong \n     democracies and a strong security institution called NATO.\n       Today, countries in the other half of Europe are struggling \n     to rebuild their societies and economies, and the one thing \n     they all desire is greater security. NATO's challenge is to \n     provide these Europeans a path for achieving their security \n     goal. And along the way, we want them very much to develop \n     strong democracies and strong economies.\n       This other half of Europe includes the nations of Central \n     and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States. It \n     includes Russia. And it includes the nations of the former \n     Yugoslavia. Today, NATO is reaching out to all three areas \n     and providing a path to Marshall's Europe.\n       The primary path NATO has provided is the Partnership for \n     Peace. Just as the Marshall Plan worked because it was rooted \n     firmly in the self-interest of both the United States and \n     Europe, so too does the Partnership for Peace work because it \n     is rooted firmly in the self-interest of both NATO and the \n     Partner nations.\n       PFP is bringing the newly free nations of Europe and the \n     former Soviet Union into the security architecture of Europe \n     as a whole. Our nations are working and training together in \n     military joint exercises. But make no mistake, the \n     Partnership for Peace is more than just joint exercises. Just \n     as the Marshall Plan had an impact well beyond the economies \n     of Western Europe, PFP is echoing beyond the security realm \n     in Central and Eastern Europe, and into the political and \n     economic realms as well.\n       Just as the Marshall Plan used economic revival as the \n     catalyst for political stabilization--and ultimately the \n     development of the modern Europe--the PFP uses security \n     cooperation as a catalyst for political and economic reform.\n       PFP members are working to uphold democracy, tolerate \n     diversity, respect the rights of minorities and respect \n     freedom of expression. They are working to build market \n     economies. They are working hard to develop democratic \n     control of their military forces, to be good neighbors and \n     respect the sovereign rights outside their borders. And they \n     are working hard to make their military forces compatible \n     with NATO. \n     \n[[Page S1396]]\n\n       For those Partner countries that are embracing PFP as a \n     passage to NATO membership, these actions are a key to \n     opening that door. For many of these nations, aspiration to \n     NATO membership has become the rock on which all major \n     political parties base their platforms. It is providing the \n     same overlapping consensus that NATO membership engenders in \n     NATO countries, making compromise and reconciliation \n     possible.\n       In Hungary, all six major political parties in the \n     Parliament united to pass a resolution in support of IFOR, \n     the Bosnia peace implementation force, by a vote of 300 to 1. \n     In Poland, the new President--a former member of the former \n     communist party--re-affirmed Poland's NATO aspirations. In \n     Slovakia, Hungary and Rumania, governments are quietly \n     resolving border disputes, and putting into place protection \n     for ethnic minorities. For these countries, the Partnership \n     for Peace is becoming a passage to democracy and market \n     reform, as well as a passage to security cooperation with the \n     West.\n       But even those countries that do not aspire to NATO \n     membership are realizing many of the same political and \n     social gains from active participation in the PFP. Moreover, \n     PFP is providing them the tools and the opportunities to \n     develop closer ties to NATO, and learn from NATO--even as \n     they choose to remain outside the Alliance. And PFP is \n     building bonds among the Partner nations--even outside the \n     framework of cooperation with NATO.\n       That is why defense ministers from many Partner nations \n     have said to me that even if, or when, they eventually join \n     NATO, they want to sustain their active participation in PFP. \n     In short, by creating the Partnership For Peace, NATO is \n     doing more than just building the basis for enlargement. It, \n     is in fact, creating a new zone of security and stability \n     throughout Europe.\n       That is why I believe that the creation of the Partnership \n     for Peace has been one of the most significant events of the \n     post-Cold War era. By forging networks of people and \n     institutions working together to preserve freedom, promote \n     democracy and build free markets, the PFP today is a catalyst \n     for transforming Central and Eastern Europe, much as Marshall \n     Plan transformed Western Europe in the '40s and '50s. It is \n     the passage this half of Europe did not take in 1947; it is \n     the door that we never opened.\n       To lock in the gains of reform, NATO must ensure that the \n     ties we are creating in PFP continue to deepen and that we \n     actually proceed with the gradual and deliberate, but steady, \n     process of outreach and enlargement to the East. NATO \n     enlargement is inevitable. And if NATO enlargement is a \n     carrot encouraging reforms, then we cannot keep that carrot \n     continually out of reach. So it is critical that we implement \n     the second phase of NATO enlargement agreed upon at the NAC \n     Ministerial Meeting in December.\n       And even as some countries join NATO, it will be important \n     to keep the door open for others down the road. We must make \n     sure that PFP continues to provide a place in the security \n     architecture of Europe so that we keep the door open to \n     Marshall's Europe even for those nations that do not aspire \n     to become NATO members.\n       For Marshall's vision to be truly fulfilled, one of the \n     nations that must walk through this door is Russia. Russia \n     has been a key player in Europe's security for over 300 \n     years. It will remain a key player in the coming decades, for \n     better or for worse. Our job is to make it for the better.\n       Unlike with the Marshall Plan 50 years ago, Russia today \n     has chosen to participate in the Partnership for Peace. And \n     in the spirit of Marshall, we welcome Russia's participation, \n     and hope that over time it will take on a leading role in PFP \n     commensurate with its importance as a great power.\n       But for Russia to join us as a full and active partner in \n     completing Marshall's vision, NATO and Russia need to build \n     on our common ground, even when we don't agree with each \n     other's conclusions. It is fair to say that most members of \n     Russia's political establishment do not welcome or even \n     accept NATO's plans for enlargement. Anybody that doubted \n     that yesterday, if you heard Mr. Kokoshin's speech, realized \n     the extent of the opposition to NATO enlargement in Russia.\n       When I was in Russia last June, I had a number of \n     conversations with Russian government leaders and Duma \n     members about the future of European security. I offered them \n     a series of postulates about that future. I told them if I \n     were in Russia's shoes, I would want the future security \n     picture in Europe to have the following characteristics:\n       First, I said, if I were a Russian leader, I would want the \n     United States to be involved in the security of Europe. They \n     agreed with that postulate.\n       Then, I said, if I were a Russian leader, I would want to \n     see Germany an integrated part of the European security \n     structure. And they agreed with that postulate.\n       And third, I said, if I were a Russian leader, I would want \n     Russia to be in the security architecture of Europe, not \n     isolated outside of it. They agreed with this postulate also.\n       Finally, I asked them how could a Russian leader best \n     achieve these goals?\n       I concluded they could only be achieved through a healthy \n     and vibrant NATO. That is NATO, far from being a threat to \n     Russia, actually contributes to the security of Russia, as \n     well as to the security of its own members.\n       When I reached that conclusion most of the Russians I \n     talked to fell off the cliff. They agreed with each of my \n     premises--but they did not agree with my conclusion. But in \n     the absence of NATO and its partnership arrangements, I do \n     not see any way of achieving those goals--our shared goals--\n     of a safe and peaceful Europe.\n       I have to tell you that I did not persuade my Russian \n     colleagues with my argument. But, I do believe that as Russia \n     deepens its involvement with NATO, it will come to believe in \n     the truth of my conclusion, as well as my premises. And I \n     believe that Russia will want to have a cooperative relation \n     with NATO and a leading role in the Partnership for Peace. \n     And that Russia will come to understand that enlargement \n     means enlarging a zone of security and stability that is very \n     much in Russia's interest, not a threat to Russia.\n       But the way for this new understanding to occur is for NATO \n     to continue to reach out to Russia not only from the top down \n     but from the bottom up. Last year at Wehrkunde, I proposed \n     that NATO and Russia begin a separate plan of activities, \n     outside the Partnership for Peace. Since then, we have all \n     discussed and even agreed upon this proposal in principle, \n     but we have not yet put it on paper. We must do so. We cannot \n     let disagreements over the ``theology'' of building NATO-\n     Russia relations get in the way of ``here and now'' \n     opportunities to work together where our interests clearly \n     overlap. Instead of letting theology dictate our practice, we \n     should let our practice shape our theology.\n       One example of where the United States is already doing \n     this is with our program of bilateral training exercises with \n     Russia. We have held four such exercises in the last year, \n     each a great success, and each conducted in a spirit of trust \n     and goodwill. This summer, the United States and Russia will \n     move beyond the bilateral and jointly participate in a major \n     regional Partnership For Peace exercise with forces from \n     Ukraine, Russia, United States and other regional powers.\n       Our bilateral contact program with Russia is not confined \n     to joint exercises or even to just the security field. \n     Through the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, it extends to the \n     fields of science and technology, space, defense conversion, \n     business development, the environment, health care and \n     agriculture.\n       Just this past week the Commission met in Washington, and \n     Mr. Kokoshin and I both participated in the defense \n     conversion program of this Commission. I urge all NATO \n     nations to build on this model. These contacts provide \n     important exchanges of information. They help break down \n     years of distrust and suspicion. They weave the Russians into \n     the kind of personal and professional networks that have long \n     characterized relations among all of the Allies. These are \n     the kind of activities that will build trust between Russia \n     and NATO. And these are the kind of activities that will keep \n     Russia on the passage toward integration with Europe, to pass \n     through that open door.\n       Mr. Grachev and I attended the joint U.S. exercise in \n     Kansas last October. And we met after the exercise with the \n     American and the Russian soldiers conducting that exercise, \n     and talked to them. He told the Russian soldiers what they \n     were doing was very important, that they should extend their \n     friendship and cooperation with the American soldiers, and \n     that this was the basis for creating a peaceful world for \n     their children. The American soldiers were as much interested \n     in what he was saying as the Russians were, I can assure you.\n       Ironically, the place where a distinct NATO-Russia \n     relationship is occurring in practice is in Bosnia. Today, as \n     we speak, a Russian brigade is serving in the American \n     Multinational Division of IFOR. It took an enormous amount of \n     work to make this happen. Minister Grachev and I met four \n     times over a two month period to iron out the details. \n     Generals Joulwan and Nash work closely every day with their \n     counterparts, General Shevtsov and Colonel Lentsov. NATO and \n     Russia do have a special relationship today in Bosnia, and \n     Russia is demonstrating its commitment to participating in \n     the future security architecture of Europe.\n       The reason we are all working so hard to make this \n     relationship successful is not just because of the additional \n     troops Russia brings to Bosnia, but because Russia's \n     participation in Bosnia casts a very long shadow that will \n     have an impact on the security of Europe for years to come. \n     When we deal with the most important security problem which \n     Europe has faced since the Cold War was over, we want to have \n     Russia inside the circle, working with us, not outside the \n     circle, throwing rocks at us.\n       Indeed, the more you think about what NATO and Russia are \n     doing together in Bosnia, the more amazing it becomes. I can \n     only imagine what General Eisenhower, the first SACEUR, would \n     think if he saw a General from Russia sitting with General \n     Joulwan, today's SACEUR, at the SHAPE compound reviewing a \n     secret NATO OPLAN. We need to build on this model, to \n     institutionalize it, and expand it to cover the entire range \n     of NATO and Russia's overlapping security interests. By so \n     doing, NATO and Russia can move forward as full partners in \n     completing Marshall's version.\n       Just as the NATO-Russia relationship is being forged in \n     Bosnia, so too is the future of NATO itself. I was in Bosnia \n     several weeks ago. I was struck by the dedication and \n     professionalism of every unit from every country that is \n     participating. I was also struck by the stark contrast \n     between the devastation and suffering I saw in Sarajevo, and \n     the \n\n[[Page S1397]]\n     rebirth and renewal I have seen in the other capitals of Central and \n     Eastern Europe.\n       Bosnia is what happens when newly independent nations focus \n     on old hatreds instead of new challenges. Four years ago, \n     some people in the former Yugoslavia chose not to join \n     Marshall's Europe. And the death and bloodshed that resulted \n     will long echo in our memory. But today the door to \n     Marshall's Europe is open again for them--and holding that \n     door open are NATO, Russia and the newly free peoples of \n     Central and Eastern Europe.\n       The success or failure of IFOR is crucial to whether or not \n     we will complete Marshall's vision. It is in Bosnia where we \n     are sending the message that NATO is the bedrock on which the \n     future security and stability of Europe will be built. It is \n     in Bosnia where NATO is first reaping the benefits of joint \n     peacekeeping training with our new Peace Partners. It is in \n     Bosnia where future NATO members are showing themselves ready \n     and able to shoulder the burdens of membership. And it is in \n     Bosnia where we are showing that we can work as partners with \n     Russian forces. Bosnia is not a peacekeeping exercise. It is \n     the real thing.\n       Bosnia is also teaching us important lessons about the kind \n     of NATO that Marshall's Europe will require. Ever since the \n     end of the Cold War, NATO has struggled to develop a \n     mechanism for executing the new missions using NATO assets \n     with the voluntary participation of NATO members.\n       In the conference room, we have so far failed to come up \n     with an agreement on a Combined Joint Task Force, CJTF. But \n     in the field, we have cut through these theological arguments \n     and put together IFOR, which is CJTF. As with the NATO-Russia \n     relationship, we need to take the practical lessons learned \n     in putting IFOR together and extrapolate back until we have a \n     CJTF that works.\n       Bosnia also casts in sharp relief something we have \n     suspected for some time: that it is time for NATO to adapt \n     itself internally to deal with the new challenges of this new \n     era. NATO was not well structured for the Bosnia mission. At \n     a time when our political and geostrategic thinking has been \n     completely reoriented, symbolized by our partnership in \n     peacekeeping with former adversaries, and at a time when our \n     individual military forces have streamlined and modernized \n     for the battlefield of the future, NATO's command and \n     decision-making structure is still geared for the challenges \n     and the battlefields of the past. The time has come to \n     streamline and modernize NATO, recognizing that our challenge \n     is no longer simply to execute a known plan with already \n     designated forces, as it was during the Cold War.\n       We must make NATO's command structure more responsive and \n     more flexible, and streamline the planning and force \n     preparation process, and simplify and speed-up the entire \n     decision-making process. And we must complete the task of \n     giving NATO's European members a stronger identity within the \n     alliance. These kinds of internal changes will ready NATO for \n     enlargement, and will allow us to better respond to the \n     future challenges to European security and stability.\n       It is in this context that we welcome the French decision \n     to participate more fully in NATO's military bodies. And we \n     look forward to working with France as we transform the \n     Alliance and realize Marshall's vision of a Europe united in \n     peace, freedom and democracy.\n       In 1947, Marshall told America that it must ``face up to \n     the responsibility which history has placed upon our \n     country.'' Today, it is not only America, but also Russia; is \n     not only NATO nations, but all of Europe--all of us must face \n     up to the responsibility which history has placed upon us. \n     This means reaching out to each other not only in the spirit \n     of friendship, but also in the spirit of self-interest. This \n     means working towards our goals not only from the top-down, \n     but also the ground-up. And it means recognizing that when \n     the outside world changes, we must look inside our \n     institutions and see what changes are needed there.\n       If we do these things, then next year, when we commemorate \n     the 50th Anniversary of the Marshall Plan, we will be able to \n     say that we made Marshall's vision our own. That Partnership \n     for Peace is a strong, permanent pillar of Europe's security \n     architecture. That NATO and Russia have a relationship where \n     trust, understanding and cooperation are givens, not goals. \n     That all the nations of the former Yugoslavia are adding, not \n     detracting, from Europe's security. And that we have taken \n     the passage to a new Europe and opened the door to a new era \n     of peace, freedom and democracy.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/28/senate-section/article/S1395-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
