Mr. President, today we embark upon a most important \nresponsibility, a responsibility that the people of this country called \nupon us to undertake in the elections of 1994. I must say that I \nbelieve the people have been yearning that Congress confront this \nchallenge forthrightly and productively for years. But I believe that \nthe Congress has finally gotten the message, and we have been working \nvery hard to change the welfare system--to change it from a system for \nkeeping the poor and maintaining the poor. And, unfortunately, that is \nwhat we have done. We have maintained them and kept them poor through a \nsystem that should have become a transitional system, a system that \nwould help people move from poverty to prosperity, move from welfare to \nwork. And it is an important responsibility which we have.\n  The welfare system in the United States has been a system of failure. \nIt has not been that the people have failed so much as the system has \nfailed. We started out with an aggressive program in the 1960's to \nlaunch a war on poverty. And yet, in spite of the great war on poverty, \nspending over $5 trillion, we have more people in poverty now than we \ndid when we started the war on poverty. We have a greater percentage of \nthe children of America on poverty than we did when we started the war \non poverty.\n  It occurs to me that we have a great responsibility to change this \nsystem--to change it profoundly so that, instead of a system which ends \nup trapping people in lives of poverty, we make this a transitional \nsystem; that, when people really need help, we move them from the \ndesperation of needing help to the opportunity of work and \nresponsibility.\n  So this national system which has become a national disgrace is the \ntopic now of national debate, and it should be the topic of action in \nthe Senate today.\n  As you and I well know, and as our colleagues here in the Senate well \nknow, the House has already acted forthrightly in this respect. There \nare differences between what the House has passed and what those of us \nin the Senate have been working on. But we can find a way to reconcile \nour differences, and I believe we can give to the President of the \nUnited States, who has said that he wants to end welfare as we know it, \na constructive bill. \n\n[[Page S13750]]\n\n  During the past several weeks we have debated this measure, and we \nhave properly spent substantial time on it because this is no small \nitem. It does not just deal with the billions and billions of dollars. \nThe welfare problem, the welfare challenge, deals with much money. It \ndeals with the great set of natural and national resources--not just \nfinancial but human resources.\n  The fact of the matter is that the United States of America can ill \nafford to compete on the international scene, can ill afford to be a \npart of the challenge for productivity as one nation will seek to do \nand do better than another nation, if we have so many of our players \nthat are not really on the field. We would not think of sending our \nteam out to play another team for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon \nfootball game with half of our team not taking the field, not being \ncapable of participating, and being ruled out of the system. Well, our \nteam is a big team, and it is a strong team. It is a capable team in \nthe United States. But we have too many that have been consigned to \nbench duty without any possibility of making it to the field. And we \nwill not win in the competition of the international arena unless we \nfind a way to bring people into productivity and out of poverty.\n  So the real challenge we face is changing the system, and changing it \nnot just by tinkering around the edges. No rearrangement of the deck \nchairs on the welfare Titanic will get the job done. We need to have \nthe kind of profound changes that will move people out of despair into \nindustry, and out of hopelessness into opportunity.\n  So we will vote on a clear question today, and that is whether we \nwill continue to fund the horror that came to define the United States \nwelfare system and which came to detail the lives of individuals \ntrapped in this system. Whether we have the courage to change that or \nnot will be the real vote which we make today. I believe we have the \ncourage to do that which is right, and I believe we will do so. And I \nbelieve we ought to do so.\n  I would say that this is not an ideal welfare bill. This is not \nsomething that is in my judgment the best that could be done. There are \nprobably changes that almost every Member of this Chamber would make in \nthe bill. I believe that the right thing to do would have been far \nbroader, not just block granting AFDC with an option to block grant \nfood stamps. In my judgment we should have had AFDC, food stamps, \nMedicaid and Supplemental Security Income. The big four of welfare \nshould all have been in this bill, all reformed at the same time for a \nvariety of reasons, such as stopping the insanity of entitlement \nspending. We should avoid cost shifting that would take people out of \none program in which we removed the entitlement status and shove them \nover into another program which has remained as an entitlement. That \nkind of cost shifting should not be allowed. It should be avoided.\n  I would have preferred a more comprehensive bill. Obviously, I would \nhave preferred one where the block grant for food stamps was mandated. \nI would have preferred one where we had Supplemental Security Income. I \nwould have preferred a bill that would have had a more significant \nbreadth, that had Medicaid in it as well. But we are making some first \nsteps, and they are important first steps.\n  One of the important first steps is the reduction in bureaucracy \nhere; the reduction in the redtape, the reduction in this \nmicromanagement, this intermeddling micromanagement from the Federal \nGovernment which makes it very difficult for the States to adopt \npolicies that will really make a difference and makes it very expensive \nwhen you have to comply with hundreds of pages of Federal bureaucratic \nredtape. It is expensive. Instead of money getting to the truly needy, \ninstead of the resource making it to the population that wants to move \nfrom welfare to work, sometimes the resource gets clogged in the \nbottleneck of the bureaucracy and the money is spent there instead of \nbeing spent on the poor. We are going to reduce the number of \nregulatory impositions from Washington substantially. This bill will \nimprove our ability to deliver the real kind of help that people need. \nThat is important--maximum State flexibility.\n  Second, I believe it is important that we will end an entitlement. \nThis philosophy that we do not care how much it costs, that as many \npeople as can meet certain criteria are just entitled to self-\nappropriate to themselves--that has to stop. It is a major thing. \nFirst, reduce the bureaucracy; second, end entitlement; third, we are \ngoing to require work far more pervasively than ever before.\n  The American people have told us with a clarity that is unmistakable. \nWe must require work, and, of course, provide the flexibility so that \npeople can do in the various States and communities of this country \nwhat works there, not what somebody in Washington wants to impose, but \nto do simply what works.\n  This bill makes a statement that Washington does not have all the \nanswers. We are now looking to the communities and the States to do \nwhat works there, to tailor programs, and to be experimental stations \nto say we will try this, and, if it works here, others might want to \ntry it. But it should not be imposed on them because people should have \nan opportunity to do what works to move people from poverty to \nproductivity. Washington, it may be said, has been the mad scientist \nseeking to impose its will. But the truth of the matter is we need to \nprovide an opportunity for States to do that which works.\n  Well, this bill comes with an explicit admonition as well. This bill \nrecognizes that Government alone will not solve these problems. And I \nthink that it is important for us to express nationally and as a part \nof policy that we really expect charitable and nongovernmental \ninstitutions in this culture to rally to address this problem, and not \nexpect the problem to be solved fully by Government.\n  So we have in this bill a specific invitation to private charities, \nnongovernmental entities, even faith-based organizations to participate \nin the solution of this serious challenge to the success of this \nsociety in the next century. And I believe that is a major step \nforward.\n  We have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to do something that \nis substantially in the best interests of the people of this country, \nsomething they have yearned for us to do. That is to change a welfare \nsystem which is badly broken, which has been the keeper of the poor and \nhas kept people poor, which has managed to find more people in poverty \nafter its great effort than less people in poverty.\n  The war on poverty has resulted in the children of America being \ntaken as prisoners. We have to do something, and we have to do it well.\n  As I previously stated, this welfare reform bill is not perfect, but \nit does take the first steps. The lack of perfection in this bill, the \nabsence of a mandate that the Food Stamp Program be sent to all the \nStates, the lack of reforms to the SSI Program in the bill, are some of \na number of things which keep it from being perfect but should not keep \nit from being passed.\n  This bill gives us the opportunity to say, ``Let us pass this bill, \nbut let the imperfections drive us to keep our focus and in the next \nyear to continue to improve and extend it.''\n  There has been a lot of talk in the last few weeks during the welfare \nreform debate about money and about resources. We know how desperately \nimportant it is for us to balance the budget, but the ultimate \nimportance of this bill is not money. The savings we are talking about \nare the savings in lives and opportunities and, through those savings, \nthe future of America. Our task in this welfare reform measure is then \nto save the lives and opportunities of citizens. To pass this welfare \nreform bill today would be a real step toward saving lives, and we must \nsupport it and must be driven by its imperfections to do even more when \nwe reconvene next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13749-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13750-S13751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE DEATH OF STATE SENATOR JOHN PLEWA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the loss of a \ndear friend and former colleague, State Senator John Plewa.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with John in the legislature for 10 \nyears, and for 8 of them in the State senate. He represented the people \nof Wisconsin, first in the assembly, and then in the \n\n[[Page S13751]]\nState senate, with dedication and devotion, and his constituents \nreturned him to office at every election since he was first elected in \n1972. At the time of his death, John had the fourth longest tenure \namong lawmakers currently serving in the Wisconsin Legislature.\n  John was a lifelong resident of Milwaukee, graduating from Don Bosco \nHigh School in 1963. He earned a bachelor of education degree in 1968 \nat the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and following that, taught \nhistory and social studies at Milwaukee Area Technical College prior to \nhis service in the legislature.\n  A committed and passionate advocate for Wisconsin's families, John \nmay be best remembered as the father of Wisconsin's family and medical \nleave law, which allows people to take time off from their job to \nprovide assistance to a family member needing care, from newborns to an \nelderly relative--a law that helped pave the way for the Federal family \nleave law that was enacted in 1993.\n  His commitment to families in need went well beyond the family leave \nlaw. John was vice chair of the Senate Aging Committee when I chaired \nthat body, and I saw first-hand his steadfast and effective support of \nlong-term care reforms that help people with disabilities of all ages \nremain in their own homes with their families.\n  John was also vitally concerned with housing policy, serving on the \nboard of Wisconsin's Housing and Economic Development Authority for 10 \nyears. I had the pleasure of working with John in this area as well \nwhen we coauthored Wisconsin's Housing Trust Fund, to provide flexible \nhelp to families in need of decent, affordable housing.\n  John would have been 50 years old this Friday. But even though he did \nnot live to celebrate that anniversary, he left Wisconsin an impressive \nlegacy.\n  Today, thousands are able to take time from work to care for a family \nmember without the fear of losing that job. Other families are finally \nable to afford a decent home. Wisconsin families, who otherwise might \nbe forced apart because of a long-term disability, are able to remain \ntogether, and individuals needing long-term care, who otherwise might \nbe forced to seek services in an institution, are able to remain in \ntheir homes. All because of John Plewa. Wisconsin families have lost \none of their foremost champions, and I know they join in offering their \nsympathy to the friends and colleagues John leaves behind, to his \nstaff, and most especially to John's wife Susan and their two sons.\n  We will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13750-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now soaring \ntoward $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation now by \nbureaucratic hot air--and it is sort of like the weather--everybody \ntalks about it but almost nobody did much about it until immediately \nafter the elections in November 1994.\n  But when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but one of the 54 \nRepublicans supported the balanced budget amendment--that was the good \nnews.\n  The bad news was that only 13 Democrats supported it--which killed \nhopes for a balanced budget amendment for the time being. Since a two-\nthirds vote--67 Senators, if all Senator's are present--is necessary to \napprove a constitutional amendment, the proposed Senate amendment \nfailed by one vote. There will be another vote either this year or in \n1996.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Monday, September 18, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,963,468,747,991.22 or $18,841.41 \nfor every man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

There is at least one other speaker, possibly two, so could we \nhave a division of time so that everyone will have an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 4 minutes; I believe the Senator from Connecticut \nwould like to speak for 4 minutes, and the Senator from Wyoming would \nlike to speak for 4 minutes, and have the time adjusted at 9:30 to \naccommodate this request.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I was \nunable to hear the entire consent request.\n  Could the Senator restate it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would extend morning business beyond 9:30.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am constrained to object to that. We \nmade it very clear last night what the times were. We have Senators who \nhave rearranged schedules to be here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I withdraw my request, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I intend to vote for the welfare reform \nbill today. It is not a perfect piece of legislation, but it does \nadvance some of the issues that I think need to be advanced and begin \nsome new directions that I think are necessary.\n  There is no disagreement in this Chamber about the proposition that \nthe current welfare system does not work very well. There ought not be \nany disagreement in this Chamber either about the fact that when we \nchange our welfare system, we ought to make sure we protect America's \nchildren.\n  There is a stereotype about welfare that is fundamentally inaccurate, \nthat welfare is a woman who has 16 kids because it is profitable to \nhave children; that welfare is some able-bodied person lying in a Lazy \nBoy recliner drinking beer, watching color television, and who is \nessentially slothful, indolent, and unwilling to work.\n  The fact is, that is not the statistical welfare recipient. The size \nof the average welfare family is almost identical to the size of the \naverage American family.\n  Two-thirds of the people on welfare are kids under 16 years of age. \nAs we go about trying to figure out how to change the system, we have \nto understand our obligation to protect children. We also need to \nprovide the right incentives and to provide some hope to those who are \nhopeless, to extend a hand of help to those who are helpless, but also \nto say to them that welfare is temporary. We extend the hand of help \nbecause you need it, and it is to help you get up and out, to go get a \njob and be productive and be able to care for yourself.\n  These are the kinds of incentives we want to be included in this \nwelfare reform bill. We have accomplished some of those goals, some of \nthose goals we have not.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, who is going to speak for a couple of \nminutes, put a very important provision in this bill dealing with child \ncare. That is enormously important and will allow a number of us to \nvote for this legislation. As I said, this bill is not perfect. I am \nconcerned about the notion of block granting money, of wrapping up \nmoney and sending it to the States and saying, ``By the way, here is \nsome money you didn't collect. Go ahead and spend it.''\n  I am concerned about a number of other things in the bill, but I do \nthink it advances the welfare reform debate as it leaves the Senate. I \ndo not know whether I will vote for it when it comes back from \nconference. I hope it will come out of conference as a good welfare \nreform bill, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise in support of the welfare \nproposal that will be before us today. We have talked about it a very \nlong time. Obviously, there are different views about how it should be \nimplemented but, most of all, it is the first opportunity \n\n[[Page S13752]]\nwe have had in a very long time to make some changes, to make some of \nthe kinds of changes that the American people asked us to make in \nNovember and, indeed, have been asking us to make for some time.\n  It is the first opportunity in a long time to make some of the kinds \nof changes that most of us have known needed to be made for a long time \nin the welfare program. Most everyone agrees that we need a program in \nthis country to help people who need help and help them back into the \nworkplace. The program as it now exists has not accomplished that. \nIndeed, the program we now have has not accomplished the basic things \nwe think it should accomplish.\n  The provisions of this welfare proposal will allow us to encourage \npeople back to work, to put in some incentives to go back to work, and \nto deal very properly with the notion of child care, with extending \nhealth benefits to single-parent families so that that parent can work.\n  We have done this in our own Wyoming Legislature. We recognized some \ntime ago that if the option was to take a minimum wage job and lose \nthose benefits, then the better thing to do was stay on welfare. We \nhave to change that. We do have to make some changes if we expect \ndifferent results, and too often we all talk expansively about change; \nwe want to make change; we are all for change; but when the time comes, \nwe really resist change. We simply cannot expect the results to be \ndifferent unless we do some changing, and one of the principal, most \nimportant changes here is to allow the States to have more flexibility, \nto allow the States to be the laboratory for developing and testing and \ncreating programs that, indeed, deliver the kinds of programs needed.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote in support of this welfare bill \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, just very briefly regarding the welfare reform \nproposal, this is a substantially improved product from what the other \nbody, the House of Representatives, has passed. It is certainly \nimproved over what was originally proposed by the majority leader in \nthe areas of child care, maintenance of effort, and a number of other \nareas that have been included as part of this proposal. My concern is, \nof course, that this may be the best it ever gets and that as we go to \nconference, as historically happens, you find some sort of middle \nground between what the Senate has done and what the House of \nRepresentatives has done.\n  If that is the case, this bill will come back to us from conference \nin a very weakened position. And so while I think there will be a \nsubstantial vote for the proposal today, having spoken now with a \nnumber of our colleagues, particularly on this side, Madam President, \nit should not be construed, if the vote is a strong vote for the Senate \nproposal, that this is some indication of a willingness to support \nwhatever comes back from conference.\n  In order to have intelligent welfare reform, you have to make \ninvestments. The distinguished Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], \nwho, as I mentioned at the outset of this debate, knows more about \nwelfare reform than most of us will ever know about the issue, has \nwarned that if we do not make these investments, we are going to be \nlooking down the road at a tragic situation.\n  It is not enough just give the issue back to the States. The problems \nexist primarily at the local level, the city and town level. I do not \nknow how many States are necessarily going to allocate resources in \nthose parts of their own jurisdiction where the problems persist the \nmost.\n  Having said all of that, Madam President, I do not disagree with what \nmy colleagues have generally said this morning, that this is a far \nbetter bill than what the other body has passed, a far better bill than \nwas initially proposed and offered here in the Senate.\n  But I would still say that we have a long way to go before this bill \nbecomes the kind of proposal that not only saves money, but allows \npeople to go from welfare to work and protects the 10 million children \nwho could be adversely affected by these decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13751-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Under the previous order, the hour of 9:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1976, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1976) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     rural development, Food and Drug Administration, and related \n     agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1996, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Brown modified amendment No. 2688 (to committee \n     amendment beginning on page 83, line 4, through page 84, line \n     2), to prohibit the use of funds for salaries and expenses of \n     Department of Agriculture employees who carry out a price \n     support or production adjustment program for peanuts.\n       (2) Bryan-Bumpers amendment No. 2691, to eliminate funding \n     to carry out the Market Promotion Program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2691\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes for debate under the Bryan amendment No. 2691 equally divided. \nThe Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. It is my intent to speak a few minutes in opposition to the \nBryan amendment, to put in context the decision we will make at 9:45.\n  This is an amendment that does not seek to modify or simply reduce \nthe funding for the Market Promotion Program. It is designed to kill \nthe program, eliminate all funding under this legislation for this \nprogram in the next fiscal year. I think that would be a big mistake, \nMr. President, and here is why.\n  The Foreign Agriculture Service undertook a study of this program in \nresponse to requests from the Congress and determined that for every $1 \nthat we invest in this Market Promotion Program promoting U.S. \nagriculture commodities and foodstuffs that are exported in the \ninternational marketplace, $16 is generated in additional agriculture \nimports.\n  At a time when we are trying to compete more aggressively in the \ninternational market because of the opening up of new markets under the \nGATT Uruguay Round Agreement, we are trying to do a better job and use \nall the resources that we can muster to help ensure that we maintain a \ncompetitive edge and that we work with our farmers and ranchers and \nfood processors to try to enlarge our share of markets. This is going \nto have just the opposite effect.\n  So I am hopeful that the Senate will vote against this amendment. I \nurge all Senators to carefully consider this. This is a proven, tested, \nworkable, and effective program, and we have the facts to prove it. We \ndebated this issue for an hour last night and laid all the facts out on \nboth sides. I hope the Senators this morning will reject this amendment \nsoundly.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if there is no one seeking to address the \nSenate in support of the amendment, I am going to suggest that the time \nduring the quorum, which I am going to call, be charged to the \nproponents of the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nso charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S13753]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I listened last night \nto a debate we have had here many times, and my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada, Richard Bryan, my distinguished friend who I respect, \nlists all the companies that get this, shall we say, assistance for \nexport promotion and points out they all make a profit, they make large \nprofits and says that this is a program that we should not have.\n  But every year, and it seems like twice a year, I take to the floor \nto point out to my friend and to the rest of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle that the future of this country, the economic future \nof this country really lies in exports. That is where we are going to \nhave the job creation, that is where we are going to have an economic \nfuture that is worth something.\n  We know scientifically, because we have the studies, that every \ndollar that is invested in market promotion yields far, far many more \ndollars in return. It is a multiplier effect because the companies \nmatch the moneys and we wind up selling more of our products overseas.\n  The other point I want to make is that every other country in the \nworld with whom we compete have similar programs, as a matter of fact, \nhave much broader and wider and deeper programs where they push the \nexports of their country. If we are to walk away from this, we will \nfall behind.\n  So, Mr. President, I know that the companies that are listed by my \nfriend are successful companies, and I know that they do put some of \ntheir capital into this, but I think it is very appropriate for this \ncountry to have an export promotion program, just as I think it \nappropriate for our trading partners.\n  I stand with the chairman, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I point out to my colleagues that the MPP and its immediate \npredecessor, the Targeted Export Assistance Program, has cost the \nAmerican taxpayers $1 billion--$1 billion. It is currently proposed for \nfunding at $110 million. It is a program which has been soundly \ndenounced by think tanks and organizations that are representing a \nbroad spectrum of interest groups from the Cato Institute to the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, the \nCitizens Against Government Waste, the Center for Science in the Public \nInterest, the Progressive Policy Institute.\n  The General Accounting Office has reviewed this program and has \nconcluded that there is no tangible, ascertainable basis upon which to \nconclude that, in fact, has assisted in the Market Promotion Program. \nThere are no criteria in terms of large company, small company, who \nreceives, no period of time in which one is supposed to graduate out of \nthe program.\n  We are currently spending to assist our overall export promotion \nprograms in this country about $3.5 billion annually. While \nagricultural products account for 10 percent of total U.S. exports, the \nDepartment of Agriculture spends $2.2 billion, or 63 percent of the \ntotal.\n  The way this program works, Mr. President, is that the advertising \nbudgets of some of the largest corporations in the world receive a \nhandout from the American taxpayer to supplement their budgets. Time \nrestricts me from going into great detail, but here are some of the \ncompanies, all fine companies, that received in fiscal year 1993-1994 \nsubstantial amounts of money: Ernest & Julio Gallo, $7.9 million; \nPillsbury, $1.75 million; Jim Beam Whiskey, $713,000, Campbell Soups, \n$1.1 million, to cite a few.\n  I think the American taxpayer, if he or she understood, would be \nshocked that, in effect, we are taking tax dollars collected from the \nAmerican people and, in effect, adding them to the advertising budgets \nof some of the largest companies in the world.\n  Mr. President, the time to end this program has come. We have cut \nMedicare by $270 billion. We are cutting all kinds of programs \ninvolving educational assistance and a whole raft of programs. Yet, we \nseem to be unable to divorce ourselves from this form of corporate \nwelfare.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 3 minutes 33 \nseconds. The Senator from Nevada has 2 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Let me simply say that in response to the suggestion \nthat large corporations are getting all this money, 80 percent of this \nmoney goes to trade associations, farmer cooperative groups, the \nassociation of exporters of poultry and eggs, cotton promotion groups, \nand others who are trying to take up for the interests of America's \nfarmers, ranchers, and those in the food businesses that sell in the \ninternational market.\n  We are trying to save American jobs and promote American economic \ninterests, American agriculture interests. These are companies that are \ninvolved in those businesses. But the majority of the money goes to \nsmall businesses, farmer cooperatives, and organizations like that, who \nsometimes use those companies to help promote what the ingredients are \nin their products that are sold in the international market.\n  So we hope Senators will keep that in mind. This is not corporate \nwelfare--the catchy phrase some are using to discredit programs, this \none included. It is not well-placed criticism. It is not accurate to \njudge the worth of this program on the basis of that kind of argument.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues from Nevada and \nArkansas--the amendment to eliminate the funding for the Market \nPromotion Program. I think this effort is a misguided attack on a \nprogram which is successful in its accomplishments. In fact I believe \nfunding for this program should be increased, not eliminated.\n  Mr. President, American agriculture is an example of successful \nexport growth. This year our exports will be in the neighborhood of $50 \nbillion. And our trade surplus in agricultural goods is around $20 \nbillion. And one big reason is the MPP.\n  This program promotes American agricultural commodities in foreign \nmarkets. This program allows foreign businesses to advertise American \nproducts in their operations. The MPP helps put American beef in \nChinese Big Macs--rather than less expensive, locally produced foods.\n  And the benefits of such a program are well-recognized by our \ncompetitors in the global marketplace. The European Union, our largest \nand most tenacious agricultural export adversary, outspends us nearly 3 \nto 1 in programs of this type. They spend as much to export wine as we \ndo for all our commodities through the MPP. I think that speaks volumes \nabout these programs.\n  This year we have seen significant advances in our ability to enter \nforeign markets. We've moved apples and broccoli in Japan, and \nnegotiated an agreement to ship more meat into Korea. These exports \nmean jobs and revenue in America. And I am confident this trend will \ncontinue. But it makes no sense to eliminate the tools which have \nfacilitated this progress. The MPP is one such tool.\n  Mr. President, I strongly endorse the Market Promotion Program and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment to end the \nfunding for this valuable program.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Bryan amendment to \neliminate funding for the Market Promotion Program.\n  The Market Promotion Program helps promote U.S. agricultural \ncommodities abroad and build foreign markets for American agricultural \nproducts. I support the Market Promotion Program. And here is why:\n  First, the Market Promotion Program has been a very successful \nprogram. It has significantly benefited agriculture and expanded \nmarkets. There have been scores of success stories. For California \nagriculture, MPP moneys have boosted exports of almonds, asparagus, \nprunes, citrus, avocados, kiwi-\n\n[[Page S13754]]\nfruit, canned peaches, canned pears, canned fruit cocktail, pistachios, \nstrawberries, table grapes, tomatoes, walnuts, wine, raisins, cotton \nand cotton products, and more.\n  The California avocado industry, for example, used MPP moneys to \nincrease Japanese consumers' awareness of the higher quality of \nCalifornia avocados as opposed to lower priced, lower quality foreign \nsources. In 3 years, using MPP funds California avocado growers were \nable to increase exports to Japan by 200 percent.\n  Similarly, the U.S. cotton industry effectively used to promote the \nhigher quality of products made with U.S. cotton. In the 5 years \npreceding the Market Promotion Program, exports of American cotton \naveraged only 5.3 million bales of raw cotton. This year, U.S. cotton \nexports will exceed 10 million bales. U.S. cotton exports have averaged \n$437 million more per year since the Market Promotion Program began.\n  Second, the Market Promotion Program is a cost-shared program. \nRecipients of MPP funds must contribute funds of their own as well. But \nthe Federal funds serve as seed money that attract the private funding \nand bring diverse segments of an industry together on export promotion \nthat would not otherwise be possible.\n  Third, the Market Promotion Program helps American agriculture \ncompete in a global market. It is a GATT legal program. Agricultural \nexports now account for nearly one-third of total U.S. agricultural \nproduction and over $40 million in sales. But our competitors in world \nmarkets are aggressively supporting export and promotion of their \nagricultural products. We need to ensure that our growers are given the \nsame support that their foreign competitors receive.\n  Mr. President, the Market Promotion Program works. We should not \neliminate it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my message today is simple: If you are pro \ntrade, pro growth, and pro jobs--you are pro MPP.\n  The Market Promotion Program is a proven success. For example, in my \nhome State of Washington we have seen a dramatic increase in apple \nexports from 4.3 million cartons to 25.1 million, an increase of over \n500 percent. Export sales now total over $300 million. This success is \ndue to the Market Promotion Program.\n  My State alone exports over 1.1 billion dollars' worth of agriculture \nproducts. Such exports generate nearly $3 billion in economic activity \nand provide over 33,000 export-related jobs in my State of Washington. \nPrograms like MPP are absolutely essential if U.S. agriculture--the \nmost competitive industry in the world--is to remain viable and \ncompetitive in the international marketplace. MPP gives U.S. \nagriculture the tool it needs to develop, maintain, and expand \ncommercial export markets for U.S. agriculture commodities in the new \npost-GATT environment.\n  In summary, Mr. President, without MPP we give our competitors an \nadvantage and the opportunity to capture and maintain a significant \nshare of the world market. U.S. agriculture is the most competitive \nindustry in the world. We should provide the tools necessary so that \nU.S. agriculture can develop, maintain, and expand its share of the \nworld market.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If I have 30 seconds, I will yield that to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support the Market Promotion \nProgram. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by my \ncolleague Senator Bumpers to eliminate funding the Market Promotion \nProgram. I would like to point out to the Senate why this program is so \nimportant for agriculture in my State of California, and many other \nStates as well.\n  The MPP is an important tool in expanding markets for U.S. \nagricultural products. Continued funding for this program is an \nimportant step in redirecting farm spending away from price supports \nand toward expanding markets.\n  A 1995 Foreign Agricultural Service study, Evaluating the \nEffectiveness of the Market Promotion Program on High-Value \nAgricultural Exports, concluded that for every dollar invested in the \nMPP and its predecessor, the Targeted Export Assistance Program, since \n1986, the United States has exported $16 dollars worth of agricultural \nproducts.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that each dollar of MPP \nmoney results in an increase in agricultural product exports of between \n$2 and $7. The program has provided much needed assistance to commodity \ngroups comprised of small farmers who would be unable to break into \nthese markets on their own.\n  While the program has been the subject of criticism, some of it \njustified, I believe it would be a mistake to cut the program because \nof a few cases of poor judgment. Overall, the program has greatly \nbenefited the small growers for whom it was intended. New regulations \nwent into effect in February 1995 to, among other things, give priority \nassistance to small businesses. In 1995 small businesses will receive \nover 50 percent of the funding provided for brand-name products up from \n41 percent in 1994.\n  Last year, a task force of the U.S. Agriculture Export Development \nCouncil met for 2 days in Leesburg, VA, to review the role of the MPP, \nand other agriculture programs as part of our overall trade policy. \nThis task force affirmed that the purpose of the MPP is to ``increase \nU.S. agricultural project exports.'' It concluded that the increase in \nsuch exports helps to ``create and protect U.S. jobs, combat unfair \ntrade practices, improve the U.S. trade balance, and improve farm \nincome.''\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. agricultural \nexports reached $43.5 billion supporting almost 800,000 jobs. For \nfiscal year 1995, agricultural exports are expected to reach a record \n$51.5 billion. Individual export records have been set in 1994 for red \nmeats, poultry, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, tree nuts, wine and beer \nand other high value products. This has been achieved with the help of \nMPP and other USDA export programs.\n  Mr. President, the Market Promotion Program has been an unqualified \nsuccess for California farmers. For many Californian crops, the MPP has \nprovided the crucial boost to help them overcome unfair foreign \nsubsidies. I would like to share two of the successes of this program \nin California.\n  California produces about 85 percent of the U.S. avocado crop on over \n6,000 farms that average less than 8 acres per farm. Between 1985 and \n1993, California avocado growers utilized $2.5 million of their own \nmoney, combined with $3.4 million of MPP funds to achieve over $58 \nmillion in avocado sales in Europe and the Pacific rim. This is better \nthan a 17 to 1 return on our MPP investment that means jobs for \nCalifornia.\n  The growth of California walnuts exports also illustrates the success \nof this program. Since 1985, the year before the MPP began helping \nwalnuts, 90 percent of the growth in California walnut sales has come \nfrom exports. And 90 percent of this export growth has been to markets \nwhere California walnuts have had MPP support. The total value of these \nexports in 1985 totaled $36 million. By last year, that total export \nvalue grew to $119 million.\n  This growth in MPP driven walnut exports has been the greatest in the \nheavily protected Japanese market. There, California walnut exports \ngrew from about $3 million in 1985 to $28 million last year. The $19 \nmillion devoted by the MPP between 1986 and 1994 to promoting \nCalifornia walnuts in Japan has helped generate nearly $140 million in \nsales. This is a rate of return on the taxpayer's investment that \napproaches 700 percent.\n  The California walnut industry is not a monolithic corporation. It is \nmade up of over 5,300 growers who farm orchards that average only 44 \nacres. And its these California family farmers, not big corporations, \nwho benefit from the MPP support of walnut exports. Without the MPP, \nthese farmers could not muster the resources they need to break into \nthe Japanese and other protected markets.\n  Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on a possible initiative \nby my colleagues to means-test the Market Promotion Program. In \nCalifornia, nonprofit agricultural marketing cooperatives such as \nSunkist, Blue Diamond, and Calvaro are owned by their \n\n[[Page S13755]]\nfarmer members and distribute all income to the individual farmers less \noperating expenses. Cooperatives such as these are associations of \nfarmers who accomplish collectively what that cannot accomplish \nindividually. The average farmer in these three cooperatives farms \nbetween 20 and 40 acres and the overwhelming majority of them are full-\ntime farmers. I believe it would be unfair to penalize individual small \nfarmers because they have joined together to form an effective \ncooperative. It defeats the purpose of a market development program. It \nis clear that these farmers could not individually be effective \nexporters to the world market.\n  In closing Mr. President, the MPP is a wise investment in American \nagriculture and I urge my colleagues to support it in its current form, \nat the highest possible level.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of export-related jobs in each \nState be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Market Promotion Program\n\n                Agriculture export related jobs by State\n\nState:                                                             Jobs\n    Alabama......................................................11,000\n    Alaska.......................................................20,000\n    Arizona......................................................10,000\n    Arkansas.....................................................33,000\n    California..................................................137,000\n    Colorado.....................................................25,000\n    Connecticut...................................................1,500\n    Delaware......................................................2,000\n    Florida......................................................22,000\n    Georgia......................................................15,000\n    Hawaii........................................................1,700\n    Idaho........................................................22,000\n    Illinois.....................................................68,000\n    Indiana......................................................36,000\n    Iowa.........................................................96,000\n    Kansas.......................................................69,000\n    Kentucky.....................................................25,000\n    Louisiana....................................................17,000\n    Maine...........................................................400\n    Maryland......................................................5,500\n    Massachusetts.................................................1,100\n    Michigan.....................................................27,500\n    Minnesota....................................................50,000\n    Mississippi..................................................24,000\n    Missouri.....................................................24,000\n    Montana.......................................................6,000\n    Nebraska.....................................................74,000\n    New Jersey....................................................2,000\n    New Mexico....................................................3,000\n    New York......................................................8,300\n    North Carolina...............................................27,500\n    North Dakota.................................................23,000\n    Ohio.........................................................33,000\n    Oklahoma.....................................................10,000\n    Oregon.......................................................15,000\n    Pennsylvania.................................................11,000\n    South Carolina................................................7,000\n    South Dakota.................................................25,000\n    Tennessee.....................................................9,000\n    Texas........................................................77,000\n    Utah..........................................................2,800\n    Virginia.....................................................10,000\n    Washington...................................................30,000\n    Wisconsin....................................................27,500\n    Wyoming.......................................................1,400\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just received, from the farmer \ncooperatives a table that I have placed in the Record, which shows the \nnumber of jobs that are related to the export of agricultural products. \nThey are shown by State. It is really an extraordinary list: Kansas, \n69,000; Kentucky, 25,000; Texas, 77,000; California, 137,000. Virtually \nevery State in the Union, thousands of jobs. I stand in strong support \nof this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, might I inquire about the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 2 minutes 50 \nseconds. The Senator from Mississippi has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself a minute and a half.\n  Mr. President, I simply make a point that this presumably is a time \nin America in which we are calling for shared sacrifice. We are saying \nthat we cannot do business the way we have always done it. With all due \nrespect to my distinguished colleague and friend from California, in \nterms of weighing the priorities, it seems to me it is pretty hard to \ncontend when we are savaging the kinds of programs that affect the poor \nand those who are least able to defend themselves to support these \nkinds of dollars.\n  McDonald's, the hamburger folks, I think, reported a net profit of in \nexcess of $1 billion. They continue to receive money to supplement \ntheir advertising account. Their advertising budget is in the range of \n$600 to $700 million. I would think that these outfits would be \nembarrassed, at a time when they are encouraging us to balance the \nbudget, as we should, to simply say, look, it is time for us to kind of \nparticipate in this shared sacrifice and say, look, we will handle our \nown promotion and not depend upon the American taxpayer for a handout.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume. Let me remind the Senate that we voted on this same issue when \nwe had the supplemental reconciliation bill before the Senate on April \n6 of this year. I moved to table this same amendment that was offered \nby the Senators from Nevada and Arkansas. And on a vote of 61 yeas to \n37 nays, this amendment was tabled. We fully debated the issue then. We \nhave fully debated the issue now. Nothing has changed, Mr. President.\n  So I hope Senators will notice that I am going to put on the desk \nhere how everybody voted on that previous occasion. I hope we will \nrepeat the success of that favorable motion on the motion to table this \nsame amendment. It is my intention to move to table when time has \nexpired and we ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire as to how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 44 seconds. The \nSenator from Mississippi has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will yield time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  First, the point I seek to make, as I have over the past several \nyears with my friend from Arkansas, is that this is really a question \nof a subsidy that in light of what I consider the new economic reality, \nwhere we are literally going to have to reexamine the way in which we \ndo things in Government, and those programs that have long existed that \nare near and dear to many of my colleagues. Some of these programs \nsimply cannot pass what I would call the ``smell test.'' This is one of \nthem.\n  I offer no criticism of these large agribusinesses, who have been \nextraordinarily successful. I compliment them. But I think the \nfundamental question is: Should the American taxpayer be paying for \ntheir advertising and promotion?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the Senator from Arkansas my remaining time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just came from downstairs where the \nHouse just receded to the Senate position on mine law reform. The \neffect of that is to take 233 patent applications that have been \nexcluded from being grandfathered in last year and say you can have \nthat, too. The biggest mining companies in America. Those 233 patent \napplications, which we just voted to allow to go forward contain $15.5 \nbillion worth of gold, platinum, palladium, silver, and so on, \nunderneath them. They will be given out to the biggest mining companies \nin the United States for zip--not $1 to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Here we are debating continuing a practice of giving $110 million to \nthe biggest corporations in America, not just the 10 listed on that \nchart--dozens more. Some of them are almost as big. To the biggest \ncorporations in the world, we are giving $110 million to help them sell \nMcNuggets and Big Macs around the world. I found out last night that we \nhave already spent $86 million on this program for alcoholic beverages. \nWho thinks that is a great idea?\n  We are doing that, while we are cutting welfare, kicking 50 percent \nof the people off of the rolls by the year 2000, cutting earned-income \ntax credit to keep people off the rolls, $270 billion in Medicare cuts \nfor our elderly citizens, $240 billion in Medicaid cuts for the poorest \nof the poor for health care in this country, and on and on it goes. And \nthis day, in one fell swoop, we have just voted to give $15 billion \nworth of minerals away and $110 million in the grossest kind of \ncorporate welfare. Is that what the revolution of 1994 was about?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \non this side. \n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is a red herring. The fact is that the funds \nallocated under this program are to promote U.S. agriculture products. \nWe are seeing the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council promoting the \npurchase of U.S. poultry products and eggs by foreign-owned and \noperated franchises of McDonald's. That does not mean that goes to \ncorporate headquarters in Chicago, or wherever. This means that we are \nproducing a promotional campaign using these funds to try to help sell \nmore of what we produce in America.\n  It is a good program. It has worked and I hope the Senate will vote \n``yes'' on this motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, we have about 10 minutes before we are to \nproceed with debate on the amendment dealing with poultry regulation. \nOne hour on each side is available under that agreement for debate of \nthat issue. We had hoped to take up another amendment and discuss it \nbetween now and then. I know Senator Kerrey had considered bringing up \nhis amendment, which is a Market Promotion Program amendment. I know of \nno other business that Senators have requested be transacted during \nthis 10-minute period, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I further ask I may be permitted to proceed \nas if in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the excepted committee amendment regarding \npoultry regulations, on which there will be 2 hours of debate. The \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand the allocation of time, \nthere is 1 hour on each side. If I am not mistaken, I think under the \norder, I am to control the time in opposition to the amendment of the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what is at issue here in this amendment \nthat will be offered by the Senator from California is a provision of \nthe Senate bill as approved by the Appropriations Committee, which I \nwill read. It is section 729 and found on page 83 of the bill:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to develop compliance guidelines, \n     implement or enforce a regulation promulgated by the Food \n     Safety and Inspection Service on August 25, 1995 (60 Fed. \n     Reg. 44396): Provided, That this regulation shall take effect \n     only if legislation is enacted into law which directs the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate such regulation, or \n     the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee \n     on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry receive and approve a \n     proposed revised regulation submitted by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n  This regulation, which has been promulgated after a great deal of \ndiscussion, public comment on the proposed regulation has the effect of \nprohibiting and actually preventing poultry producers and processors in \nthe Southeast and Southwest from exporting their products into the \nCalifornia market. That is the practical consequence of the regulation \nas drawn and promulgated by this administration.\n  The origin of the initiative came from California to restate the \nregulations and rules regarding the labeling of poultry products with \nrespect to whether they were frozen, chilled or not and what should be \ndisclosed in that connection and how you measure the temperature with \nrespect to which regulation or label would be appropriate.\n  This was all driven by the poultry industry in California which is a \nhigh-cost producer and processor of poultry products. High cost: High \nlabor costs, regulations that are imposed locally and in the State of \nCalifornia, that elevate the price at which poultry products can be \nsold in California.\n  Different regulations with regard to the way these imported products \nare sent from the Southeast and the Southwest into that market, are \npackaged and labeled, could be drawn so as to increase the costs of and \nmaybe even make it impossible to ship deeply chilled poultry products \ninto that market.\n  So this issue was developed as a way for the California poultry \nindustry to keep competition out of their market, to keep lower cost \npoultry processing firms in the Southeast, like in my State of \nMississippi, from competing and undercutting the price being sold by \nCalifornia poultry producers in their own market.\n  To let the Senate know that this is not an issue that has been just \nhastily or capriciously injected into this appropriations bill, back in \nApril, we were trying to convince the administration of the seriousness \nof this situation that would be caused throughout many parts of this \ncountry if this regulation were to be approved.\n  I am looking at a letter, which I will have printed in the Record, \ndated April 4, 1995. It is written on the letterhead of Senator John \nWarner of Virginia, but it is signed by 19 Senators: Senators David \nPryor, John Warner, Mitch McConnell, Jesse Helms, Howell Heflin, Paul \nCoverdell, Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, Strom Thurmond, Richard Shelby, \nBennett Johnston, John Breaux, Jim Inhofe, Sam Nunn, Christopher Bond, \nLauch Faircloth, Rod Grams, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Don Nickles.\n  What we said in this letter addressed to the acting Under Secretary \nof Agriculture for Food Safety, is that we believe it is appropriate \nfor the Food Safety and Inspection Service to consider changes in the \nexisting Federal standards, but we have major reservations about the \nstandards that the Food Safety and Inspection Service are proposing. We \ntalk about the consequences of the proposed regulations \n\n[[Page S13757]]\nat that time, illogical from the point of view of measuring the \ntemperature of chilled poultry and then having it labeled ``previously \nfrozen'' or ``frozen'' and the consequences of that in terms of the \nbusinesses that deeply chill the poultry to protect it from \ncontamination as it is transported across the country to other markets \nin the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a copy of this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                    April 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Michael Taylor,\n     Under Secretary for Food Safety (Acting), U.S. Department of \n         Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Taylor: We believe it is appropriate for the Food \n     Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to consider changes in \n     the existing federal standards for labeling ``fresh'' and \n     ``frozen'' poultry. However, we have major reservations about \n     the standards FSIS are proposing.\n       FSIS on January 18, 1995 proposed regulations that would \n     allow a ``fresh'' label to appear only on those poultry \n     products that have not been chilled below 26 degrees \n     Fahrenheit. Poultry that had been chilled to 0 degrees or \n     below would be labeled ``frozen.'' Poultry chilled to a \n     temperature of between 0 degrees and 26 degrees would be \n     labeled ``previously frozen.''\n       The following are our most serious concerns about this \n     proposal:\n       FSIS arbitrarily chose 26 degrees as the dividing line \n     between ``fresh'' and other designations. There are other \n     temperatures below 26 degrees that preserve the ``fresh'' \n     characteristics consumers are seeking while giving poultry \n     products the longer safe shelf life necessary for \n     transportation across long distances.\n       The proposed regulation requires ``fresh'' poultry products \n     to remain at no less than 26 degrees throughout processing, \n     storage and transportation. The original processor does not \n     control some of these operations and could lose a ``fresh'' \n     designation through no fault of their own. The strict \n     adherence to 26 degrees also does not take into account \n     important differences in equipment calibration.\n       The designation of ``previously frozen'' poultry is \n     completely illogical. Poultry chilled to between 0 degrees \n     and 26 degrees never has met the proposed regulations \n     definition of ``frozen.'' How, then, can it accurately be \n     labeled ``previously frozen''?\n       As Members of Congress deeply concerned about food safety, \n     accurate labeling for consumers and fairness for all segments \n     of the poultry industry, we urge you in the strongest \n     possible terms to make several changes to the proposed rule.\n       First, we urge FSIS to select a temperature lower than 26 \n     degrees but higher than the current 0 degrees as the minimum \n     temperature at which poultry can receive a ``fresh'' \n     designation.\n       Second, we urge FSIS to consider a temperature variance \n     from that minimum to accommodate temperature shifts during \n     shipping and storage and to accommodate the important \n     differences in the calibration of temperature measuring \n     devices and refrigeration equipment. We would point out that \n     USDA's Agricultural Research Service, working in laboratory \n     settings, is able to control holding-chamber temperatures \n     only to within three degrees of the target temperature.\n       Finally, we urge you not to require a label designation for \n     poultry chilled to between 0 degrees and the minimum \n     temperature as necessary for ``fresh'' labeling.\n       These common sense changes will result in a regulation that \n     assures full labelling disclosure for consumers and the \n     safest possible shipment of fresh poultry products across the \n     nation.\n       Thank you for your attention to these recommendations; \n     please do not hesitate to contact us if you have additional \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n         David Pryor; Mitch McConnell; Howell Heflin; Thad \n           Cochran; Strom Thurmond; J. Bennett Johnston; James \n           Inhofe; Christopher S. Bond; Rod Grams; Don Nickles; \n           John Warner; Jesse Helms; Paul Coverdell; Trent Lott; \n           Richard C. Shelby; John B. Breaux; Sam Nunn; Lauch \n           Faircloth; Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, before yielding time for others to \ndiscuss their views on this, let me just say the temperature threshold \nand the negative labeling that the California poultry industry has been \npromoting has only one objective, and that is keeping competitive \nproducts out of the California market, to make those products appear \nless appealing to California consumers. I do not believe the Federal \nGovernment should take actions which, like it would in this instance, \ninfluence improperly interstate trade and commerce in this matter.\n  This issue has absolutely nothing to do with improving product \nquality, nothing to do with enhancing food safety. The regulations will \nnot improve consumer information or enhance consumer protection. This \nis an intraindustry trade dispute between California and the rest of \nthe country where poultry products are produced and sold in that \nmarket, and I hope that the Senate will reject the amendment to be \noffered by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was wondering how this debate would \nshape up because, to me, it is very straightforward. It is not about \nCalifornia; it is about common sense. The Agriculture Department, after \n8 long years, finally issues a rule that says if your chicken or your \nturkey is frozen, then you cannot put a ``fresh'' label on it.\n  Let me repeat that. If the chicken or turkey is frozen when you send \nit out of your State, you cannot mislead consumers and put a ``fresh'' \nlabel on it. Hurray, a victory for common sense, a victory for the \nright to know what we are purchasing.\n  I have shopped for my family for many years, and these things are \nimportant. So what happens in the Appropriations Committee? A sneak \nattack on a fair rule. They are not going to allow this rule to go into \neffect. I say to consumers all over the country, listen to this debate \nbecause you are going to hear words that have no meaning. You are going \nto hear words such as exporting and fairness and barriers. But those \nare not the issues. This is about truth in labeling.\n\n  Now, to prove my point that this is not just a California issue, I \nmight say on the Record to my friend, my chicken producers are for this \nrule, and my turkey producers are against this rule. I have business on \neither side. I line up with consumers. I hope you will, too, after \nlistening to some of the points that I will make.\n  Perdue Chicken, which is produced in New York, and has headquarters \nin the State of Maryland and offices in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, \nIndiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, \nsays, ``We are opposed to companies selling products as fresh when they \nhave been previously frozen or thawed.''\n  Perdue is not a California company. This is simple corporate \nresponsibility. What are we going to do in the U.S. Senate? I am glad \nit is not in the dead of night. At least it is in the day time and \neverybody can watch us. We are going to say that fresh is frozen and \nfrozen is fresh. This makes no sense at all, for anybody who has ever \ngone into a supermarket. I think most Americans have, and they \nunderstand this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may show you this \nchicken.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object. I make a point of order that \nthe display of any such product would violate rule 17 of the Senate \nrules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is correct.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have put away my frozen chicken. I will not bring it \nout in violation of the rules. I respect my friend's right to object to \nmy request. But what I was going to do was take that little chicken, \nwhich is frozen as hard as a rock and marked fresh, and put it on this \ntable, and it would have sounded like this. And everyone could see the \nlunacy of this debate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I could not agree with the Senator more. If you take a \nchicken frozen solid like that, one at zero degrees, and use it for a \nbowling ball, as a House Member did, or as a prop here, as you were \nproposing to do, I agree that is the sound it would make. But that is \nnot what this debate is about.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time, because I have \nlimited time, that is exactly what this debate is about. When my friend \nspeaks, he can say what he thinks it is about. It is about taking a \nproduct that is frozen to one degree--what human being can say that one \ndegree is not frozen--\n\n[[Page S13758]]\nand enabling producers to mark it ``fresh.'' Why? Because they want to \nget more money for a frozen product. That is what this is all about. \nThey want to get more money by marking it ``fresh.''\n  So I would have shown you this chicken, hard as a rock, marked \n``fresh.''\n  My friends objected, and I respect their right to object. So I will \nshow you a picture instead. I know they cannot object to that. As you \ncan see, there is a frozen chicken being used as a bowling ball headed \nfor these pins and, as a result, I think some of them were knocked \ndown. Now, do we believe for a minute that a chicken that is frozen \nlike this should be marked ``fresh'' if it can knock down bowling pins?\n  Now, if I told you this desk was a chair, you would think I was \nkidding. And if I told you summer was winter, and ice was hot, warm was \nfreezing, ovens were freezers, and freezers were toasters, you would \nsend me to the nearest psychiatrist. And you would be right.\n  I do not know what came over the committee, but let me read you the \ndefinition of fresh. This is out of Webster's Dictionary: ``Fresh: \nRecently made, produced, or harvested, not preserved as by canning, \nsmoking, or freezing.''\n  Yet, my friends on the committee say that if a chicken or a turkey is \nfrozen to one degree, it can be marked fresh. Let me remind you what \nWebster said: ``. . . not preserved as by freezing.''\n  ``Frozen: Made into, or covered with, or surrounded by ice; preserved \nby freezing.''\n  That is frozen. ``Immobile.'' I will add one: It knocks down bowling \npins. Chickens that are that hard are not fresh, they are frozen. And \neveryone with a pulse, I think, understands that.\n  We have tried to straighten this mess out for 8 long years, and \nspecial interests come in every time and kill it. This time, the \nClinton administration had the guts to issue this rule, and the \nAppropriations Committee--by the way, whose chairman said--and he is my \nfriend, and I work with him and I admire him, and we just worked \ntogether on an issue--that we really should not do these things on \nappropriations bills, in relation to an article that appeared today. He \nsaid he does not believe in making policy on spending bills in relation \nto the mink program.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, on his own time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am not quoted in that article. My \noffice said something to the effect that I did not think policy should \nbe established on appropriations bills. I am not sure my staff said \nthat. My staff told me they told this reporter that I did not favor \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. That was one reason why I was \nopposing that amendment. I am not advocating legislation on this bill. \nI am saying no funds shall be used to carry out this regulation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend and colleague, he is a very smart \nMember of this Senate. He is terrific. He gets his way a lot around \nhere. A lot of the time he is right, and he should get his way. But if \nthis is not legislating on an appropriations bill, I do not know what \nis. This is a rule that is going to go into effect so that when \nconsumers go to the supermarket, they will know whether the chicken \nthey buy is fresh or frozen. We are stopping it dead here in the \nAppropriations Committee, simply saying no funds shall be spent to \nenforce it. Well, if it cannot be enforced, then there is no rule. So \nwe know what we are talking about here.\n  This rule is a victory for common sense. That is why the Consumer \nFederation supports the rule. That is why Citizen Action supports the \nrule, and Public Voice supports the rule, and Public Citizen supports \nthe rule. Look at all the people who are for the rule. My friends say \nit is a California issue. Why do we have the National Association of \nMeat Producers and Meat Purveyors and all kinds of national unions, and \nthe Oregon Broiler Growers Association and Pacific Egg and Poultry \nAssociation? As I told you, there are all these consumer groups and \nveterinary groups, et cetera.\n  Studies show consumers are willing to pay more for products that are \nfresh. These are their hard-earned dollars. They should be getting what \nthey are paying for: a fresh product. And, by the way, there is nothing \nwrong with buying frozen produce, nothing at all. Some people prefer to \ndo that.\n  Let me give you another serious problem with this. You go to the \nsupermarket and buy a frozen product, it is defrosted, marked \n``fresh,'' so you think it is fresh. You go home and put it in your \nfreezer. Then you defrost it again before you cook it. That could be \ndangerous to your health.\n  I have to say that this rule is very gentle on the people that my \nfriends represent in Arkansas and in the Southern States. Why do I say \nthat? Because it does not say they have to label it ``frozen'' until it \ngets down to zero. They can use the term, quote, ``hard chilled.'' So \nthe Department of Agriculture bent over backward. In my mind, if it is \n10 degrees, it is frozen. They are allowed to say ``hard chilled.'' \nThat is a commonsense rule that looks out for those producers that my \nfriends represent.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 49 minutes, 23 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 51 minutes and 42 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see my friend, the senior Senator from California has \njoined me. I will yield the Senator 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from California and I thank the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the committee amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to strike the committee language to ensure truthful \nlabeling of poultry and poultry products.\n  Let me say first that the committee language in the fiscal year 1996 \nagriculture appropriations bill flies in the face of the consumer. It \nprevents the Department of Agriculture from implementing a new and \ncommonsense regulation on what poultry products can be labeled as \n``fresh.''\n  I might parenthetically say I never thought when I came to the U.S. \nSenate we would be debating this on the floor.\n  Be that as it is, I must say, Mr. President, I find it astonishing \nthat any business engaged in the processing of food products can call \nsomething ``fresh'' when it has been frozen as hard as a rock. The \nwhole thrust of Federal food labeling over the past several decades has \nbeen to provide consumers with accurate information about the quality \nand contents of the food they buy.\n  Existing departmental guidelines regarding poultry are really wrong. \nThey allow consumers to be deceived into thinking they are choosing \nbetween two equally attractive pieces of poultry, when in fact one has \nbeen frozen to zero degrees and then thawed, while the other has never \nbeen frozen at all.\n  The consumer has a right to know if a chicken has been previously \nfrozen. If it has, then it is not fresh.\n  The new Department of Agriculture Food and Safety Inspection Service \nrule, which is scheduled to take effect next year, ensures that the \nlabeling corresponds with reality.\n  The new rule sets three labeling categories: First, poultry products \nwhich have never been chilled below poultry's freezing level of 26 \ndegrees may be labeled as fresh. Second, hard chilled: Poultry products \nwhich have been chilled below 26 degrees but above zero degrees must be \nlabeled as hard chilled. Third, frozen: Poultry products which have \nbeen chilled at zero degrees or below must be labeled as frozen or \npreviously frozen.\n  It makes sense. However, until this new rule goes into effect, the \npoultry industry can use the term ``fresh'' on poultry that has been \nchilled down to zero degrees. In practice, this means that chicken and \nturkeys are being labeled and sold as fresh when, in fact, they have \nbeen frozen rock solid.\n  For example, in California, Foster Farms and Zacky Foods, among \nothers, sell fresh chicken, while previously frozen chicken shipped in \nfrom Southern producers can also bear the ``fresh'' label.\n  In the Washington, DC, market, Perdue Farms sells fresh chicken, but \n\n[[Page S13759]]\n  labeling does not tell consumers that Tyson and Wampler chickens have \nbeen frozen.\n  Similarly, while Farmers Pride in Pennsylvania, Plainsville Farms in \nNew York, and Sunset Acres Farm in Maine sell fresh poultry, their \ncompetitors who sell previously frozen poultry can also use the \n``fresh'' label.\n  This situation makes a mockery of the label and misinforms consumers \nabout the actual freshness of the product.\n  This most certainly is not reasonable, and it does not meet the \nexpectations of today's consumers.\n  According to a telephone survey conducted by ICR Survey Research \nGroup in June 1994, the vast majority--75 percent--of the public does \nnot think chicken which has been shipped or stored below 26 degrees \nshould be called ``fresh.''\n  The vast majority of the public questioned, 86 percent, said it was \ninappropriate to label as ``fresh'' chicken which has been stored below \n26 degrees and then thawed out.\n  Four out of five consumers, 81 percent, said yes there is a \ndifference between chicken which has never been frozen and chicken \nwhich has been frozen and thawed out.\n  By a margin of five to one, those questioned rated ``never frozen'' \nchicken as superior to chicken which had been ``previously frozen.''\n  That is the rub. Clearly, the consumer, if possible, would prefer to \nbuy fresh chicken.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, once food is thawed, when \nit is refrozen there may be a loss of quality due to high loss of \nmoisture. Consumers certainly think so.\n  Consumers have a preference for fresh poultry and--this is the rub, \nas well--they are willing to pay a higher price for it. They should be \ngetting, we think, what they are paying for.\n  As in many issues of national importance, California has taken the \nlead on truthful labeling of poultry products. In 1993, California \nenacted a law restricting the use of the term ``fresh'' on labels of \npoultry that have been chilled at or below 25 degrees and to allow the \nuse of the term ``fresh'' only on poultry that has been kept above 25 \ndegrees. However, the court subsequently ruled that California law was \npreempted by Federal law, which prohibits States from imposing labeling \nrequirements that are different from, or in addition to, the Federal \nrequirements.\n  California is preempted, even though California says what is fresh is \nfresh, and what is frozen is frozen, and never the twain will meet, and \nwe will show you with our law. Bingo--they are preempted by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In response to the consumers' continued demand for truthful labeling, \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture accepted its responsibility, and \nafter a 15-month rulemaking process, the Department is prepared to \nimplement truthful labeling.\n  The Department of Agriculture's new poultry labeling rule, we \nbelieve, is reasonable and fair to both consumers and the poultry \nindustry. Not only does it ensure truthful labeling of fresh poultry \nand protect the consumers' right to know, it provides a new category of \n``hard chilled'' and gives the industry 1 year to comply, allowing \nample time to use up inventories of existing labels and make the \nnecessary changes.\n  Accurate and truthful labeling is strongly supported by national \nconsumer groups--the National Consumer League, the Public Voice for \nFood and Health Policy, and the Consumer Federation of America.\n  The committee language, on the other hand, will prohibit the \nDepartment from proceeding with its own order.\n  Unless the Department of Agriculture is permitted to implement its \nnew poultry labeling rule, frozen poultry products will continue to be \nfalsely labeled.\n  We do not allow fish which has been frozen to be labeled as fresh. We \nshould not allow poultry to be mislabeled, either.\n  Let us, Mr. President, make the Federal Government be honest about \nwhat is fresh and what is frozen. Otherwise, we face the prospect of \nallowing the American public to be conned into going to Antarctica to \nlie on the beach.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me simply say in response to the \ndistinguished Senator from California who has just spoken, on this \nissue of frozen and fresh, I happened to receive a letter from someone \nin California telling me her views on this issue, back when we were all \ncorresponding with the Food Safety Inspection Service about this \nproposed regulation. I am going to read this letter and ask unanimous \nconsent a copy of it be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is from Dr. Ann R. Stasch, who lives, according to \nthe return address, in Northridge, CA. She writes it to me, Senator \nThad Cochran, ``Chair,'' she says, ``of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.''\n\n       Dear Senator Cochran: I am interested in the frozen/fresh \n     chicken controversy.\n\n  This is a handwritten letter. This is a handwritten letter.\n\n       I have recently retired as a University Professor of Food \n     and Nutrition. As a consumer, I find little difference in the \n     frozen and unfrozen chicken with regard to the state of \n     thawing. The only chickens which are completely thawed, \n     regardless of state of origin, are, for the most part, those \n     on periodic price reduction sales. It has been my experience \n     that wholly thawed at purchase chickens are often those which \n     have been in storage the longest. These frequently have less \n     flavor.\n       I prefer partially frozen (that is, not totally thawed) \n     chicken when I purchase chicken, as chicken fat develops \n     rancidity rather quickly. There are local differences in \n     color of fat preferences by consumers and California chickens \n     have a generally more yellow colored fat than southern \n     chickens. If a chicken is going to sit 3 or 4 days between \n     harvest and sale, it would probably be preferable that it be \n     frozen, no matter the point of origin. It would be \n     unfortunate if partially frozen chicken could not be sold at \n     a regular price.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ann R. Stasch.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield some time on my time to respond?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to yield for a question. I have other \nSenators I want to yield to for purposes of----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was asking if the Senator will yield for a moment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have the right to the floor now, but I do intend to \nyield to a Senator, as the Senator from California has yielded to a \nSenator on her side. It was my intention to yield to a Senator on our \nside, but I will be glad to yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will put it in the form of a question. Is the Senator \naware there are 32 million people in the State of California?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I know it is a big State.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is a big State, and this is one person's opinion. Is \nthe Senator aware that clearly we are going to enable this woman to buy \nfrozen products? We just want to make sure they will be marked \n``frozen'' or ``previously chilled'' or ``hard chilled.'' This would \nnot stop this woman from buying frozen. It would just make her choice \neven clearer.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thought the Senate would benefit, Mr. President--I \nwill reclaim my time--from a point of view which apparently is a \nthoughtful point of view by someone who is a recently retired \nuniversity professor in the subject of food and nutrition.\n  Mr. President, I want to yield to my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi such time as he may require.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Northridge, CA,\n\n                                                   April 21, 1995.\n     Senator Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, USDA, Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: I am interested in the frozen/fresh \n     chicken controversy.

Stasch.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nagriculture appropriations subcommittee for yielding me this time. I \nwould like to go back and reiterate, for a moment, the process that is \ninvolved here.\n  On August 25 of this year, the Secretary of Agriculture revised \nregulations that imposed what I consider to be misleading restrictions \non labeling of raw poultry products as ``fresh.'' This regulation was \ndesigned, as I understand it, by the California poultry industry, to \nmake it difficult for competing poultry products from other sections of \nthe country to be marketed in California without jeopardizing product \nquality.\n  Here is an important point. This new regulation is to take effect \nAugust 1996.\n  Senator Cochran's language in the bill would prohibit implementation \nof this regulation. That is very strongly supported by the ranking \nmember. That will give us time to consider this matter further, to make \nsure the regulation is properly drafted and to make sure it is fair. \nThat is all that Senator Cochran does, in this language in the bill.\n  The Agriculture Committee, the authorization committee, has not even \nhad hearings on this matter. It is very important to all of the \ndifferent parties involved. I believe the poultry industry would be \nvery happy to work with the agriculture authorization committee and \nwith all those interested and involved, both on the Appropriations \nCommittee and from the State of California and all the other States \naffected, to come up with a regulation that is fair and that we can all \nlive with.\n  So I wanted to emphasize this. This regulation is not even scheduled \nto go into effect until August 1996. We have the time to look at this \nmatter very carefully. Funds should not be used to implement, start \nimplementing this regulation until we have had hearings and really \nthought it through carefully.\n  The purpose of the provision is to require that the Secretary of \nAgriculture develop and implement a more reasonable regulation. Pleas \nwere made to the Secretary of Agriculture to do that. It does not \nprevent the Secretary from eventually imposing a final rule.\n  The fresh poultry regulation that we are dealing with right now is \ngoing to cause major problems. For instance, in my own State of \nMississippi, if a poultry firm ships a load of poultry from our State \nto California at 28 degrees, but it is unloaded and put in a freezer \nset at 26 or 24 degrees, it will be labeled ``hard chilled.'' The \nsender of this poultry, Sanderson Farms, in this case, followed all the \nprocedures but its poultry would have to have a stamp which the \nconsumer would mistake for it being frozen. When you ship something at \n28 degrees, it is not hard frozen. It is not a bowling ball. And it is \ngenerally considered to still be in a very fresh state. Yet, once it \ngets to the State of California how it is handled could determine how \nit is labeled and could very much impact the sales in that State.\n  USDA's final rule also ignored the fact, in my opinion, that 23,000 \nof the 26,000 comments received objected to all or portions of the \nproposal. Ironically, the rule even ignores USDA's own study, done by \nthe Agricultural Research Service, demonstrating that consumers cannot \ndetect any quality differences, as pointed out by the letter from the \nlady in California, between poultry chilled to 26 degrees and products \nchilled to lower temperatures.\n  The same USDA study showed that, under ideal laboratory conditions, \ntemperatures can only be controlled within plus or minus 2 degrees. \nNevertheless, some reason, something caused USDA to go ahead and \nimplement this regulation without providing any temperature variations \nor tolerances in the final rule, and that is critical. There must be \nsome tolerance, some allowance for variation.\n  Also, I might note for those who represent pork and beef producing \nareas--and we have both of those in my own State--I think we need to be \ncareful if we start down this road toward what can be considered, I \nbelieve, mislabeling. In the case of pork and beef, already, in order \nto be able to handle them better, products are brought below 26 \ndegrees. Trim products from beef and pork boning operations are frozen. \nThey are later thawed and used in ground beef and pork sausage sold as \nfresh. Frozen beef is mixed with fresh to get a mixture that forms well \nin patty equipment. Frozen lamb is routinely thawed at retail and sold \nfresh. Bacon is routinely chilled to below 26 degrees Fahrenheit to aid \nin slicing.\n  So, I just think what the Senator is trying to do here with the \nsupport of the senior Senator from Arkansas is say let us stop now, \nbefore we implement a rule that is misleading and unfair. Let us think \nabout it. Let us talk about it. Let us have hearings on it. Then we can \ncome up with a rule that we think everybody can live with.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the action of the committee and \noppose the amendment by the Senator from California.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from California.\n  Recently, USDA issued a final rule prohibiting poultry that has ever \nbeen chilled below 26 degrees from being called fresh. Under the new \nrule, poultry chilled below zero degrees would be labeled frozen, \npoultry chilled between zero and 26 degrees would be labeled hard \nchilled, and poultry held above 26 degrees would be labeled fresh.\n  All we are asking for is a little common sense.\n  The language in the committee's bill is simply designed to ensure \nthat before implementing any new regulations on this matter, USDA \naddress three issues: First, the temperature variance; second, the \nlanguage on the label; and third, to ensure consumer health and safety \nis fully protected.\n  The USDA's new poultry labeling rule does not allow for a temperature \nvariance. As it stands, a poultry product could drop one-tenth of a \ndegree below the cutoff assigned by USDA, and it would have to be \nrelabeled. Yet USDA's own studies show it is impossible to maintain a \nrefrigerated product's temperature to within 2 degrees of the target \ntemperature. Imagine transporting a refrigerated truck long distances, \nthrough a variety of climates, and many stops and handlers. There needs \nto be some degree of flexibility in this rule to permit for those types \nof variations.\n  But I think the key words here are long distances. I hope no one is \nfooled by this debate. The issue here is competition--competition from \nout-of-State producers. Certain producers just do not want to compete \nwith products from out of State. Maybe their production costs are too \nhigh, maybe they are not as efficient, or maybe they just do not want \nthe competition. But the consumer does. The consumers I hear from want \nthe greatest possible selection of safe foods at the lowest price. They \ndo not care if their chicken comes from California or Arkansas or \nVirginia. They just want the highest quality product at the lowest \nprice.\n  In case there is any doubt about what is a stake here, let me tell a \nstory. A few months ago, I opened a Richmond, VA, paper and saw an add \nurging Virginians to call me and express their displeasure with my \nposition on this issue. Obviously someone was very concerned for \nVirginia consumers. But down at the bottom of the add, in small print, \nwere eight very telling words: ``Paid for by the California Poultry \nIndustry Federation.''\n  Second, USDA has resorted to some unique terminology. Before USDA got \ninto this there were two kinds of chicken: fresh and frozen. Simple \nenough. You went to the store, read the label, bought your chicken, and \nyou were finished. Common sense.\n  Now, according to USDA, there are three kinds of chicken: fresh, \nfrozen, and hard chilled. Some might call that an improvement. I call \nit confusing. As the junior Senator from California said earlier: ``You \nwill hear words that have no meaning.'' Well there are two.\n  Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League said \n``Consumers generally are familiar with the \n\n[[Page S13761]]\nterms fresh and frozen. Now we have to educate them about what it means \nwhen something is `hard chilled.''' Once again, regulatory zeal \ndisplaces common sense, and consumers need to be reeducated by those \nwho know better.\n  But why not just call it fresh, frozen, or ``from somewhere other \nthan California.'' I guess hard chilled is more concise.\n  Whatever term USDA selects to describe this new category of poultry, \nit should be a neutral term, not one that denigrates the product, \nconfuses the consumer, or that benefits one market segment over \nanother.\n  Mr. President, the committee bill in no way hinders the regulatory \nprocess. We ask simply for a level playing field. In the end, I am \nconvinced that sound science and common sense will prevail. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I, likewise, am very supportive of the action taken by \nthe committee on which I am privileged to serve, the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and, indeed, the position taken by the distinguished floor \nmanagers.\n  I just wish to propound a question here. I think we should have a \nlittle colloquy among us on this issue, because I think the only \nconcern that remains is not all the technical business about the \ntemperatures and everything, but did our committee--it is I my \nunderstanding we did as a committee--take into consideration the fact \nthat our action as a committee would in no way jeopardize the health of \nthe consumers? That is the bottom line. I am satisfied it does not, but \nI think it would be wise if we had the distinguished floor managers \naddress that issue, and perhaps other Senators who might likewise wish \nto address it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to \nrespond. The Appropriations Committee has been questioning witnesses \nfrom the administration on this issue for some time. I can remember 2 \nyears ago, the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] was chairman of this \nsubcommittee. At our regular hearing on the budget request this came \nup. We have talked about it. It is not a new issue. The issue is not \nwhether we want to ensure that these food products are safe and healthy \nand do not in any way jeopardize human health because there is no \nquestion about that. This does not in any way put at risk any \nconsumers.\n  All we are saying, as the distinguished Senator from Mississippi so \neloquently put it--we are asking for time to review this in the \nCommittee on Agriculture, for example, on which the Senator has served. \nWe have not had hearings, as Senator Lott pointed out. And the \nAgriculture Committee, that has jurisdiction over this legislation, \nought to look at it and ought to have an opportunity to be heard in \nsome official way, in my view, as controversial and as far-reaching and \nas unfair as many say this is; that it is protectionist regulation and \nthat the administration has simply ignored some of the facts about how \nthis poultry industry does business and what is used, in terms of \nchilling, to protect consumers, really.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is a very satisfactory response to my \nquestion. As I said, I serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee. We \nwill have hearings.\n  But in this period of time that is embraced by the proposal, which I \nsupport, of the Appropriations Committee, those hearings will take \nplace. But we also give assurance to the people that we have primarily \nexplored this question as to whether or not the current processing and \ntransportation will in any way affect health and safety, and the answer \nis, flat out, ``No, it will not.'' That is very important.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of the Senator, I put \nin the Record at the beginning of this discussion a copy of the letter \nthat actually was written on your letterhead, signed by 19 Senators, \nfully discussed from the point of view that the proposed regulations \nwere unfair, and why, and that we have the interest of consumers at \nheart as well as fairness in the poultry industry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership on \nthis issue. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi.\n  By coincidence, I was in the valley of Virginia yesterday on the \noccasion of the anniversary of the date of the Third Battle of \nWinchester, which was a very significant engagement during the Civil \nWar. And I had a chance to meet with some of my constituents because \nour poultry industry in large part is in that historic valley of \nVirginia of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I know these people so well. I \nhave grown up with them and have been with them all of my life. They \nwould not even think of asking the Federal Government or the Congress \nor anyone else to do something that in any way jeopardized the health \nof the American people.\n  We export millions of birds daily from that area of Virginia--all \nover the United States; indeed, all over the world. It is a very \nsignificant industry, but an industry operated in large measure by the \nfamily farmers as we know them, co-ops and so forth. And these people \nare gravely concerned that someone might raise the allegation, ``Well, \nyou are doing something that would jeopardize the health of the \nAmerican people.''\n  I am glad that we have put that issue to rest. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to two comments that were made \nhere, one by the Senator from Mississippi, which was echoed by the \nSenator from Virginia. Sometimes I wonder where I am. Is this ``Alice \nin Wonderland''? On October 13, 1994, in a unanimous vote by the U.S. \nSenate on poultry labeling:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the United States \n     Department of Agriculture should carry out the plans of the \n     department to hold public hearings for the purpose of \n     receiving public input on issues related to the condition \n     under which poultry sold in U.S. may be labeled fresh; and, \n     (b) finalize and publish a position on the issue as \n     expeditiously as possible after holding those hearings, and \n     no person serving on the expert advisory committee shall have \n     a conflict of interest.\n\n  That passed overwhelmingly. It is the law.\n  Now Senators stand up here and say ``not enough time, not enough \nhearings.'' That is extraordinary. We asked them to do this. Public Law \n103-354, October 13, 1994. We said, ``Do this expeditiously.'' And now, \n``Not enough time. This is not fair. Not enough time.''\n  What a way to kill a commonsense rule. It is not even based on the \ntruth and the facts.\n  The other comment was that the Department of Agriculture did not \nlisten to the people who wrote in on this rule. The truth is they \ndiscarded the form letters that came from employees of Tyson Poultry, \nand other companies on both sides of the issue, because they had a \nconflict of interest. Sure, they were consumers, but they worked for \nthese companies. They wanted to make sure that they were not making \nthis rule based on what people who have an economic conflict of \ninterest believe, but what is in the best interest of consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Public Law 103-\n354, October 13, 1994, asking the Department of Agriculture to pass a \nrule that was fair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 301. POULTRY LABELING.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Department of Agriculture should--\n       (A) carry out the plans of the Department to hold public \n     hearings for the purpose of receiving public input on issues \n     related to the conditions under which poultry sold in the \n     United States may be labeled ``fresh''; and\n       (B) finalize and publish a decision on the issues as \n     expeditiously as possible after holding the hearings; and\n       (2) no person serving on the expert advisory committee \n     established to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on the \n     issues should stand to profit, or represent any interest that \n     would stand to profit, from the decision of the Department on \n     the issues.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you ask the average person, ``If a \nchicken is frozen to 10 or 20 degrees, is it frozen,'' they would say \nyes. The Department of Agriculture in its rule did not even force them \nto do that; it said you can \n\n[[Page S13762]]\nmarket hard chill. And no one is up here saying that it is bad to buy a \nfrozen chicken or turkey at all. All we are saying--the Consumer \nFederation of America and all the consumer groups that are lined up \nbehind this rule--is, you have a right to know. You should know. It is \nonly fair to know. Consumers now know how much fat there is in a \nproduct. I hope we all support that. That is an important health issue.\n  We know how many vitamins there are, how many minerals there are, how \nmany calories there are, and how much protein there is. Should they not \nknow if the product has been frozen? It affects the taste. It affects \nthe price. It affects whether or not they will throw it in the freezer \nagain because we know that is not a good thing to do if it has been \ndefrosted once or twice.\n  Again, we hear a lot of talk about, oh, let us hold off. Do you know, \nmy friends, when this all started? It was more than 8 years ago now \nbecause it was under the Bush administration. Eight years ago the Bush \nadministration attempted to solve this problem. My colleagues came on \nthe floor, ``We need more time.'' How about 100 years? How much time \ndoes it take to understand that fresh is fresh and frozen is frozen? I \nthink it is a no-brainer. But then again, others may disagree.\n  Truth in labeling should be a practice in this country. And the only \nreason I can see why people oppose this is--you guessed it--money. You \ncan get more money for a fresh product, and they know they cannot \ndeliver it fresh. So they freeze it, but they market fresh. And it is \nhighway robbery, if you really want to get down to it, for the \nconsumers of America. How are we going to do this?\n  I do not know where these votes are going to come out here, but I \nknow there is an awful lot of money behind it. And if this Senate votes \ntoday that frozen is fresh, I do not know. That will be a low point for \nme in terms of common sense.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from California to strike a provision requiring the Department \nof Agriculture to report back to Congress with a new rule regarding \npoultry labeling. Both consumer groups and the poultry industry support \nthe development of new labeling rules which are fair and based on \nscientific data about consumer views regarding descriptive labeling \nterms. But instead of taking this approach, the USDA arbitrarily \nestablished temperature ranges and descriptive terms which have no \nbasis in science, marketplace experience, or consumer preference, and \nhave never been heard of before.\n  Moreover, in issuing its recent labeling rule, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture ignored 23,000 comments which it received in opposition to \nthe proposed rule change. And it is worth mentioning that they only \nreceived 4,000 in support of the rule change, and these all primarily \nfrom one State.\n  This rule discriminates against poultry producers which market their \nproducts nationwide, and most agricultural products are marketed \nnationwide. But this rule carves out regional markets where local \nproducers can sell their product free from out-of-State competition. It \nsimply is a barrier to trade. Thus, in the end, this new rule is not at \nall proconsumer. It is anticompetitive and will result in higher \nconsumer prices and protected markets where regional producers will \nreap monopolistic benefits.\n  The very day that Secretary Glickman was confirmed by the Senate, I \ncame to the floor and voiced my concerns about this issue, which at the \ntime was still in the form of a proposed rule.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed and surprised that Secretary \nGlickman has allowed his Department to issue a final rule with as many \nflaws as this one has. I am shocked that he would tolerate the \ndevelopment of a major labeling rule with total disregard for \nscientific data or consumer views. He has allowed the USDA to pick the \nterm ``hard chilled'' out of thin air. It is a term that has never \nexisted in the poultry industry before. I have been around the industry \nall my life and had never heard the term. It is a totally meaningless \nterm. There are absolutely no market data to support the \nappropriateness of the term, and there is no history of it ever having \nbeen used in the poultry industry.\n  Another problem with the USDA labeling rule is that it totally fails \nto provide for temperature variance for products shipped over long \ndistances.\n  Common sense tells you that when you load a truck in Virginia and \ndrive it across country to California, it is impossible to maintain an \nexact, no-variance temperature. I know from personal experience you \njust simply cannot maintain the temperature without any variance \nwhatsoever as it travels through different climates and different time \nzones en route to its final destination. But what does a variance of 1 \ndegree matter anyway?\n  In addition to the weather problems, the shippers also have to \ncontend with cooling equipment, which is simply not that exact. \nCalibrating a thermostat to maintain a product temperature at exactly \n26 degrees is a very inexact science and impossible to do. However, the \nUSDA rule provides no temperature tolerance.\n  This is totally an unreasonable and farfetched idea, and it is \ncompletely unacceptable. A real proconsumer rule would be based on \nscientific data and would ensure competitive prices for poultry \nconsumers throughout the Nation. The existing USDA rule accomplishes \nneither.\n  I encourage Secretary Glickman to revise the existing rules in a \nmanner consistent with fairness, objectivity, and real marketplace \ncompetitiveness. Therefore, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from California and urge its defeat. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was prepared to yield some time to the \ndistinguished Senators from Arkansas. I am going to let them decide \nwhich one goes first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 32 minutes on the side of the \nSenator from Mississippi, 33 minutes on the side of the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] would like to have on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let the Record show that the junior Senator \nfrom Arkansas was certainly willing to yield to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Arkansas to make his statement at this time. I have \nbeen looking forward to that statement. I think he, as the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, along with our friend from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, is doing a very good job of putting this issue exactly \nwhere it should be placed, and that is it is not an issue, in my \nopinion and I think in the opinion of many of my colleagues, of \nconsumer protection. It is an issue basically of the protection of the \nState of California. That is where we see this issue coming down.\n  There is something missing about this debate, I might say, Mr. \nPresident, that is disconcerting to me, which I think, and hope, will \ndeserve a response certainly, if I could elicit one, from my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer. I am hoping to find out why the issue \nof only poultry--only poultry--is today before the Senate in this so-\ncalled great debate between frozen and fresh poultry products.\n  Mr. President, it is a known fact that beef, that pork, that fish may \nbe frozen at any degree and they are not affected as the Senator from \nCalifornia, or I should say the Senators from California, would attempt \nto affect the products of poultry especially from the South and the \nSoutheastern part of the United States.\n  I might say, also, Mr. President, that the Senator from Mississippi \nhas rightfully offered his amendment and placed it into this basic \nlegislation, into the committee bill. The Senator from Mississippi is \nnot trying to obliterate what the U.S. Department of Agriculture is \nattempting to do. He is simply trying to say that any regulation in \nthis area, \n\n[[Page S13763]]\nassuming that we would have hearings, as the Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, has stated on the issue, that the Committees of \nAgriculture in the House and the Senate must approve ultimately any \nlanguage that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would adopt in \nimposing and, I might say, implementing such a far-reaching, sweeping \nregulation, in regulatory language.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also needful, or let us say worthwhile, \nat this point for us to sort of go back just a couple of years and see \nhow this issue got to the Senate in this form.\n  First, about 2 or 3 years ago, the State of California passed a law \nto prohibit fresh labeling as has been under discussion today. I think, \nif I am not mistaken, that was in 1992 or 1993. The American Meat \nInstitute and the National Broiler Council and others took this issue \nto court, in fact to the Federal court. The court held, with the \nsupport of the Department of Agriculture, that this particular law \npassed by the State of California was preempting Federal law and \ntherefore basically was struck down. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \nthen, Mr. President, agreed to review this regulation and issued an \ninterim or a proposed rule.\n  During the rulemaking process, as other Members of the Senate have \nmentioned this morning, during that particular time of several weeks \nwhen people could comment on how they felt about this rule about to be \nproposed, or which assumingly was going to be proposed by the \nDepartment of Agriculture, of the 26,000 comments that came in, 23,000 \nstated they felt that the regulation went too far.\n  We think it also interesting to note, and perhaps the Record could be \nmade clear on this, we do not know of any consumer in the State of \nCalifornia who objected to this labeling process that we have had so \nlong, that has been so fair. We do not know of any consumer in Senator \nBoxer's or Senator Feinstein's State who has objected to this process.\n  Who objected? The California Poultry Association, which is an \nassociation made up of California poultry producers who might not be as \nefficient as those throughout the South and the Southeast in the field \nof poultry production.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I think that there is no scientific basis \ntoday that we can see for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \narbitrary selection of 26 degrees as the threshold temperature for \ndetermining whether poultry is fresh. In fact, some say that if you \nkept poultry at 26 degrees, it might well spoil.\n  What this is, I think, is a nontariff trade barrier erected by the \nCalifornia poultry industry, not brought about by California consumers. \nThere is no objection from California consumers that we know of. \nPerhaps we might even consider initiating new GATT or NAFTA rounds for \na trade agreement among the States, involving the State of California \nand these particular poultry concerns that they are raising this \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, we have time to hold hearings. And with the Cochran \namendment in place, if it is kept in place, we are certainly willing \nand, I think, able to work out a fair solution to the issue of fresh \nversus frozen poultry.\n  I sincerely hope that the Senate will defeat the amendment offered by \nour very good and distinguished friends, the Senators from California, \nSenator Boxer and Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might \nconsume.\n  Let me say to my dear friend from Arkansas that he is correct that \nthere were 26,000 comments. Now, 22,000 comments came from people who \nwere employed in the chicken business in his home State and other \nSouthern States, so I do understand their point of view. Of course I \ndo.\n  A couple thousand came in from California, also people employed by \nthe chicken industry there. So when they were making a decision, \nobviously people with a special concern do not carry as much weight as \npeople who are not economically affected.\n  Let me tell you about that, because the Senators from Arkansas keep \nmaking this a California issue. As I said before, I have a split in my \nState. I have the chicken people backing this rule, and the turkey \npeople strongly opposing it. I have come down on the side of consumers. \nAs the Senator knows, it is hard when your State is not united. In this \ncase, the Senator from Arkansas's State is pretty much united.\n  Let me say that I have a breakdown of the comments: 611 from poultry \nprocessors and growers, clearly with a special concern; 23 from trade \nassociations; 12 from State government agencies; 6 from academia; 6 \nfrom consumer organizations; 5 from congressional Members; 3 from chefs \nwho are interested in this issue; 2 from retailers; and 4 from other \nsources. And the vast majority of the individual letters were on \ncompany forms.\n  So I think it is hard to learn a lot from that. I think we all know \nif we are concerned that a rule might impact our economic abilities, of \ncourse we are going to write, and I support those people. But I think \nwe have to cut to the bottom line here, which is, what is fair and what \nis just and what is right?\n  Clearly, the Senate is on record asking the Agriculture Department to \nissue this rule or this kind of a rule, which I think bends over \nbackward. They did not say that produce under 26 degrees must be marked \nfrozen--it allows the producers in Arkansas to mark those products \n``hard chilled'' down to zero degrees--only when they go below zero. I \nalso think it important that I place in the Record, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to do so, a statement of the administration about this move by \nthe Appropriations Committee to essentially cancel this rule or, if you \nwill, I will say in nice terms, to deep-six this rule or to put it in a \nhard freeze.\n  This is what the administration says:\n\n       The administration is strongly opposed to the committee \n     bill's prohibition on the use of funds to implement or \n     enforce the final regulation on fresh and frozen poultry, \n     which was published on August 25, 1995. Publication of this \n     regulation was the culmination of nearly 2 years of effort, \n     during which the views of all stakeholders were heard and \n     considered. The issue of proper labeling of poultry products \n     has been the subject of litigation in Federal court as well \n     as congressional- and USDA-sponsored public hearings \n     throughout the Nation. Committee language would prevent \n     consumers from receiving accurate information and assurance \n     of a national standard in this area and could result in \n     disparate and conflicting State enforcement activity.\n\n  I think this is important coming from the administration:\n\n       The committee's language represents unwarranted legislative \n     intrusion into the regulatory process.\n\n  We all know here that we are opposed to regulation that overreaches. \nBut in this particular case, I say to my friend, the Senate itself \nvoted, urging the Department of Agriculture to produce this rule, and \nnow when they produce a rule that bends over backward to be fair--it \ntakes them 2 years, public hearings all over the country--there is a \nbackdoor attempt to stop it from going into effect.\n  I also want to make this other point. We keep hearing this is a \nCalifornia issue. I already told my friend that the California poultry \nindustry is split on it, but I also want my friend from Arkansas to \nknow that other States have passed labeling laws that mirror or are \nsimilar to this rule. Those States are: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, \nIllinois, New York, Oregon, and Washington.\n  So clearly, these other State legislatures are waking up to the fact \nthat their consumers deserve truth in labeling.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of those States \nand the types of laws that they have.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Irell & Manella,\n\n                                                 January 25, 1994.\n     To: Team\n     From: Matthew Sloan.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     File: NBC v.

California (organic).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope I have debunked the myth that this \nis a California issue. Certainly, there is support among parts of our \npoultry industry for this rule, but it is not universal. The main issue \nhere is, do the consumers have a right to know? They already know the \nfat content, they already know the calorie content, they already know \nthe minerals in products, they already know the vitamins, protein. For \ngoodness' sake, they ought to know if a product has been frozen or deep \nfrosted, and exactly what they are getting when they pay their hard-\nearned dollars.\n  I just have to say, again, I understand that colleagues must fight \nfor their States, and I understand that completely. When you have a \nState that ships these products out, I understand why you would be here \nfighting for that industry and making sure that your State was not \ndisadvantaged. So I have total respect, and if I was the Senator from \nArkansas, who knows what I would be doing. So I am not being holier \nthan thou in any way, shape, or form.\n  But I have to make the point that this is really about money; it is \nall about dollars. Otherwise, who would be opposing such a commonsense \nrule? You can get more money for a fresh product, so you market fresh. \nWhat is a little lie? You can ship your frozen product miles and miles \ninto another State to compete with truly fresh chicken, and no one will \nknow and you get top dollar, so what is a little lie? I say it is \nwrong.\n  I would like to take a little time to read a Washington Post \neditorial, or just portions of it. I ask unanimous consent not that we \nprint this copy in the Record, but that a smaller copy be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Fair's Fair on Fowl\n\n       ``When I use a word,'' said Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty, \n     ``it means exactly what I want it to mean.'' Humpty Dumpty \n     was an egg, but the observation applies especially well to a \n     fight that's going on about chickens. Michael Taylor, acting \n     agriculture undersecretary for food safety, recently tried to \n     call a halt to 2\\1/2\\ years of squawking by issuing a rule \n     that chickens and turkeys frozen rock solid and shipped that \n     way, then thawed, may no longer be labeled ``fresh.'' At the \n     last minute, though, a Senate subcommittee has come up with \n     appropriations language that would block the rule, leaving \n     frozen chickens and turkeys still eligible for the label of \n     freshness.\n       The notion that fresh chickens aren't frozen, and vice \n     versa, might at first seem uncontroversial. Consumers might \n     like to know if a bird has been frozen and thawed, whether \n     out of health or cooking preferences or because they prefer \n     fresh meat. Small regional chicken companies see this \n     preference for freshness as a possible selling point, since \n     they, unlike the bigger producers, don't have to freeze their \n     birds to ship them cross country. They have been wanting for \n     some time to label their own birds ``fresh'' and to stop the \n     national companies from so labeling theirs.\n       Inconveniently enough, however, the government at some \n     point agreed that to be defined as legally ``frozen'' a \n     chicken or turkey had to reach an internal temperature of \n     zero degrees Fahrenheit, although the meat actually freezes \n     solid at about 25 degrees above that. The big companies thus \n     have been within their legal rights all this time to freeze \n     their birds down to a point above zero \n\n[[Page S13765]]\n     and label the meat ``fresh'' because it has technically never been \n     ``frozen.'' The National Broiler Council beat back a \n     California law that attempted to redefine ``fresh'' as having \n     ``never reached an internal temperature of 25 degrees or \n     below for more than 24 hours.'' The big birders successfully \n     sued to establish that the state law was superseded by the \n     less nature-bound federal version.\n       Would a frozen chicken under the proposed rules now be \n     referred to as ``frozen''? Heaven forbid. ``Frozen'' chicken \n     and turkey--the kind chilled below zero--would continue to be \n     ``frozen.'' The stuff that had been frozen to between zero \n     and 26 degrees, previously called ``fresh,'' would be labeled \n     ``hard chilled.'' For now, though, barring a Senate \n     turnaround, the victory may remain with the broiler lobbyists \n     who complain that it's too arbitrary to draw an either-or \n     distinction between fresh and frozen at all. Seriously, you'd \n     think this one would be easy.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the first paragraph says:\n\n       ``When I use a word,'' said Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty, \n     ``it means exactly what I want it to mean.'' Humpty Dumpty \n     was an egg, but the observation applies especially well to a \n     fight that's going on about chickens. Michael Taylor, acting \n     agriculture undersecretary for food safety, recently tried to \n     call a halt to 2\\1/2\\ years of squawking by issuing a rule \n     that chickens and turkeys frozen rock solid and shipped that \n     way, then thawed, may no longer be labeled ``fresh.'' At the \n     last minute, though, a Senate subcommittee has come up with \n     appropriations language that would block the rule, leaving \n     frozen chickens and turkeys still eligible for the label of \n     freshness.\n  My friend, that is what this is about. Some of us are trying to stop \nthat attempt by the Appropriations Committee to block a rule that is \nover 2\\1/2\\ years in the making and, by the way, which started under \nGeorge Bush. He tried to resolve this problem. We are talking about an \n8-year-old issue that has not been resolved. He goes into the rule, \nwhich I have explained already, that says that it can be labeled \n``fresh'' if it is down to 26 degrees, and ``hard chilled'' between 26 \nand zero, and it must be labeled ``frozen'' if it is below zero. The \nperson who wrote this article is critical. He says:\n\n       Would a frozen chicken under the proposed rules now be \n     referred to as ``frozen''? Heaven forbid. ``Frozen'' chicken \n     and turkey--the kind chilled below zero--would continue to be \n     ``frozen.'' The stuff that had been frozen to between zero \n     and 26 degrees, previously called ``fresh,'' would be labeled \n     ``hard chilled.'' For now, though, barring a Senate \n     turnaround, the victory may remain with the broiler lobbyists \n     who complain that it's too arbitrary to draw an either-or \n     distinction between fresh and frozen at all. Seriously, you'd \n     think this one would be easy.\n\n  Mr. President, I echo that. I thought this one would be easy. This \none is not easy; it is difficult.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I wonder if the Senator from California would educate this \nSenator as to the California Legislature, I think in 1993, enacting the \nlaw only relating to poultry. Why is it that the State of California \nonly objected to poultry labeling and not the labeling of beef, not the \nlabeling of pork, and not the labeling of fish? Why is it that we are \nletting those groups off and concentrating only on poultry products?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my good friend, I do not serve in the California \nState Legislature, and I do not always agree with them on things. I \ncannot answer for why they did this. I assume that one of the reasons \nthey did this is because, clearly, the issue was brought to their \nattention. I say right now to my friend that I am very much in favor of \ndoing more. He asked before, why are we not doing fish? As far as we \nknow, that is under the FDA authority. I am happy to team up with my \nfriend to work for truth in labeling on every conceivable product. That \nis what it is about to me, making sure consumers know what they are \nbuying and what they are getting.\n  Again, I guess one of the problems I have is--and this Senator is \ncertainly saying nothing ill about a frozen product. Some people prefer \nto buy a frozen product. All I am saying is that it ought to be labeled \nso we know what the truth is. In terms of the legislative agenda of the \nCalifornia State Assembly, remember, we have many thousands of issues \nthat come before us. I would be happy to research the issue and come \nback with a specific answer. I can only speak for what I can do.\n  In this bill, the Appropriations Committee is stopping a truth-in-\nlabeling bill that involves poultry. I would be happy to support my \nfriend for truth in labeling in any and every product he would like to \nbring forward.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator has \ncompleted her statement at this moment, I will be happy to yield such \ntime as he may consume to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nBumpers].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for the \nSenator from Mississippi?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is another one of those issues \nwhich, on its face, would appear to give the California Senators the \nhigh ground. But it does not. It is the phoniest issue I think I have \never seen come before the Senate. The Senator from Arkansas, my \ncolleague, Senator Pryor, has just asked a very relevant question. Red \nmeat products are routinely shipped at below 26 degrees and sold as \nfresh. Listen to this. Whole hog sausage is packed warm into tubs, then \nexposed to glyco or brine to chill below 26 degrees.\n  I can tell my colleagues that any time you buy sausage in the fancy \nmeat section of the grocery store, the chances are about 90 percent of \nthe time you are getting sausage that has been previously frozen. It is \nthawed for display purposes. Pork and beef loins and other products of \nbeef and pork are routinely brought below 26 degrees. Why? So it is \neasier to slice. You get a better consistency in the slice if the \ntemperature of the bacon is much lower than freezing. Trim products. \nWhen you trim steaks and roast, pork chucks and pork roasts, they take \nthe trimmings and freeze them--not to 26 degrees, but to zero. And then \nthey are later thawed and put with whole hog, and you buy whole hog \nsausage, some of which is fresh and some of which has been frozen.\n  Frozen beef: Frozen beef is mixed with fresh beef. Do you know why? \nTo give it a better consistency, because it forms a patty better if \nhalf of it has been frozen. When you buy beef patties and pork patties, \nyou are getting formerly frozen product. Frozen lamb is routinely \nthawed at retail and sold fresh.\n  Why are those things not included here? Because the California \nPoultry Federation does not care about lamb, they do not care anything \nabout beef or pork, and they do not care anything about fish. What they \ncare about is the fact that they only have 25 percent, or less, of the \npoultry business in California. California, right now, has the highest \npoultry prices in the United States. And if the Senators from \nCalifornia prevail, it will go a lot higher, under the name of \nconsumerism.\n  Do you know what this regulation of the Department of Agriculture \nsays? It says exactly what the California Legislature said in 1993--\nthat the California Poultry Federation went to the California \nLegislature and said, ``Look, we cannot compete with the Southern and \nSouthwestern States, so here is the way we have conjured up to deal \nwith the issue.''\n  So the California legislature says, ``Any poultry product coming into \nthe State of California may not be below 26 degrees.'' What does this \nregulation say, after the court, incidentally, had ruled that one \nillegal? The very same thing. Dan Glickman did not think this up. The \nDepartment of Agriculture did not think this up. They never thought of \nit until the California Legislature told them to think of it. And when \nthe Federal court declared that the Federal Government had preemption \nrights over the safety of food, they came to the California Senators.\n  I am not complaining about the California Senators going to bat for \ntheir State, and I hope nobody will blame me or Senator Cochran for \ngoing to bat for our States. So here we are on the floor of the Senate \nprotecting the California poultry industry. Unhappily, this rule \napplies to the entire Nation.\n  Mr. President, I have watched this Congressman--I forget his name--\nover in the House. He got a lot of publicity. You have to do crazy \nthings to get on the evening news around here. So he takes a chicken, \nfrozen at zero degrees, and uses it for a bowling ball. \n\n[[Page S13766]]\n\n\n  The ordinary citizen looks at that and says, ``You mean I have been \nbuying chicken like that?'' The Senator from California came in here \nwith a frozen chicken this morning. You can use that for a bowling \nball, too.\n  That is not what the debate is about. You take a chicken frozen to 26 \nor 27 degrees and use it for a bowling ball, and you will get \nsplattered. This chicken, when it leaves the plant to go to California \nor any other State, is usually at 27 or 28 degrees. When it arrives at \nits destination, there is a distinct possibility that over the course \nof that 2-day trip, that some chickens--they are in boxes; they are in \nwhat they call a ``chill pack''; they are in a tray and the trays are \nin boxes--some of the boxes in the middle of the load may conceivably \nbe below 26 degrees, maybe 25 degrees when it gets there.\n  Now, how are you going to handle that, Mr. President? Are you going \nto make them unload the whole load and relabel every chicken? \nObviously, that is not doable. Economically, that is not doable.\n  So, what do you do? Nobody can tell you what the Department of \nAgriculture Inspection Service is going to ask for. I can tell you one \nthing: The $25 million that we put in for the Food Safety Inspection \nService in the bill before the House is not going to be nearly enough \nto hire all the inspectors to check every temperature.\n  Is this just me? Listen to this. The Agriculture Research Service, \nwhich does all of the research on these things in their laboratories--\nin the laboratories--the Agriculture Research Service allows a plus or \nminus 3 degrees because that is the best they can do.\n  Yet, the California Senators say it has to be 26 degrees, not 1 \ndegree below. As high above as you want to go, but if you go 1 degree \nbelow 26 degrees, no plus or minus allowances. Even the Agriculture \nMarketing Service has a minus or plus 2 degrees. No mistakes for \nmechanical failures, no allowance for anything.\n  Mr. President, while, as I say, this looks good on its face, I want \nto remind my friends from the red beef and the pork States and the fish \nStates, you are next. Whoever you may be competing with, you can depend \non them going to their legislature, the Department of Agriculture, and \nsaying, ``We want the same treatment.''\n  The poultry industry has been attacked as long as I have been in this \nSenate. It is, as Gilda Radner said, it is always something, is it not, \nSenator? It was always inspection. Now the poultry industry has agreed \nto what we hope will be the best and final inspection of a product in \nthe history of man: a macro-organism inspection system that will pick \nup anything on the carcass of a chicken.\n  Do you know who is squawking now even though it will cost a lot of \nmoney to put it in place? The labor unions, because ultimately it will \nbe labor saving. As I say, it is always something.\n  Who do you think, Mr. President, finally, has the most to lose by \nshipping a bad product? It is the industry, is it not? If they send a \nbad product, if somebody gets sick, they are the ones would pay the \nprice.\n  Listen to this. Billions and billions and billions of chickens have \nbeen shipped to the State of California and all over this country, that \nleft the packing plants at 27 or 26 degrees and when it gets there, \nmaybe some of the chicken was at 25 degrees, some of it was at 26 and \nsome of it was at 27.\n  Do you know something else? Not one complaint out of billions shipped \nall over the United States, not one single complaint from anybody but \nthe California Poultry Federation. Does that tell you what this \namendment is about?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my friend from Arkansas is a great \ndebater. He says this is the phoniest issue he has ever seen come \nbefore the Senate. Let me tell you what is phony. What is phony is \nmarking a frozen product fresh. That is phony. What this regulation is \ngoing to do is cure that problem.\n  To make this a California issue is misleading. Alaska: ``It is \nunlawful to sell previously frozen as fresh.'' Why not attack Alaska, I \nsay to my friend? Arizona: ``Prohibits misbranding.'' Attack Arizona, I \nsay to my friend. Delaware: There is a prohibition; you cannot misbrand \na food. Illinois: If a meat or poultry product has been frozen, it \ncannot say fresh. It has to say ``previously frozen.'' Why not attack \nIllinois?\n  New York: There is a frozen labeling requirement. Oregon prohibits \nthe use of a label that says ``are fresh, if at any time after \nslaughter, they have been frozen.'' Washington State: Poultry that has \nbeen frozen at any time must bear a label ``clearly discernible to \ncustomer that such product has been frozen and whether or not it has \nbeen thawed.'' We know that California has a law, as was mentioned here \nseveral times.\n  So, put to rest the claim that this is only about one State. This is \nacross the country, and I think that we in the U.S. Senate should \nrespect those States that have gotten out in front of a consumer issue.\n  Now, I tell you something, I know these consumer groups and they do \nnot get behind a phony issue. I do not know if you have ever dealt with \nthem before, but I do not see Citizen Action standing up here on behalf \nof one industry. I do not see consumer unions standing up behind one \nindustry. I do not see National Consumer League standing up behind an \nindustry. I do not see Public Voice doing that, and I do not see the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association doing that.\n  Clearly, this is not a phony issue. But if we do not defeat the \ncommittee amendment, a phony situation will continue.\n  By the way, do not be misled. They say the committee will put a rule \ninto effect, but when we pass it, when we decide it. It has been 8 \nyears since we have been trying to solve this consumer problem and it \nwill be another 8, 10, and God knows how long, the consumers will not \nhave their right to know. So I think the issue is drawn.\n  My friend says the price will go up. How does the price go up? It is \nthe opposite. The price is artificially up now because a product that \nsays fresh gets a higher price. And that is why the people in your \nState do not want to put an accurate label on there. They fetch a \npremium price for a frozen product. Therefore, they want to keep \ncalling it fresh.\n  On the contrary, when this goes through--and I hope it will, and I do \nnot know how we will come out on it--prices will go down and consumers \nwho want to get a good price can buy a frozen product.\n  By the way, there is nothing wrong with that. Some prefer it. All we \nare asking for is truth.\n  Then my friend says the California Senator said ``26 degrees.'' We \nnever said any such thing. The way the rule came about was because this \nSenate asked the Department of Agriculture to go hold public hearings, \nhear the experts, and they found out that the temperature in which it \nis frozen is 26 degrees. If they picked 24 degrees or 22 degrees, I \ncould not challenge that, I say to my friend. It is a scientific \ndetermination. If it is rock solid it is rock solid at 25 degrees.\n\n  And he is right. He said a Congressman bowled a chicken down an alley \nto bring attention to this issue. He is right. It got the Congressman \non the news. And sometimes people do that because they are so desperate \nthat things like this will be legislated in the dead of night, in a \ncommittee, stuck into an appropriations bill, that they have to shine \nthe light of day on this.\n  I hope every single consumer in America is watching this vote today. \nBecause you will hear a lot of talk about pork, beef, fish--let us talk \nabout that another time. I am with you. Let us have honesty in the way \nwe sell products in this country. That is the way we are moving. We let \nconsumers know a range of things about the products that they buy.\n  So, I am going to move, at the proper time, to table the committee \namendment. As I understand the rules, and I ask the President if this \nis correct, the appropriate time would be just before the vote rather \nthan at this time? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will at that time reserve my right to move to \ntable the committee amendment. At this time I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on April 4, 1995, 19 Senators sent a letter \nto the U.S. Department of Agriculture in which we expressed our concern \nabout \n\n[[Page S13767]]\nproposed changes in poultry labeling standards. The USDA has ignored \nour concerns and is preparing to impose unfair and subjective rules \nwhich will adversely and unnecessarily affect the poultry industry in \nNorth Carolina, indeed across this country.\n  At issue is the process by which the poultry industry labels its \nproducts--either ``fresh'' or ``frozen''--and whether the USDA will \nchange the rules, unnecessarily and unfairly, on America's food \nproducers. The losers, if the USDA prevails, will not be confined to \nAmerica's chicken and turkey producers and processors, but also the \nconsumers who are certain to be confused and misled by this USDA \nbureaucratic meddling.\n  Senators should be aware of some important facts when considering \nwhether the Senate should allow the USDA to proceed with such \nunnecessary requirements.\n  First, the proposed rule change unfairly singles out the poultry \nindustry. Currently, meat, fish, and poultry products are allowed by \nUSDA to be preserved at temperatures below 26 degrees and be labeled as \n``fresh.'' If the USDA has its way, the poultry industry alone must \nlabel its products as ``previously frozen'' when poultry products are \nstored at temperatures below 26 degrees.\n  Second, the proposed rule changes will hinder the growth of America's \nchicken and turkey industry. The USDA bureaucracy proposes to make \npermanent standards that the poultry industry already has had \ndifficulty in meeting. Keep in mind, under the USDA's proposal, poultry \ncompanies will be required to process, store, and transport their \nproducts at specific temperatures beyond their control--and this \nbureaucratic meddling will automatically reduce the quality of food. \nThis disservice to the consumer will also harm the poultry industry.\n  Mr. President, America's poultry industry is the envy of the world. \nIts further growth, and the confidence of the consumer, are at stake in \nthis debate. The Senate should support Senators Cochran and Bumpers in \ntheir efforts to prohibit funding for this unwise USDA rule change that \nwill serve nobody's best interests--except, perhaps, the ego of the \nbureaucrats who came up with an idea whose time should never come.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield time to my \ndistinguished friend and colleague from Alabama [Mr. Heflin]. How much \ntime would the Senator request, 5 minutes? Ten minutes?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, 5, 6, 7, 8, somewhere in that \nneighborhood.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield the distinguished Senator 8 minutes, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I rise in opposition. \nBut first let me say that no opponent is more formidable than the \nlittle package of dynamite from California. Senator Boxer is a \ntremendous opponent. They say dynamite comes in little packages. And \nshe certainly works on every issue that she takes a stand on. Most of \nthe time she is right. But every now and then she gets misled and this \nis one of those instances.\n  My colleague asked me how much time I wanted, 5 minutes, maybe? I \nsaid 6, 7, 8, somewhere around that so I got 8--but, you know, as I \nthink about that, why did I not say a specific time? Well, it is \nbecause there may be some variances of thoughts that I had, and \nvariances are very important.\n  What is lacking from this, in regards to fresh, is variance. \nThermometers differ. I have been in a hospital a good deal, and they \ntake my temperature one way and it is one figure and they take it \nanother way and it is a different figure. Then they, all of a sudden, \nwill get thermometers that they take it in the ear for a minute, and in \nthe old days you take the thermometer and you kept it for 3 minutes in \nyour mouth, and you are supposed to put it in a certain spot and \neverything else relative to that.\n  The point I am making is you have a hard and fast rule and you are \ncrossing the desert in a truck, you set it at 26 degrees, but by the \ntime it gets through west Texas, where you are going through some area \nwhere the temperature is about 105, and 106, and it varies. Then I \nthink what this also is, it is that we are going to see the inspectors \nare going to be the thermometer brigade. The thermometer brigade will \nbe coming around, checking.\n  What we need here is some flexibility, some variance, that will \nallow--if you have something at 26 degrees, why not have it, say, a 4-\ndegree variance because of weather or whatever else, relative to this? \nTrucks will have to stop and check the temperature about every 5 or 6 \nminutes to see that it gets to be 26 degrees.\n  As you travel across the desert and everything else they will stop. \nSometimes, when these truckdrivers stop, they might also have something \nelse to quench the heat. So I do not know what might be occurring \nrelative to this. But, I think there is certainly a need for variance.\n  I have the front page and the introduction of the California Poultry \nWorkgroup, University of California, Cooperative Extension, called \n``Turkey Care Practices.'' In the introduction it has this:\n\n       The number of turkeys produced in California peaked at 32 \n     million in 1990 and dropped to an estimated 24.5 million by \n     1993. The major causes for this reduction was the necessity \n     to import feed grain and the unfavorable business climate in \n     California. Production costs in California are higher than in \n     other areas making it difficult for the California industry \n     to competitively produce turkey meat products for the \n     consumer.\n\n  That is said there. I assume feed is the same for chickens. The same \nclimate is there for chickens as it is for turkeys.\n  When you get out there, this is a cost issue. It is basically a \nprotectionist issue. It seems to me we are missing the point on all of \nthis. The way I heard Senator Bumpers talking about freezing various \nmeats, and you freeze bacon to slice it and you freeze beef to do \nvarious and sundry things, but turkeys--I know very few people who, on \nThanksgiving, do not have frozen turkeys. Most of the turkeys that you \nbuy in the market are frozen. That is one of the delicacies of the \nAmerican cuisine, is turkey on Thanksgiving. But how many live turkeys \ndo you see? There is nothing wrong with frozen food. Frozen food has a \nlot of things.\n  We talk about diseases. It kills a lot of germs in a lot of things \nthat might be flying around and get on to the meats. So this is a \nsafety protection, a food safety provision that Senator Cochran has \ncome up with as well, in regards to this.\n  So, there are a lot of things we feel that people are not reviewing, \nthey are not thinking about in all of these. This 26 degrees that has \nbeen said is not any scientific number. A lot of the companies put it \non the market at 26 degrees. It is pliable, it is soft, it is \ncertainly, with the ideas we have on poultry and other things, this \nconcept of fresh--if it is 25 degrees it is no longer fresh.\n  When you cannot tell the difference in the feel, you cannot tell the \ndifference in anything else, even if it is 24 degrees instead of 26 \ndegrees. The point I am making here is the Department of Agriculture \nhas some 26,000 comments and 23,000 of them, as I recall, were against \nthis proposal. But they have some zealots over there in the Department \nof Agriculture on certain issues who throw to the winds reason, who \nthrow to the winds the logic that is necessary and the real facts that \nunderlie all of this.\n  So I think this is a mistake on what the Department has done. We \nought to adopt the Cochran amendment that is in the bill, send it back \nto them, and tell them, ``All right. Let us take another look at it.'' \nAt that time, Senator Boxer, with her dynamite approach toward her \nissues, can argue with the Department of Agriculture, and the \nCalifornia turkey group that I quoted from here can make their \narguments. I just think that we are reaching out and making a very \nunrealistic approach toward an issue that is not the problem that it is \nbeing made here today.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the motion to strike the provision in this \nappropriations bill. The purpose of the language is to ensure that new \npoultry labeling rules are meaningful to all consumers.\n  The rule promulgated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service on \nAugust 25, 1995, prohibits poultry products \n\n[[Page S13768]]\nthat have ever been chilled below 26 degrees from being labeled \n``fresh,'' products chilled above 0 degrees but below 26 degrees would \nhave to be labeled as ``hard chilled'' or ``previously hard chilled.''\n  There is nothing special or scientific about the 26-degree threshold \ntemperature selected for determining freshness other than the fact that \nit is low enough to permit certain regional poultry companies to \nprocess their products in accordance with accepted industry practices. \nAt the same time, the temperature suggested by those who have benefited \nby this regulation is just high enough to interfere with competing \npoultry products transported from other States from reaching these \nregional markets without jeopardizing product quality. This is \nespecially true since USDA did not provide any temperature tolerance in \nthe final rule.\n  You will not find anyone who can tell you with a straight face that \npoultry products at 26 degrees are fresh while those chilled to 25 \ndegrees are no longer fresh. There is absolutely no scientific evidence \nthat poultry freezes at those temperatures. That is something that came \nfrom a Hollywood script and a bureaucrat's desire to develop a punitive \nand unreasonable regulation. This kind of irresponsible regulation \ncannot be tolerated.\n  USDA has succeeded in developing a labeling system that designates \nhigh-quality poultry products and will confuse consumers. Poultry \nconsumers will be misled by a labeling requirement that a product is \nhard chilled when it is, in fact, soft and pliable to the touch at the \nretail counter. Many consumers may be led to believe that such product \nis of lesser quality, when, in fact, it is the same high-quality \nproduct they have been buying for years.\n  Not only will consumers be misled by this designated labeling, but \nthe threat of such labeling may force companies to ship poultry \nproducts at higher temperatures to avoid being required to use the \nlabeling USDA has mandated, even in the absence of any affirmative \nquality claim. Basic science provides that cooler temperatures enhance \nthe quality of food products. Poultry, as well as beef, pork, or lamb \nproducts, shipped at 24 or 25 degrees will have a longer shelf life and \nmaintain their quality longer than products shipped at higher \ntemperatures--to the benefit of consumers. Because of USDA's \ndenigrating labeling requirement, however, poultry companies will be \nforced to ship products at higher temperatures, to the detriment of \nproduct quality and consumers.\n  The fresh poultry regulation was designed by the California poultry \nindustry to make it difficult for competing poultry products from other \nsections of the country to be marketed in California without \njeopardizing product quality. When consumers in California have fewer \nchoices in the marketplace, they will pay higher prices for poultry. \nThat is the hidden agenda of the California Poultry Industry \nFederation. It's simple economics--less competition, fewer choices, and \nhigher prices. The consumer pays and the California poultry products \ntake it to the bank.\n  We should reject USDA's misguided and ill-conceived regulation and \ninstead require the agency, as we have been forced to do before, to \ndevelop a rule that will not result in consumers paying more for the \nhigh-quality poultry products they buy today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, might I ask how much time I have left in \nthis great chicken debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 15 minutes and \n53 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say, Mr. President, to my friend, Judge Heflin, \nthat he gave me a wonderful compliment. I really mean it. I want to \ngive him one back. He is a powerhouse lawyer, judge, and Senator. He is \nvery convincing. But on this one, I really believe fresh is fresh and \nfrozen is frozen. You can talk about how to take the temperature.\n  By the way, while the Senator was speaking, I looked at who actually \nworked on this rule. Believe it or not--this is really interesting--\nthis is an American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air \nConditioning Engineers. They actually made a decision that 27 degrees \nshould have been the proper degree. But the Department of Agriculture \ngave the flexibility of a degree.\n  So there are scientists who worked on this. It had nothing to do with \nzealots. The National Institute of Standards and Technology came out \nwith 26 degrees. So there was a disagreement. One said it is frozen at \n27, and one said at 26 it is pretty frozen. But this is not about \nzealots. This is about common sense. The fact of the matter is we want \nto make sure our consumers know what they are getting.\n  I agree with my friend. There is nothing wrong with frozen turkeys, \nchicken parts, or anything. As I said, the Senator is right to say some \npeople actually prefer to buy the frozen product.\n  All this rule says is you must clearly mark it as frozen if it is \nzero degrees or below, and you get to market hard chill if it is from \nzero to 26, which I think shows a great deal of flexibility.\n  On the inspection point, all the details will be worked out as they \ngo into this rule with the industry. A lot of it is going to be self-\nenforcement, I might say to my friend. They are very aware, if there is \na very large shipment, if one part of the shipment may have fallen \nbelow; it does not mean the entire shipment cannot be marked fresh.\n  So I think rather than saying that they are zealots over there, I \nthink they have bent over backwards to be fair. They even have gotten \ncriticized by some consumers for giving the folks a chance to have \ntheir product at 10 degrees marked ``hard chill.''\n  So my friend is a powerhouse. I have to say that respectfully I \ndisagree with his conclusion on this one. I hope the Senate will \nsupport commonsense reform in this area. Again, the country is moving \nin that way. If people can know how much fat is in a product, how many \nvitamins are in a product, how many calories are in a product, how much \ncalcium is in a product, and on and on, we have decided it is important \nfor consumers to know this. They ought to know if a product is frozen \nor has been previously frozen. Eighty-six percent of the folks agree \nwith that premise. We have a chance to stand with 86 percent of the \nfolks.\n  I hope we will do that in defeating this particular committee \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware [Mr. Biden].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, while we are exchanging compliments, I think this \namendment is about the efficacy in the way in which the distinguished \nSenator from California protects her State. She does an incredible job. \nI do not know anybody since I have served here who looks out for \nCalifornia's interests better than she does. I think that is what this \nis all about.\n  We are very close friends, the Senator from California and I. I do \nnot doubt for a single moment what she says about her concern about \nconsumer interests. But I might say, if she prevails, California wins \nbig in the marketplace. I am sure it is purely coincidental. But again, \nshe is tenacious when it comes to California. She is too effective, as \nfar as I am concerned, when it comes to California interests versus the \ninterests of other parts of the country. I think that is what this is a \nlittle bit to do with.\n  She is also trying to influence my mind here by sliding something in \nfront of me that has to do probably with something that says my \nposition does not make any difference; I am not crazy about him anyway.\n  So, Mr. President, she will go to any lengths within the legitimate \nconfines of the rules of the Senate to win, like just handing me that \nnote.\n  This debate is not about health and safety. It is not about saving \nthe taxpayers money. Let me state up front this amendment has \nabsolutely no impact on Federal spending. Ensuring compliance will be \nessentially impossible. Literally one degree of variance would \ntechnically require a different label. A package placed, for example, \nnear a refrigeration unit which cools to a temperature of less than 26 \ndegrees would not be considered on par with poultry 10 or 15 feet away \nfrom that unit. That is hardly an efficient standard to impose on \nbusiness. More importantly, the rule ignores the Agricultural Research \nService study which \n\n[[Page S13769]]\ndemonstrates that consumers cannot detect any quality difference \nbetween poultry chilled to 26 degrees and poultry at 2 or 3 degrees \nlower. Again, there is no difference between these two types of \npoultry.\n  It is not surprising to me, Mr. President, that virtually all \nconsumers place poultry in the freezer for later use. I know that the \nsponsor of that amendment is not suggesting that the tens of millions \nof items that consumers take home and put in freezers all of a sudden \nmake that chicken somehow, that poultry somehow, less palatable than if \nthey did not take it from the grocery store to their homes. \nInterestingly, the Agricultural Research Service study concluded that \nunder ideal laboratory conditions, poultry temperatures can only be \ncontrolled to plus or minus 2 degrees. Let me repeat that: Under ideal \nconditions, literally perfect conditions, we can only control it within \n2 degrees.\n  What the distinguished chairman of the committee has done, he has not \nsaid we are not going to have a ruling. He has said look, let us go \nback and look at this. In fact, I respectfully suggest that many of the \nadvocates of this amendment are more concerned about freezing the \ndelivery of out-of-State poultry, and not actually freezing the product \nthat is being allegedly frozen. This is about freezing out.\n  We sell a lot of chickens in California. I expect that California \npoultry producers do not like that. We have not figured how to make \nthose birds fly from the Delmarva Peninsula to California, and then \njump into a processing plant. We have not figured out how to do that. \nWe have to put them in trucks. We try to do it at 26 degrees.\n  We do not want to be put in the position where my distinguished \nfriend implies that the chickens we are sending, which are not below \nzero degrees, by the way, which is now frozen, is somehow less \npalatable.\n  I imagine my time is running out. I apologize for being so \ndisconnected here. But how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your time has just expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for 5 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is not about E-coli bacteria or cryptosporidium. The \ncommittee language is about simple fairness. It is about fostering \ncompetition and about improving the information available to consumers.\n  I hope we reject the amendment of my distinguished friend from \nCalifornia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend that he may be \nright that there is no difference to consumers. But 86 percent of the \nconsumers think they ought to know what they are getting, No. 1. No. 2, \nthe Department of Agriculture said they will be flexible in their \nenforcement. They have recognized the problem that my friend put out on \nthe table, and I commend him for that. No. 3, back in October 1994, the \nSenate passed a unanimous vote, a sense of the Congress, that the \nDepartment of Agriculture should issue this rule.\n  We gave them guidance. We told them to hold public hearings all over \nthe country. They did. We told them to publish a decision on the issue \nas expeditiously as possible. They did that. I thought they were a \nlittle slow, taking 2 years, but they finally did that. And we said \nthat no person on the expert advisory committee could have a conflict \nof interest in the outcome.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 1 second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator tell me whether she thinks consumers know \nwhat ``hard chilled'' means?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend they are going to know because of all \nthe publicity we are giving it. I would prefer that we were just saying \n``frozen fresh,'' ``previously frozen,'' ``thawed.'' But what they \ntried to do in this rule, I say to my friend, is accommodate some of \nthe producers in the Eastern States who did not want the word \n``frozen'' placed on it, and so they said, OK, if it is between 26 \ndegrees and zero degrees it is hard chilled, and if is zero degrees or \ncolder it is frozen.\n  I think both of my friends who have spoken in opposition this morning \nsaid it is an arbitrary thing. The fact is right now the rules say if \nyou are freezing below zero, you have to say frozen. No one has ever \ncomplained about that. Nobody ever said if it is minus 2 degrees, we \nshould say fresh. So there has to be some cutoff point. And the science \nsays it is 26 or 27 degrees and the rule came down at 26.\n  I would also say to my friend that Delaware has a law on the books \nthat is called ``Misbranding of food: For the purpose of this chapter, \nfood is deemed to be misbranded if is obtained by the dealer in frozen \nbulk form and is subsequently thawed and offered for sale in a package \nbearing a label `fresh.'''\n  So I think that the Senator's State, in looking at the overall issue, \nnot necessarily poultry but the overall issue of fresh versus frozen, \nis one of the leading States here because there is only about 10 that \nhave come forward with these kinds of laws.\n  Finally, I say to my friend--and we are in a mutual admiration \nsociety and I will not go into that--I do find myself fighting for my \nState, for the consumers of my State. The poultry industry in my State \nis split. The chicken people like the agriculture rule and the turkey \npeople oppose it. So I have come down on the side of the consumers, \nwhich I believe is what we should really do.\n  I say to my friend, Citizen Action, Consumer Union, National \nConsumers League, the Public Voice, and many others believe that fresh \nis fresh and frozen is frozen, and that is why I feel very strongly we \nshould strike the committee amendment.\n  The administration thinks it is wrong to derail this rule. Eight \nyears ago we tried to resolve this issue. It has been hanging around \nfor 8 years. We finally had it solved. I am really kind of sad that we \nmight derail it because no matter what my dear friend says to me--and \nhe has been around here a lot longer--I do not believe the committee is \ngoing to rush to get a new rule in place. I am putting it in the best \nterms. I think this is a way to put this rule into deep freeze for a \nlong time, never to see the light of day. That is my own view.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Just for 10 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield as long as my friend wants.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend, the poultry industry in my State, \nwhich is divided, by the way--some of the poultry people who are in my \nState share the Senator's view--is not looking for there to be no rule. \nThey are looking for some flexibility in the 26 degree mark--2 or 3 \ndegrees either way. They are not asking there not be a demarcation. \nThey are not saying that the rule should say zero and below is frozen, \nabove that is fresh. They are not asking for that.\n  So I am not standing here making the argument that there is no \nrationale related to having a third category here. I am suggesting that \nit is not workable as the standard proposed by the Department now \nwhich, to use the term freeze, is being frozen by the committee until \nthere can be some more rational way to look at this.\n  So I wish to make it clear, we are not asking and I am not of the \nview that there not be a distinction made among the categories of how a \nchicken or a piece of poultry is packaged and sold.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I might say to my friend, I am glad to hear that, but \nfrom the bottom of my heart, if this is killed, we are not going to see \nthat happen.\n  Let me say this. This is a very difficult issue because there are \nspecial interests on all sides of it, as my friend knows. What my \nfriend is trying to do, he has a situation in his State where some of \nthe businesses are for it, some are against. He took a position he \nfeels is correct. I took a position I feel is correct.\n  The Agriculture Department in writing this rule really went to the \nscientists to set the standard. They did not ask just the industry \nbecause each industry has a special interest. So they asked the \nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning \nEngineers. Clearly, this is a group that is not a household name, and \nthey do not have a particular interest. They examined the problem, and \nthey came \n\n[[Page S13770]]\nout and said at 27 degrees ice crystals begin to form on the poultry \nflesh. They believed that 27 degrees was appropriate. Another group \nsaid it is 26 degrees. That group that said 26 degrees is--let me find \nit. I had it in the Record before. It is a technology group that said \nit is 26 degrees. So they went with the more, if you will, liberal \nnumber of 26 degrees.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe, if you leave it up to the businesses to come \nup with what they think is right, we are not going to have a fair rule. \nWith all due respect to my friend, if we kill this today, I believe we \nare killing this for a very long time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for another brief question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The experts in the refrigeration industry also point out \nthat there is no way you can get that ideal number within less than 2 \ndegrees. The science of refrigeration is not precise enough that you \ncan get it within 2 degrees. So although they give you an ideal number \nof 26, they say that is when crystal began to form, they also say, if I \nam not mistaken, there are not refrigeration units made that can \nguarantee you can keep it at exactly 27 as opposed to 26 or 25 or 25 as \nopposed to 23.\n  So I would ask my friend the following question. Assume the issue \nhere were to say 26 degrees plus or minus 3 degrees. Would she be \nwilling to go along with that? Or is she stuck on precisely 27 degrees? \nBecause the Senator from Delaware would be willing to go along with 26 \ndegrees plus or minus 3 degrees, mainly because there is not the \nscience in refrigeration that you can put a product in the back of a \ntruck, send it off to be sold in California or anywhere else and be \nassured that for the duration of that trip it will not fluctuate \nseveral degrees above or below.\n  I might add, the reason why the producers are split in my State, the \nproducers who sell only on the east coast think this is a good idea. \nThe producers that sell in California say: I cannot get my product \nacross guaranteeing it is exactly a certain temperature--I cannot \nassert, and the technology cannot guarantee me when I put it in the \ntruck, that I can keep it within the rule no matter what I tell you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I say to the Senator I am down to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have to say to my friend, this is exactly what I do not \nthink we should get into: Will the Senator agree to 27 minus-plus. I \nbelieve if we start getting into that on the Senate floor, we are \ngetting into minutia.\n  There is a science. Now, my friend may not believe it is accurate, \nbut the other group that said it is 26 is the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology. The Agriculture Department said that flexible \nenforcement will be absolutely a defining goal. And today we enforce \nthe law when it gets down to zero degrees. So at some point you have to \nhave a cutoff with flexible enforcement, because clearly my friend \nmakes a good point. But I never supported 26 degrees or 25 or 27. What \nI supported was science dictating when a product ought to be marked \n``frozen.''\n  I think if we do not act today, I say to my friend--and I think he \nmeans it that he wants to work on something--it will be a long, cold \nmonth, 2 months and years before we get back to this issue.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 10 seconds, \nthe Senator from California has 113 seconds. Who yields time?\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from California has \ngenerously yielded me 30 seconds, which may be kinder than I would be \nto her under the circumstances.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thanks.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank her very much. Mr. President, I want to make the \npoint the Senator from Delaware was making. If the Agriculture Research \nService has to have a plus or minus 3 degrees in highly controlled labs \nand highly controlled labs have to have a plus or minus 2 degrees, to \nask for a plus or minus 3 degrees in this situation without devastating \nan industry seems to make eminent good sense. It seems to me if we can \ntransport chickens 2,000 miles and still beat the California Poultry \nFederation's price, there may be something wrong with the California \nPoultry Federation.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say to my friends, it is hard to \nknow what to say to my friends at this point, because when we started \nthis debate, we wondered if we could keep it together through the \nentire debate. I compliment all of us; we have kept it together.\n  Again, I am going to finish off where I started, and then you are \ngoing to have to hear it again for 2 more minutes before the vote.\n  If I told you that this desk is a chair, you would think I was \nkidding. And if I told you that winter was summer and summer was \nwinter, and ice was hot and warm was cold, and freezers were toasters, \nyou would send me to the nearest psychiatrist.\n  I have to say, everything stripped aside, because there is money in \nindustry on one side and money in industry on the other side and we \nknow that, the bottom line is what is fair and what is right and what \nis common sense and what is reality.\n  We can decide we are the scientists here, and we can decide at what \ndegree it is frozen and what degree it is fresh. I do not think that is \nour job. We have a fine, I believe, Department of Agriculture headed by \na very fine man from Kansas who knows agriculture. He stepped in and \noversaw this rule. We have a good rule. I hope we support it and defeat \nthe committee amendment.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, USDA's own study, conducted by the \nAgricultural Research Service, demonstrated that consumers cannot \ndetect any quality differences between poultry chilled to 26 degrees \nand poultry chilled to lower temperatures.\n  The Food Safety and Inspection Service based its rule on assertions \ngenerated through a well orchestrated public relations campaign by \nthose who would benefit from this new rule.\n  In effect, the agency is saying that although it cannot control \ntemperatures under ideal conditions in a laboratory, the poultry \nindustry must not let their products reach a temperature just 1 degree \nunder 26 or the products will be declared out of compliance and \nmislabeled.\n  I urge Senators to vote against the California Senators' motion to \ntable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13752-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 30 minutes for debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader \nbecause this Senate is getting ready to take a major step to end \nwelfare as we know it. The majority leader has put together a coalition \nthat is bipartisan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order? The Senator is \nentitled to be heard. She is making a very important statement. And \ncould we insist on order for the remaining half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that when we take this \nmajor step to end welfare as we know it, we will owe a great deal of \nthe thanks to our majority leader for putting together this bipartisan \ncoalition.\n  We are making an important policy change in America today. Welfare \nwill be a hand up but not a handout. Welfare will be there for a \ntransition, for people in trouble, but it will not become a way of \nlife.\n  There will be a 5-year lifetime limit on able-bodied people getting \nwelfare, so that family that is working hard to do better, to educate \ntheir children will know that they are not paying a bill for someone \nwho is able but not willing to work.\n  In our bill, block grants replace entitlements for seven AFDC \nprograms. We will be saving $60 billion in welfare costs, the most ever \ncut in welfare in our country's history.\n  What could have killed this bill was the inequity in block grants \namong the States. The States could have said, ``Well, if I don't get \nthis for my State, I'm walking away from welfare reform.''\n  But many of us were able to get together and say each State is \ndifferent. What we have done in the past is different, what we are \ngoing to do in the future is different and, therefore, we must \naccommodate each State.\n  Everyone has given so that we will have parity over the next 7 years. \nThat is the hallmark of this bill: States rights, State flexibility to \nprovide the programs that fit their needs.\n  In fact, it is the policy set by the Congress that States can become \nmore efficient and responsive if Washington, DC, will just get out of \nthe way. And today, Mr. President, Washington is going to get out of \nthe way. Thank you.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the indomitable \nSenator from Illinois, [Ms. Moseley-Braun].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is poised to take action on one of the most \npolitical issues facing this Congress. There is bipartisan agreement \nthat welfare reform is needed, welfare is not a free ride, and work \nrequirements should be placed on adult recipients as a condition of \nreceipt. Certainly anybody who can work should work.\n  Welfare should have more than one goal, however. It should not only \nput people to work but it should also protect children. This bill, \nhowever, regrettably, does neither. It bears repeating. Of the 14 \nmillion-plus welfare recipients, two-thirds, or nearly 9.6 million \npeople, are children; 60 percent of those children are under 6 years \nold. It is the 5 million preschool-age babies who will be the real \nobjects of our decisionmaking today.\n  The most stunning error of this bill, in my opinion, is that it \nignores entirely the plight of poor children. It dismantles the 60-\nyear-old Federal safety net that has assured at least some assistance \nto them. This bill completely ignores the consequences to our national \ncommunity of the abandonment of a safety net for poor children. \n\n[[Page S13773]]\n\n  Earlier in this debate, I showed pictures from around the turn of the \ncentury, before we had a national Federal safety net. Those pictures \nshowed young children sleeping on grates and picking through trash. Is \nthat where we want to be when we enter the 21st century?\n  Mr. President, I am afraid this bill could make that shameful history \na new reality. In my opinion, this bill takes a Pontius Pilate approach \nto Federal responsibility. As a national community, we are here washing \nour hands of responsibility for these poor children. This bill sends \nthe problem to the States with high-flown rhetoric about State \nresponsibility and innovation.\n  But what if--what if--a State proves unwilling to address the poverty \nof children in its midst? Are we to concede there is nothing that we as \na national community should do? This bill makes certain that there is \nnothing that we can do.\n  And what if the States find, as Senator Moynihan has shown, that \nincidents of child poverty in this country are localized in urban areas \nor in pockets of rural poverty? What if the States find that? Child \npoverty may not be a problem that is most effectively addressed by \nblock grants to State governments. Who will speak for the children \nthen?\n  It is said that this bill will end welfare as we know it. Had it \nended welfare abuses, I would have been among the first to applaud it. \nHad it rationally addressed ending the poverty that is the first level \nqualifier for welfare, I would have enthusiastically supported it. But \nit does neither, and it will not end welfare as we know it but rather \ncreates 50 welfare systems with the potential for real tragedy for \nchildren.\n  In my opinion, Mr. President, that is the fatal flaw of this \nlegislation; that this is welfare as we knew it, back to the days of \nstreet urchins and friendless foundlings and homeless half-orphans. I, \nfor one, am not prepared to take so giant a step backward or to be so \ngenerous with the suffering of those 5 million poor children under the \nage of 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, first, I would just like to respond to \nmy colleague, whom I admire and whom I know feels deeply about \nchildren, about those who may not have a safety net protection. I would \njust like to say to Senator Moseley-Braun that I think one of the real \nstrengths of this legislation is that we did strengthen child care, and \nchild care is a very important requirement in order to have successful \nwelfare reform.\n  I think this bill does strike a good balance, and I express my \nappreciation to those on both sides of the aisle who have worked to \nshape an exceptionally strong welfare reform bill, particularly the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, who has tried hard to balance the \ninterests of many people on both sides of this aisle, to Senator \nSantorum who also has worked tirelessly among those on our side of the \naisle and those on the other side of the aisle. I will say to Senator \nDodd, as well, who has cared a great deal about trying to meet the \nneeds of children in this legislation, that I think we do have a good \nwelfare reform bill and, most importantly, it is not welfare as an \nentitlement. That starts us on a new path and one that I think will be \nmost successful.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I happily yield 3 minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have offered amendments that have \nbeen adopted--and so have other colleagues--that have mitigated some of \nthe harshest effects of this piece of legislation. But an essential \ntruth remains. For the first time in 60 years, we are eliminating a \nfloor below which we never before allowed children to fall. Mr. \nPresident, for the first time in 60 years, we are saying that as a \nnational commitment, as a national community, we will no longer take \nthe responsibility to make sure that every child, even the poorest of \nchildren, at least has some minimal level of assistance, that children \ndo not go hungry.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask myself the question: Will the passage of this \nlegislation mean that there will be more impoverished children and more \nhungry children in America? The answer to that question is yes, and \nthat is why I must vote no.\n  Mr. President, I ask myself the question: Is it true that the passage \nof this legislation will shut out hundreds of thousands of disabled \nchildren from essential services? The answer to that question is yes. \nThat is why I will vote no.\n  Mr. President, I ask myself, as a Senator from Minnesota, the \nfollowing question: In the context of all of the slash and burn--cuts \nin housing, cuts in Medicare, cuts in Medicaid, cuts in EITC, cuts in \nall these programs, with States then having to figure out where they \nare going to come up with the resources--I ask myself the question: Who \nis going to lose out? The answer is that it is going to be the \nchildren. They do not have a lobbyist. They do not have the PAC's. They \nare not the heavy hitters. They are the ones who are going to be left \nbehind. And it is for that reason, Mr. President, that I will vote no.\n  We moved to a national standard in the early 1970's because we had \nchildren with distended bellies in our country. We had malnourishment \nand hunger in America. We said as a national community that we would \nnot let that happen. Now we are turning the clock back. For the first \ntime in 60 years, we move away from that commitment.\n  This is a profound mistake for America.\n  Mr. President, I ask myself the question: Is it the Minnesota \ntradition--an almost unique tradition--to speak for children, to \nadvocate for children, to vote for children, to vote for all of God's \nchildren? And the answer to that question is ``yes.'' Therefore, as a \nSenator from Minnesota, I will vote ``no.''\n  The Dole bill will also affect the Hmong, approximately 30,000 of \nwhom live in Minnesota and share with us their rich heritage and \nculture. Many in the Hmong community came to the United States to \nescape persecution after they aided the United States in the secret war \nof Laos.\n  Many of the Hmong now receive SSI and will be in danger of losing \ntheir benefits under the Dole bill. It is difficult--due to language \nbarriers, lack of formal education and age--for the Hmong to become \nself sufficient. A large number of them depend on SSI benefits for \ntheir survival.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee].\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nmeasure before us today. We have been working on this for many months. \nI am pleased we are finally able to approve a bill with bipartisan \nsupport. This bill is very conscious of the needs of children, a group \nI strongly believe should be cared for in any welfare program.\n  The measure before us contains additional money for child care and \nrequires States to continue to maintain their financial effort for the \nlife of the bill, for the 5 years. Senators Breaux and Dodd were very \nhelpful in those issues. Under this measure, States would also be \nprohibited from denying benefits to single custodial parents with young \nchildren who do not work because the parents do not have child care.\n  This provision is extremely important for the protection of these \nvery young children. The last thing we want to have happen is for \nparents to be placed in the untenable position of having to choose \nbetween leaving their children unsupervised while they work or losing \ntheir entire cash benefit.\n  I would like to note that S. 1120, the bill before us, does not make \nany changes in the foster care and adoption assistance programs. It has \nlong been my belief that the Federal entitlement for these programs \nshould continue and we should not roll back the Federal protection \nparts of the foster care and adoption assistance. Those entitlements \nare continued in this legislation.\n  On the subject of children's SSI, the Senate bill retains the concept \nof cash assistance for poor, disabled children and does not go as far \nas the House in scaling back eligibility. I am pleased that the Senate \nchose to take a more balanced approach to this issue than \n\n[[Page S13774]]\nthe House. Most of the children in this program are severely disabled. \nWere it not for SSI, they would not be able to remain at home with \ntheir families.\n  I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his contribution to this \nbill in two areas--particularly in providing for the maintenance of the \neffort by the States. Senator Domenici led that effort. I also thank \nhim for his help in removing the mandatory family cap. Under the \nDomenici approach, which we adopted, the family cap remains an option \nfor the States. There is no evidence that denying benefits to women who \nhave additional children while on welfare has any impact on birth \nrates. Senator Domenici spoke forcefully on that.\n  Finally, I praise our majority leader, Senator Dole. But for his \nextraordinary efforts to find a common ground, we would not be here \ntoday. That is no easy feat, given our differences when we started out.\n  I thank him for his able leadership and the fact that we were able to \nachieve a bipartisan bill today.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to yield 3 \nminutes to my esteemed colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I will vote against this bill because I \nthink it would wipe out protection for families with children but would \ndo nothing to repair what is really wrong with welfare. We have made \nsome improvements in this bill, eliminating the job training \nconsolidation that never belonged in the welfare bill in the first \nplace. We tightened and strengthened child support enforcement. But the \nfundamental structure is deeply flawed and can only lead to deeper \npoverty and more dependency.\n  All we are really changing in this bill is the one thing that is not \nwrong with welfare--the financial relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and the State bureaucracy. That is not the problem. In fact, \nblock grants create a new problem because States that have increasing \nnumbers of poor families, because of a bad economy or simple population \ngrowth, would not have enough funds to assist these poor people.\n  Federal politicians should not simply transfer pots of money to State \npoliticians without any standards about what the money would be used \nfor. We do not need to transfer money from one bureaucrat to another \nbureaucrat. We need commitment to individual poor children.\n  While this bill would abandon the commitment, the real problems of \nwelfare would remain--the rules that penalize marriage and work, the \nindifferent local and county bureaucrats who treat people as numbers \nand do nothing to help people take care of themselves, the brutal job \nmarket, the deep cultural forces driving increases in divorce, \nillegitimacy, and teen pregnancy; all these problems would remain, and \nmany would get worse.\n  All this bill does is require States to penalize the children who are \nborn into and live in the midst of all of this turmoil.\n  With all the rhetoric about changing welfare, how did we wind up with \na bill that does nothing to change what is wrong with welfare? The \nshort answer is: politics.\n  Neither party was as serious about really changing welfare as it was \nabout capturing the welfare issue from the other party. Democrats \npromised to end welfare as we know it by tinkering with the levers of \ngovernment, mostly in a positive way, but not in a way that deeply \nchanges the lives of people on welfare. Republicans promised to do even \nbetter--abandon the welfare state. They would toss aside the Federal \nresponsibility for poor families and children altogether. They did not \nknow how to deal with the reality of poverty and welfare, so they came \nup with the solution by handing the whole problem over to the States \nfor them to solve. Block grants create an appearance of change, but no \nreal change.\n  The debate in the last few days, during which we accepted every \namendment that did not challenge the underlying political rhetoric, \nalso indicates the problem. The legislation does not abandon the \nmythical welfare state. But it does abandon our society's commitment to \nprotect poor children from abject poverty, hunger, abuse, neglect, and \ndeath. Meanwhile, it does nothing to fix the real problem.\n  I urge everyone to think twice before joining the rush to send this \ndeeply flawed bill forward into a process where it will get even worse.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as I have been saying ever since Congress began \nwelfare reform debate, unless we address illegitimacy, which is a root \ncause of welfare dependency, we will not truly reform welfare.\n  Only by taking away the cash incentive to have children out of \nwedlock can we hope to slow the increase of out-of-wedlock births and \nultimately end welfare.\n  Middle-class American families who want to have children have to \nplan, prepare, and save money because they understand the serious \nresponsibility involved in bringing children into this world. It is \nunfair to ask the same people to send their hard-earned tax dollars to \nsupport the reckless, irresponsible behavior of women who have children \nout of wedlock and continue to have them, expecting the taxpayers to \nsupport them.\n  It is clear that our country must begin to address the crisis of \nillegitimacy. Today, one-third of all children are born out of wedlock. \nAccording to Senator Moynihan, the illegitimacy rate will hit 50 \npercent by 2003, or sooner. The rise of illegitimacy and the collapse \nof the family has had a devastating effect on children and society. \nEven President Clinton has declared that the collapse of the family is \na major factor driving up America's crime rate.\n  Halting the rapid rise of illegitimacy must be the paramount goal of \nwelfare reform. Unfortunately, the Senate has been unable to follow the \nexample set earlier by the House and has not included provisions, like \nthe family cap, ending the current cash incentives for teenage mothers \nto have children out of wedlock.\n  The bill before us is far better than the one we started with. It has \nstrong work provisions, transfers flexibility to the States and, \noverall, is a good bill. Unfortunately, it fails in the one key area \nwhich I feel very strongly about. It does fail to address the crisis of \nillegitimacy.\n  It is a missed opportunity for the Senate to send out a loud and \nclear message that society does not condone the growth of out-of-\nwedlock childbearing, and that the taxpayers will not continue the same \nopen-ended subsidies for illegitimacy which has characterized welfare \nin the past.\n  I hope this bill returns from conference with strong provisions on \nillegitimacy. If it does, I will support it enthusiastically.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way to \nreform welfare. Punishing children is the wrong way. Denying realistic \njob training and work opportunities is the wrong way. Leaving States \nholding the bag is the wrong way. Too many of our Republican colleagues \nwant to reform welfare in the worst way, and that is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  After more than 60 years of maintaining a good-faith national \ncommitment to protect all needy children, the Senate is on the brink of \ncommitting legislative child abuse. This measure is an assault on \nAmerica's youngest and most vulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues \nto join with me in doing the right and compassionate thing, and vote \n``no''.\n  In 1935, President Roosevelt said:\n\n       The test of our progress is not whether we add to the \n     abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide \n     enough to those who have little.\n\n  In passing the Social Security Act, Congress made a bold pledge to \nthe elderly and to the children of our society that their well being \nwould be ensured. It was a sign of what we stood for as a society.\n  With that legislation, Congress, made a historic promise--that no \nchild would be left alone to face the cruel forces of poverty and \nhunger. Today, more than 60 years later, the Senate is breaking that \npromise. As an institution, we are turning our back on America's \nchildren.\n  If this legislation passes, whether needy children receive a helping \nhand \n\n[[Page S13775]]\nwill depend on whether they are fortunate enough to be born in a State \nthat has the resources and the will to provide that assistance. A \nminimal safety net for children will no longer be a part of what makes \nAmerica America, but rather a gamble of geography.\n  This bill nullifies one of the fundamental roles of the Federal \nGovernment--to bring our country together as a nation. Instead it will \nencourage border wars as States across the country selfishly compete to \nassure that they do not become too generous to the needy and attract \nfamilies from other States.\n  Granted, the child care and other modifications achieved in recent \ndays have made this legislation less bad than it was. And that is no \nsmall achievement. But it is hardly a reason to support a measure that \nwill devastate the lives of millions of American children to say it \ncould be even worse--and probably will be after the Conference with the \nHouse.\n  This bill is not about moving American families from welfare to work. \nIt is about cutting off assistance to millions of poor, hungry, \nhomeless, and disabled children.\n  This bill is not about fiscal responsibility or deficit reduction. It \nis about misguided priorities--for which, as the columnist George Will \nhas said, we will pay dearly as a society for years to come.\n  This bill is not about eliminating the barriers to employment that \nexist for people on welfare. It is about short-changing the job \ntraining and child care programs needed to give people a chance. It is \nabout setting arbitrary time limits on assistance for families who \ncannot find jobs, and providing grossly inadequate resources to make \ngenuine opportunity a reality.\n  This bill is not about giving States more flexibility. It is about \nCongress washing its hands of a difficult problem, by slashing Federal \nfunding, and then turning the remains over to the States with little \naccountability or guidance and even less leadership.\n  This bill is not welfare reform--it is welfare fraud. We are all for \nwork--but this plan will not work. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that only 10 to 15 States will be able to meet the bill's \nwork requirements and the rest will simply throw up their hands.\n  These actions are in no way required by the current balanced budget \nenvironment. The Republican majority has already shown that it is \nwilling to spend money when the cause is important enough to them. When \nthe Republican majority wanted to preserve a $1.5 billion tax loophole \nfor American billionaires who renounce their U.S. citizenship, they \nfound the money to preserve it. When the Republican majority wanted to \nincrease defense spending $6.5 billion more than the Defense Department \nrequested for this year, they found the money to fund it. When the \nRepublican majority wanted to give the wealthy a $245 billion tax \nbreak, they will find the money to fund it.\n  But now, when asked to reform welfare and create a genuine system to \nhelp America's 10 million children living in poverty, the Republican \nmajority tells those children: ``Sorry--check returned--insufficient \nfunds.''\n  For billionaires, the Republicans will move mountains. For poor \nchildren they will not lift a finger--and their record makes that \nclear. As President Kennedy said in his inaugural address: ``If a free \nsociety cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who \nare rich.''\n  Poor children in America are worse off than poor children in 15 of \nthe 18 Western industrial nations. The annual incomes for the poorest \n10 percent of Canadian families, including all benefits, is nearly \ntwice that of families in the United States. The United States has the \ngreatest gap between the rich and the poor--a gap that will surely grow \nin the years ahead because of this harsh legislation.\n  Despite these realities, the Republican majority wants to take $60 \nbillion over the next 7 years from programs supporting poor children \nand families, in order to help balance the budget and pay for their tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. That is their priority.\n  When we tried to pay for increases in child care by closing the \nbillionaires' loophole or ending other forms of corporate welfare, the \nRepublicans said no--take it out of food stamps. They would rather harm \npoor children than offend fat cats who live on corporate welfare.\n  Some in the Republican majority say that this legislation will \nsucceed--that faced with the prospect of benefits being cut off, \nwelfare recipients will have no choice but to find work. Governor \nEngler of Michigan made that argument when eliminating Michigan's \nState-funded General Assistance Program. Unfortunately, things did not \nwork out the way the Governor had said. Only one-fifth of the former \nwelfare recipients found jobs --the majority became even more \ndestitute.\n  And so it goes when social experiments go wrong. The Republican \nmajority is asking us to put the lives of children in their hands as \nthey prepare to push welfare recipients off the cliff in the hope that \nthey will learn to fly. And what happens if they fail? Ten million \nchildren, who make up the majority of AFDC recipients, will pay the \nprice, and as a society, so will we.\n  This is not just theory. We already know some of the havoc this \nlegislation will cause. The administration estimates that the 5-year \ntime limit in the bill will result in one-third of the children on AFDC \nbecoming ineligible for assistance--4 million children. Yet when we \nproposed to give the States the option of providing vouchers to protect \nthese children after the time limit, the Republicans said no. So much \nfor States rights.\n  Of the parents who will be affected by the time limit, only one-third \nhave a high school degree. Yet recent studies show that three-quarters \nof the available jobs in low-income areas require a high school \ndiploma. Sixty percent of those jobs require experience in a particular \ntype of job. And there are already two to three jobseekers for every \njob vacancy.\n  This bill is not seriously designed to change those realities. There \nis no way this bill can create jobs for millions of low-income, low-\nskilled parents who will be looking for work at the same time in the \nsame communities. It will not help schools do a better job of preparing \nyoung men and women for an increasingly demanding workplace. In fact, \nthe Republican majority is busy cutting the very education and job \ntraining funds necessary to produce a skilled American work force in \nthe years ahead.\n  Welfare reform cannot be accomplished on the cheap. Governor Tommy \nThompson of Wisconsin, whose welfare expertise has been praised \nrepeatedly by the Republican majority, was recently quoted in Business \nWeek as saying that in order for welfare reform to be successful, ``It \nwill cost more up front to transform the welfare system than many \nexpect.'' After his reforms in Wisconsin, administrative costs rose by \n72 percent.\n  My Republican colleagues are correct when they say that this is an \nhistoric moment in the Senate. If this bill passes, today will go down \nin history as the day the Senate turned its back on needy children, on \npoor mothers struggling to make ends meet, on millions of fellow \ncitizens who need our help the most. It will be remembered as the day \nthe Senate broke a noble promise to the most vulnerable Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no''--for the children who are too young \nto vote and who cannot speak for themselves. This bad bill can be \nsummed up in four simple words--``Let them eat cake.''\n  I say to my colleagues--can you look into the eyes of a poor child in \nAmerica and say, ``This is the best hope for your future'' I cannot--\nand that is why I must vote ``no''.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with reluctance that I rise in \nsupport of the welfare legislation which the Senate is about to pass.\n  I have serious reservations about many aspects of the bill as it now \nstands, not the least of which is the ability of States to address the \nneeds of poor children during periods of recession or economic \ndownturns.\n  Having said that, I believe that the modifications adopted in the \nagreement between the Democratic and Republican Leaders begin to move \nthis bill in the right direction. Compared to legislation passed by the \nHouse earlier this year, it is substantially more responsible and in \nthat sense, more likely to succeed.\n  First, the bill provides for an additional $3 billion for child care \nfor those moving from welfare to work. We should expect those people on \nwelfare \n\n[[Page S13776]]\nto go to work. But to do so, we must give them the tools to go to work. \nAnd child care is the most significant problem young mothers face as \nthey try to move into the work force.\n  Second, the bill now requires States to maintain a safety net for \npoor children through the so-called maintenance-of-effort requirement. \nAs a result, States must continue to spend at least 80 percent of their \ncurrent welfare spending for the next 5 years. This will help ensure \nStates go the extra mile to move people from welfare to work, rather \nthan simply forcing recipients off of the rolls with no chance for \nemployment.\n  Third, the bill does not include a job training block grant that \ncould have siphoned off precious dollars used to help retrain victims \nof foreign competition, base and plant closings, or the negative \neffects of corporate downsizing.\n  Fourth, the bill creates a very modest contingency grant fund of $1 \nbillion which States could tap to deal with increased need due to the \neffects of a recession or population growth.\n  In addition to these provisions, the bill incorporates much of the \nDemocratic Work First proposal, S. 1117, in several key areas.\n  Teen Pregnancy: The bill includes the tough stay-at-home and stay-in-\nschool provisions of the Work First bill. It also makes $150 million \navailable as seed money for second chance homes, locally-based, \nsupervised group homes for teen-age mothers which have been popularized \nby the Democratic Leadership Council.\n  Private sector work bonus: The bill also contains a bonus pool of \nfunds that will be awarded, in part, on the basis of States' success at \nmoving welfare recipients into private sector work.\n  Parent empowerment contract: The final bill has a requirement for a \nparent empowerment contract that welfare recipients would have to sign \nonce they sign up for benefits. This contract obligates them to take \ncharge of their own lives, commit to acting as responsible parents, and \nundertake an intensive job search--all designed to move them from \nwelfare to work.\n  Work requirements: Finally, the bill includes provisions of the work \nfirst bill that tell States they should do everything they can to be \nmoving welfare recipients into the work force as quickly as possible, \nwith the expectation that the period for a transition from welfare to \nwork should be approximately 6 months.\n  Having announced my support for this measure, albeit with some great \nreservations, I want the conferees on this bill to know that I will not \nsupport any conference report that moves in any significant and \nsubstantial way toward the punitive and harsh proposals in the House-\npassed welfare bill.\n  If the conference agreement contains a mandatory family cap, or \narbitrarily cuts off benefits for young women, I will oppose it.\n  If it modifies the child care or maintenance of effort provisions now \nin the Senate bill, I will not support it.\n  If it has no means for States to cope with economic downturns, I will \nwithdraw my endorsement.\n  If it moves to block grants for foster care and adoption assistance, \nfor food stamps or child nutrition programs, this Senator will cast a \n``no'' vote on that conference report.\n  I hope that the Senate framework will emerge from the conference \ncommittee so that we can have bipartisan welfare reform this year. But \nif not, this Senator will be on this floor later this year fighting to \nstop a bad bill from getting enacted.\n\n\n               information technology and welfare reform\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to raise a subject which I \nbelieve will be a key problem for the States in implementing welfare \nreform under block grants--ensuring the States are able to make the \nnecessary investments in information technology.\n  Most of our attention here on the floor has been with regard to very \ncontentious social issues such as work requirements and unwed mothers. \nWe have devoted little attention to the problems States will face in \nmanaging the vastly increasing responsibilities which this legislation \nwill transfer to them. I am concerned that all our hard work to set the \nstage for new and successful human services programs will fall short of \nits goal if States are not equipped with the necessary information \nsystems. If the States are unable to handle these enlarged \nresponsibilities, pressure will rapidly build for the Federal \nGovernment, piece by piece, to become involved once again in managing \nthese programs.\n  The unfortunate fact is that many States are far behind the rest of \nour society in computerizing and reinventing the delivery of their \nservices. Among the State agencies, it is often the human service \nagencies which are the most in need of automation. While I endorse the \nconcept of block grants and the latitude they provide to States, I \nbelieve the Federal Government must continue to provide specific \nassistance to States to automate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My colleague raises an excellent point. Many States at \npresent are struggling to take advantage of the benefits which \ninformation technology can provide. Twenty-two States are currently \nunder court order to improve their child welfare programs. One of the \nsaddest examples is right here in the District of Columbia, where the \nfoster care system was placed in receivership by the courts.\n  According to the court-appointed receivers, the system of foster care \nplacement was failing some of the city's most needy children. One of \nthe major problems was a lack of information available to the field, \nlargely due to the lack of even basic computer support in the \nDistrict's foster care system. This is symptomatic of problems across \nour Nation, problems which can be overcome through effective use of \ninformation technology. Yet the States and the District face compelling \nalternative uses for the funds as caseloads increase.\n  Mr. COHEN. Congress over the years has sought to ensure that States \nhave the proper tools to handle their responsibilities in human \nservices programs. For example, the fiscal year 1993 Omnibus \nReconciliation Act provided matching of State funds over a 3-year \nperiod to be spent or information systems for foster care and adoption \nassistance programs. Forty-six States and the District of Columbia have \nresponded, and are on their way to improving their information \ntechnology systems in these critical areas.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Increased automation will bring many efficiencies to \nhuman services programs. In numerous cases, State workers enter \nessentially the same information as many as 200 times in required \npaperwork. This wasteful duplication can be eliminated through \nautomation. Further, investments in information technology yield \nsubstantial savings in welfare programs through elimination of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. In Rhode Island, for example, a $10 million \ninvestment in technology saved over $7.7 million in erroneous welfare \nbenefit payments in the first year of operation. By now this investment \nhas paid for itself many times over. The system allowed the State to \nhandle a 40-percent increase in welfare cases, while reducing its \nprogram work force by 15 percent over a 4-year period.\n  Mr. COHEN. Unfortunately, without Federal help, many States will not \nbe able to afford the up-front costs required to plan, develop, and \ninstall these systems, and train personnel on their use. This is why \nthe Federal Government has always maintained a leadership role in this \narea. I strongly believe we must continue specific assistance to States \nin making information technology investments, even in a block grant \nenvironment. I call on the eventual conferees on this legislation to \ncarefully consider this point, and work with the House to ensure the \nStates have the resources to make the necessary investments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I join my colleague in making this request. I think \nsome further consideration of the information technology needs of the \nStates is vital for welfare reform to succeed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2683\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Dole \nmodified amendment. Every Member of this body has come to the floor and \ndeclared that it is time to ``end welfare as we know it.'' We have \ndisagreed on the most appropriate ways to do that but I hope that there \ncan be no disagreement that welfare reform will not succeed without a \nmore generous provision for child care services.\n  Even under the current system of entitlement, there are more than \n3,000 \n\n[[Page S13777]]\nchildren of working parents already waiting to receive child care \nassistance in Maine. Some of these parents have transitioned off of \nwelfare, others are at-risk of going on welfare. One child care center \nin Maine has just now started serving families who have been on a \nwaiting list for more than 2 years.\n  This amendment will create a separate block grant for child care \nservices. By creating this separate grant fund, we hope to assist \nStates by providing them with a specific amount of child care funds. \nThis is identical to the approach the House of Representatives elected \nto take in the Personal Responsibility Act. We have gone further to \nprovide States with additional funds and to help ensure that child care \nfunding does not disappear for welfare families and low-income families \nalike.\n  I am glad to see that the Governors have finally weighed in on this \nissue. Last week, I received a copy of a letter sent to both the \nmajority and minority leadership from the National Governor's \nAssociation requesting supplemental funds for child care services. I \nwould like to quote one sentence from the letter, signed by Governor \nThompson from Wisconsin and Governor Miller from Nevada. The NGA states \nthat:\n\n       Child care represents the largest part of the up-front \n     investment need for successful welfare reform.\n\n  More women will be able to work when there are child care funds \navailable. More women who have jobs now will keep them if there are \nfunds for child care. In a report issued by the General Accounting \nOffice in December, GAO found that child care costs are a significant \nportion of most low-income working families' budgets. In fact, child \ncare consumes more than one quarter of the income for a family below \nthe Federal poverty level. For families above the Federal poverty \nlevel, child care consumes about 7 percent of income.\n  Unlike the Dodd-Kennedy amendment, we know where the funds are coming \nfrom to pay for additional child care slots. I support our efforts to \neliminate the deficit by 2002 but finding money for States to follow \nthrough on welfare reform is imperative. By agreeing to realize a \nsmaller amount in overall savings from this legislation, we have taken \nthe steps necessary to lead to successful welfare reform and help us \nmaintain our goal to zero out the deficit.\n  While there has been an emphasis on the need to help States meet work \nparticipation requirements, of utmost concern is the safety of \nchildren. Some parents are already forced to leave their children in \nunsafe settings. I recently reviewed a report from the State of \nIllinois where more than 40 children, half of them under the age of \ntwo, were discovered being cared for in a basement by one adult. The \ncost of that care was $25 per week.\n  This is not an isolated case. Recent studies have indicated that 1 \nout of every 8 children in child care are being cared for in an unsafe \nsetting.\n  The provision for child care services in Senator Dole's earlier \nsubstitute did provide certain protections for children who are not yet \nin school by prohibiting States from penalizing mothers who cannot work \nbecause there simply is no child care available.\n  The Senate also overwhelmingly approved an amendment sponsored by \nSenator Kassebaum to eliminate a provision that allowed a transfer of \nup to 30 percent of the funds from the child care development block \ngrant. The CCDBG has played an important role since its creation in \n1990 as a source of funds targeted at enhancing the quality of child \ncare and providing subsidies to low-income families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Without access to \nchild care, mothers will not be able to work. When 92 percent of AFDC \nmothers are single mothers, the need for additional child care slots \nmust be met if our version of welfare reform is going to be successful.\n\n\n                    interracial adoption provisions\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced the \nAdoption Antidiscrimination Act of 1995, S. 637, to ensure that \nadoptions are not denied or delayed on the basis of race, color, or \nnational origin. I am pleased that the House passed an almost identical \nprovision in its welfare reform bill, H.R. 1. It is my hope that the \nmembers of the conference committee on welfare reform will recognize \nthe importance of this issue, and incorporate interracial adoption \nprovisions in the conference report.\n  In the late 1960's and early 1970's, over 10,000 children were \nadopted by families of a different race. This was before many adoption \nofficials decided, without any empirical evidence, that it is essential \nfor children to be matched with families of the same race, even if they \nhave to wait for long periods for such a family to come along. The \nforces of political correctness declared interracial adoptions the \nequivalent of cultural genocide. This was, and continues to be, \nnonsense.\n  Sound research has found that interracial adoptions do not hurt the \nchildren or deprive them of their culture. According to Dr. Howard \nAlstein, who has studied 204 interracial adoptions since 1972, ``We \ncategorically have not found that white parents cannot prepare black \nkids culturally.'' He concluded that ``there are bumps along the way, \nbut the transracial adoptees in our study are not angry, racially \nconfused people'' and that ``They're happy and content adults.''\n  Since the mid-1970's, there have been very few interracial adoptions. \nAfrican-American children who constitute about 14 percent of the child \npopulation currently comprise over 40 percent of the 100,000 children \nwaiting for adoption in foster care. This is despite 20 years of \nFederal efforts to recruit African-American adoptive families and \nsubstantial efforts by the African-American community. The bottom line \nis that African-American children wait twice as long as other children \nto be adopted.\n  Last year, Senator Metzenbaum attempted to remedy this problem by \nintroducing the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 [MEPA]. \nUnfortunately, the bill was weakened throughout the legislative process \nand eviscerated by the Clinton administration Department of HHS in \nconference.\n  After the original MEPA bill was hijacked, a letter was sent from \nover 50 of the most prominent law professors in the country imploring \nCongress to reject the bill. They warned that it ``would give \nCongressional backing to practices that have the effect of condemning \nlarge numbers of children--particularly children of color--to \nunnecessarily long stays in institutions or foster care.'' Their \nwarning was not heeded, and the bill was passed as part of Goals 2000. \nAs Senator Metzenbaum concluded, ``HHS intervened and did the bill \ngreat harm.''\n\n  The legislation that was finally signed by the President does \nprecisely the opposite of what was originally intended. This is because \nit contains several huge loopholes that effectively permit continuing \nthe practice of racial matching. For example, it states that an agency \nmay not ``delay or deny the placement of a child for adoption or into \nfoster care solely on the basis of [race, color, or national origin]''. \nThis language can be used by those opposed to inter-racial adoptions to \ndelay or deny placements by using race, color, or national origin as \nonly part of their rationale.\n  An even bigger loophole is contained in the ``permissible \nconsideration'' section of MEPA which states that an agency ``may \nconsider the cultural, ethnic or racial background of the child and the \ncapacity of the prospective foster or adoptive parents to meet the \nneeds of a child of this background as one of a number of factors used \nto determine the best interests of a child.'' While this language may \nappear innocuous, it can be used by those who are committed to racial \nmatching to delay or deny a placement simply by claiming that an inter-\nracial adoption is not in the best interests of the child.\n  DHHS has issued guidelines for implementing the Multiethnic Placement \nAct. Again, on their face, the guidelines do not appear to be \nobjectionable. However, consistent with the underlying MEPA law, they \ncontinue to allow race to be a major consideration that may be used by \nthose who wish to stop interracial placements. Consequently, the \nNational Council for Adoption and Institute for Justice have informed \nthe Department that its guidelines do not adequately address this \nissue. They continue to believe that new legislation is necessary.\n  Clearly, we need to fix last year's flawed legislation. In \nconsidering the \n\n[[Page S13778]]\nHouse provisions on this issue, the conferees should prohibit, under \nany circumstances, an agency that receives Federal funds from delaying \nor denying the placement of a child on the basis of the race, color or \nnational origin. Racial or cultural background should never be used as \na basis for denying or delaying the placement of a child when there is \nat least one qualified household that wants the child.\n  Perhaps, there are certain extremely limited circumstances in which \nan agency should be allowed to consider race, color or national origin, \nonly when there are two or more qualified households that want the \nchild and only as one of a number of factors used to determine the best \ninterests of the child. But under no circumstances should such \nconsiderations be allowed to delay the adoption of a child. When there \nis only one qualified household that wants the child, that placement \nis, by definition, in the child's best interests.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that the conferees will be willing to adopt a \nstrong prohibition against consideration of race, color or national \norigin in placement decisions, and to close the gaping loopholes in the \ncurrent law. By incorporating strong and reasonable antidiscrimination \nprovisions in the Conference Report, we will help to remedy the \nnational problem of children being held in foster care because the \ncolor of their skin does not match that of the individuals who wish to \nadopt them.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2542\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the welfare reform bill imposes upon the \nStates a 6-month time limitation for any individual to participate in a \nFood Stamp Work Supplementation Program. This amendment, which is \nsupported by the National Governor's Association and the American \nPublic Welfare Association, would replace the 6-month limit with a 1-\nyear limit. It would continue to allow an extension of this time \nlimitation at the discretion of the Secretary.\n  Arizona's current cash-out of food stamps under its Empower welfare \nprogram allows individuals to participate in subsidized employment for \n9 months with an option for a 3-month extension. There is no reason \nthat the State should have to make another special request to the \nSecretary in order to maintain this policy. This amendment would allow \nStates with such policies to continue their programs without \ndisruption.\n  Ideally, I would prefer that the States be able to plan their work \nsupplementation programs without being constrained by requirements \nimposed by the Federal Government. The States know best how to \nstructure their programs to help their citizens become employable. \nThus, my preference would be to eliminate the time limitation \naltogether.\n  However, I recognize that many of my colleagues are insisting upon a \ntime limitation for individuals under the program, and I am pleased \nthat we were able to come to an agreement that meets the needs of \nArizona and other States that wish to pursue similar policies. In the \nfuture, I plan to revisit this issue to allow States maximum \nflexibility to plan their work supplementation programs.\n  Mr. President, a primary objective of this bill is to encourage the \nStates to innovate. The best way to achieve this is to get out of their \nway. We should not impose requirements limiting the States' flexibility \nunless there is a compelling reason to do so. This amendment will give \nStates additional leeway to innovate in their work supplementation \nprograms and will thereby help them achieve their employment \nobjectives.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2544\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would give States the right \nto correct problems in their welfare programs before penalties are \nimposed by the Federal Government. Titles I, III, and VIII of the bill \nimpose significant penalties, in the form of reductions in grant funds, \nfor States that are out of compliance with Federal requirements. I \nbelieve that it is simply unfair to punish States without first giving \nthem an adequate opportunity to remedy the problems.\n  Under this amendment, a State would have 60 days in which to submit \nto the Federal Government a corrective action plan to remedy any \nviolations for which a penalty could be assessed. The Federal \nGovernment would then have up to 60 days to accept or reject the \nState's corrective action plan. If it does not act within this period, \nthe plan will be deemed to be accepted. Finally, the State would have \n90 days to correct the violation pursuant to the plan before penalties \nmay be imposed. A longer correction period would apply if it is part of \nan accepted plan.\n  A major objective of the welfare reform bill is to give States \ngreater flexibility and freedom from Washington regulations in helping \ntheir welfare recipients to be productive, independent citizens. Where \nFederal requirements are imposed, States should have ample opportunity \nto comply with those requirements and correct any problems without \nbeing penalized. This amendment ensures this objective and the overall \napproach of giving States the flexibility to implement their programs.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is strongly supported by the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nand the American Public Welfare Association. I ask unanimous agreement \nthat the letter of support from the APWA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                          Welfare Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The American Public Welfare \n     Association strongly supports your amendment number 2541, \n     that relieves states from the excessive data collection and \n     reporting requirements in H.R. 4, if sufficient funding to \n     allow states to meet such excessive requirements is not \n     provided. We are deeply concerned that between the 15% \n     administrative cap approved by the Senate earlier this week, \n     the bill's penalty provisions, and the array of new and \n     burdensome reporting requirements contained in H.R. 4, states \n     will not have the systems support they will all need for \n     greatest transformation of their welfare systems to date.\n       APWA fully supports State accountability in the use of \n     block grant funds for national programmatic and fiscal goals. \n     APWA policy calls for a state federal partnership in the \n     establishment of minimal, clear, concise federal audit \n     standards, related penalties, or sanctions for noncompliance. \n     In addition, APWA supports your amendment number 2544, \n     providing states with advance notice of any impending \n     penalty, with the option of entering into a corrective action \n     plan. The measure provides for accountability by states and \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services during the \n     implementation of a corrective action plan, and provides \n     states with the opportunity to remain focused on reforming \n     their systems, while coming into compliance with the statute.\n       Finally, we support your amendment number 2543, to broaden \n     the definition of work to include job readiness workshops as \n     a work activity. With regard to work programs under a cash \n     assistance block grant, APWA policy calls for enhanced state \n     flexibility to design and implement work programs, including \n     the right to define work. We also support your amendment \n     number 2542, to remove the six month limit for an \n     individual's participation in a work supplementation program \n     under the food stamp program. Each of your amendments \n     contribute to increased flexibility for states.\n       Again, Senator McCain, thank you for offering these \n     amendments that are so vitally important to the successful \n     implementation of welfare reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            A. Sidney Johnson III,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                         welfare reform, again\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, like many voters, I have heard before \nthe siren call of welfare reform--that if we only pass revolutionary \nlegislation, the recipients will work, the poor children will be \nnurtured, and benefits reductions will be returned to taxpayers. \nFrankly, I am very skeptical that this plan will work better than those \nthat went before.\n  First, its promises continue to feed rife misperceptions. Note the \nfollowing facts:\n  Welfare actually is less than 2 percent of our budget.\n  Illegitimacy, far from rising due to the United States welfare \nsystem, has risen across the board to approximately one third of all \nbirths (not just welfare births) in America, France, and England \ndespite different welfare systems and declining welfare benefits in the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\n  True reform that employs recipients and cares for children is likely \nto cost more in the short run, not less.\n  In short, the savings proposed in this legislation are unlikely to \nmaterialize. The bill would not stop the rise in illegitimacy. And, \nwithout a newfound commitment from Governors to fill the gap in child \ncare, children will be worse off.\n  Furthermore, the basic funding mechanism for this legislation is \nseriously flawed. Southern States, for a variety of reasons including \nlack of funds, have built smaller welfare programs as part of the \nhistoric Federal-State welfare funding partnership. Now, the \nlegislation before us proposes to end that partnership and provide each \nState with a frozen level of funding and a requirement to employ 50 \npercent of recipients. Reasonably, the Federal Government should \nprovide an equal per-child amount to each State under this approach \nsince each State must reach the same target. Instead, this reform bill \nlocks States in at the vastly different historic funding rates:\n\n\n                       Federal funding per child\n\nNew York..........................................................$2036\nRhode Island.......................................................2244\nWashington.........................................................2340\nVermont............................................................2275\nAlaska.............................................................3248\nMassachusetts......................................................2177\nSouth Carolina......................................................393\nAlabama.............................................................408\nArkansas............................................................375\nMississippi.........................................................331\nTexas...............................................................405\n\n  I don't know why southern children are worth so little to our current \nwelfare theorists. There is no reason--indeed, it is offensive--to \nfreeze in place past inequities in the name of forward-looking reform.\n  Again, South Carolina and Rhode Island will each be given about $100 \nmillion per year to run their respective welfare programs, although \nSouth Carolina has more than three times as many people. Similarly, \nSouth Carolina has slightly more people than Connecticut--3.5 million \nrather than 3.2 million--but under the Dole plan, the Federal \nGovernment will give Connecticut more than twice as much--$247 million \nyearly instead of $103 million for South Carolina. In effect, the South \nCarolina taxpayer will chip in a double payment to help Connecticut \nwhile struggling to meet an extra burden at home to meet the Federal \nchild care and training targets.\n  How about Kansas? Kansas has 2.5 million people. South Carolina has \n3.5 million people. Despite having a million fewer people, Kansas gets \n$18 million more than South Carolina from Federal taxpayers over the \nnext 3 years to run its welfare program.\n\n  Mr. President, this unfairness has not fazed many of our governors. \nThey want the cash and the control, whether or not the plan will work. \nI predict that the promises of reform will again prove false, but as \nbefore, I endorse the goals. In 1988, I voted to make it possible for \nStates to draw down adequate funding for workfare programs and child \ncare to really reform welfare. We have recently seen a few glimmers of \nsuccess after that legislation, but only where investments have been \nmade. Similarly, I have voted for a community works progress pilot \nprogram to allow communities and welfare recipients to benefit mutually \nfrom community improvement jobs.\n  More importantly, I urge my colleagues to pay attention to the policy \nareas that are not called welfare, but which in reality, have huge, \nlong-term effects on welfare rolls. Chief among these policy areas are \neducation and job protection.\n  For instance, over the past 20 years, high school dropouts have \nbecome more likely to end up on welfare. Overall, the welfare rate for \nyoung adults has risen slightly from 4 percent to 5 percent. However, \namong the high school dropouts, the rate has nearly doubled, from 9.7 \nto 17.1 percent. These particular high school dropouts are mostly \nwomen, since women and their dependent children make up the vast \nmajority of welfare recipients.\n  However, a similar economic decline has faced their male \ncounterparts, who generally do not have dependent children who would \ntrigger welfare eligibility. Earnings for black male high-school \ndropouts fell by half from 1973 to 1989. About one third of all \nAmerican men aged 25-34 earn too little to raise a family of four out \nof poverty. And, not surprisingly from the perspective of poor women \nseeking a mate, poor young men and less than one third as likely to be \nmarried. In short, jobs have dried up for the high school dropout, \nmarriage has become less likely than before and the children of their \nincomplete families are more likely to be on welfare at a lower benefit \nlevel.\n  I urge my colleagues to take note of these facts--the importance of \neducation and livable-wage jobs to preventing welfare dependency--as \nthey work on the related issue of welfare reform. While we pass this \nreform bill on the Senate floor, recently passed cuts to education are \nheaded for conference with the House. Just as States are taking the \ninitiative to eliminate high school general-track education and replace \nit with tech prep programs that move graduates into better paying jobs, \nwe are cutting back on the Federal tech prep program that provided \nleadership and the Carl Perkins vocational education program \nappropriations that have helped fund implementation. Just as data show \nthat the economic split between college graduates and non-college \ngraduates is widening, we are cutting back on Perkins loans, student \nincentive grants, and in budget reconciliation, college loans. In \nshort, the data is telling us to go one way on education, but we are \ngoing the other way fast and bragging about welfare reform.\n  Similarly, on trade we have unilaterally disarmed, and in \nmanufacturing we refuse to invest. I have proposed a competitive trade \npolicy, including a competitive restructuring of our tax policy, and \nhave worked to invest in a stronger American manufacturing base.\n  Mr. President, I do not brag about today's welfare reform \nlegislation. In fact, my favorable vote today is largely an effort to \nprotect the child care improvements I have worked for in the Senate \nbill as it goes to conference with a less favorable House bill. \nFurthermore, I support it in the hope that, with welfare off the table, \nmy colleagues will look at the underlying problems that I have outlined \nand continue to work on improving access to jobs and education.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there is no doubt that our current system \nof welfare needs reforming. Each Member of the Senate knows that severe \nshort-comings exist in our welfare program and each is sincere in their \nefforts to solve these problems.\n  The bill before us highlights block grants as the principal \ninstrument for reform. By folding several programs into a block grant \ndirectly to States, the Federal Government will be giving broad \nauthority to the States to run their welfare programs, as well as lump-\nsum Federal payments to help cover costs. If this is done, the Federal \nguarantee of cash assistance to all eligible low-income mothers and \nchildren will end.\n  I originally supported the Daschle-Breaux-Mikulski Democratic \nalternative as the best, most compassionate means of reforming welfare. \nThe Work First reform plan would have changed the current system by: \nabolishing the AFDC Program and replacing it with a Temporary \nEmployment Assistance Program; establishing the Work First employment \nblock grant for States to get welfare recipients into jobs and to keep \nthem in the work force; and permitting the States to use block grant \nfunds to provide such services as job-placement vouchers, wage subsidy \nand work supplementation, on-the-job training or other training or \neducation for work preparation to assist recipients in obtaining jobs, \nand allowing the States to establish all eligibility rules.\n  Furthermore, it would have increased the Federal matching rate for \nwork-related activities, consolidated child care programs and increased \nthe Federal matching rate to make child care available to all those \nrequired to work or prepare for work, and extended Medicaid coverage \nfor an additional 12 months beyond the current 1-year transition \nperiod. It would have also required community service for those not \nworking within 6 months. In short, the Democratic plan would have met \nthe basic objective of the Republican plan in terms of allowing for \nState flexibility.\n  Its strength was that it provided for much more flexibility on the \npart of the State governments while also correctly recognizing that \narbitrary time-\n\n[[Page S13780]]\nlimits and monetary caps do not meet the test of sound policymaking. \nThe plan which I strongly supported provided for major reforms in the \nsystem, but at the same time allowed for the fact that every situation \nand case is unique, and that arbitrary standards and block-grants are \nnot panaceas for addressing every situation. It is these unique cases \nand situations that, unfortunately, are not addressed in the Republican \nplan. These are also the cases and situations which will end up costing \nthe system more in the long-term than under the current system. I still \nbelieve this was the best reform plan we could have adopted.\n  The Dole-Daschle compromise welfare reform legislation, while not as \nsound as the original Democratic plan, is still a vast improvement over \nthe Republican bill. I still have some objections to certain provisions \ncontained in the measure, but I believe, overall, that the good \noutweighs the bad. As is the case with virtually any comprehensive \nomnibus legislation we consider, this test has to be our bottom line: \nAre there enough positives to offset the negatives? I think the \ncompromise we have struck is a step in the right direction, and an \noverall positive effort at ending welfare as we know it.\n  One of the major problems I had with the original Dole bill was its \nfunding formula, which, in my judgment, was somewhat punitive to the \nSouthern States. In essence, it places the very States where most of \nthe welfare population lives at a disadvantage as compared to other \nregions. The formula in the Graham-Bumpers children's fair share \namendment, which was rejected, would have substantially increased poor \nStates' funding for legitimate recipients of welfare. Senator Graham \ntried again last Friday to alleviate some of the problems with the \nfunding formula by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nmore discretion in certain funding decisions, but that amendment was \nalso defeated. As with most funding formulas, the figures can be \nmisleading. In any event, I think that any problems that remain can be \nproperly addressed when they appear in the future. There will also be \nan opportunity for the conference committee to address remaining \ndeficiencies in the funding formula.\n  The Senate also agreed to a Daschle amendment creating a contingency \nfund for States during times of economic hardship. The original GOP \nblock grant froze funding for States over the next 5 years, with no \nconsideration for economic or natural disasters. This important \nprovision provides eligible States with the resources necessary to \nmanage unforeseen emergencies that are impossible to predict.\n  The second major objection I had to the original Republican plan was \nthat it did not provide enough funding for child care for those mothers \nwho will be required to work after 2 years. As Senator Moynihan \nsuccinctly put it during the debate on child care, we will either have \nto pay for child care, or for orphanages.\n  Senate leaders wisely opted to cover more expenses for child care. \nDemocrats were able to secure an additional $3 billion over 5 years for \na total of $8 billion in funding to guarantee the availability of child \ncare for mothers required to work. This is the key to shifting mothers \nof young children from the welfare rolls to the pay rolls. This major \nchange will assist many mothers and their families to permanently move \noff of welfare and into the work force.\n  Welfare reform legislation is among the most important issues we will \ntackle during this or any other Congress. Our debate over the last \ncouple of weeks has been civil, constructive, and, ultimately and most \nimportantly, productive. We now have a bill before us which is a \ntestament to the Senate and its leadership. In essence, it is a product \nof the Senate's legislative process working as it was designed to work, \nand I will vote in favor of this landmark welfare reform measure.\n  We have seen some hard-fought battles and witnessed significant \nchanges in the original bill after some intense debate and good-faith \nnegotiations between the two sides of the aisle. Each side has made \nconcessions, while holding firm to certain core principles. We have \narrived at agreements on several major issues. As a result, we now have \na bill that contains stronger work provisions and that is not as harsh \non children. While there are undoubtedly problems still remaining in \nthe legislation that will have to be addressed down the road, the Dole-\nDaschle compromise is an overall positive step for reforming welfare, \nreducing dependency, and offering a brighter future for millions of \nAmerican families.\n\n\n                  contingency fund eligibility trigger\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before we vote on the leadership \ncompromise amendment, I would like to raise a concern about the \ncontingency fund provision. I am concerned that, although included with \nthe best of intentions, the unemployment-rate criteria used to trigger \nState eligibility has not worked particularly well in the extended \nunemployment benefits program, and may not be the best measure of State \nneed for contingency fund assistance. I would appreciate the \nopportunity to work with the Finance Committee to identify another \ntrigger that more effectively accomplishes the purpose of the \ncontingency fund--to provide some degree of protection for States that \nexperience economic downturns, population shifts or natural disasters. \nI would like to clarify whether the authors of the amendment share my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I, too, am concerned about the ability of State to \nreceive needed assistance from the contingency fund in the event of a \nrecession or some other economic, demographic or natural calamity. I am \nvery interested in the potential for exploring other trigger options in \nconference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senators from North Dakota and Florida have raised a \nvery important issue. I believe this issue should be looked at more \nclosely during conference. The trigger provision in the amendment is \nidentical to the trigger for extended benefits under the unemployment \nprogram. I think it's fair to say that few of us are completely \ncomfortable with using that trigger in this context. We clearly need \nmore information than time currently allows before finalizing this \nissue.\n  Mr. DOLE. I share the opinion of the Democratic leader. We have every \nintention of closely examining this issue to ensure the contingency \nfund provides States with the protection it is intended to provide.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I just say that this is an \nextremely important issue, and requires the attention of the conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, one of the clear messages sent by the \nvoters in last year's elections was that confidence in the Federal \nGovernment to solve problems has declined precipitously over the past \n20-30 years. As David Broder observed in his Washington Post column, \nthe 1994 elections ``ushered in a fundamental debate about what \ngovernment should do, and what level of government should do it.''\n  There is a growing sense that the trend toward more centralized \ngovernment in Washington should be reversed and that decisionmaking \nauthority should revert back to the State and local levels. Some \nfunctions of government, like defense, must be conducted at the Federal \nlevel. Other functions, however, may best be left to the States.\n  Having said that, I believe we have a common and national interest in \nassuring an effective social safety net for all Americans, regardless \nof where citizens may reside. So I would not support any effort to \ncompletely remove the Federal Government from the welfare system.\n  Washington does not have all the answers. It is misguided, if not \ndownright arrogant, for us to assume that one-size-fits-all Federal \nsolutions offer better hope than granting more freedom to States to \ndesign approaches that address a State's unique set of circumstances.\n  In considering our welfare system, I think it is useful to \ndistinguish beneficiaries by three major groups.\n  First, there are those in need of temporary assistance. People who, \nwhile they are generally able to support themselves and their families, \nthey have fallen on hard times. Food stamps and other assistance must \nbe there to provide temporary help when unforeseen economic crises \noccur.\n  The second group includes those whom most of us would agree cannot \n\n[[Page S13781]]\n  work. These individuals--through no fault of their own, are simply not \nable to economically provide for themselves. They have disabilities \nthat warrant our compassion not our scorn. The welfare system should be \nthere for them.\n  The third group consists of people who fall somewhere in between the \nfirst and second groups. They have been on and off the welfare rolls \nfor years, yet they do not seem to fit the profile of someone whom most \nwould agree cannot work.\n  It is this third group that should be the focus of the current \nwelfare debate. The debate has often been extremely polarized. Many on \nthe left are reluctant to vest any sense of personal responsibility in \nwelfare recipients. They view them as unwitting victims of societal \ninjustices, refusing to acknowledge the role that personal behavior may \nplay.\n  On the other hand, many on the right are reluctant to acknowledge \nthat no person is an island--that each of us thrives or fails to \nthrive, to some extent, as a result of our environment. Some on the \nright naively believe that we all have the same opportunities and that \na failure to succeed is simply evidence of laziness.\n  As in most cases, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. We do no \none a favor by excusing them of all personal responsibility. But some \nof the poorest members of our society are born into environments of \ndrugs, crime, and severe poverty. Through government, we have an \nobligation to try to counter these negative influences.\n  Unavoidably, a debate about welfare is a debate about values. Richard \nPrice, the author of ``Clockers,'' a book about life in the inner city, \nsaid that during his year of living in a New York slum that he wanted \nto try to understand why some kids worked in McDonald's, earning \nminimum wage, while some of their peers hustled drugs outside, earning \nupward of $1,000 a day.\n  He said the key difference he was able to discern was that the kids \nworking in McDonald's had someone to go home to who offered them hope. \nFor these kids, working at McDonald's was a beginning not an end. The \nkids dealing drugs, however, had little hope about the future. They \nsensed that, if they went to work in McDonald's, they would never get \nout.\n  According to the author, the corollary to the hope that some homes \noffered was a sense of expectation that their children would meet \ncertain expectations. They instilled a sense of discipline and a sense \nof hope that convinced their kids that minimum wage at McDonald's was \nbetter than hundreds of dollars in the drug trade.\n  Parents are the principal source of moral teaching. Regrettably, too \nmany of our young people are growing up without two parents involved in \ntheir lives. The correlation between single parenthood and welfare \ndependency is overwhelming. Ninety-two percent of AFDC families have no \nfather in the home.\n  Society must also acknowledge the correlation between crime and \nfatherlessness. Three-quarters of all long-term prisoners grew up \nwithout fathers in their homes or active in their lives. When 24 \npercent of children born today are born to unwed mothers, we cannot \navoid this issue if we hope to break the cycle of poverty and crime \nthat permeate some of our communities.\n  Unfortunately, no one really knows how to counter this trend. For \nthis reason, I do not support efforts to attach a lot of strings to the \nwelfare block grants, including provisions ostensibly designed to curb \nillegitimacy. It is clear that welfare reform cannot disregard the \ngrowing incidence of out-of-wedlock births, teen pregnancy, and absent \nfathers, but it is also clear that we do not know what will counter \nthis trend. Accordingly, we ought not prescribe a Federal solution that \nwould hamstring the ability of States to try different approaches.\n  Time will tell how effective States will be in improving our welfare \nsystem. To the extent that we clarify what level of government is \nresponsible for welfare, I think we will go a long way to making the \nsystem more accountable and thereby more effective.\n  I support the general thrust of the pending welfare legislation to \nturn more decisionmaking authority over to the States. Consistency \nwould suggest that we not at the same time put a lot of requirements on \nStates on how and who to spend Federal welfare dollars. I do think that \nit is important to ensure that States share responsibility with the \nFederal Government by investing dollars at the State level in welfare \nprograms. For this reason, I think it is important that the block grant \nprovision include a maintenance of effort requirement.\n  Under current law, States have an incentive to spend their own money \non AFDC and related programs. That incentive is the Federal match. \nFourteen States receive 1 Federal dollar for each State dollar they \ninvest. The rest of the States receive more than a dollar-for-dollar \nmatch.\n  A maintenance of effort provision continues the incentive for a State \nto spend its own resources to aid its own people. Understand, however, \nthat the State match does not require a State to spend money. If a \nState is successful in trimming its costs, there is no requirement that \nit maintain its spending. But if a State is going to realize savings in \nits welfare program, I think the Federal Government should share in the \nsavings, too.\n  I am also concerned about the bind States may find themselves in with \nrespect to child care. Even under the current system of entitlement, \nthere are more than 3,000 children of working parents already waiting \nto receive child care assistance in Maine. Some of these parents have \ntransitioned off of welfare, others are at risk of going on welfare. \nThe pending legislation has a strong work requirement--States that are \nnot successful in placing 25 percent of recipients in work programs in \n1996 will lose 5 percent of their block grant allocation, no questions \nasked.\n  The provision for child care services in Senator Dole's substitute \ndoes provide protections for children who are not yet in school by \nprohibiting States from penalizing mothers who cannot work because \nthere simply is no child care available.\n  I believe we are addressing my concerns with child care. Last week, \nthe Senate overwhelmingly approved Senator Kassebaum's amendment which \nprohibits the transfer of money from the child care development block \ngrant to activities not associated with child care. The amendment also \nstreamlines the administration of child care programs because States \nwill now be able to operate a unified child care system. No longer will \nmothers who successfully move off of welfare have to move their \nchildren out of a child care facility simply because they are no longer \neligible for AFDC.\n  To give States a shot at meeting the goals of welfare reform, we have \nnow provided States with $3 billion to expand child care services. In \nthe year 2000, States must put 50 percent of their welfare population \nto work. This means that Maine will have to increase the number of \nworking welfare recipients by 64 percent. Now that we have reached an \nagreement to realize a smaller amount of overall savings in the short \nterm, in the long term these additional dollars will pay off.\n  A vivid example of a welfare program run amuck is the SSI Program, \nwhich I have investigated over the past several years through my work \non the Special Committee on Aging.\n  Our investigations have discovered that the Federal disability \nprograms, which were intended as a vital safety net for America's most \nvulnerable citizens--the elderly and the disabled poor--have mushroomed \ninto the largest and fastest growing cash welfare programs in the \nFederal Government. Despite the huge outlay of taxpayer and social \nsecurity trust fund dollars, we have paid far little attention to how \nthese benefits are being spent and taken far too little notice of how \nthe disability programs are being abused.\n  The lax management and rampant abuses in the SSI Program that have \ncome to light through these investigations shocked the public. Drug \naddicts and alcoholics have been using cash SSI benefits to subsidize \nand perpetuate their addictions, and many addicts were actually seeking \nout the SSI Program as a steady source of cash to support their habits. \nThe message of the program has been, ``Stay addicted and you qualify \nfor benefits. But stop drinking or shooting up drugs and the benefits \nwill stop.''\n  Tragically, these policies have not only drained the Federal \nTreasury, but \n\n[[Page S13782]]\nhave also been destructive to substance abusers themselves, by \nrewarding addiction and discouraging, or failing to require, necessary \ntreatment to pave the way to rehabilitation.\n  Following legislation I introduced to correct these abuses, Congress \ntook swift action to place protections on disability benefits paid to \ndrug addicts and alcoholics. We took the cash out of the hands of the \naddicts by requiring them to have third parties handle their benefits \nfor them, and made alcoholics and addicts eligible for SSI only if they \nreceive treatment for their addictions. Finally, we imposed a 3 year \ncut-off of SSI and disability insurance benefits for addicts and \nalcoholics.\n  These changes enacted last year removed major incentives for abuse of \nthe SSI Program and encouraged rehabilitation, rather than lifelong \ndependency.\n  Another stunning example of abuse of the SSI Program pertains to one \nof the major areas of growth in the SSI Program, namely, benefits for \nlegal immigrants. Just last week, for example, I released a GAO report \nfinding that the Social Security Administration is not doing enough to \ncrack down on fraud by translators who fraudulently assist legal \nimmigrants qualify for SSI benefits. In one case, a middleman arrested \nfor fraud had helped at least 240 immigrants obtain $7 million in SSI \nbenefits by coaching them on medical symptoms and providing false \ninformation on their medical histories. The GAO has identified major \nweaknesses in how SSA awards SSI benefits to legal immigrants.\n  While the bill before us will go far in reducing the problem of \nunchecked benefits to legal immigrants, this will continue to be an \narea of potential abuse that we must continue to watch carefully.\n  Fraud and abuse in SSI should not be the only cause for reform of the \ndisability programs. Even more fundamental problems should motivate \nreform. First, the SSI and disability insurance programs as now \nstructured encourage lifelong dependency, not rehabilitation. The \nprograms return virtually no one to work: Less than 1 person in 1,000 \non the SSI-DI rolls gets off the program through the programs' \nrehabilitation efforts.\n  We must address the growth of these programs if we are to preserve \nthem for the truly disabled. Persons are getting SSI at younger ages, \nwith very little chance of ever getting off the rolls. The SSA recently \nestimated that a typical SSI recipient will stay on the rolls for about \n11 years, and we are paying out roughly $51,000 in SSI benefits to each \nnew person on the rolls over this period of time. The cost to the \nGovernment for each recipient is far higher when Medicaid and food \nstamps are added to the equation: Recipients can receive total Federal \nbenefits of about $113,000 when these other programs are taken into \naccount.\n  With dollars this large at stake it is crucial that we do all we can \nto reform the disability program so that it emphasizes rehabilitation \nrather than dependency. In reforming this program, our guiding \nprinciple must be that we preserve the disability programs for the \ntruly disabled, but that we not remain blind to the very real problems \nthat exist within the SSI Program.\n  As Marvin Olasky noted in his recent book, ``The Tragedy of American \nCompassion,'' effective welfare requires the ability to distinguish \nthose who have fallen on hard times and need a helping hand from those \nwho simply refuse to act in a disciplined and responsible manner. When \nwelfare is a Federal entitlement, it is very difficult to make these \ndistinctions. Giving State and local governments more discretion in the \nwelfare system is a step in the right direction.\n  Block-granting AFDC to the States is not a panacea. A welfare system \nthat has clearer lines of responsibility and accountability will be \nmore effective. But this is not the end of the welfare debate. \nHopefully, the legislation we enact this year will make meaningful \nimprovements in the current system. But turning these programs over to \nthe States will not itself fix the problems. Congress and the President \nmust continue to work with States to improve the welfare system to make \nsure that a safety net is there for those who need it but is denied to \nthose who abuse it.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the landmark \nwelfare reform legislation that the Senate will be adopting this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I call H.R. 4 landmark legislation first and foremost \nbecause it ends the 60-year status of welfare as a cash entitlement \nprogram. Once this bill becomes law, no person will be able to choose \nwelfare as a way of life. Likewise, no person will be entitled to cash \nbenefits from the Federal Government simply because he or she chooses \nnot to work.\n  By dramatically cutting the Federal welfare bureaucracy and providing \nwelfare block grants for the States, H.R. 4 recognizes that the best \nhope for making welfare programs successful lies in shifting major \nresponsibility for their administration to a level of government where \ninnovation and experimentation can flourish. That is a significant step \ntoward reinvigorating federalism in our system of government.\n  H.R. 4 transforms welfare from a handout that fosters dependency into \na temporary helping hand for those who fall on hard times. The bill \nplaces a 5-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare benefits. \nIndividuals will be permitted to move on and off of the welfare rolls, \nbut will, after a cumulative total of 5 years, become ineligible for \nadditional benefits.\n  In return for Government's temporary helping hand, H.R. 4 requires \nthat welfare recipients work for their benefits as soon as their States \ndetermine that they are ``work ready.'' If a recipient refuses to \nreport for work, then a pro rata--or greater--reduction in benefits is \nimposed. In fact, the States may terminate benefits for such recipients \nif they so choose.\n  Although I supported amendments to the bill that would have taken \nstronger steps to reduce the Nation's escalating out-of-wedlock birth \nrate, H.R. 4 does address that crisis in several very important ways. \nMost important, the legislation requires that minor mothers who have \nchildren out-of-wedlock must stay in school and live under adult \nsupervision in order to receive welfare benefits. In doing so, the bill \nremoves the perverse incentive under current law for a young girl to \nbecome pregnant and have a baby in order to receive a welfare check and \nthus become financially independent of her parents.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, H.R. 4 permits the States to refuse to give \nmore cash benefits to mothers who have additional children while on \nwelfare. Finally, H.R. 4 provides $75 million to encourage the States \nto establish abstinence education programs designed to reduce out-of-\nwedlock births and encourage personal responsibility.\n  I am also pleased, Mr. President, that H.R. 4 takes a number of steps \ntoward ending the abuse of the welfare system by those legal immigrants \nwho come to America not to go to work, but to go on welfare. H.R. 4 \ndoes this by giving the States the option to deny welfare benefits to \nnoncitizens.\n  Equally important, Mr. President, H.R. 4 requires that, for most \nmeans-tested welfare programs, both the income and the assets of a \nlegal immigrant's sponsor are deemed to be those of the noncitizen for \na period of 5 years. This ``deeming'' provision is designed to prevent \nnoncitizens from going on welfare. This is good public policy. \nNoncitizens, after all, remain, by definition, citizens of other \ncountries. If they come to the United States and fall on hard times, \nthey can, quite simply, go home. They should not, in all fairness, \nexpect to be supported by Americans who are not their fellow citizens.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I commend those among my colleagues in the \nSenate who have worked long and hard to make this a strong welfare \nreform bill. I am pleased to support it. I look forward to supporting \nan even stronger bill when it comes back from the conference committee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is not the best welfare reform bill \nthat Congress could pass. And, this is not how I would have designed a \nwelfare reform bill. There are, in my view, still some problems with \nit.\n  But, I cannot ignore why we are here today. Democrats and Republicans \nsat down together and came up with a bipartisan compromise.\n  That is what the American people sent us here to do. Not to bicker. \nNot to fight. Yes, to have honest disagreements. But, in the end, to \nsit down and \n\n[[Page S13783]]\nwork out our differences. That is exactly what happened here on welfare \nreform.\n  The result of us working together is a dramatically better bill than \nwhen we started. Not perfect. But, much, much better. And, it is far \nsuperior to the bill passed by the House of Representatives earlier \nthis year.\n  The welfare bill before us today stresses that welfare recipients \nwork for their benefits--and many will be required to do so.\n  It limits the amount of time that individuals can spend on welfare--\nso that welfare is no longer a way of life.\n  It takes a significant step toward ensuring that innocent children \nare protected--by providing safe day care while their mothers are \nworking.\n  And it toughens the child support enforcement laws--so that everyone \nknows that when they bring a child into this world, they have a \nresponsibility for that child.\n  These are the general principles that I have previously outlined as \nthe major components that must be included in any welfare reform bill. \nAnd, the requirement that welfare recipients work for their benefits is \na proposition that I have advocated since 1987.\n  Nevertheless, as I said a moment ago, this bill is not perfect. The \ndetails are not as good as I believe they could--or should--be.\n  I believe we could have had a bill that was both more compassionate \nto the children--by ensuring that they are taken care of even if their \nparents are kicked off of welfare--and also more demanding of the \nparents--through even stricter work provisions.\n  And, I still have concerns about the whole concept of block grants to \nStates.\n  But, as Senator Moynihan stated long ago, we should not let the best \nbe the enemy of the good. This is not the best bill, but it is a better \nbill. And, I dare say that after the bipartisan agreement, it is a \npretty good bill.\n  Mr. President, I cannot turn my back on the significant improvements \nthat have been made in this proposal. And I cannot turn my back on the \ngood faith bipartisan effort at reforming our welfare system.\n  So, I will--despite my continued reservations about some aspects of \nthe legislation--vote for this welfare reform bill.\n  I only hope that this delicate compromise--and not the draconian \nHouse bill--is accepted when the bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for passage of the welfare \nreform bill that has been crafted over the past several weeks.\n  I do so, however, with trepidation over where this reform may lead.\n  The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has spoken eloquently on \nmany occasions about the potential consequences of ending over 60 years \nof Federal commitment to the welfare of children who through no fault \nof their own have either been born into a life of poverty, or who have \nfallen into poverty because of family misfortune.\n  I will vote for this bill because the current system is badly broken, \nand we must find an alternative to the status quo.\n  No one likes the current system, least of all the families trapped in \nan endless cycle of dependency, poverty, and despair. We must change \nthe system and I see this bill as the most moderate measure likely to \nmove forward in the current climate.\n  The basic premise of this bill rests upon the notion that the current \nsystem has failed and that we ought to allow the States the opportunity \nto try to do a better job, with as much flexibility as possible. This \napproach places a great deal of faith in the good will of State \ngovernments to implement programs designed to help, not punish, needy \ncitizens.\n  As a former State legislator, I have a good deal of respect for State \ngovernments. I am not convinced that the Federal Government always \nknows best how to handle every problem. Certainly, there are areas--\nlike civil rights--which are national in dimension, which require a \nconsistent, bedrock level of Federal involvement to insure that rights \nderived from our national constitution are fully protected. But I am \nnot convinced that social policy, welfare policy in particular, must \nalways be controlled from Washington.\n  I recognize that part of my willingness to try this approach of \ngreater State control is based upon the fact that I come from a State, \nWisconsin, which has long been a laboratory for progressive social \npolicy and demonstration programs. I have said on the Senate floor that \nmuch of what Wisconsin has tried to do through direct investment in job \ntraining programs for welfare recipients makes sense and is designed to \nhelp people join the workforce. Some of the policies, like Learnfare \nand Bridefare, I have voted against because there is little evidence to \nshow that they will have any real impact on helping people move off \nwelfare and into the work force. I have voted against mandatory family \ncaps for the same reason.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that this is not the kind of bill \nI would draft if I were the author.\n  I think it falls far short of what is needed in the areas of child \ncare, job training, and services that will help families become self-\nsufficient.\n  Mr. President, the changes made in the bill through the bipartisan \nleadership amendment make this a more desirable bill than the one we \nbegan debating several weeks ago.\n  This amendment will provide an additional $3 billion for child care \nservices. It includes a maintenance of effort that will require States \nto spend at least 80 percent of their 1994 level of State funding in \norder to receive the block grant. Without such a maintenance of effort \nrequirement, Federal dollars would simply replace state contributions, \nand States like Wisconsin which make a substantial contribution to \ninvesting in welfare programs would have simply seen their dollars \nshifted to States which lack such investments.\n  The amendment contains a contingency grant fund to help States which \nrun out of money under the block grant because of higher unemployment \nrates. It provides that up to 20 percent of recipients can be exempted \nfrom the 5-year time limitation for welfare assistance--a provision \nthat will allow some flexibility in a provision which might otherwise \ncause untold hardships. The inclusion of each of these provisions has \nbeen critical to my decision to support this bill.\n  At the same time, the bill still falls far short of what I think \nneeds to be done to achieve real, meaningful change. I believe that the \nStates will be back here within a few short years asking for more \nFederal dollars to get the job done.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the provisions of the bill that \nremove the guaranteed Federal safety net for young children, replacing \nthat 60-year Federal commitment with a system of State block grants \nwhich will create a patchwork quilt across this Nation to replace the \ncurrent Federal commitment.\n  Many States will continue to provide protections for these children \nand will work hard to help families move from welfare into the work \nforce. The Senate wisely rejected several efforts to impose the \npunitive-type provisions contained in the version of welfare reform \npassed by the other body.\n  But there will be some States which will exercise the punitive \noptions available under this bill and will opt to impose harsh \nrequirements upon needy families.\n  These provisions and the lack of national protections for children, \nwherever they may live, are deeply troubling to me.\n  But we cannot continue the current system. I am hopeful that many of \nthe States will enact innovative programs, like the New Hope program in \nMilwaukee, WI, that will provide real opportunities for welfare \nrecipients to become economically self-sufficient members of the work \nforce.\n  This bill will give the States the opportunity to demonstrate whether \nthey are willing to make the kinds of investments that will promote \nthis self-sufficiency, rather than serve simply to punish those who \nfall through the system.\n  As I said at the outset, I am voting for this bill because I am not \nconvinced that welfare policy can only be made in Washington, DC. I \nthink the problems of welfare policy are so complex and difficult that \nit is a mistake to believe that there is only one approach. This bill \nwill encourage State experimentation which may well lead to better \npolicy development over the long period. \n\n[[Page S13784]]\n\n  I believe that the vote being cast today is either for or against the \nstatus quo, and I do not support the status quo.\n  Although I will vote for the Senate bill, I want to make it very \nclear that I will not support a conference report that contains the \nkinds of punitive, harsh measures contained in the welfare reform bill \nproposed by the other body. I hope that the bill that emerges from \nconference will reflect the moderate efforts that went into the Senate \nbill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in my home State of New Mexico and \nacross the country, agreement is virtually unanimous: it is time to \nreform our Nation's welfare system.\n  The current system is not working as well or as efficiently as it \ncould. The many State waivers already approved by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services are compelling evidence that the current \nsystem is incapable of meeting the wide variety of differing needs \nacross our country.\n  We need a system that is less costly; more efficient; and truly \ncapable of moving people permanently from welfare to work. Most \nimportant, we need a system that gives States the flexibility they need \nto fund and operate programs specifically tailored to meet the needs of \ntheir citizens.\n  But as we move toward reform, we must do so carefully and \nthoughtfully. We need to fully understand the ramifications of our \nactions, and we need clear, measurable goals.\n  As we prepare to vote on final passage of welfare reform legislation, \nI would like to take a few moments to talk about effective goals and \nobjectives for reform and to discuss how the majority leader's Work \nOpportunity Act and the Democratic Leader's Work First Act meet these \ngoals. I would also like to discuss three critical differences in the \ntwo bills and the effect of these differences on my home State of New \nMexico.\n  Recently, I read a book on homelessness in America, ``The Visible \nPoor'' by Joseph Blau. One of the statistics in the book that made a \nsignificant impression on me was that something like one-third of all \nthe homeless people in this country are working Americans.\n  These Americans are doing everything we ask, and they still do not \nhave the resources to afford basic housing.\n  Joseph Blau attributes this phenomena to several factors. One is the \nsorry state of our economy, and the fact that the minimum wage is not \nreally a living wage in this country.\n  Many Americans are facing a declining standard of living. This has \nthe obvious effect of forcing people to allocate a larger percentage of \ntheir income to the basic necessities; and when all of their income is \nnot enough, to relinquish adequate housing in favor of food.\n  The declining standard of living in America also has the effect of \nexerting downward pressure on our social safety net.\n  I think all of us agree with the principle that work has to be \nrewarded. Working should pay more than not working.\n  For most of American history, when our living standards were on the \nrise, this philosophy did not conflict with ensuring that everyone in \nthis Nation had the basic necessities of life. It was quite possible to \nhelp some people in need to obtain food, housing, and clothing without \nviolating the premise that those who were working should have a better \nlife. We did not create the perfect social safety net, but we did the \nbest we could to ensure that the poorest among us--especially children, \nwho are the most vulnerable members of any society--had the basics of \nlife.\n  Today, however, when our economic living standard is in decline, some \nthink the way to ensure that working pays more than not working is to \ntake away from those who are not in the system.\n  In other words, the argument is that if our Nation is confronted with \na situation where a person can work and still not be able to afford a \nplace to sleep, then to correct this problem, we need to remove any \nbenefits that would have enabled those outside the employment system to \nhave a place to sleep.\n  Rather than making sure that those who work have a standard of living \nwe can be proud of, we find ourselves taking away from the most \nvulnerable in society to make sure that those who work at least can \nfind someone worse off in this Nation.\n  I believe a saner approach is to make sure that everyone who works \nfor a living in this Nation gets a decent living. This approach ensures \nthat everyone who can work has the right incentives to do so, and that \nwe do not have to literally take food and shelter from children to \nensure that those who work are receiving more than those who do not.\n  I hope that in the future, the Senate will engage on a debate on how \nto raise the rewards of working, through increasing the minimum wage, \nkeeping the earned income tax credit, improving job training, and \ncreating a national strategy on competitiveness. That would be an \nexcellent policy debate.\n  In the meantime, however, it appears that we must first fight to \nensure that we do not force more people who are on public assistance to \nthe streets so that to work becomes relatively attractive.\n  I believe the scope of the compromise amendment worked out by the \nDemocratic and Republican leadership is limited to this basic issue. \nThe agreement should not be characterized as a significant step forward \nin the effort to reform and improve our Nation's welfare system.\n  The agreement simply will help prevent us from taking too many steps \nbackward.\n  The compromise we are voting on today will enable States to get more \nunemployed parents into the work force because it will help make \naffordable child care more accessible for some. Not all families in \nneed will be covered under the compromise, but a number parents in each \nState will be able to move from welfare to work.\n  If the Senate votes today to reject the compromise amendment, in \nfavor of the majority leader's bill, there is no question but that a \nsubstantial number of families, a growing percentage of the homeless \nalready, will be forced onto the streets.\n  If we vote to accept the compromise amendment, we will lessen the \nblow to some, but not all, of these families. Throughout the welfare \nreform debate, I have been concerned about the effect of a massive \noverhaul of our public assistance programs on these families, and the \nworking Americans who are hanging on to the economic ladder just one \nrung above them.\n  I am not saying that change is not needed. Some change is clearly \nneeded. But in making changes, the Congress and the American people \nneed to be aware of the degree to which these issues and programs are \ninterconnected.\n  We need to understand the ripple effect of changing one, or two, or \nthree Federal programs. If one nutrition program is eliminated or \nconsolidated, are more working Americans going to have to make a choice \nbetween food and housing?\n  Of particular concern to me is the ripple effect in New Mexico: What \ndoes block-granting vital domestic programs mean to New Mexico's \nchildren?\n  What does it mean to New Mexico's poor working families who can just \nbarely make ends meet today?\n  How are we going to guarantee that the basic needs of New Mexico's \npoor working families are met?\n  How are we going to guarantee that poor, rural States like New Mexico \nare not left with disproportionate and unmanageable financial and \nadministrative burdens?\n  In seeking answers to these and other questions, I have reached the \nconclusion that the chief goals of welfare reform should be to create a \nsystem that encourages--and demands--personal responsibility and that \nhelps people become self-sufficient, productive members of our society \nand workforce.\n  To reach these goal, I believe we need a system focussed on education \nand on building the skills they will need to compete in the global \nmarketplace of the 21st century. Four key components of an education-\noriented system are: First, a strong public education system that \nincludes training for adults, and, in particular, parents; second, \naffordable, accessible child care; third, affordable, accessible \nprimary and preventive health care, including nutrition programs such \nas child care food assistance, and school lunch and breakfast programs; \nand fourth, real opportunities to earn a wage that allows working \nfamilies to maintain a decent standard of living. \n\n[[Page S13785]]\n\n  I do not believe the Republican leadership's Work Opportunity Act \nwill help us reach these goals. In fact, I believe the block grants \ncontained in the Republican bill take us in the wrong direction and \nlead us away from our goals.\n  Reducing essential funding and lumping many important social service \nprograms into a few omnibus block grants, without any assurance of \naccountability or continuity among the states simply is not be the best \nway to reach our goals.\n  Instead, we in the Congress need to work together with three \nobjectives in mind: First, to enact well-considered, effective, and \nfair legislation where needed; second, to consolidate, coordinate, or \neliminate duplicative or outdated programs; and third, to support and \nimprove those Federal programs with proven track records of success, \nsuch as child care programs, the school lunch program, and the child \ncare nutrition program.\n  In my view, these three objectives are at the core of the Democratic \nleader's Work First welfare reform plan, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor.\n  The Work First plan recognizes the need for a Federal partnership \nrole in helping States and individuals gain the tools and skills--\neducation, effective job training, and child care--they need to become \nproductive, contributing members of society. The Republican bill does \nnot.\n  The Democratic and Republican plans differ significantly in three key \nareas: First, commitment to work; second, commitment to child care; and \nthird, commitment to States and American families in general.\n  The top priority of the Democratic leader's plan is to move people \nfrom welfare to work. In fact, under the plan, welfare recipients must \neither go to work or enroll in school or job training within 6 months \nor sooner. To help meet these stringent work requirements, the \nDemocratic bill helps States fund the education and training programs \nthey will need. States will submit detailed plans for program \nimplementation, so progress toward goals can be measured, but the \nstates will have a great deal of flexibility in designing programs.\n  The majority leader's Work Opportunity Act also sets up work \nrequirements, but it does not fund them. Instead, the bill shifts AFDC, \nEmergency Assistance, and transitional and at-risk child care into a \nsingle block grant to the States; then it freezes the annual funding \nfor the total block grant at the fiscal year 1994 level--$16.7 \nbillion--for the next few years.\n  If the Senate leadership's compromise is adopted, and additional $3 \nbillion in funding for work-related child care, above the fiscal year \n1994 level, will be available over the next 5 years.\n  Because the work requirements under the Republican plan are \nmandatory, many believe the bill essentially amounts to an unfunded \nmandate of more than $23 billion over 7 years.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the unfunded work mandate totals $161 \nmillion over 7 years.\n  As I understand it, the compromise agreement addresses a portion of \nthe burden of this State mandate by allowing States, at their option, \nto require that single parents with children age 5 and under work 20 \nhours per week, as opposed to 35 hours under Senator Dole's bill.\n  A key difference in the two bills, which is addressed in the \ncompromise, involves child care. Both the Democratic bill and the \ncompromise recognize that the No. 1 barrier to work for most parents is \nlack of child care.\n  The Democratic bill would ensure that child care is available for all \nwelfare recipients who are working. The Senate leadership's compromise \nwould help ensure that child care is available for many welfare \nrecipients who are working.\n  In my view, this is a key difference between the Republican and \nDemocratic bills--under the Dole plan, child care is not required or \nensured. Existing Federal programs are simply lumped into an omnibus \nblock grant to the States.\n  Under the Democratic bill, access to child care is real. No parent \nwill be able to use inability to find child care as an excuse for not \nfinding work. Under the compromise, child care is not guaranteed, but \nit is more likely to be available. In addition to the overall increase \nin funding, $3 billion over 5 years, the compromise stipulates that \nfunding will be distributed at the Medicaid match rate to those States \nthat agree to maintain funding for at-risk child care programs.\n  Despite the improvements that the leadership compromise would make to \nthe majority leader's legislation, the Democratic and Republican \nproposals remain dramatically different in their fundamental commitment \nto the States and American families. The foundation of the democratic \nplan is an individual entitlement to American children and families. \nThe foundation of the Republican plan--and the Senate leadership's \ncompromise--is a block grant to the State.\n  Why is this distinction important, particularly in light of the \nincreased funding under the compromise?\n  It is important, especially to poor families and poor States, because \nan individual entitlement is an unbreakable promise made by the Federal \nGovernment to its States and its citizens that in times of need, \nassistance will be there.\n  Now, I want to make clear: this is not unconditional assistance. This \nis not a give away. Always, assistance will be contingent on certain \nrequirements, such as job training, completing school, or seeking \nemployment.\n  Consistent with the Democratic bill's focus on work, the entitlement \nhas a 5-year time limit, with exceptions for children. In addition, it \nis dependent on the signing of a parent empowerment contract, stating a \nparticipant's commitment to finding a job. No aid is provided unless a \ncontract is signed, and penalties will be applied to those who violate \nthe terms of their contract.\n  On the other hand, the majority leader's plan and the leadership \ncompromise are based on block grants. These are fixed amounts of money \ngiven to the States with little or no requirement for accountability, \neither to taxpayers or the State's citizens, and with no assurance of \ncontinuity among State programs unless amendments offered and accepted \nduring the floor debate are retained in conference.\n  The real problem is that the block grant may or may not be sufficient \nin times of need. When a State runs out of money, it runs out of money. \nHelp simply will not be available to eligible, needy children and their \nfamilies unless State and local taxpayers pick up the tab.\n  To help alleviate this situation, the compromise includes a $1 \nbillion contingency grant fund, which States could use--so long as they \nmeet certain matching requirements--in fiscal emergencies.\n  According to the information and statistics I have, my home State of \nNew Mexico could be one of the first to apply for such a grant.\n  Under the Republican leadership's plan, an additional 14,400 jobs for \nwelfare recipients would be needed in New Mexico by 2000, or the State \nwould be assessed a 5 percent penalty in reduced Federal funding. Now, \n14,400 new jobs may not sound like a high figure when compared to \nStates like Texas or California, which must add more than 116,000 and \n358,000 jobs to their economies respectively. But in a poor, rural \nState like New Mexico, 14,400 new jobs is a significant number--it \nrepresents a required increase in the State's current welfare-related \nwork participation rate of 123 percent. And it represents an increased \ncost to the State of $13 million in fiscal year 2000 alone.\n  Directly tied to the increased work requirements are increases in the \nnumber of families needing child care.\n  In fiscal year 1994, about 2,970 children in New Mexico received \nAFDC/JOBS-related child care. Based on the Republican plan's work \nrequirements, the number of children needing AFDC/JOBS-related care \nwould grow to at least 4,720 by 2000. This represents an increase of \n159 percent, and an increased cost of at least $23 million in fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  Yet, the Republican plan does not provide any additional funding to \ncover the child care needs of these families. As a portion of the new \ntemporary assistance block grant, the plan freezes funding for AFDC/\nJOBS child care at the fiscal year 1994 level.\n  The Senate leadership's compromise is only slightly better. It would \nmake an additional $3 billion available over the next 5 years. When the \nadditional \n\n[[Page S13786]]\nfunding is divided between the 50 States and spread over 5 years, the \nsignificance of the compromise tends to diminish. Fortunately from New \nMexico's perspective, this additional funding would be drawn down by \nthe States at the Medicaid match rate.\n  Mr. President, let me just review the costs to New Mexico of the \nincreased work requirements and related child care expenses. Estimates \nare that by 2000, New Mexico would have to spend: $13 million more for \nwork-related operating costs, $23 million more in child care costs. In \ntotal, from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 2000, $115 million \nincrease.\n  These two costs represents 40 percent of New Mexico's total block \ngrant, leaving only 60 percent to cover cash assistance and other \nprograms. If this is insufficient, as it would be if benefit levels \nremained where they are today, the State will have no option but to \ngreatly reduce benefits, deny eligibility to many families, or spend \nmuch more than it does today in State funds.\n  Based on current law projections, by 2005, 72,000 New Mexican \nchildren would be eligible for AFDC benefits. Under the Republican \nplan, which would strip parents--and their children--of all AFDC \nbenefits after 60 months, 19,000 children--or 26 percent of all \nrecipients--in New Mexico would be denied benefits.\n  Further, the State could decide to maximize its Federal funds by \nimplementing various penalties available as options under the \nRepublican plan. Each penalty denies more children benefits:\n  Children denied family cap: 12,000 if the family cap is added back in \nconference.\n  Children denied birth to unwed teen: 320.\n  Children denied family benefits for 24 months: 36,673.\n  Today, we are debating the wisdom of block granting essential safety \nnet programs. The block grants would be authorized for the fiscal years \n1996 to 2000. Because we cannot project with certainty the economic and \nemployment situations of each State in future years, or whether \nmigration among States will be more or less significant than it is \ntoday, or a variety of other factors, we cannot precisely project the \nactual degree of harm one State may endure under a fixed formula for \nblock grants.\n  Mr. President, earlier in my remarks I said it was critical that we \nin the Senate work together, in a bipartisan matter, to enact real, \ngoal-oriented welfare reform. I believe the compromise amendment worked \nout by the Senate leadership represents a step--albeit a small step--in \nthat direction.\n  I will support the compromise, and despite some serious misgivings, I \nwill vote to pass the underlying bill. However, I remain deeply \nconcerned that in the rush to cut spending and send a message to the \nAmerican people, the very people who need our compassion and assistance \nthe most--vulnerable children and their families--could be the most \ngravely hurt.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues who will take this bill to \nconference with the House to approach their deliberations carefully and \nthoughtfully.\n  Without question, we need to better coordinate our public assistance \nprograms; we need to streamline many of them; but we cannot do so in a \nway that threatens the health and well-being of New Mexico's--or any \nState's--children and their families.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to support this welfare reform \nbill and advance it to a conference with the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I do so even though I have some real problems with \nsome provisions. Despite my concerns, I think it is important to move \nthis legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, there is broad consensus in this country that the \ncurrent welfare system serves no one well--not the recipients, not \ntheir children, not the American taxpayer. It fails both the people who \nneed help and the working people who are paying for it. It has trapped \nall too many people, especially women, into a lifetime of dependency \ninstead of helping them on a temporary basis to get on their feet and \ninto the labor force. Sadly, the children of long-term welfare \nrecipients all too often suffer irreparable harm and are likely to \nremain poor and disadvantaged for the rest of their lives.\n  Mr. President, the American people want us to overhaul a system which \nthey perceive to be one that encourages dependency rather than one \nwhich encourages work. They see the current system as inefficient, \nunproductive, and a waste of their hard-earned tax dollars. They want a \nsystem that demands responsibility and accountability--a system where \nable-bodied individuals are required to work for their benefits. That \nis why we are here today.\n  But the American people are also compassionate. They do not want \ninnocent children punished for the behavior of their parents. They \nexpect us to protect poor and vulnerable children. And that is the most \nserious flaw in the legislation before us--innocent children are not \nguaranteed protection. The bill before us today does not guarantee that \nthe children of parents who violate the rules or are removed from the \nrolls because of they have exceeded the time limits for benefits are \nprotected.\n  I think we have a moral responsibility for these children. They ought \nnot to be punished for the mistakes of their parents. There ought to be \na safety net in this bill to ensure their protection. There is not. If \nthis egregious hole in the social safety net is not remedied by the \nconference committee, I will have great difficulty supporting the final \npackage. I am not willing to gamble with the life of one child in \nwelfare reform.\n  Despite my very serious concerns about the impact this legislation \nwill have on innocent children, the bill we are considering today is a \nvast improvement over the bill that emerged from the Finance Committee \nthis spring. With bipartisan support, a number of the most serious \nflaws in the original legislation were corrected.\n  Nevertheless, I remain concerned about the block grant, no-strings-\nattached approach to welfare reform. I am especially concerned that the \nblock grant funding levels are frozen for a 5-year period. In my view, \nthat is a dangerous experiment. And it is an experiment that could \nimpact the lives of 10 million children.\n  If a cash assistance welfare block grant had been enacted in fiscal \nyear 1990, an historical analysis by the Department of Health and Human \nServices concludes that States would have received 29 percent less \nfunding in fiscal year 1994 than they would have received under current \nlaw? If States do not have enough money to meet needs, what do we \nexpect them to do? Surely, they will not raise taxes. What they will be \ninclined to do is establish more stringent eligibility criteria and \nreduce benefit levels to make ends meet. And who could suffer? Poor and \nvulnerable kids.\n  So let me repeat. I have serious reservations about the block grant \nconcept. But a majority of Members of Congress seem to like the idea, \nand most governors relish it. We will not know the results of this \nblock grant experiment for a number of years. Only then will be know \nfor certain if it has been a wise or foolish undertaking.\n  Every expert agrees that lack of adequate child care is the No. 1 \nbarrier in moving individuals from welfare to work. It is the linchpin \nfor successful welfare reform. Yet, as originally proposed, not 1 \ndollar of the block grant was earmarked for child care. Under the \ncompromise offered by Senators Dole and Daschle, $5 billion of the \nblock grant was earmarked for child care and an additional $3 billion \nwas added to that pot. While the $8 billion funding level is still well \nshort of the estimated need, it is a step in the right direction. \nWithout this commitment to child care, the welfare reform effort was \ndoomed to failure. If the final package does not contain this \ncommitment to child care, I simply cannot support it.\n  Other modifications to the original Republican proposal were \nimportant to garnering my vote in support of this measure. First, \nmothers with children under age one will not be forced to go to work to \nreceive benefits. Second, single mothers with children under age 5 will \nbe exempt from the 5 year time limit if no child care is available. In \nother words, the 5-year clock will not begin ticking for these mothers \nif States do not make child care available to them. This makes eminent \ngood sense. The last thing we should want to do is create a situation \nwhere young children will be left home alone. That is irresponsible. \nAnd that was exactly \n\n[[Page S13787]]\nthe scenario we were creating under the original proposal.\n  Finally, States will be given the option of not requiring single \nmothers with children under age 5 from working more than 20 hours a \nweek. Giving mothers the ability to stay at home and nurture their \nchildren during the most formative years is the right thing to do.\n  These three improvements were crucial components in my decision to \nsupport this bill, and they must be retained in conference or I intend \nto oppose the final measure.\n  Shortly before final passage, the Senate finally agreed to include a \nmaintenance of effort provision. As originally crafted, this bill did \nnot require states to contribute one red cent of their own money for \nwelfare reform. Under current law, states contributions constitute \nabout 45 percent of total welfare expenditures. Think about that. \nWithout a maintenance of effort provision, the pot of welfare money \ncould have been reduced by almost half overnight. That was \nunconscionable in my view. Welfare has always been a State-Federal \npartnership. That partnership should be retained. The compromise \nagreement requires States to contribute at least 80 percent of the \nmoney they spent on welfare in 1994 in order to be eligible for their \nblock grant money. While I would have preferred a 100 percent \nrequirement, I can live with this percentage. This State maintenance of \neffort requirement must be retained by the conference committee. It is \nthe right and fair thing to do.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, the compromise included a provision to address \nthe crisis of teen pregnancy. Seventy percent of teen mothers are not \nmarried, and that percentage has escalated each year for the past two \ndecades. If we do not get a handle on this problem, all our good \nefforts for welfare reform could prove to be in vain.\n  Too many unmarried teens are becoming parents, and too few are able \nto responsibly care for their children either emotionally or \nfinancially. The result: the child is deprived of a fair start in life, \nand the mother will very likely be doomed to a lifetime of poverty. No \nwelfare reform effort can succeed without addressing this problem.\n  The compromise that was agreed to last week included a provision on \nteen pregnancy that was part of the Democratic plan. It is a good \nprovision. It will establish second chance homes where unmarried teen \nparents can live in adult-supervised homes where they will receive the \nsupport and guidance they need to finish school and become successful \nparents and productive citizens. This provision ought to be \nenthusiastically embraced by the conference committee.\n  Mr. President, the original Republican plan for welfare reform has \nbeen significantly improved with the adoption of some very important \nbipartisan amendments. I commend the leadership of both parties for \nworking together to make these changes. And I hope the bill will be \nfurther improved by the conference committee. If the final bill does \nnot guarantee that innocent children are protected, however, I will \nhave great difficulty in supporting it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Today, we will vote on final passage of S. 1120, the so-\ncalled Work Opportunity Act of 1995, better known as welfare reform.\n  During the robust Senate debate on welfare reform, I have been a \ncritic and a skeptic about the fundamental fairness and the workability \nof the legislation advanced by our majority leader, Senator Dole.\n  I have also watched this bill improve with time, and I remain hopeful \nthat progress will continue through the conference process.\n  I remain hopeful because I have an abiding, underlying interest in \nachieving genuine welfare reform because I know the current system does \nnot work.\n  The incentives in the current system are in all of the wrong places \nand trap individuals into welfare dependency. For so many Floridians on \nwelfare, it pays to stay there instead of to work.\n  Why? Because without day care you can not train to get a job that \npays a living wage. Without transitional, subsidized day care it is \ndifficult to make ends meet when you first go back to work. And, \nfinally, without some form of health insurance, a sick child in the \nhouse, is reason enough to stay at home and to stay on welfare.\n  That is the failed system that we have today in America. That is what \nwe seek to discard today.\n  But we must make sure that the new system we are contemplating today \nis not a patchwork of slogans and wishful thinking, but instead a \nmeaningful attempt to provide temporary assistance to families in need \nuntil they can return to the work force quickly.\n  Mr. President, you cannot just wish away the children on welfare \nwhile you deal with the adults who receive the welfare checks.\n  We must remind ourselves that children comprise almost 70 percent of \nthe number of welfare beneficiaries. It is for the children that the \nold system was built, and in so many cases that system has failed them.\n  As we construct a new system, we must look at the real needs of the \nchildren: quality and available child care is a critical need.\n  I spoke earlier of the recent efforts which have been made to improve \nS. 1120. I would be remiss if I did not commend the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle, and also Senator Dodd who helped lead the charge, \nfor the improvements in the child care provisions from the original \nbill.\n  The additional $3 billion in funds for child care represents \nmeaningful progress in the movement toward true welfare reform.\n  We know very well from our experiences in Florida that you can not \nget a mother back to work if her children have no place to go during \nthe work day.\n  The old system forced a woman to choose between her children and \nwork, and an enhanced Federal investment in subsidized child care can \nallow her to address both concerns. That is what the $3 billion Federal \ninvestment is intended to buy.\n  But before we celebrate these advances in the funding levels for \nchild care, we need to look at the cold realities facing the families \nwho comprise the so-called working poor.\n  Today in Florida, there is a waiting list of 25,000 children who are \nseeking subsidized day care. This number is not even representative of \nthe actual unmet need when those who do not bother to add their names \nto this gargantuan list are considered.\n  Because Florida has taken steps the last several years to invest more \ndollars into its child care system, the amount of Federal dollars that \nwill go to Florida due to the additional $3 billion in this bill, will \nbarely maintain Florida where it is today.\n  This new money will actually only assist Florida to the point that it \ndoes not have to cut back on its subsidized day care program. Today \nFlorida is investing in child care well beyond the 1994 spending base \nupon which S. 1120 is predicated.\n  Further, I think every Member of the Senate should pause and \ncontemplate the effect the new work requirements will have on the \navailability of subsidized child care for the working poor.\n  In Florida, of the total child care pie, about half of it goes to the \nchildren of the working poor, primarily through the child care \ndevelopment block grant and the social services block grant programs.\n  S. 1120 imposes a requirement that 25 percent of all welfare \nrecipients must be working in the first year, and 50 percent by the \nyear 2000. Therefore, the States will be under extreme pressure to move \nall eligible welfare families to the front of the line for day care, at \nthe expense of the working poor families presently enrolled.\n  The numbers speak for themselves, and currently Florida is barely \nhalf way toward that goal of 25 percent employment.\n  As the conferees wrestle with the issues of maintenance of effort, \nwork requirements and State flexibility, they need to focus on this \nimportant child care trade-off.\n  This is not the time for shell games, moving some people off welfare \nand into work, while forcing others on welfare because we have \nwithdrawn child care help from them. For a working poor family trying \nto make ends meet, the approximately $300 a month per child in day care \nin Florida can be a budget buster.\n  Mr. President, I want welfare reform. The people of Florida want \nwelfare reform. The people of America want welfare reform. \n\n[[Page S13788]]\n\n  For that reason, I am voting for this bill, with reservations. I am \nvoting for this bill to keep this legislative process alive, with the \nhope that the bill will be improved when we vote on the conference \nreport.\n  I would rather support this bill and keep this process moving, than \nvote no and kill any chance of welfare reform this year.\n  With that premise stated, I want to outline two key reservations \nabout this bill:\n  First, The fundamental inequity of distributing resources under the \nproposed block grants to States.\n  Under this legislation, we would divide Federal resources based on \nspending patterns in 1994. This arbitrary method would lock in current \ninequities, would disadvantage growth States, would be difficult to \nchange once its in place, and would set a troubling precedent for our \nupcoming decisions on Medicaid.\n  In the past, the Federal welfare allocation to States has varied from \nState to State due to the local match incentive. If a State put more \nfunds into the welfare system, it got more funds from Washington.\n  By using 1994 as the baseline for future allocations, we would \nperpetuate wide disparities among States. On a per-child basis, some \nStates would receive five or six times the amount received by less-\naffluent States.\n  These stark disparities raise fundamental questions of fairness which \nI am hopeful the conference committee will address.\n  Second, My second reservation about this bill deals with its unfair \ntreatment of legal immigrants.\n  Mr. President, most people of this Nation trace their heritage to \nsomewhere else. My family came here from Scotland.\n  This Nation has benefited from a long tradition of legal immigration. \nLet me repeat: Legal immigration.\n  We set out rules and expectations for legal immigrants to become \ncitizens. Under this bill, we are saying to legal immigrants who have \nfollowed the rules that we are going to change the rules, \nretroactively, on their way to citizenship.\n  Again, this raises fundamental questions of fairness.\n  Denying benefits to legal immigrants would unfairly impact certain \ncommunities in this Nation that have attracted a large number of \nnewcomers.\n  I will leave for another day the discussion over how Florida \ncurrently picks up the Federal tab for illegal immigration, to the tune \nof hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n  Permit me to focus on the dollars that are spent today for legal \nimmigrants. In Florida in November, 1994, there were 34,224 legal \nimmigrants on the welfare rolls, and 149,732 on the food stamp rolls. \nThe estimated annual costs associated with these groups are $39 million \nand $133.5 million, respectively. In addition, Medicaid costs for legal \nimmigrants in Florida in 1994 was greater than either AFDC or food \nstamps.\n  This represents a substantial sum of money which Florida spends and \nwhich Florida might be asked to absorb under certain versions of this \nwelfare reform legislation.\n  This is a significant issue which must be addressed in conference.\n  Furthermore, changing the rules for legal immigrants would be unfair \nto the newest Americans. I am particularly concerned about access to \neducation.\n  One of the great principles of America, that has bound us together as \na diverse people and provided a foundation for the American Dream, is \naccess to education.\n  I implore my colleagues to consider the impact of this legislation on \nstudents. At Miami-Dade Community College, an estimated 8,000 students \ncould lose financial aid.\n  Is that the type of message we want to send to tomorrow's citizens, \nthat the door to education is closed to you in the name of welfare \nreform?\n  I am hopeful that the House-Senate conference can work to remedy this \ninequity in the overall bill. In part, I base my hope on public \ncomments made by Majority Leader Bob Dole, who visited Florida last \nweekend.\n  Senator Dole said he would prefer more flexibility on the issue of \nproviding benefits to legal immigrants.\n  The Gainesville Sun, on Sunday September 17, reported Senator Dole's \nviews as follows:\n\n       Dole later said he supported giving some benefits to legal \n     immigrants and said the amendment would be reviewed when the \n     welfare package goes to conference committee.\n\n  I am pleased that the majority leader has not closed the door on \nchanges to the portion of this bill that deals with treatment of legal \nimmigrants.\n  I look forward to reviewing the product of the conference committee \nwith the hope that my concerns about fairness will be addressed.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for the \nhonest debate which has produced the legislation we will vote on later \ntoday . . . legislation which takes a solid step toward fixing our \nbadly broken welfare system. Both sides have put forth credible \narguments, and more often than not we've been able to work together to \nfind common ground.\n  Yes, we may disagree on many of the details of this compromise \nlegislation . . . but we all agree that the welfare system is in \ndesperate need of an immediate overhaul.\n  These facts are clear and indisputable: today, one American child in \nseven is being raised on welfare . . . one in three children is now \nborn out of wedlock. And despite the $5.4 trillion taxpayer dollars we \nhave funneled into the welfare system over the last 30 years, the \npoverty level has remained nearly the same.\n  Three years ago, during his presidential campaign, President Clinton \npromised the American people that he would ``end welfare as we know \nit.'' Since then, however--even though his party controlled both the \nHouse and Senate--the welfare system remained untouched. Today, less \nthan one year after Republicans gained control of both Chambers, we are \non the verge of passing legislation to dramatically reform a welfare \nsystem which has too often entrapped both welfare recipients . . . and \nthe taxpayers who subsidize them.\n  At the heart of our legislation is the strong message from this \nSenate that the days of welfare without work are over.\n  The American taxpayers are fed up, Mr. President. They go to work \nevery day--both spouses, more often than not--and struggle to make ends \nmeet while trying to carve out a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. They make a combined average income of $47,000 . . . but hand \nover more than a third of that to the Federal Government. And when they \nsee those precious tax dollars going to support welfare recipients who \nsimply refuse to work . . . well, they have every right to be furious.\n  The taxpayers of this country have always been generous . . . but \nnobody likes to be taken for a fool.\n  The ``pay for performance'' provisions of this welfare reform \nlegislation offered by myself and Senator Shelby are intended to put \naccountability into the system. If a welfare recipient wants a federal \ncheck, all we ask is that they start making a contribution to society . \n. . to their own future . . . by working for that money.\n  It is hardly a revolutionary concept. Every taxpayer in the Nation \ndoes the very same thing.\n  I am proud that this bill incorporates a second amendment of mine to \nfurther strengthen its work requirements. This amendment permits \nstates--for the purpose of meeting their work participation rate--to \ncount no more than 25% of their welfare caseload as ``working'' if they \nare enrolled in vocational education.\n  Without my amendment, the work requirements in this bill could be \ncircumvented by substituting vocational education for actual time spent \non the job. It is already happening in many states, where officials are \navoiding the work requirements of the 1988 ``Family Self-Sufficiency \nAct'' by counting voc-ed programs as work.\n  Let me make this clear, Mr. President--work does not mean sitting in \na classroom. Work means work.\n  Any farm kid who rises before dawn for the daily chores can tell you \nthat. Ask any of my brothers and sisters what ``work'' meant on our \nfamily's dairy farm. It didn't mean sitting on a stool in the barn, \nreading a book about how to milk a cow. ``Work'' meant milking cows.\n  Now, I am not opposed to vocational education. Not every voc-ed \nprogram can be considered a success, but we are \n\n[[Page S13789]]\nfortunate to have a number of effective programs operating in Minnesota \n. . . and we need to continue to give these kinds of efforts a chance.\n  But my neighbors back home are tired of sending other people's kids \nthrough school. They are struggling to send their own children to \nschool. They want this government to reflect their values--hard work, \nrespect, personal responsibility, and accountability.\n  It sometimes seems that the work ethic upon which this Nation was \nfounded has gotten a little dusty. For example, experts say that less \nthan one percent of the adults who receive welfare benefits are \ncurrently engaged in real work. That is a sharp departure from the \npast: during the Great Depression, welfare beneficiaries were expected \nto work for the assistance they received through federal programs such \nas the Civilian Conservation Corp and the Work Progress Administration.\n  What has changed?\n  Mr. President, the government has become the first call for help. But \nwhat we too often forget is that the government is funded by other \npeople's money . . . and should be the last call for help.\n  One leading welfare expert sums it up quite clearly: ``In welfare, as \nin most other things, you get what you pay for. By undermining the work \nethic, the welfare system generates its own clientele. The more that is \nspent, the more people in apparent need of aid who appear.''\n  What is most troubling of all is that because there are no incentives \nto move themselves off welfare and into the workforce, too many welfare \nmothers and fathers have given up the search for that better life. And \nthe taxpayers who foot the bill feel powerless, too.\n  Mr. President, if we ever want welfare recipients to become self-\nsufficient, we must begin holding them to the same standards that apply \nto the taxpayers. How can we ever expect welfare beneficiaries to lift \nthemselves up if we continue to ask less of them than we do of every \nother productive, taxpaying American citizen?\n  By allowing states to count 25% of their welfare caseload as \n``working'' if they are engaged in vocational education, my amendment \ncloses a gaping loophole . . . strengthens the work requirement . . . \nand gives states the flexibility to continue successful vocational \neducation programs, while recognizing there is no substitute for work. \nMost importantly, this amendment moves welfare recipients a bit closer \ntoward self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, the Majority Leader's welfare reform legislation is a \nserious first step toward fixing our fractured welfare system. While I \nam pleased that both of my tough work amendments were included in this \nfinal bill, I recognize that we still have a ways to go before we can \nsay we've truly conquered the welfare problem.\n  Many important provisions which were not included in the Senate bill \nwill be addressed by the House-Senate Conference Committee. I look \nforward to the Senate's consideration of the conference report . . . \nwhich I hope truly will end welfare as we know it. That is what we \npromised the American people, and that is what we must deliver.\n  ``Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work \nhard at work worth doing,'' said Theodore Roosevelt.\n  I urge my colleagues to hear those words and give this bipartisan \nlegislation their support. It is good for welfare families . . . it is \ngood for the taxpayers . . . and it is good government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have decided to vote for the Senate's \nwelfare reform bill because I believe a bipartisan consensus has \ngreatly improved it.\n  First child care to job training, to going after deadbeat parents--\nthis Senate bill has moved in the appropriate direction.\n  I strongly oppose the House bill and believe that a strong vote going \ninto the conference committee is essential.\n  I must state, however, that it is unfortunate to see the National \nGovernment backing away from a responsibility toward our Nation's \nchildren--a responsibility embraced by the Democratic alternative which \nwas tougher on work and more compassionate toward children. I will work \nin the future for adoption of that kind of commonsense welfare reform.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the compromise welfare \nreform bill which is before the Senate.\n  The Nation's welfare system does not serve the Nation well. It is \nbroken in a number of places. It has failed the children it is intended \nto protect. It has failed the American taxpayer.\n  The compromise bill before us represents a bipartisan and \nconstructive effort. Meaningful reform should protect children and \nestablish the principle that able-bodied people work. Also, it would \ntighten child support enforcement laws and be more effective in getting \nfathers to support their children.\n  Additional funding has been included to assure that more child care \nresources will be available for children as single parents make the \ntransition into work. This is a significant improvement in the bill and \nstrengthens the work requirement because it better assures that States \ncan effectively move people into job training, private sector \nemployment, and community service jobs.\n  A provision has been added to strengthen the requirement on States to \nassure that they will take more responsibility and maintain their on-\ngoing contribution to the welfare program.\n  The compromise adds a $1 billion contingency fund to provide for \nassistance to the States in economic emergency situations. The \nestablish of such a provision is very important. As responsibility is \nshifted to the States and a block grant provided, it is critically \nimportant that there is some flexibility in the event of a recession or \nother economic crisis. I am particularly concerned about working people \nwho lose their jobs and have exhausted their unemployment insurance \nbenefits. Tens of thousands of such individuals are currently on \nwelfare in my home State of Michigan. Such working people need the \nassurance of the safety net. I am also concerned that adequate \ncontingency funds be available to protect children during periods of \neconomic hardship. The contingency fund is a step toward such \nflexibility. I doubt that $1 billion will prove to be adequate, but \nCongress can revisit that issue in the future.\n  I am particularly pleased that the compromise bill contains my \namendment which strengthens the work requirement in the bill.\n  The original Dole legislation required recipients to work within 2 \nyears of receipt of benefits. My amendment, in its final version, adds \na provision which requires that unless an able-bodied person is in a \nprivate sector job, school, or job training, the State must offer, and \nthe recipient must accept, a community service employment within 3 \nmonths of receipt of benefits. In order to obtain its passage, it was \nnecessary to include a provision which gives the States the flexibility \nto opt out of the requirement. However, I hope and expect that pressure \nfrom the American people, who overwhelmingly support strong work \nrequirements, will convince their States to enforce the provision and \nnot opt out.\n  Mr. President, this welfare reform bill is a positive step in the \neffort to get people, now on welfare, into jobs. It is a significant \nimprovement over the original proposal put before us. It is stronger on \nwork. It better protects children. It cracks down on parents who do not \nmeet their responsibility to support their children. It provides some \nnecessary child care.\n  I am troubled by some shortcomings. I would prefer a bill which did \nnot end the Federal safety net for children, a bill like the Daschle \nWork First legislation which failed in the Senate narrowly and which I \ncosponsored. I am not fully convinced that the block grant approach \nwill prove to be the right approach. Also, as I have already mentioned, \nI am not certain that the contingency fund which we have established \nwill be adequate in a recession.\n  The decision is a close one.\n  So it is particularly important that partisanship not dominate the \nconference between the House and the Senate.\n  If it does, the progress made in the Senate would be undermined and \nwelfare reform would be jeopardized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the Senate has now debated welfare reform \nlegislation for several weeks. The changes that have been incorporated \nin the legislation before us today are profound, \n\n[[Page S13790]]\nmarking a great departure from the system that has been in place for 60 \nyears. As one who has served my State of Rhode Island and this Nation \nas a U.S. Senator for 35 of those 60 years, I do not take lightly the \nvote that I am casting today. I have thought long and hard about the \ndesire for change, for reform, and for a better welfare system, and I \nshare all of those goals.\n  As I look at the bill before us, I remain concerned. It does not \nprovide nearly enough of what I think is necessary for quality welfare \nreform. And it does not sufficiently protect our children or provide \nadults with the tools they need to move off of welfare and into work.\n  But the bill before us is also a drastic improvement over the House \nwelfare legislation, and, with the addition of the Dole-Daschle \ncompromise, moves us more in the direction that I think is best for our \nNation. So while it is with some reluctance. I have decided to cast my \nvote in favor of the bill before us today. I am doing so with the \nunderstanding that the American people want and demand action, and are \nseeking a new way of accomplishing what the existing system has not \nbeen able to accomplish. I am willing to try a new way, but acknowledge \nfreely that without the minimal protections put into place by the Dole-\nDaschle agreement with respect to child care and other important \nprovisions, I would not be voting ``yea'' today.\n  I cannot help hope that the conference committee will see fit to \nincorporate more of the provisions contained in the work-first proposal \nintroduced by Senator Daschle, which I cosponsored. I still support and \nstrongly prefer its provisions--its emphasis on transitioning welfare \nrecipients to work, its understanding that providing childcare is a \nlinchpin of successful reform, and its premise that, despite very real \nabuses of the current system by some welfare recipients, most people \nwant to get off welfare and work at a job that provides a living wage. \nBut I realize that the conference committee is more likely to move this \nbill in a direction that I cannot support, by being more punitive to \nparents and, in the process harming children who have not chosen their \nparents or their circumstances.\n  Mr. President, it would be my intention, should the bill return from \nthe conference committee stripped of these moderating provisions, or \nincluding any of the more draconian provisions we defeated during the \nSenate debate, to cast my vote against the conference report. I hope \nthat this will not be necessary and that we will be able to pass a \nconference report that really does move the Nation in the direction \nthat we all want to see toward workable reform that moves this \ngeneration off of dependency while ensuring that the next generation \ndoes not suffer from its parents' failures or misfortunes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a \ncomprehensive overhaul of our Nation's welfare system.\n  I would like to commend the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator \nDole, and many of my colleagues for bringing a much-needed and timely \nbill to the floor of the Senate for action.\n  I am also looking forward to what I believe can be a genuine spirit \nof bipartisanship as we seek to address some of the aspects of our \nwelfare system that have hurt, rather than helped, Americans forge a \nbetter future for themselves and their families.\n  Although it has been characterized as such, welfare reform should not \nbe a conservative-versus-liberal issue, or a Democrat-versus-Republican \nissue. It should be an issue where we seek to involve and include \nvarious constructive points of view for a cause whose worth stretches \nbeyond partisan political lines.\n  Simply put, what we must strive for in this debate is to end welfare \nas a way of life for millions of Americans and their families, while at \nthe same time preserving a safety net for those in our society who need \na leg-up rather than a hand-out to succeed in their personal quest of \nthe American dream.\n  What we must be compelled to accomplish is to require more individual \nresponsibility, a strengthened work ethic, and a sense of discipline \nand order to the family, all while continuing to maintain our historic \nand compassionate commitment to those who need our help in those dark \ntimes that are a part of everyone's life at some time or another.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can--and must--give them change with a \nhuman face. It is not necessary to be less compassionate or less \nunderstanding, but it is possible to be less spendthrift and less \ngenerous to those who have taken undue advantage of our system.\n  As we begin to meet these challenges and others, I am eager to work \nwith all my colleagues to further improve this legislation and, in the \nprocess, craft a better America and set our Nation on a new and more \nresponsible course into the 21st century.\n  Everything we and our parents have worked for to give us a better \nlife and instill in us a sense of national purpose as well as personal \nresponsibility is at stake in this debate.\n  We, in America, all too frequently judge our Nation and measure our \ncountry's worth as a people by standards of economic statistics, by \ngold, silver and bronze medals won at world tournaments, or by military \nmight as the world's greatest democracy.\n  But to judge America in terms of a society, clearly we are lacking in \nmany respects.\n  In today's society, it is hardly uncommon for an individual to be \nsmoking or drinking by the time they are 10; to be caught stealing by \nthe time they are 11; to be hooked on drugs by the time they are 12; to \nbe sexually active by 13 years of age; to be pregnant by the time of \ntheir 14th birthday; to be on welfare at 15; to be a high school drop-\nout at 16; and to have the American dream be nothing more than a pipe \ndream at 17.\n  Mr. President, to many this may be nothing less or nothing more than \na worst-case scenario. But, unfortunately, in the 1990's it has become \nan acceptable scenario in America. How tragic; and how wrong.\n  Welfare in America has become a way of life, a culture of \ndespondency, a tradition of dismay, and has bequeathed a sad \ninheritance of dependance for millions of our citizens.\n  Our challenge in these proceedings is not to make their lives more \ndifficult by our efforts here, or to perpetuate any negative \nstereotypes, or to treat harshly those people in need of help; our \nsolemn challenge is to give them a new chance, a new beginning, and to \nshow them a different and better way of life.\n  In the 1960's, when many welfare programs were designed and \nimplemented by the Federal Government, we were willing to risk the \ninvolvement of central government in people's lives for the benefit of \nhelping them to help themselves.\n  Instead, welfare in the 1990's is out of touch, out of cash, and out \nof tune with people's lives. In an August 1993 Yankelovich poll, \nrespondents were asked, ``Do you think our current welfare system helps \nmore families than it hurts, or hurts more families than it helps?'' \nTwenty-four percent said that it helps more, while a commanding 62 \npercent said it hurts more.\n  Many might wonder what it is that we have bought with over $5 \ntrillion in welfare funds over the past 30 years. Many might wonder \nwhat the returns have been on an investment we made three generations \nago.\n  It is a disappointing litany of our shortcomings as a society and as \na compassionate democracy.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing is rewarding the failure of the \nindividual spirit to strive for greatness and personal responsibility. \nAs one pollster said, ``Welfare rewards what life punishes.''\n  Moreover, these social and cultural trends play a major role in other \ntrends involving crime and violence, both on the streets and in our \nhomes; they affect education, urban decay, and our economy. Their link \nto each other is unmistakable.\n  As former Education Secretary William Bennett said:\n\n       Over the last three decades we have experienced substantial \n     social regression. Today, the forces of social decomposition \n     are challenging--and in some instances, overtaking--the \n     forces of social composition. And when decomposition takes \n     hold, it exacts an enormous human cost.\n\n  These figures exact the toll and tally that cost.\n  Since 1960, illegitimate births have soared by more than 400 percent; \nwhile only 5.3 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock in 1960, \nillegitimate births rose to 30 percent of all births by 1992.\n\n[[Page S13791]]\n\n  The pregnancy rate among unmarried teenagers has more than doubled \nsince the early 1970's, amounting to over one million--one million--\nteen pregnancies every single year.\n  While America's marriage rate has declined spectacularly for 20 years \nby almost one-third to an all-time low, America's divorce rate has \nincreased by nearly 300 percent in the past 30 years, subjecting more \nof our children to more broken families than ever before.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that 77 percent of unmarried \nadolescent mothers become welfare recipients within 5 years of the \nbirth of their first child. And many of them are staying on welfare for \na long time. In fact, more than half of the 9.5 million children \nreceiving AFDC have parents who never married each other.\n  Single-parent families account for 65 percent of poor families with \nchildren, and they account for over half of all poor families. I should \nmention that studies show that almost 1 out of every 4 children from \none-parent families will be in poverty for 7 years or more, compared \nwith only 2 percent from two-parent families.\n  And, despite an explosion in welfare spending, more children live in \npoverty today--22 percent--than in 1965; 15 percent, which is when the \nfamous--or infamous--War on Poverty began. What does 22 percent mean in \nreal terms? Try over 15 million children living in poverty in America \ntoday.\n  The percentage of all American children dependent on AFDC welfare \nincreased from 3.5 percent in 1960 to over 13 percent in the 1990's.\n  While we are talking about AFDC--it has become a $23 billion Federal-\nState program supporting approximately 14.5 million people--and that is \na 31-percent increase not over 1960 or 1965 or even 1970, but a 31-\npercent increase over 1989; only 6 short years ago.\n  Probably worst of all, among these terrible numbers, are these:\n  First, of the 4.5 million households currently receiving AFDC \nbenefits, well over half will remain dependent on the program for over \na decade--10 years--and many will remain dependent for 15 years or even \nlonger.\n  Second, and even worse, children raised in single-parent families are \nthree times more likely to become welfare recipients themselves as \nadults--a clear continuing legacy of failure and the unmistakable mark \nof what the Heritage Foundation calls intergenerational dependence.\n  That is highlighted by the fact that 60 percent of welfare recipients \ntoday are the children of welfare dependents from the previous \ngeneration.\n  As I mentioned, America has spent $5 trillion in welfare assistance \nsince the start of the War on Poverty.\n  Mr. President, we are losing--badly losing--the war within our \nborders against poverty and social decay.\n  But through the haze and maze of this debate, we can learn from some \nof the success stories of people who were once on welfare and had the \ncourage and stamina to leave the system and seek a better life.\n  For some, welfare meets a critical need; sometimes, a critical \nlifeline in troubled times. Our challenge is to reform this system so \nthat it works for more people, encourages more to leave the system for \ngood and return to wage-earning jobs, and yet retains the vital \nportions of the safety net for the neediest among us.\n  It can happen. It can work. We can make it a reality.\n  I know because I have met the success stories firsthand. Take Melissa \nBrough from Portland, ME. She succeeded in welfare. Sadly, she \nsucceeded despite the system, not because of it. Listen to what she has \nto say:\n\n       I started out just needing some subsidized child care so I \n     could find a job to support us. I ended up trickling down \n     through the system for 4 years. What a way to build self-\n     confidence and self-esteem!\n       It's no wonder people get trapped in the welfare system, \n     when competing resources seem to have money and statistics in \n     mind instead of individuals * * * [L]et's provide the \n     resources and support * * * to help people along the road to \n     self-sufficiency.\n\n  Mr. President, Melissa is right. Self-sufficiency should be our goal, \nand the system we design must provide the resources and support to help \npeople along that road.\n  Sometimes, getting to success and self-sufficiency requires short-\nterm sacrifices and tough choices. But there are stories to show that \nthey are worth it.\n  Tecia Girardin is a proud mother of three sons living in Readfield, \nME. She works 50 hours a week and takes home $350 weekly in pay through \nher job at Progressive Distributors, a warehouse distribution center. \nShe is now getting $345 a month in child support, and 2 years ago put a \ndownpayment on 48 acres of land, where she hopes to build a house in \nthe near future.\n  But it was not always this way for Tecia and her boys. Years ago, she \ncounted on food stamps to put food on her table at night. She used to \nrummage for aluminum cans to pay for the rent.\n  Looking back, Tecia recalls, ``It was a nightmare, but we made it.'' \nShe adds, ``I was determined to make it on my own. I just do not think \na life of dependency is good--whether it is dependency on alcohol, \ndrugs, or government assistance * * * I wanted to be free of welfare.''\n  With her pride and her self-confidence, Tecia broke the shackles of \nwelfare and took several tough jobs before landing a position at \nProgressive Distributors, where she has now been for 5 years. She is \noff food stamps and off Medicaid, and it is been 4 years since her last \nbenefit check. But times are still tough for her and her family.\n  We still need to do more to help people like Tecia break free of the \nsystem.\n  I believe the majority leader's plan makes a good attempt to help \npeople break free of the labyrinth of welfare.\n  This legislation recognizes that the Federal Government does not have \nthe ability to create a one-size-fits-all welfare program. Instead, it \nhas made a necessary and bold change: States are awarded block grants \nto design a local program that meets unique State needs.\n  I support this basic concept, and believe it is essential that \nwelfare reform give States the flexibility to address the unique \nproblems of their citizens. At the Federal level, we simply do not know \nwhat will work. Each State should have the flexibility to address the \nproblem as they understand it.\n  In Maine, the principle reason that families go on welfare is divorce \nor separation. That is the No. 1 reason: 42 percent of all AFDC \nrecipients are forced onto welfare as a result of divorce or \nseparation. In Maine, 61 percent of adult AFDC recipients have obtained \ntheir GED. The people behind these statistics may require quite \ndifferent welfare programs than people in densely populated States.\n  That is why flexibility is a crucial tool--missing from existing \nwelfare programs--that must be extended to the States.\n  I also support the restoration of AFDC as a temporary assistance \nprogram, rather than a program which entangles and traps generation \nafter generation after generation.\n  The legislation before us allows States to provide benefits for 5 \nyears, but after that point benefits are terminated. As soon as a \nrecipient is work ready, he or she will be required to work for their \nbenefits. All recipients will be required to work after receiving \nbenefits for 2 years.\n  Nothing like a time-limited welfare system has ever been tried in \nthis country. But we need to send a message to recipients that there \nare responsibilities associated with receiving a welfare check: \nresponsibility brings dignity. And to promote responsibility, there \nmust be consequences to action or inaction.\n  This bill also makes progress in another critical area of concern, \none that, for many welfare recipients, has forced them into poverty: \nchild support enforcement.\n  Child support enforcement is one of the most important provisions in \nour campaign to revamp the welfare system of this country. It affects \nevery State--children at every income level--and it affects both \nsingle-mothers and single-fathers. As a national problem, child support \nenforcement merits a national solution. And we must demonstrate our \nleadership by providing it.\n  I am proud to have worked in a bipartisan manner with the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, to \ndevelop a sound and comprehensive national child support enforcement \nsolution. The major provisions of our legislation have been \nincorporated into this proposal. \n\n[[Page S13792]]\n\n  To strengthen efforts to locate parents, the bill expands the federal \nparent locator system and provides for State-to-State access of the \nnetwork.\n  To increase paternity establishment, the bill makes it easier for \nfathers to voluntarily acknowledge paternity and encourages outreach.\n  To facilitate the setting of effective child support orders, it calls \nfor the establishment of a National Child Support Guidelines Commission \nto develop a national child support guideline for consideration by \nCongress, and provides for a simplified process for review and \nadjustment of child support orders.\n  And to facilitate child support enforcement and collection, the bill \nexpands the penalties for child support delinquency to include the \ndenial of professional, recreational, and driver's license to deadbeat \nparents, the imposition of liens on real property, and the automatic \nreporting of delinquency to credit unions.\n  This provision has proven very effective in my own State of Maine, \nwhere the State has collected more than $21 million in child support \npayments by sending letters to delinquent parents with a very real \nthreat to revoke professional licenses.\n  This bill also grants families who are owed child support the right \nof first access to an IRS refund credited to a deadbeat parent and \npermits the denial of a passport for individuals who are more than \n$5,000 or 24 months in arrears.\n  Mr. President, as I have pointed out, this legislation seeks to \nimplement on a national level some of the successful child support \nenforcement mechanisms being utilized by some innovative States, like \nmy home State of Maine.\n  Clearly these efforts pay off. But we can--and must--do much more. We \nhave the tools to replicate the successes of States like Maine on a \nnational level and begin to ease and eventually lift the economic and \nemotional burdens caused by delinquent child support payments.\n  Mr. President, as we reform the system to encourage welfare \nrecipients to work, we must also ensure that we provide for appropriate \nand adequate child care for mothers with young children. And in \ninstances where that child care is not available, we cannot penalize \nmothers with young children at a very fragile and unstable time in \ntheir lives as they struggle to make ends meet.\n  When we in this chamber talk about the need to protect the neediest \nin society and to protect some of our less fortunate citizens by \ncasting a so-called safety net, nothing could represent that support \nmore than helping mothers care for their children as they seek to make \nthe move from the world of welfare to the world of work.\n  We must not condone a situation where a woman would be forced to \nchoose between her children's well-being and her job and benefits.\n  We cannot allow, for example, a woman to leave her two young children \nat home alone, unattended, because she is required to work. To do so \nwould be to give them a Catch-22 choice, a choice between the devil and \nthe deep blue sea.\n  And many more women could be faced with that difficult choice than \never before under this bill. By requiring work participation rates to \nreach 50 percent by fiscal year 2000, it is estimated this will add an \nadditional 665,000 children to those currently in need of child care.\n  The truth is, we have a long way to go before we can assure access to \nchild care--let alone affordable child care. In dozens of States across \nAmerica, there are long waiting lists for child care. In Alabama, for \nexample, there are nearly 20,000 children on the waiting list for child \ncare, adding up to an average wait between one and one-and-a-half \nyears.\n  In Texas, a staggering 35,692 children are on the waiting list, with \nwaits as long as two years. In my home State of Maine, there are more \nthan 3,000 children on the child care waiting list.\n  Fortunately, there is light at the end of what for many women in this \ncountry is a very long tunnel.\n  I am extremely pleased to be able to say that the majority leader has \ndecided to incorporate a major provision, I authored along with some of \nmy colleagues, into this proposal to help address the issue of child \ncare for parents on welfare. This is a critical issue for welfare \nreform, and one I have been working to address since the debate on \nwelfare began.\n  With this new provision incorporated into the proposal, States will \nbe prohibited from sanctioning mothers with children aged 5 or under if \nthe State cannot provide adequate and affordable child care for those \nrecipients whom it requires to go to work.\n  This is important considering that the Department of Health and Human \nServices has estimated that almost 62 percent of welfare recipients \nhave children aged 5 or under.\n  I am also pleased to have been involved in a bipartisan effort by \nworking with Senators Orrin Hatch, Christopher Dodd, Bill Cohen, John \nChafee, Jim Jeffords and Nancy Kassebaum to allocate an additional $3 \nbillion over 5 years in child care services funding.\n  Under this agreement reached with the majority leader, the States \nwill be required to match child care funds at the Medicaid match rate.\n  This additional funding, when combined with the $1 billion that \nSenator Hatch's amendment sets aside for child care, will go a long way \nto ensuring that we make our welfare reform proposals viable and \nrealistic options for single parents who need care for their children \nin this country.\n  Adequate child care funding is a major issue that the Governors \nthemselves--in a letter to Majority Leader Dole dated September 13--\ncalled the largest part of the up-front investment needed for \nsuccessful welfare reform. And they are right.\n  This provision on child care funding is a significant point of \nagreement and consensus for all of us in this historic legislation, and \nI am heartened to see its addition to the bill.\n  We have also made progress in another area that I consider critical \nto our reform efforts--and that is the important issue of State \nmaintenance of effort.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, believe this area is a central \ncomponent to the success of the reforms before us because we believe it \nis essential to continue the shared Federal-State partnership in \nwelfare.\n  Since 1935 when title IV of the Social Security Act was signed into \nlaw, welfare has been a shared Federal-State responsibility. As we move \nto reengineer the system, both sides must renew their commitment to the \npartnership--and by this I mean both their moral commitment and their \nfinancial obligations.\n  Indeed, the States, like the Federal Government, face many competing \nforces for funding.\n  With the mandate from the public to reduce spending and balance State \nbudgets, Governors and State legislatures face the same tough choices \nthat we in Congress are in the process of making.\n  Some have written that this ``is not a question of trust.'' But I \nbelieve it is, and some States are working hard to meet that trust, and \nthey are succeeding.\n  Many States, like my State of Maine, have already made a strong \ncommitment to welfare reform and I know that they will continue to do \nso. But my concern is that some States--precisely because of those \ncompeting forces for funding--may not.\n  States have a tremendous stake in the success of our welfare system. \nThey should have a financial commitment as well, both in the cost as \nwell as in the potential savings.\n  That is why we must include provisions requiring States to continue \nthe Federal-State partnership.\n  Let me be clear about one point: We are not asking the States to \nincrease their financial contribution, but we need to make sure that \nthey do contribute. Toward that end, I supported and was cosponsor of \nthe Breaux amendment to make those figures a 90 percent contribution \nover five years.\n  In response, the leadership agreed to include language that would \nrequire States to provide 80 percent of their fiscal year 1994 \ncontribution to welfare for 5 years--the full lifespan of this bill.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that, like all broad-\nreaching Government reforms, this is not a perfect solution to the vast \nchallenges that face our welfare system. There are some aspects that \ncan--perhaps should--be improved. But I believe that this legislation \nmoves us closer to a workable solution. \n\n[[Page S13793]]\n\n  We have already spent countless billions on a welfare system that has \nmade little progress in resolving the problems of the poor. We cannot \nafford to simply do nothing--to maintain the status quo, with all of \nits perverse incentives.\n  Instead, we must act now, and begin the process of ending welfare as \na way of life, and restoring welfare assistance to its original \npurpose, to provide temporary help to our neighbors in need.\n  Americans have long demonstrated their generosity and their \ncommitment to help our neighbors, families, and children in need. Yet \nAmericans deserve to see results for their efforts and their investment \nin assisting the neediest. For 30 years, our welfare system has \ndelivered positive results sporadically at best. Americans are \ndemanding more for their investment, and we in Congress must heed their \ncall and help States achieve welfare's noble goals.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for a very long time, I have argued \nfor welfare reform. My fundamental goal for reform is to see parents \nwork and accept personal responsibility. Welfare should be a temporary \nprogram to help people become independent, not a trap of long-term \ndependency. But at the same time, innocent children should be protected \nand not punished for circumstances beyond their control.\n  I rise to explain how I came to the conclusion to vote for the final \nversion of welfare reform legislation before the Senate this afternoon. \nMy vote is for the basic idea that the current welfare system can't be \ncontinued. It must be changed. This bill is now our opportunity for \nchanging the rules and encouraging major reform. While I strongly \nopposed the original bill offered by the Majority Leader, Bob Dole, I \nam relieved that the persistent, dedicated work of a team that I was \nproud to join has resulted in many changes--including some major \nimprovements that were essential for West Virginia--to the legislation. \nIn my view, there are still flaws and disappointments in this bill. But \nas someone who serves to achieve the most good possible through \nconsensus and cooperation, I am voting for this bill to do just that.\n  West Virginians have told me for a long time why they are anxious for \nwelfare reform. It is unfair to hard-working families when it is too \neasy for others to receive public assistance that does not end. And for \nparents who want to work or can work, the system has to emphasize the \nmeans to that end instead of the criteria for staying on welfare. None \nof this will be easy, but it is time for these changes.\n  This is not a new mission for me. I have worked on ways to reform our \nwelfare system for years. In 1982 as Governor of West Virginia, I was \nproud to start a program called Community Work Experience Program in \nour State that required many parents on welfare to work in their \ncommunity when they could not find private sector jobs, mostly because \nof high unemployment. This idea is more commonly known as workfare, and \nWest Virginia was one of the first two States in the country to start \nthis program and we are still using it today. I believe in workfare and \ncommunity service as important alternatives when a private sector job \nis not available.\n  In the Senate, I continued to work on changing the welfare system, \nand I am proud of the efforts begun in 1988 under the Family Support \nAct that passed with strong bipartisan involvement and support. This \nlegislation was an important first step. While we all know that the \nFamily Support Act was not perfect, it began to change the system to \nmove families from welfare to work. The Family Support Act also gave \nStates the latitude to try various approaches to welfare reform which \nhave now encouraged bolder efforts, today.\n  Based on my goals for West Virginia and my work as Chairman of the \nNational Commission on Children, I participated in the welfare reform \ndebate as a cosponsor and strong proponent of the Democratic Leader's \nbill, ``Work First.'' In my view, it was a mistake for the Senate to \nreject our amendment containing this bill. ``Work First'' would end \nwelfare as we know it by eliminating the existing Aid to Families With \nDependent Children (AFDC). The Democratic alternative would require \nwork and promote parental responsibility, and yet at the same time \nprovide the best safeguards for both children and State budgets during \ntimes of economic downturns. Unfortunately, this strong package was not \ntaken seriously by the Republican side and was defeated.\n  So in good faith, Democrats did not disappear from the process to \nenact welfare reform, nor did we surrender on the goals we think the \nAmerican people share, too. We have spent the last week on the floor to \npush for consensus and compromise on very important issues. It was \ndiscouraging to deal with the original Republicans' bill that made \npromises without the means to keep those promises. The early refusal to \nwork in a bipartisan spirit was unnecessary, and made it very difficult \nto work through decisions that will have consequences for taxpayers and \npoor families in our States. But we persisted in order to make our best \nattempt at achieving welfare reform and protecting principles \nrepresented in the ``Work First'' alternative.\n  As a result, major changes have been made to the Republican bill on \nthe Senate floor, including adding a maintenance of effort requirement \nto ensure that States continue to invest their fair share to help needy \nchildren and their families. This was a victory for the principle of \nresponsible government and a major step in reserving adequate resources \nfor poor children.\n  Child care funding is another fundamental change to the original Dole \nbill that is absolutely crucial if we are serious about moving parents \nfrom welfare to work. We should insist that parents go to work, but we \nalso must be realistic and acknowledge that a lack of safe, affordable \nchild care remains a barrier. Democrats worked very hard to secure \nadditional funding for child care. I still worry that this final \ncompromise might be short on funding, but I am relieved that we secured \nthe additional funds for something that families literally can not go \nwithout. Let us remember that parents are put in jail for leaving \nchildren unattended. Government can not require parents to be at work \nif they do not have a way for their children to be cared for. When we \ntalk about family values, child care belongs in how to turn our \nrhetoric into reality.\n  If we make the huge leap from an entitlement to a block grant \nprogram, one of my early goals has been to secure a contingency fund to \nprovide additional help to States when poverty rises. Under the \nDemocratic ``Work First'' alternative, we maintained the historic \nFederal-State shared responsibility for this population so there was no \nneed for a contingency fund. But under a block grant approach, there is \na need for some type of safeguard in times of high unemployment, \nnatural disasters, or other unforeseen reasons that increase the number \nof very poor families in a State.\n  As a former Governor who led my State of West Virginia through a \nsevere recession with double-digit unemployment rates, I am keenly \naware of this problem. Families who always worked and never wanted \nwelfare were temporarily forced to seek assistance because of harsh \neconomic conditions in my State in the 1980s. Then, Federal assistance \nwas there to help needy families through hard times even though our \nState revenues declined, and it would have been impossible for West \nVirginia to serve needy families without additional Federal help. Even \nwith a contingency grant fund, I worry how a block grant approach will \nwork when a State or several States face problems of high unemployment \nor a natural disaster. But after a hard battle, we managed to get a \nprovision into this final legislation that will make the contingency \nfund a grant program, instead of loans, and which will offer real help \nwhen families and States hit difficult times.\n  As we think about the problems of unemployment, it brings to mind the \nworries of what happens to families who hit the time-limit in the midst \nof a deep recession? I know numerous personal stories, because I know \nfamilies on welfare in West Virginia who would eagerly work, but the \njobs just are not there. I submitted two specific amendments to this \nbill designed to give States the option of waiving the time limits for \ngood reasons--such as high unemployment or if adults simply could not \nwork because they were ill, incapacitated, or caring for a disabled \n\n[[Page S13794]]\nchild. In my view, it would be best to spell out limited reasons for \nexceptions. While my criteria were not adopted, our success in winning \nan increase in the States' hardship waiver from 15 percent to 20 \npercent will achieve the same goal. I appreciate the strong support for \nmy amendments that was voiced by the National Governors' Association, \nState Legislatures, and other officials who know the practicalities \ninvolved in real welfare reform.\n  I also want to note why it is so essential to maintain the Senate \napproach on child welfare, foster care and adoption assistance. In the \nFinance Committee, we specifically stated our intention to retain \ncurrent law so that the Nation's basic commitment to abused and \nneglected child would continue. Child welfare is very different than \ngeneral cash assistance for poor children. Child welfare serves \nchildren at risk of abuse and neglect in their own homes. We should not \nreduce or cap Federal aid to such vulnerable children. That means we \nmust maintain the entitlement nature of foster care and adoption \nassistance. There is support from both sides of the aisle for this in \nthe Senate, and I specifically want to commend Senator Chafee for his \nleadership on the important issue. The Senate approach on child welfare \nand foster care system must be preserved in the conference, and I am \npersonally determined that we not retreat from the country's important \nguidelines and reliable support that abused and neglected children rely \non.\n  Bold changes in child support enforcement are a real victory in this \nlegislative package. Because this was one section developed in a \nbipartisan manner from an early point, it has not attracted much debate \nor public attention. But West Virginians and our fellow Americans \ncertainly know the significance of child support and insisting on \nparental responsibility. There are billions of dollars owed to children \nby absent parents. I cosponsored the bipartisan legislation offered by \nSenator Bradley which provided a good framework for the tough \nprovisions in this legislation that will help collect those dollars. \nGetting tough on child support is a priority.\n  In addition to changing the rules, we also need to change attitudes. \nIt is pathetic that adults are more responsible about paying their car \nloan payments than their child support. This is unacceptable and must \nbe turned around.\n  As Chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on Children, I have \nbeen working on the issue of welfare and families closely for years. I \nwant to find creative, bipartisan ways to strengthen and stabilize \nfamilies. Our Commission issued a unanimous report that called for a \nwhole new approach on children and family policy at all levels--\nFederal, State, and in our communities. The legislation passed today \nreflect some of the direction recommended by the Children's Commission. \nI strongly support the idea that States and local communities must take \na leadership role in helping all families, including those needy \nfamilies on welfare.\n  And again, I repeat my hope that this country will maintain a \nnationwide, steadfast commitment to safeguarding children. Our country \nhas a stake in every child, whether a child is born to a poor family in \nrural West Virginia or a family in an inner city. A child born to an \nunwed mother has the same basic needs and the same potential, as a \nchild who is more fortunate and born into a stable, wealthy family. I \nhonestly don't believe that the legitimate cry we hear for welfare \nreform is a demand to forget or abandon children.\n  As I said at the outset, I believe in welfare reform, and it is \nobvious that the American public demands it.\n  As someone who has fought for children and families for years, I hope \nthat the States receiving so much new responsibility for the fate of \ntheir poor citizens will take it very, very seriously.\n  Children are two out of three people who depend on welfare today, and \nthey should not be punished. Because of this deep concern, I was one of \nthe members who pushed very hard to incorporate an evaluation amendment \ninto this legislation. We should acknowledge that this legislation is a \nhuge experiment. We are eliminating the Federal safety net that has \nassured minimum support for needy children and families for over 60 \nyears, and this legislation will replace it with a new approach. While \nAFDC has serious flaws and must be changed, this approach is new and \nuntested. I feel a strong moral obligation to thoroughly study and \nevaluate how this new approach serves children and families. Optimists \nand staunch supporters of the Work Opportunity Act predict this bill \nwill reduce dependency and move families from welfare to work. Critics \nwarn that children will end up on the streets.\n  I am willing to try, and I am willing to vote for this legislation. \nBut I insist that we monitor it closely to evaluate carefully how \nchildren are affected. Because of our evaluation amendment, we now have \nthis commitment and obligation.\n  I truly hope that this bill fulfills its bold promise to help move \nfamilies from welfare to work and to end the cycle of dependency. When \na conference is established to negotiate the final welfare reform bill \nto send to the President, I hope that the debate and revisions that \nhave taken place here in the Senate will be taken extremely seriously. \nAnd if and when a welfare reform bill is signed into law, and if the \nwarnings of the critics are true and children are abandoned, we must \nswiftly revise the law and try again.\n  My fundamental principle remains that children should be protected. \nFrom my work on the National Commission on Children, I believe in \nbuilding consensus and trying creative approaches. For the sake of our \nchildren, and the future of our country, we need to chart a bipartisan \ncourse that emphasizes cooperation on behalf of children and families. \nChildren should not become pawns in a partisan rhetoric and politics, \nand I hope that the conference on welfare reform will adopt such an \napproach so that common ground and reasonable compromises will be \nachieved.\n  I congratulate the numerous Senators, staff members, and experts who \ndevoted untold hours and energy into preventing the original Dole bill \nfrom succeeding and working out important, vital improvements. West \nVirginia was better served through the process of these revisions, and \nwill be better equipped to prod and help poor families avoid \ndependency. I worked hard to achieve the changes most important to my \nState, and I hope they will remain in the final welfare reform \nlegislation that must be negotiated with the House.\n  Welfare reform must also work in the real world. We have seen in the \nrecent months once again how attractive the words are to politicians \nand others who see advantage in dividing people, scoring cheap points, \nand pretending that the country's problems are easy to solve. That is \nan injustice to all Americans, to taxpayers frustrated with the welfare \nsystem and to the families who find themselves poor for whatever \nreason. We know that America feels best when we succeed in achieving \nambitious goals by pulling together, living up to our Nation's \nprinciples, and making the effort required to get the job done. Welfare \nreform is a very ambitious goal, and the passage of this bill takes us \none step further to accomplishing the real results and true change that \nAmericans expect.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, 30 years ago President Johnson had a dream \nof a ``Great Society'' where the United States Government would \nundertake to lift the poor out of their wretchedness. Today, the \nintended nobility of his dream has been obliterated by the horrors of \ncrime, drugs, illegitimacy and total family breakdown. Mr. President, I \nam not just saying that welfare does not work; I am saying that it is \nhurting those it purports to help.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are suffering because the Federal \nGovernment insists on centralized control over a system that is not \nliving up to its promises. Thirty years of welfare state have not \neradicated poverty, not made a dent in poverty; if anything, poverty in \nAmerica has become more wretched than ever before.\n  What we know now, Mr. President, is a Federal bureaucracy that has \nshown itself virtually incapable helping needy people. More Federal \nmandates are not the answer. Control over welfare must be relinquished \nto State and local governments. Federal control certainly does not \nwork, and the only way we can determine what kind of public assistance \nprogram will work is if we let \n\n[[Page S13795]]\nStates and local communities experiment.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from people in Washington State who have \nknowledge of and experience with the present system and who fervently \nbelieve in disassembling welfare as we know it.\n  This year, Washington State legislators tried to overhaul the State \nwelfare system. Their frustration mounted as their innovative ideas \nwere killed by overwhelming amounts of waivers, directors and general \nred tape from the Federal Government.\n  Social workers are often too busy keeping up with paperwork and \ncomplicated, sometimes conflicting, Federal regulations to help people \nget jobs and become self-sufficient.\n  I have listened to people who are on or have been on welfare. Their \nstories alone are enough to convince me that the system has to be \ncharged. Welfare, you see, punishes people for trying to get out. One \nwoman in Whatcom County was not allowed to participate in a job \ntraining program because she hadn't been receiving public assistance \nlong enough.\n  Mr. President, the faults and iniquities of welfare run wide and \ndeep. We must face the problem. We must stop pretending that by \ntinkering here or changing a bit there that everything will be better. \nWhat we must do is completely restructure public assistance in America. \nIt is well past time for Washington, DC to relinquish control over \nwelfare to States and local communities.\n  There are a lot of things the Federal Government is good at--handing \nout checks and creating bureaucracies are particular areas of \nexpertise. But the Federal Government is not so good at setting people \nfree from its control.\n  The current system pits people against government institutions. it \nprohibits innovation. When local communities try to implement new ways \nto combat poverty, unemployment and illegitimacy, the bureaucracy \nbalks, throwing up barriers to new ideas and community involvement, and \nenforcing the same old mandates.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, bureaucracies do not care if people get off \nwelfare or stay on it for the rest of their lives. But there are many \nof us who do care, who do want to relieve the plight of so many of our \nfellow Americans.\n  The liberals who have supported the Welfare State these many years \nare reacting with vehemence against proposals to let States and local \ncommunities have more of a say in public assistance programs. This \nreaction points to the distrust most liberals have toward people, as \nopposed to government institutions. Does it make sense to say that a \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC cares more about needy people in Spokane, \nWA, than do the actual citizens of that community? I do not believe so.\n  Mr. President, the only way to stop the dependency, the illegitimacy, \nthe family breakdown, and the hopelessness of the current system is to \ntruly change--not merely tinker with--the way it is run. If our goal is \nto improve people's lives, then we can't continue on the path we're on \nnow.\n  We must allow people the opportunity to make their own lives, to \nprovide for themselves and their families, to feel the pride of honest \nwork, and to be the deciders of their fate--not to have the Federal \nGovernment as their master.\n  Mr. President, I support the majority leader's welfare reform bill \nbecause it provides the best means for giving responsibility back to \nlocal communities and ending the Federal Government's control over how \nmoney is spent and programs administered. This legislation, America's \nWork and Family Opportunities Act of 1995, does not fall into the trap \nof trying to manage the system from Washington, DC. State and local \ngovernments, instead of being told what to do by Federal bureaucrats, \nare allowed to experiment and come up with solutions that meet local \nneeds.\n  The last thing we need is yet more Federal mandates to stifle local \ninnovations and solutions. Mandates that sound wonderful in the \nNation's Capital can wreak havoc when they are put into practice--in \ntruth, we have no way of knowing if they will work. Giving States \nflexibility will produce programs both successful and unsuccessful; \nwhen we can distinguish one from the other, perhaps more Federal \nguidance will be in order.\n  Our only hope for ending welfare as we know it, Mr. President, is to \nend the bureaucracy, end the incentives for staying on the rolls and \nout of work, and end the institution which has bred social \ndisintegration. Washington, DC is going to have to do something \nentirely foreign to its nature: give up some of its power and mind its \nown business.\n  Mr. President, it is no longer enough to say that we mean well, that \nwe have the proverbial good intentions. Let's stop the arrogant, self-\nimportant assumption that we can single-handedly run things out of \nWashington, DC. In the case of welfare, that's what we've been doing \nfor 30 years, and its been a disaster.\n  My goals is reforming welfare area straightforward: Do away with the \ncurrent system, and replace it with one that encourages work, \ndiscourages illegitimacy, and stops the cycle of family destruction. I \nbelieve America's Work and Family Opportunities Act of 1995 will best \naccomplish these goals.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, although I vote today in support of welfare \nreform, it is with strong reservations.\n  We all agree that our Nation's welfare system needs reform. Members \non both sides of the aisle, most of our constituents, our Governors, \neveryone agrees that the current system does not work.\n  And while we all have agreed that the system needs change, there has \nnot been agreement on the right approach. The original Dole welfare \nproposal was totally unacceptable. It failed to designate a dime for \nchild care, would force parents to leave kids home alone, and did not \nfocus on actually getting our current welfare recipients into real \nwork.\n  Enough significant improvements have been made, however, to lead me \nto vote for this bill. It looks totally different from the House \nversion and is no longer the bill introduced by the majority leader.\n  The bill now emphasizes work. Unlike its original version, it now \nmeasures work instead of participation rates. It recognizes that child \ncare is essential to getting people with young children to work. The \nbill now includes a work bonus for States and includes other provisions \nthat truly commit us to moving adults off the welfare rolls and onto \npayrolls.\n  The current version of the bill also includes many more protections \nfor children. The original Dole bill designated no money for child \ncare. We now have $8 billion over 5 years to help ensure that no child \nis left home alone. I initially pushed for $11 billion, the amount we \nhave heard is necessary to make the work requirements effective, and \ncame close to securing that amount.\n  In the original Dole bill, women with infants and toddlers, in \neffect, would have been told to leave their kids home alone or face \npenalties. The bill we vote on today says that mothers with children \nunder 6 cannot be sanctioned if they cannot find child care. The \nmodification also says that States can limit required work hours for \nparents with kids under age 6 from 35 hours to 20 hours per week.\n  Democrats made significant improvements in other areas too. The bill \nnow includes a maintenance of effort requirement for States so that \ntaking care of our Nation's poor children remains a joint \nresponsibility between the Federal and State governments. And the bill \nprovides a limited contingency fund for States to deal with downturns \nin the economy. It is not as much as I would like to see, but it \nrecognizes that flat-funded block grants do not address sudden or \nprolonged changes in a State's economy.\n  The bill also, now, provides money for second chance homes--as a way \nto really try and get at the problem of teen pregnancy. The original \nDole bill had no money for these homes. I also am pleased that punitive \nmeasures that would have required all States to impose the family cap \nand deny benefits to teen mothers have been defeated and excluded from \nthe bill.\n  While I am pleased with the changes we were able to make in the bill, \nproblems remain. It includes no protection for children whose parents \nmeet the time limit. Republicans opposed even allowing States to decide \nwhether or not they would provide vouchers for children whose parents \nmet the time \n\n[[Page S13796]]\nlimit. The absence of this provision--a safety net for kids--troubles \nme.\n  Also of concern, the contingency fund offers States only $1 billion \nwhere we sought $5 billion. I worry, ultimately, about the impact of \nthese deficiencies on States that face economic downturns.\n  But ultimately, all of us must make a choice here today, and despite \nthe measure's deficiencies--I intend to vote to move the process \nforward. But I want to make myself perfectly clear: if it returns from \nthe House, looking less like the bill we have here today--if it \ndestroys child protection programs, if it takes away school lunches, if \nits child care provisions do not reflect the significant progress \nthat's been made in this body over the passed week--then this bill and \nwelfare reform is in real trouble.\n  So I hope that a strong vote for the bill today will not be construed \nas an indication of support for whatever comes back from conference. \nThis is simply not the case. A serious retreat from what we adopt here \ntoday will lead me to stand up and oppose the legislation.\n  As I have said all the way along, I believe that going from welfare \nto work is something that ought to be supported. This vehicle gives us \nthe opportunity to do that with the improvements that have been made in \nit. So, with reluctance, I will support this legislation and await the \noutcome of the conference.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, making significant alterations in a \ngovernmental service or program that affects many people almost always \nwill be controversial. The Senate will act today on a bill that falls \ninto that category. The welfare reform legislation addresses a vexing \nset of social problems, a portion of our population that indisputably \nhas great need, and our society's hopes and desires that people, \nespecially children, be treated humanely but that all adults able to do \nso contribute to the Nation in which they live and achieve self-\nsufficiency to the extent of their potential.\n  There are some component issues about which there is widespread \nagreement. The existing welfare structure fails in far too many cases \nto provide a sufficient incentive to adults--and the various kinds of \ntemporary assistance they need--to move toward self-sufficiency. The \nabuses of the existing system--while they very likely are statistically \ninfrequent--are sufficiently frequent and sufficiently provocative that \nthe system has lost the support of the American people. The commendable \nbenevolence of the American people toward those who truly have \nexperienced misfortune due to no fault of their own and need some help \nin getting back on their feet, has been sorely tested.\n  Indeed, my patience with the existing welfare system has been \nexhausted. It is my judgment that our welfare system badly needs \noverhaul. It is failing to contribute sufficiently to the self-\nsufficiency of those it is intended to help. Instead, all too often it \nperpetuates dependency.\n  Welfare reform was a prominent objective of those whose party won the \nelections last fall, and who gained control of both Houses of the \nCongress. They produced legislation to dramatically alter the existing \nwelfare structure and system. Earlier this year, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a far-reaching bill. That bill basically takes \nthe welfare problem and dumps it in the lap of State governments. It \nannounces in effect, ``Henceforth, the wellbeing of impoverished adults \nand their children will not be a Federal problem.'' That bill takes the \nFederal funding now being spent on welfare, and, after cutting the \namount, simply hands it to the States and says ``Go solve this problem. \nGood luck.'' While that is admittedly a dramatic oversimplification of \nthe bill, it is a bill I could not support.\n  The majority leader, Senator Dole, brought a welfare reform bill to \nthe Senate floor in August--a significantly modified version of \nlegislation reported earlier by the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. \nPresident, that bill was not satisfactory to me. It was excessively \npunitive--it appeared to penalize the poor harshly for conditions not \ninfrequently beyond their control. It, like its House counterpart, \nappeared to be a headlong rush to dump the problem of welfare on State \ngovernments, with little concern for the impact on the impoverished or \nthe States or the social fabric of our Nation.\n  But I'm pleased and relieved to say that, to a considerable extent, \nthe legislative process our Founding Fathers established worked as it \nwas designed. A number of colleagues on this side of the aisle, some on \nthe other side, and I offered a series of amendments designed to \ntransform the bill into a bill worthy of the term ``reform.''\n  The results of this process confront us today, Mr. President. It is \nnot a perfect bill, not by a long shot. It differs in a number of ways \nfrom the bill I would design were I in a position to decree the \ncomplexion of our Nation's welfare system.\n  But in the face of great need to shore up the way in which our Nation \ndeals with its impoverished population, a widespread demand by the \npublic to make major changes in our welfare system, and the social \nimperative to focus our available resources on moving poor adults into \nself-sufficiency and provide a path from poverty for poor children, I \nbelieve this is a bill that meets the threshold test for acceptability. \nIt turns the corner from a street going the wrong direction onto a \nstreet pointing toward our objective.\n  One has only to look at the altera- tions made in the bill while it \nwas being considered on the floor.\n  While the ultimate responsibility for poor people is shifted to the \nStates, the States are required, for the next 5 years, to continue to \nspend a minimum of 80 percent of the amounts they spent for welfare in \npast years and 100 percent of the amounts they have spent for child \ncare. The original Dole bill contained no such maintenance of effort \nrequirements.\n\n  The original Senate bill contained no funding whatsoever for child \ncare for children of adults required by the bill to seek work. The bill \non which we will vote today authorizes $8 billion for this purpose.\n  The original bill measured its success in moving persons from welfare \nto work on the basis of participation rates. The bill on which we will \nvote today will measure actual work.\n  The original Dole bill raided existing job training funds to include \nthem in the welfare block grants to the States. The bill before us \ntoday drops the job training titles, and the Senate will return to \naddress those separately at a later date.\n  The Dole bill required all adults on welfare to seek work and accept \njobs when offered. The bill on which we will vote today exempts mothers \nof infants less than 1 year old.\n  The Dole bill made no distinction between women with very young \nchildren and women with school-age children. The bill we consider today \npermits the States to comply with the work requirement if mothers of \nchildren under age 6 work a minimum of 20 hours a week.\n  Mr. President, I am confident this bill will pass the Senate today. I \nintend to support it. Should this bill, or one substantially like it, \nbecome law, it will establish the national laboratory desired by the \nGovernors and legislators of many of our States. The attention will now \nshift to the States--to see if they can, as they have fervently \nmaintained, achieve economics never realized by the Federal Government, \nand, in particular, to see if they can move adult welfare recipients \ninto work. I am very hopeful that the advocates--both at the State \nlevel and here in Washington--knew what they were talking about and \nwill show themselves to have merited our trust and confidence on these \nvery important matters.\n  This course is not without risk, but the imperative for reasonable \naction demands that we take some risk. That is the only way we can \nleave behind a psychology of dependency and instill a psychology of \nself-help with temporary, transitional government assistance. It is the \nonly way we can redefine welfare so that, for the able bodied adult \npopulation, it means assistance in preparing for, finding, and holding \ngainful employment. I support these changes in direction; consequently \nI will vote to pass this bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to emphasize two key \nconsiderations. First, the conference action on this bill will be \ncritical. The safeguards and moderations added to the bill on the \nSenate floor are vital to my support and that of a number of my \ncolleagues. \n\n[[Page S13797]]\nI am very hopeful that the conferees, particularly those of the \nmajority party, will keep this in mind, and that they want to enact a \nbill that has the support from both parties that will be necessary to \nsecure enactment.\n  Second, if this bill passes today--even if this bill becomes law--no \none should prepare to relax. Some of the vexing problems confronting \nour society are addressed in this bill. But by and large this bill \ndeals with persons who already have been left behind by our society. \nIts provisions are remedial. The bill does nothing to reach out to this \nNation's greatest resource--our children--and provide to them the \neducational opportunities and the opportunities for participation in \npositive activities ranging from Boy and Girl Scouts to athletics that \nwill weave them into the fabric of our culture, prepare them to take \ntheir place as self-sufficient and psychologically stable adults, and \ngive them an alternative to falling into the activities of the street \nthat can spell alienation, lives of crime, or even untimely death. We \nhave much, much more to do, Mr. President, and this is only the opening \nchapter.\n  I commend those who struggled to make this bill more realistic, more \nhumane, and more likely to live up to the grand promises it pronounces. \nI share the hope of those who vote for the bill that it will, indeed, \nchange the course of public assistance for the benefit of the children \nand adults directly affected, our communities, our taxpayers, and our \nNation as a whole.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the American people are united by the \nfundamental issues of welfare reform which have divided us throughout \nmuch of this debate. It is clear that they have demanded a dramatic \nchange to a system which they view as ineffective and indeed as an \nimpediment to the progress of both the individual and society as a \nwhole. The $387 billion welfare system has sapped the spirit of many, \nmost especially of our young people, and our national economic \nstrength.\n  It has now been 60 years since the Social Security Act was passed \nwhich created the aid to families with dependent children program. \nAccording to the act itself, the purpose of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act, is in part, to help maintain and strengthen family life \nand to help such parents or relatives to attain or retain capability \nfor the maximum self-support and personal independence.\n  For too many, this is no longer a system which helps to maintain and \nstrengthen family life in America. Many, in fact, believe the welfare \nsystem has the opposite effect on families. The theories which \nsupported public policy in the past have been dispelled by the last 30 \nyears of experience. The misplaced hope that Washington could somehow \ncorrectly calculate the formula to solve the problems of poverty is \nsimply wrong. What happens in the home, in the neighborhood, in schools \nand churches is far more powerful than the Federal Government. We have \nknown this all along.\n  But knowing is different than doing. Today is the day we do something \nabout what we know.\n  We know that work is necessary to attain self-support and personal \nindependence, Today, we elevate the value of work to its proper level \nof esteem in public assistance programs. We know that if welfare is to \nbe only a temporary means of support, the key to personal independence \nis work. We know this basic fact of life is true for all families, at \nall levels of income. It is true for past generations. It is true for \nthis generation and all future generations. Work is not only necessary \nas the means for obtaining our daily bread, it is part of our social \nfabric. Whether in the neighborhood or in the world, work brings order \nto chaos. Many other freedoms flow from the freedom to work.\n  We know the current welfare system is designed for failure. Under the \nheavy hand of the ponderous and paralizing bureaucracy of the Potomac, \nnon one is accountable for results.\n\n  Today, we will provide the States with the responsibility and \nauthority they need to break down the barriers and false promises of \nthe present system. Properly understood, welfare reform is about \nreforming how Government works. The American people will greatly \nbenefit from the rejuvenation of the States' role in our system of \nfederalism. The lines of accountability have been blurred for far too \nlong.\n  Mr. President, today is the day to leave the past behind. To sum up \nwhat this debate is truly about, let me quote from a letter sent last \nweek by Governor Allen of Virginia:\n\n       What the debate really boils down to is who does the U.S. \n     Senate trust to make these policy decisions--the Federal \n     bureaucracy or the elected representatives of the people at \n     the State level. This is a basic philosophical question. The \n     choices you make will determine whether the bold innovations \n     that are occurring in Virginia and other States can move \n     forward, or whether Federal bureaucrats will continue to \n     micromanage and second guess the decisions of the people of \n     the States and their duly elected representatives. I \n     respectfully urge you to place your trust in the States, \n     which are leading the way.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put our confidence and faith \nin the sovereign States. Let us break from the past and free the States \nand the families who need a temporary hand-up from the system which has \nfailed us all.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of Members and staff who deserve \nour recognition and appreciation for moving this legislation forward. \nAbove all, the majority leader has done a masterful job in delivering \non the promise of welfare reform. At several points over the past few \nmonths, it looked as though a comprehensive bill would slip through our \nfingers. Once again, he has demonstrated his skills as a true leader.\n  I congratulate Senator Moynihan on his tireless efforts on this \nlegislation. His knowledge of these issues cannot be matched.\n  Let me also thank those Senators who did remarkable jobs managing \nthis legislation under very demanding and trying circumstances, \nespecially Senators Nickles, Santorum, Grassley, Chafee, Hatch, and \nSimpson.\n  Few people will understand or appreciate the enormous job done by the \nstaff in helping to get this legislation passed. The bill itself was \nnearly 800 pages long at the beginning of consideration. We added more \nthan 200 amendments into the process. The staffs from Finance, \nAgriculture, and Labor Committees as well as from the leadership \noffices, the Congressional Budget Office, and legislative counsel \naccomplished a rather remarkable feat. In particular, let me thank and \ncommend Sheila Burke in the leader's office, and Lindy Paull, Kathy \nTobin, Rick Grafmeyer and Joe Zummo from Finance for their great \nefforts and dedication. Other staff members who deserve our thanks are \nDave Johnson, Peg Brown, Susan Hattan, and Shannon Royce. From the \nDemocratic side, Margaret Malone, John Secrest, Joe Gale, and Mark \nPatterson made special contributions to this legislation.\n  There is still much work ahead of us as some of the details differ \nbetween this legislation and welfare reform as passed by the House last \nMarch. But the most important test, the strength of our will to break \nthe cycle of poverty, has been met. I look forward to completing our \nwork and to sending real welfare reform to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin for permitting me to speak for 5 minutes at \nthis point on the welfare reform package. I have been engaged for the \npast several weeks, almost continuously, with the Ruby Ridge hearings, \nbut I did want to make a few comments and have them printed in the \nRecord before the vote.\n  Mr. President, I think we have passed a reasonable welfare reform \npackage today with overwhelming, bipartisan support. The issue of \nwelfare reform has been one that I have been very much concerned about \nfor many years, having introduced welfare reform legislation going back \nto the 99th Congress, with Senate bills S.2578 and S.2579, and then in \nthe 100th Congress, with Senate bills S.280 and S.281.\n  I especially compliment my colleague, Senator Santorum, for his \noutstanding contribution on this bill and all the Senators for working \non a bill which has broad bipartisan support--a virtual consensus--of \n87 votes in favor of this bill.\n  I am very much worried, frankly, about the admonition of our \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, who has issued \nthe concern, the warning, that we may find \n\n[[Page S13798]]\nchildren sleeping on grates. As we have structured this 5-year reform \npackage, we have to be vigilant on that. Certainly, we have seen the \ndevelopment of a homeless class in America as a result of the release \nof people from mental institutions in the late 1970's without \nappropriate community support.\n  I am pleased to see that there have been significant improvements on \nthis bill, characterized by the Congressional Quarterly this week at \npage 2805, September 16, 1995, commenting about how centrist \nRepublicans have been able to achieve significant results with what you \nmight characterize as the balance of power, coming in with a very \nstrong stand on important matters like child care and maintenance of \neffort provisions for the States.\n  The bill did contain a provision, on which I worked from the outset \nof the welfare reform debate, that would not sanction the benefits of a \nsingle, custodial parent with a child under 5 who demonstrated an unmet \nneed for child care.\n  There were a couple of important provisions where, frankly, I casted \na couple of votes I was not happy about but did so in order to set the \nstage for compromises. One of them was an amendment to fund child care \noffered by Senator Dodd, which was defeated narrowly, 50 to 48. My \nprincipal concern for opposing the amendment was a lack of an offset \nfor six of the eleven billion it proposed. But that negative vote was \ncast in anticipation of a compromise which was later reached, providing \nfor some $3 billion over 5 years exclusively for child care.\n  The second issue was the maintenance of effort provision, where \nSenator Breaux offered an amendment requiring States to maintain 90 \npercent of their 1994 match on welfare spending for 5 years--the \nduration of the bill. I opposed the Breaux amendment with the assurance \nfrom the managers and the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, \nthat a 80 percent provision on maintenance of effort for the States \nwould be inserted and would be fought for in conference as opposed to \nthe 90 percent provision which would not be retained in conference. As \nusual, the better is the enemy of the good. I supported the majority \nleader's position, voted to defeat the Breaux amendment, and we have \neight-tenths of the loaf with an 80 percent maintenance of effort.\n  Senator Domenici led a very important battle on the vote to strike \nthe family cap, which was agreed to by a very substantial number, 66 to \n34.\n  So that as we have come to the end of the debate on welfare reform, I \nthink we have a reasonably good bill. Of course, we will all be \nwatching it very, very closely to see what the outcome is from the \nconference. Beyond the conference report, we will have to maintain a \nvery close vigil over this very important subject to make sure that the \nprediction and concerns expressed by Senator Moynihan do not eventuate, \nwhere we do not find the situation where children are sleeping on \ngrates.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nAbraham.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  For 30 years we have tried to fight the war against poverty and after \n30 years, poverty is winning that war. We talk about helping children, \nyet today more people are below the poverty line than when we began the \nwar on poverty--most of them children.\n  It is hard to argue that the programs that have been in effect are \nthe ones that help children when you see the results of those programs \nup close, as we do in my State of Michigan. The last few years, through \nwaivers, we had more flexibility in our State and we have been able to \naddress many of the welfare problems much more effectively than any \nother State in the country.\n  This bill gives all States the kind of flexibility to deal with these \nproblems the way we are dealing with them in Michigan. I believe it \nwill succeed in moving more people to work and helping more children \nthan the present system possibly could allow.\n  Mr. President, this bill also addresses, I think for the first time, \nthe illegitimacy problem in this country. It may not go as far as some \nwould like but takes an important first step in that direction. And, \nabove all, I think by requiring tough work sanctions, it finally places \nthe welfare debate, I think, where most persons would like to see it, \nwhere people who are the beneficiaries of Federal support and State \nsupport perform some type of community service or work in order to make \na contribution to the process.\n  As a result, I think the majority leader deserves great credit for \nwhat he has done in 9 short months here. We have really ended business \nas usual. When we pass this bill today, we will be saying business as \nusual in welfare is over.\n  Thank you, Mr. President,\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, first I want to join in \ncomplimenting Senator Dole on putting together a bipartisan bill.\n  I have been sitting here listening to those who oppose this bill and \nit seems to me they are talking about a program, talking as if we have \na welfare program that works. The problem is, we have a welfare program \nthat does not work. We are not the only ones saying it does not work. \nAbout 90 percent of Americans say it does not work.\n  Why would we keep something that does not work? It would seem to me \nthat we ought to try something new and different.\n  My second point is a very simple one. We are talking here as if the \nonly one that knows how to take care of poor people is the U.S. \nGovernment. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, \nthere is no welfare in America unless the States put up money. If the \nStates have decided they do not care about children and they do not \ncare about need, there would be no welfare program in the sovereign \nStates of America.\n  All we are saying, since they put up the money, at least part of it--\nhalf of it or more--let them try to run the program. Some would have us \nthink that that money they will get for 5 years from us they can spend \non highways. They have to spend it on those people that are needy in \ntheir State.\n  We are giving them some flexibility to try to do it better. What is \nwrong with that? Essentially, we are saying to our States, ``You have \nbeen paying for a program. We have been telling you how to run it. Now \nwe would like you to run it yourselves.'' And the only way that the \nominous predictions of those on the other side who have opposed this \nwould be anywhere close to true is if the States in America, the \nGovernors and the legislators, decide that they are going to purposely \nruin the program. And even at that, they cannot spend the money on \nanything else.\n\n  I believe we are going to have better welfare programs, more \nresponsive programs, that people are going to go to work if they are \nable-bodied--and I stress able-bodied--and I do not think there is \nanything wrong with that experiment.\n  It is as noble as the experiment that has failed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the Democratic \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues in the Chamber today should \nvote for this bill, not because it is a perfect bill, because it is \nnot, but because it is a good start. Some have said this bill is a \nblock grant and for the first time Washington, DC, gets out of the way. \nMy concern is that, being a block grant, it does nothing to solve the \nproblems of welfare reform. It just puts all the problems in a box and \nmails it off to the States and hopes the State do a good job.\n  Someone said ``Today, Washington, DC, gets out of the way.'' The \noriginal Republican proposal said and allowed for the Federal \nGovernment to, perhaps, pay for 100 percent of the costs of welfare \nreform. That is hardly saying that Washington would get out of the way, \nbut rather that Washington would get stuck with the entire bill for \nwelfare reform.\n  This bill really does address work. For the first time it says people \nshould go to work within 6 months. Welfare \n\n[[Page S13799]]\nreform is not about programs, it is about creating good jobs for people \non welfare. This bill is a step in the right direction.\n  Reform should be about taking care of children, and while this bill \nis not perfect, it provides $8 billion for child care because of the \nefforts of many of us--my colleague from Connecticut on this side \nincluded. When it left the Finance Committee it had zero money for \nchild care. This bill puts $8 billion in it for child care.\n  In addition, it says the State should do something. That is reform. \nThe Finance Committee bill said the States had to do nothing \nwhatsoever, and that was going to be reform. This bill says the States \nhave to maintain at least 80 percent of what they were doing.\n  Mr. President, we should pass this bill. It can become a better bill. \nThat is our hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the leader for yielding. Mr. President, I want \nto say, we have come a long way. Having worked on the House task force, \n2 years ago, on welfare reform, and having introduced a bill and worked \non it diligently since then, I do not think anyone, in as short a time \nas 2 years ago, would have expected us to pass a bill as dramatic, as \nprogressive, and as focused in trying to create a dynamic system to try \nto help people out of poverty as we created in the Senate today, and I \nam proud of the accomplishment.\n  I want to recognize several people who turned this ship around when \nit did not look like it was going to sail. First, I thank Senator \nPackwood from the Finance Committee. He put together the shell of this \nbill and really did work diligently with Senator Ashcroft and Senator \nGregg, two former Governors, in putting together this shell that we \nthen filled in as the process of negotiations off the floor and on the \nfloor continued.\n  I also thank Senator Hutchison. I think, if we had not figured out \nthe financing mechanism, the formulas, this bill would just simply not \nhave been able to sail. She just did yeoman's work in putting that \ntogether, and really deserves a lot of credit for moving this bill \nforward.\n  For what happened all throughout the process, but particularly at the \nend, I thank the leader. He really had faith in the process to continue \nto move it forward, to bring it up when many thought it could not be \ndone. He continued to push forward, finding common ground between the \nmoderates and conservatives, bringing people together, constantly \nbringing people together to keep moving. Because I think he recognizes, \nas all of us do, the importance of solving this serious problem for \nmillions of Americans. He deserves a lot of credit for this bill.\n  This bill is dramatic. You are going to hear reported it does not go \nas far as the House bill, and this is a minor reform, and they are \ngoing to downplay this. All they are going to talk about in the press \nis how we differ from the House. But I tell you, this bill goes so much \nfather than anyone could have anticipated just a short time ago. It \nends the entitlement to welfare. It requires work. It puts a time limit \non welfare benefits, which again is a dramatic change in the current \nsystem.\n  I have heard people say we have eliminated the safety net. I do not \nknow what safety net they are looking at, but I tell you, when you see \nmillions of people trapped in poverty for their whole lives, generation \nafter generation, that is not a safety net, it is a fisherman's net. \nYou are trapping people in a fisherman's net, and what we are trying to \ndo is cut back the net so people can climb out, not so people fall \nthrough.\n  That is the difference between what has been proposed in the past and \nwhat we are proposing today, and it is dramatic. It is significant. And \nI can tell you, the difference between the House and the Senate, while \nit will be played up in the press, is not that significant. What we \nhave are the frameworks of two bills that are very similar. We are \ngoing to move in the same direction. I believe, when we get to \nconference, we will be able to get a bill and I do not think it is \ngoing to take as long as people think.\n  We have a lot of common ground here. We understand it is important to \nget this bill in for reconciliation and I believe we will do it. I, \nagain, just want to tip my hat to the leader for his tremendous work on \nthis bill. If it was not for him, we would not be here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 2 minutes under \nthe leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. First of all, let me \ncommend those who have been involved in this debate. We talked about a \nnumber of Members here today. Let me point out, as I have on numerous \noccasions, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, who has \nforgotten more about this issue than most people ever remember. I \ncommend him and thank him for the enlightenment which he has shed on \nthis particular issue.\n  Having said that, I am going to vote for this bill. I do so with a \nhigh degree of reluctance, as my colleagues know. I think this is a \nnarrow call, but in my view, the product we vote on now is a \nsubstantial improvement over what was originally proposed. I say that \nwith all due respect to my friend and colleague from Kansas, the \nmajority leader. There are improvements here. And, it is substantial in \nits difference over what was passed in the House of Representatives. Of \ncourse, there are fundamental differences which may never be resolved \nover issues such as the entitlement.\n  But, because of the 20 or so improvements that were made to this bill \nby amendments offered from people on both sides of the aisle, \nprincipally on this side, this is a bill which I think can be supported \ntoday. It goes much further than the original proposal, certainly, in \nthe area of child care. There was zero money designated for child care \nin this legislation at first. My colleagues know that I would have done \nmore in the child care area. I would have liked to have seen as much as \n$11 billion over 5 years. We ended up with $8 billion over 5 years--\nstill, a substantial improvement.\n  Let me say to those who will be responsible for moving this product \nforward, if this bill comes back from the House with any kind of \nserious retreat from what we have adopted here, then I will stand up \nand vehemently oppose the legislation and recommend that the President \nveto the legislation.\n  This is a bill that, in my view, can be supported. It steps in a \ndirection, and no one can say with absolute certainty where it will \ntake us. I appreciate that. But, clearly, the system does need changing \nand this proposal offers us that opportunity.\n  As I have said all the way along, I believe that going from welfare \nto work is something that ought to be supported. This vehicle gives us \nthe opportunity to do that with the improvements that have been made in \nit. So, with reluctance, I will support this legislation and await the \noutcome of the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson, a member of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I never dreamed, when I came on the \nFinance Committee, we would be involved with so many vigorous \nactivities. Of course, this was the principal beginning, and now, \nwithin these next hours, our committee will meet to decide how to trim \nsome $470 billion from Medicare and Medicaid. And that is a must or \nelse that program will go broke in the year 2002.\n  Welfare reform is long overdue. We have had 2 weeks of debate on all \nof the issues. It is time to pass this in a bipartisan way, give these \nprograms over to the States. What we have done before has failed. So \nchange is difficult, but something is very, very wrong with welfare. We \nknow it. The Democrats know it. The Republicans know it. The President \nknows it. Now is the chance--to have a chance for the States to run \nthese programs with \n\n[[Page S13800]]\nmuch less Federal regulation, much more flexibility. They have \nrecognized the needs of so many of us in this body.\n  I want to commend leader Dole, Bob Dole, Senator Dole, on listening \nto our concerns, paying careful attention to our needs at every level, \nevery State receiving necessary attention to the things that concern us \nand, because of his efforts, this is now a bipartisan effort with most \nSenators voting to support this legislation. He has accommodated many \nof the Democratic concerns, including much needed child care, State \nmaintenance of effort, and a contingency fund for the States.\n  I thank him for his efforts. We will wait for the conference report \nbut, hopefully, those of us who have been involved in this one so long \nknow it is better to get a crumb when you cannot get a loaf, in this \ntype of work.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining 3 minutes \nin opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the word reform means to restore to an \nearlier good state. Sir, there was no earlier good state of our present \nwelfare system. It began as a widow's pension, a societal \ntransformation program.\n  In 1988, with the Family Support Act we began to say that welfare \ncannot be a permanent way of life; it has to be a transition. It has to \nbe an exchange of effort between the society, and the individual caring \nfor children.\n  A year and a quarter ago on this floor, I introduced S. 2224, the \nWork and Responsibility Act of 1994. This was the administration's \nwelfare reform measure. I introduced it on behalf of myself and Mr. \nMitchell, the majority leader at that time, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Rockefeller. It had taken a year and a \nhalf to get to it, but it was welcomed, and it was in the tradition \nthat we have upheld for a good 20 years now.\n  The table of contents sets the tone. Title I, JOBS--job opportunities \nand basic skills; title II, work; title III, child care; title IV, \nprovisions with multi-program applicability; title V, prevention of \ndependency; title VI, child support enforcement; title VII, improving \nGovernment assistance and preventing fraud; and title VIII, self-\nemployment and microenterprise demonstrations. That was the track we \nwere on. The Family Support Act of 1988, to which this was to be a \nsuccessor, came out of this Senate floor 96 to 1.\n  I fear we have lost that tradition. We are ripping out a portion of \nthe Social Security Act today. I fear we may be now commencing the end \nof the Social Security system.\n  The one thing not wrong with welfare was the commitment of the \nFederal Government to help with the provision of aid to dependent \nchildren. We are abandoning that commitment today.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank all concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both the \nmajority leader and I have each have 10 minutes remaining in the final \nmoments of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me begin by thanking Senators \nMikulski, Breaux, Dodd, and Moynihan for the great effort they have put \nforth to bring us to this point. Were it not for their leadership and \ntheir participation, we would not be here today.\n  I also want to thank the majority leader for his willingness to work \nwith us and address many of the concerns that we have raised during the \ncourse of the last several months.\n  Most of us began this debate with the realization that the current \nwelfare system needs repair. It does not enable people to become self-\nsufficient. It does not contain the resources to put people to work. It \nis not flexible enough for many States. It sends the wrong messages to \nwelfare recipients--that work does not pay and that welfare can become \na trap.\n  As a result, most people agree that reform--or whatever term we may \nwant to use to address those problems--be addressed legislatively. We \nrecognize that there is no perfect solution. There is no easy solution. \nAs Senator Moynihan has said, in spite of our best efforts, we have not \nfound one today.\n  The disagreement really has been about the solution. In the view of \nmost Democrats, the original Republican bill was extreme and misguided. \nIt boxed up all of the current system and shipped it off to the States, \nsaying, ``You do it.'' It was our view that that was not reform.\n  The bill we have before us today is a better bill. The bill before us \ntoday requires that the States provide at least an 80 percent \nmaintenance of effort, and 100 percent maintenance of effort for child \ncare. There is a $1 billion contingency grant fund, and there are no \nmandates from the extreme right wing.\n  In our view, the original bill was not about work. In fact, the \nFinance Committee bill did not even require work. It did not measure \nwork. It only measured what we call participation in the welfare \nsystem. No work was required for two years, and in our view that was \nnot reform.\n  We have a better bill now, a bill reached in agreement over the last \nseveral days that measures real work and provides a work bonus when \nStates exceed the goals that we lay out in this legislation. It sets \nout $8 billion in child care funds, dollars that can only be used for \nchild care and nothing else. It requires 80 percent maintenance of \neffort from states. It deletes the job training titles that ought to be \noutside the realm of welfare itself, and provides for them to be \naddressed in other legislation later on.\n  It establishes a personal responsibility contract very similar to the \nparent empowerment contract that was required in the Work First bill. \nIt allows a work exemption for mothers with children under 1, and \nrequires work after 3 months.\n  Mr. President, we have made very significant improvements in many \nareas of the legislation that I believe warrant our support today. The \noriginal bill hurt children. It included no funds for child care. In \nfact, many of us originally called it the ``home alone bill'' simply \nbecause of our concern for what it meant for children whose mothers and \nfathers would have to go out and find jobs.\n  It sanctioned mothers who could not find or afford child care. It \nallowed 30 percent of the funding under the child care development \nblock grant to be transferred. It included no safety net for children \nand only a 10-percent exemption to the time limit. And that, in our \nview, was not reform at all. That is aiming at the mother and hitting \nthe child.\n  But we have a better bill now, reached in agreement over the last \nseveral days--$8 billion in child care: $5 billion as part of the block \ngrant, and $3 billion in additional funding to address the very needs \nthat we have talked about for the last several weeks. One hundred \npercent maintenance of effort is required on child care. Transfer of \nfunds from the child care development block grant is prohibited. \nMothers with children under 6 will not be sanctioned if they cannot \nfind or afford day care.\n  We gave States the option to allow mothers with children under 6 to \nwork no more than 20 hours per week in lieu of the 35 hours per week \nthat was originally required. We increased the time-limit exemption \nfrom 15 to 20 percent. We require teen mothers to stay at home or live \nin an adult-supervised environment, just as required in the Work First \nbill. We provide $150 million for second chance homes, and we do not \nhave any mandates that deny aid to teen mothers or impose family caps.\n  This is a better bill. The original bill was an unfunded mandate of \nenormous proportion. It provided no funds for child care, even though \nchild care is the linchpin between welfare and work. Although work \nrates increased from 20 to 50 percent, the CBO originally projected \nthat 44 States would have failed to meet them. There was no contingency \ngrant fund for uncontrollable circumstances.\n  That is not reform. That is shifting the welfare problem to the \nStates. That is telling local taxpayers that they have to pick up the \ntab.\n  But Mr. President, it is a better bill now. Through agreements \nreached over the last several days, we provide the $3 \n\n[[Page S13801]]\nbillion in additional child care money, and $1 billion in contingency \ngrant funds. We passed an amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, to revert the Food Stamp \nProgram back to an entitlement if the number of hungry children \nincreases.\n  It is a better bill now. It is not perfect. It is not the bill I \nwould have drafted alone. It is not the bill that would have passed 5 \nyears ago or perhaps even last year. It does reflect, in my view, the \npolitical reality of today. It is the best bill that we are going to \nget under the circumstances that exist in the caucus, in the Senate, in \nthe Congress, and in the country.\n  I have a number of reservations about this bill. There were \nprovisions in the Work First bill that I regret were not adopted. I \nregret, for example, that the bill does not have the vouchers we \nproposed to address the needs of children after the time limit.\n  I regret that the bill ends the Federal-State matching responsibility \nfor all those who qualify based on State-set criteria.\n  I regret the bill does not exempt families from time limits based \nupon specific criteria like high unemployment or serious disability.\n  I regret that there is no increased funding, beyond child care, for \nStates to really put people to work.\n  I regret that the contingency fund is probably underfunded and we \nwill likely have to revisit that issue again in the future.\n  I regret that the food stamp block grant option was not eliminated. \nMany food stamp recipients are working poor trying to stay off welfare; \nsimilarly, many food stamp recipients are elderly, and their problems \nwill only be exacerbated. I remain concerned about the food stamp block \ngrant choice.\n  So, as other Senators have indicated, we will be watching what the \nconference does. We were successful in enacting more than 20 major \nchanges in this legislation, and those changes, Mr. President, are \nabsolutely critical to retaining our support in the future. If the \nconference bill is not very close to the Senate bill, I will oppose it \nand I will recommend the President veto that bill when it reaches his \ndesk.\n  The American people want a welfare system that is truly reformed. The \nAmerican people want changes, not through rhetoric, but through \nreality. They want able-bodied adults to work. But they also want \nchildren to be protected. Children left home alone is no good for \nanybody. Arbitrary time limits alone will mean local taxpayers pick up \nthe tab.\n  We have to ensure that we maintain the broad bipartisan support that \nfinal passage in just a few moments will represent. We will be watching \nthe conference closely.\n  This is the beginning, Mr. President. If we can, indeed, come back \nfrom the conference with what we have accomplished in the Senate \nintact, then I believe it is the beginning of a series of changes over \nthe course of the next several years that can move us to a welfare \nsystem that truly will work as we want it to. This cannot be the final \nword on what happens on welfare this decade. I support this legislation \nwith reservations. I will watch closely as work continues in the \nconference committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader. \nI thank him for his support and his cooperation in getting us this far. \nI think we are going to have a display that we have not had recently of \nbipartisan support for major legislation, which I believe the American \npeople will appreciate.\n  The Senate began debating welfare reform on August 7, and I predicted \nin my opening statement we were going to have a lot of contentious \nvotes, a lot of debate, tough votes, and I also said that throughout \nall the debate we could not lose sight of two overriding facts. No. 1 \nwas that our current welfare system had failed and, No. 2, it was our \nduty to fix it--talking about the Senate, not Republicans or Democrats.\n  So we have had about 100 hours of debate since that time, and some of \nit contentious, and we have now had I think 40 votes; 41 will be the \nfinal vote.\n  My colleagues remember the first week in August we thought we might \nbe able to take up and finish welfare reform. But it appeared we had \nreached a roadblock after a couple days, and I recall some of the \nheadlines. The media was quick to report that the Senate Republicans \nhad failed and that welfare reform was on its last legs. The media got \nthe story wrong because what is on its last leg in this Congress is the \nstatus quo.\n  Today, I am proud to say that the Senate has kept its promise--no \nmore business as usual, no more tinkering around the edges with a \nsystem that has cost American taxpayers $5.4 trillion--that is with a \n``T''--in Federal and State spending over the past 35 years. Instead, \nwe are fulfilling our duty. We are not only fixing welfare, we are \nrevolutionizing it. We are writing truly historic landmark legislation, \nlegislation that ends--ends--a 60-year entitlement program. And in the \nprocess we are closing the books on a 6-decade-long story of a system \nthat may have been well-intentioned but a system that failed the \nAmerican taxpayer and failed those who it was designed to serve.\n  So today we begin to write a new story, a story about Americans who \nearn a paycheck rather than drawing a welfare check, a story about an \nAmerica where welfare is no longer a way of life and where people no \nlonger will be able to receive endless Federal cash benefits just \nbecause they choose not to work, a story about an America where power \nis actually transferred away from Federal bureaucrats in Washington and \ngiven back to our 50 State capitals and our Governors, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and our State legislatures, Democratic or Republican, a \nstory about an America that recognizes that the family is the most \nimportant unit in our society.\n  Mr. President, there are some in this Chamber, including Senator \nMoynihan from New York, for whom I have the greatest respect, who \nbelieve the story we write today may turn out to be a harsh one. I \ndisagree. I believe nothing could be more harsh on American men and \nwomen and children in need than to continue with the system that has \nfailed them year after year after year. And rather than being harsh, I \nbelieve the vast majority of Americans agree that the system we create \ntoday is fair, it does help those in need and, above all, it is based \non common sense.\n  It is common sense to require welfare recipients who are actually \nable to work to do just that. It is common sense to put a 5-year \nlifetime limit on welfare benefits so it does not become a way of life. \nIt is common sense to give our States the flexibility to devise \nprograms that meet the specific needs of their citizens.\n  I remember what Governor Thompson of Wisconsin told a group of us in \nmy office, speaking to the Governors, that we were talking about \nmandating Governors, strings, conservative strings in this case, and \nGovernor Thompson said, ``Who do you think we are? We are elected by \nthe same people you are. Do you think I am going to allow somebody to \ngo without medical treatment or without food in the State of \nWisconsin?''\n  It is common sense. It is putting our faith in elected officials who \nare closer to the people. It is common sense to put a cap on spending \nbecause no program with an unlimited budget will ever be made to work \neffectively and efficiently. It is common sense to require that teenage \nmothers who have children out of wedlock stay in school and live under \nadult supervision in order to receive benefits. Otherwise, they have no \nchance to move off welfare. It is common sense to grant our States the \nability to try to reduce our alarming illegitimacy rate.\n  Mr. President, the American people should know that this legislation \nis not perfect. It is not going to magically solve all the problems, \nregardless of how we vote today, whatever the conference vote may be \nwhen it comes back. But the Work Opportunity Act does put an end to a \nfailed system. It does offer hope and opportunity to millions of \nAmericans. It is a revolutionary step in the right direction, and it is \nfurther proof of the commitment this Congress has made to the American \npeople.\n  At the risk of forgetting someone, Mr. President, I wish to thank a \nnumber of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who helped make \ntoday's victory for the American people possible. \n\n[[Page S13802]]\nThere have been references to my colleagues, Senator Breaux and Senator \nDodd and certainly the Democratic leader and others on that side of the \naisle. All members of the Senate Finance Committee, including Senator \nPackwood, who was our chairman when we started this revolution, \ncertainly deserve credit. Senator Packwood put the original bill \ntogether, brought it to the floor and we have made changes. Senator \nHutchison was instrumental in reaching agreement on the formula which \nkept the bill alive. Senator Faircloth led the fight for important \namendments regarding abstinence education.\n  I wish to say a special word of thanks to our remarkable freshman \nclass. They sunk their teeth into this issue from day one and never let \ngo. Senators Abraham and Snowe and Ashcroft authored important \namendments, and particularly Senator Santorum, who was in the Chamber \nevery day, almost every minute, making certain the debate was moving \nforward. And he understands the program because he worked on it on the \nHouse side. I think he did an excellent job. And I know there are \nothers I may have forgotten. But I thank also America's Governors, \nRepublicans and Democrats--particularly Republicans because I work \nclosely with the Republican Governors, whether it is Governor Voinovich \nof Ohio, Governor Engler of Michigan, or Governor Edgar of Illinois or \nGovernor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor Pataki of New York. They \nworked very closely with us throughout the process and so did State \nlegislators and local governments because they are going to have the \nauthority.\n  We are going to follow the 10th amendment. We are going to return \npower to the people, power to the States that the 10th amendment and \nBill of Rights say we should.\n  So we are going to cast our votes in a few moments. It is not the end \nof the process; as the Democratic leader has indicated, we have to go \nto conference. We will have to reconcile our differences.\n  In the Senate-passed bill, I think we save between $65 billion and \n$70 billion. The House has more savings. About $40 billion of our \nsavings, I think, are under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. \nI think we will iron out the differences we have, and then we will send \na historic bill to the President of the United States, who has \nindicated, at least preliminarily, he will sign the bill.\n  I hope he will join with this Congress and the American people in \nwriting a new chapter in the history of this great Nation.\n  As I listened to the debate and I listened to the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from Minnesota, I regret that they believe we \nare going to punish America's children. I disagree with that, because I \nbelieve we are creating a better opportunity for our children in this \nlegislation, a future of more hope and more opportunity.\n  All of us come from different places in our lifetime. We have \ndifferent backgrounds. Many come from hard-scrabble backgrounds and \nsome not so hard scrabble. I can recall a long time ago in my family, \nin the small town of Russell, KS, when every member of the family \nworked. There were four children. Both my mother and father worked.\n  I can remember a time, even in those days, because of the Dust Bowl \nand a lot of other things that were happening, we could not make ends \nmeet. We moved into the basement, six of us, and rented out the \nupstairs so we could make ends meet.\n  I think all of us can go back into our lives and say we had it tough. \nI remember coming to the Congress and working with Senator George \nMcGovern from South Dakota on the Food Stamp Program, the WIC Program, \nand a lot of other programs that I believe protect children, contrary \nto what the Senator from Minnesota may have indicated.\n  I also can think back to the days when I was a county attorney in my \nsmall county of Russell County. One of the responsibilities of the \ncounty attorney in those days in my State was to sign every welfare \ncheck that left the office. In a small county, you know everybody who \nreceived those checks. In fact, it was old age assistance at the time. \nI knew two of them, my grandparents, who were caught up in the Dust \nBowl days, in the dust storms and who had no other recourse but to seek \nhelp.\n  So I think when we vote on this bill, we should understand that, \nobviously, some are going to be in need and they are going to be taken \ncare of and they are going to be young and old. But it is our hope that \nwhat we have demonstrated here, based on a lot of hearings and a lot of \ndebate, is that we want to help people move out of this cycle of \nwelfare, generation after generation, back in the mainstream, working, \nregaining their dignity and their self-esteem. That would be the goal \nof any welfare reform plan that I can think of.\n  So I know how tough it is for some people to accept assistance, and I \nhave always had the view that people want to work. If given the \nopportunity, they will work. We call our bill the Work Opportunity Act \nof 1995. It is not going to be perfect but, in my view, it is a big, \nbig step in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this \nbill. It is a big, big step in the right direction. The American \npeople, by a vote of 88 percent, said this is the way they want to go, \nand I hope we will follow their lead.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nvote from their desks and that their vote be announced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass, as amended?\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendments and request a conference with the House, and \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n\n[[Page S13803]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to praise the magnificent work of the people on the Senate \nFinance Committee, majority office, and in my personnel office who were \nat the core of my welfare reform team and who helped develop and reach \na consensus on much of the historic welfare reform legislation that has \npassed the Senate today.\n  These individuals have been working tirelessly and at length this \nentire year with me and with other Senators, crafting policy that ends \nthe broken welfare system as we currently know it. The reforms will \nhelp our Nation's poor develop self-respect, train them for jobs, \nlessen the burdens on the hard working taxpayers of this country, give \nour Governors the greater flexibility they have been asking for, and \nleave the safety nets of aid and nutrition in place for families, for \nthe elderly and for the disabled. Well deserved praise and my thanks to \nLindy Paull, Rick Grafmeyer, Kathy Tobin, Joe Zummo, and Rob Epplin of \nthe Finance Committee, and Marcia Ohlemiller and Ginny Worrest on my \npersonal staff.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ntell my colleagues why I voted against the Dole welfare reform bill.\n  Mr. President, we live in the greatest Nation on earth. We are the \nwealthiest country in the world. But it is clear that some in our \nsociety do not share in this wealth. They are poor. They are jobless \nand in some cases homeless. And they must rely on public assistance to \nsurvive. In America, this is unacceptable. And we should be committed \nto improving their lives.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the current welfare system \nneeds reform. But the central goal for any welfare reform bill should \nbe to move welfare recipients into productive work.\n  This will only happen if we provide welfare recipients with education \nand job training to prepare them for employment. It will only happen if \nwe provide families with affordable child care. It will only happen if \nwe can place them into jobs, preferably in the private sector or--as a \nlast resort--in community service.\n  But the Dole bill is not designed to help welfare recipients get on \ntheir feet and go to work. It's only designed to cut programs--pure and \nsimple.\n  It's designed to provide funds so that Republicans can provide huge \ntax cuts for the rich. That's what's really going on here.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the radical experiment proposed in this \nlegislation will harm our society while producing defenseless victims.\n  Those victims are not represented in the Senate offices. They're not \nhere lobbying against this bill. They don't even know they're at risk.\n  The victims will be America's children. and there will be millions of \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the AFDC Program provides a safety net for 9 million \nchildren. These young people are innocent. They did not ask to be born \ninto poverty. And they don't deserve to be punished.\n  These children are African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and white. They \nlive in urban areas and rural areas. But, most importantly, they are \nAmerican children. And we as a nation have a responsibility to provide \nthem with a safety net.\n  The children we're talking about are desperately poor, Mr. President. \nThey're not living high off the hog. These kids live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, it's hard for many of us to appreciate what life is \nlike for the 9 million children who live in poverty and who benefit \nfrom AFDC.\n  I grew up to a working class family in Paterson, NJ, in the heart of \nthe Depression. Times were tough. And I learned all too well what it \nmeant to struggle economically.\n  But as bad as things were for my own family, they still weren't as \nbad as for millions of today's children.\n  These are children who are not always sure whether they'll get their \nnext meal. Not always sure that they'll have a roof over their heads. \nNot always sure they'll get the health care they need.\n   Mr. President, these children are vulnerable. They're living on the \nedge of homelessness and hunger. And they didn't do anything to deserve \nthis fate.\n   Mr. President, if we're serious about reforming a program that keeps \nthese children afloat, we won't adopt a radical proposal like the Dole \nbill. We won't put millions of American children at risk. And we won't \nsimply give a blank check to States and throw up our hands.\n   Mr. President, this Republican bill isn't primarily a policy \ndocument. It's a budget document.\n   Mr. President, if the Republicans were serious about improving \nopportunities for those on welfare, they would be talking about \nincreasing our commitment to education and job training. In fact, only \nlast year, the House Republican welfare reform bill, authored in part \nby Senator Santorum, would have increased spending on education and \ntraining by $10 billion.\n  This year, by contrast, the bill before us would cut education and \ntraining dramatically, with the bill's total cuts exceeding $65 \nbillion.\n  So what's changed? The answer is simple. This year, the Republicans \nneed money for their tax cuts for the rich.\n   Mr. President, shifting our welfare system to 50 State bureaucracies \nmay give Congress more money to provide tax cuts. But it's not going to \nsolve the serious problems facing our welfare system, or the people it \nserves.\n  To really reform welfare, Mr. President, we first must emphasize a \nvery basic American value: The value of work.\n  We should expect recipients to work. In fact, we should demand that \nthey work, if they can.\n  Of course, Mr. President, that kind of emphasis on work is important. \nBut it's not enough. We also have to help people get the skills they \nneed to get a job in the private sector. I'm not talking about \nhandouts.\n  I'm talking about teaching people to read. Teaching people how to run \na cash register or a computer. Teaching people what it takes to be \nself-sufficient in today's economy.\n  We also have to provide child care.\n  Mr. President, how is a woman with several young children supposed to \nfind a job if she can't find someone to take care of her kids? It's \nsimply impossible. There's just no point in pretending otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, the Dole bill doesn't address these kind of needs. It \ndoesn't even try to promote work. It doesn't even try to give people \njob training. It does little to provide child care.\n  All it does is throw up its hands and ship the program to the States. \nThat's it.\n  Mr. President, that's not real welfare reform. It's simply passing \nthe buck to save a buck. And who's going to get the buck that's saved? \nThe people the Republicans really care about: Those who are well off.\n  Mr. President, the Senate did adopt the leadership amendment that \nmade some improvements in the Dole bill. This amendment increases \nfunding for child care, limits State cuts in welfare to 20 percent, and \nincludes a $1 billion contingency fund.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senators who crafted these improvements. \nBut they do not change the basic design of the bill, which remains \ndeeply flawed.\n  This bill would take away the safety net we established for poor \nchildren 60 years ago. It does far little to move recipients from \nwelfare to work. And, when you get right down to it, it's main effect \nwill be to take from the poor so that Congress can give a huge tax cut \nfor the rich.\n  This was a historic vote, Mr. President. And I fear we are making a \nbad situation even worse. I only hope I am proved wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate voted to approve welfare \nreform legislation by a vote of 87-12 this afternoon. I have spent \nweeks thinking about my vote on this issue, and today, after listening \nto people on all sides of this issue, including my family and my \ncolleagues, I reluctantly cast my vote in favor of the Dole bill, as \namended. In my brief tenure here in the U.S. Senate, this was one of \nthe most difficult votes I have cast. Mr. President, I would like to \nexplain why.\n  From the beginning of the welfare reform debate, my No. 1 concern has \nbeen about finding a way to rebuild American families. I have always \nbelieved we can only do that by emphasizing \n\n[[Page S13804]]\n\nreal personal responsibility, providing adequate child care for both \nworking poor and welfare families, and ensuring our children can count \non help from adults.\n  It has been my hope that we could achieve some positive changes to \nthe current system. If there is one thing everyone can agree on, it's \nthat the current system is flawed. It needs fixing, and I vowed to \nsupport reform. My challenge has been to influence that reform in the \nmost constructive direction possible.\n  As someone who came to the Senate during the 1992 election year, I \nknow we cannot continue to do things the way we always have. We must \ntake a hard look at the sum total of our Government programs, and \nrework them to accurately reflect society's strengths, weaknesses, and \nneeds.\n  We entered the debate with two bills, the Dole version and the \nDaschle Work-First bill. I cosponsored and voted in favor of the \nDaschle bill. I supported it because I felt it was the right place to \nstart. It reflected a genuine commitment to helping poor families move \nup and into the work force.\n  Unfortunately from my perspective, a majority in the Senate rejected \nthe Daschle bill. But I didn't give up there. I and others began \ndevoting our energies to improving the Dole bill.\n  First, we offered an amendment to require full funding, and full \nprotection for child care and children's programs. It would have \nprovided the full $11 billion estimated by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to be necessary to meet child-care needs. Again, this \namendment was narrowly defeated, 50-48.\n  Given the closeness of this vote, Senators Dole and Daschle were able \nto reach a compromise that strengthened the Dole bill, but fell short \nof our original amendment. It includes provisions which: require States \nto maintain their welfare spending at a minimum of 80 percent of \ncurrent levels; strike the job training title--which had no business in \na welfare bill to begin with, establish a contingency grant fund to \ntake care of States in times of economic downturns, and provide a total \nof $8 billion for childcare services nationwide. I support this \ncompromise, though I feel ultimately we will have to do more.\n  Following the child-care debate, I cosponsored an amendment to \nestablish greater protection for victims of domestic violence. I \nbelieve domestic violence to be the single, most destructive force \nagainst families in America today. No one, not the Senate, the \nPresident, or anyone else, can place a value on the price paid by \nmothers and their children attempting to survive an abusive household. \nThis time the Senate agreed, and my amendment was adopted unanimously.\n  Having worked hard to improve the Dole bill, I found myself faced \nwith a very difficult decision. I could either vote against the Dole \nbill based on its shortcomings for children, or I could vote to affirm \nthe improvements we made to it.\n  I believe the Dole bill to be deeply flawed. I believe it draws into \nquestion the welfare of poor children throughout the Nation. But I also \nbelieve we have to start somewhere. The current system needs to be \nchanged, and the Dole bill changes it fundamentally. Therefore, I voted \nyes.\n  Mr. President, change of any kind always involves risk. We will never \nknow how great that risk is until we try something different. What we \ndo know, however, is that change brings new responsibility.\n  We do not know whether this bill will make it into law. If it is \nenacted, we don't know if it will work. It may prove a fabulous \nsuccess, or it may only prove to make problems worse for the poor.\n  But today, we have created a grave new responsibility for this \nSenate: to be watchdogs for our children. More than ever before, all \nSenators have an obligation to make the law work in favor of poor \nchildren, All Senators have a responsibility in the future to consider \nthe successes and failures they have created this day, and to be \nprepared to make changes later if things don't work out.\n  The most unfortunate part of this debate, in my opinion, is that \npeople don't think of children when they think of welfare. People think \nof dependency, complacency, poverty, and all the worst stereotypes. \nThis troubles me because it is children who face the most difficult \nstruggles. It is children who are most deserving of our care.\n  The outcome of this debate does not change one iota this basic fact: \nwe need a national commitment to children in this country. I believe \nthis to the very core of my being.\n  Children are under assault every single day in this country. In their \nhomes, in school, on the streets, and yes, in this Congress. We see it \nin cuts to education and dismantling of crime prevention. We see it in \nMedicaid cuts, defunding of AmeriCorps, and elimination of student \nloans.\n  Today, I voted for change, to try something new. But I also took \nresponsibility to live with that change, ad to work even harder \npromoting a broad, national commitment to our children. Mr. President, \nI urge my colleagues to accept that responsibility with equal sobriety, \nand with equal vigor.\n  The outcome today was not in doubt. Nor is this the end of the \ndebate. There will be a conference committee. We may even debate a \nconference report. More likely, we will see this bill again in the \nbudget reconciliation yet to come.\n  I think we can change welfare for the better, and move more people \ninto the work force. I look forward to working with you, Mr. President \nand all my colleagues, to this end; but also to build a stronger \ncommitment to children. We must do this in welfare reform, and across \nthe whole spectrum of issues we consider this session. The future is \nsimply too important. And unlike before, it is our new responsibility.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13770-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

We have agreed Senator \nBoxer will use the first minute and the managers 2 minutes and then \nSenator Boxer will close the debate for the remaining 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will listen to this \nbecause it is such a common sense issue. \n\n[[Page S13805]]\nIf I were to tell you that hot is cold and cold is hot, you would think \nI was kidding. And if I told you that freezers keep things warm and \novens keep things cold, you would think I had lost it. And then if I \ntold you that chicken frozen to 1 degree was fresh you would question \nmy brain capacity. And yet, every day in America's supermarkets, our \nconsumers go in and buy chicken products, turkey products--they are \nmarked fresh and they are hard as a rock. They are as low as 1 degree. \nAnd the Food Safety and Inspection Service finally has remedied that by \nsaying if you are going to put a label on it, it has to reflect the \ncondition of the product; fresh is fresh; frozen is frozen.\n  The committee amendment would stop that rule from going into effect. \nSo I am going to move, at the appropriate time, to table that \namendment.\n  They are going to tell you this is a parochial issue. It is not. It \nis a consumer issue. Every consumer organization thinks this rule \nshould go into effect. I hope Senators will vote to table the committee \namendment.\n  I reserve my 1 minute to close this very intriguing debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is one of those issues that if you \nlook at it you would think the California Senators had the high ground. \nThey do not.\n  In 1992 the California Poultry Association went to the California \nlegislature and said, ``We cannot compete. We have to do something.'' \nThese chickens are coming in here at 26, 27, 28 degrees, which they \nhave been for decades. They are not frozen hard. We are not talking \nabout zero degrees. They said, ``We cannot compete.''\n  So the California Legislature adopted a rule which a Federal court \npromptly ruled out of order because we had preemption on it. So what \nhappened? They go to the Agriculture Department. The rule we are \ntalking about is exactly what the California Legislature passed.\n  I want to tell you this, we have shipped--Southern and Southeastern \nStates have shipped billions and billions and billions of poultry all \nover the United States. Not just California, everywhere. One complaint, \nfrom the California Poultry Federation. They do not even want to allow \nyou a 2 to 3 percent plus or minus allowance. It is the California \nPoultry Federation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  It is clear from the evidence that this is an effort to protect \nCalifornia poultry producers from competition from outside the State. \nThere is no doubt about it.\n  Somebody asked me a while ago, they said, ``I do not understand this. \nAre we being told that if something is frozen that it is not fresh?'' \nThe point is, the Food Safety and Inspection Service has concluded, \nsomehow, that fresh is the opposite of frozen. Fresh is the opposite of \nstale or unfit for consumption or something that does not taste good.\n  The fact of the matter is, this poultry is being sold in California \nthat is being processed in Mississippi or Arkansas, Louisiana, \nOklahoma, Virginia, Delaware--Senator Biden talked about his industry \nthere. We would not be able to see our poultry processors ship any \npoultry into the California market because of this rule. The rule as \npromulgated is that it has to be at no less than 26 degrees, flat 26, \nno variance, no exceptions. Think about a truck going across the \ncountry to California and you have to maintain that exactness.\n  There is going to be a patrol of inspectors waiting on you from \nCalifornia to see if you have met these strict rules? They need to \nreexamine it. The amendment says no funds will be used to enforce this \nregulation until they review it. That is what we insist upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I heard my colleague mention California 13 \ntimes. I find it amusing. It was under the Bush administration that \nthis truth in labeling started, in 1988; in 1988. This is a consumer \nissue and finally we have a chance to make sure that our people who \nwalk into supermarkets, who take care of their families, who buy \npoultry, will know what they are getting. They know the fat content \nnow. They know how much calcium is in a product now. They know how many \nminerals are in a product, how many calories are in the product, how \nmuch protein is in the product. They only thing they do not know is if \na product has been previously frozen.\n  Sometimes they take it, throw it in the freezer, defrost it again, \nwhich is bad. It is a bad thing to do for the health of their families.\n  This is a consumer issue and the consumers are watching us. That is \nwhy every consumer group is on our side and says, ``Please, vote to \ntable the committee amendment.''\n  The fact of the matter is, this is simple common sense. You can turn \nit around, you can say ``California'' 22 times--it does not change the \nfact. Fresh is fresh. Frozen is frozen.\n  All time has expired, so I move, at this time, to table the committee \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understand it, the pending business \nis the Brown amendment to the committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the Senate will proceed to consideration of the Brown amendment \nNo. 2688, on which there shall be 60 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin], and 30 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], with a vote on or in relation to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2693\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the energy costs of Federal facilities for which \n                funds are made available under this act)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2693.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENERGY SAVINGS AT FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Facilities Energy Costs.--The head of each \n     agency for which funds are made available under this Act \n     shall take all actions necessary to achieve during fiscal \n     year 1996 a 5 percent reduction, from the average previous \n     three fiscal year levels, in the energy costs of the \n     facilities used by the agency.\n       (b) Use of Cost Savings.--An amount equal to the amount of \n     cost savings realized by an agency under subsection (a) shall \n     remain available for obligation through the end of fiscal \n     year 1997, without further authorization or appropriation, as \n     follows:\n       (1) Conservation measures.--Fifty percent of the amount \n     shall remain available for the implementation of additional \n     energy conservation measures and for water conservation \n     measures at such facilities used by the agency as are \n     designated by the head of the agency.\n       (2) Other purposes.--Fifty percent of the amount shall \n     remain available for use by the agency for such purposes as \n     are designated by the head of the agency, consistent with \n     applicable law.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 1996, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture (a) shall submit a report to \n     Congress specifying the results of the actions taken under \n     subsection (a) and providing any recommendations concerning \n     how to further reduce energy costs and energy consumption in \n     the future.\n       (2) Contents.--Each report shall--\n       (A) specify the total energy costs of the facilities used \n     by the agency;\n       (B) identify the reductions achieved: and (C) specify the \n     actions that resulted in the reductions.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the two floor \nmanagers of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, and their staff, for their excellent and efficient management \nof the fiscal year 1996 Appropriations Act for the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an amendment I am \noffering on this appropriations bill. My amendment encourages agencies \nfunded under the bill to become more energy efficient and directs them \nto reduce facility energy costs by 5 percent. The agencies will report \nto the Congress at the end of the year on their efforts to conserve \nenergy and will make recommendations for further conservation efforts. \nI have offered this amendment to every appropriations bill that has \ncome before the Senate this year, and it has been accepted to each one.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment: the Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The Office of Technology Assistance and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a non-profit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, \nestimate that Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they \nwould make an effort to become more energy efficient and conserve \nenergy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation, building controls, lighting, heating, and air conditioning. \nThe Department of Energy has made available for government-wide agency \nuse streamlined energy saving performance contracts procedures, modeled \nafter private sector initiatives. Unfortunately, most agencies have \nmade little progress in this area. This amendment is an attempt to get \nFederal agencies to devote more attention to energy efficiency, with \nthe goal of lowering overall costs and conserving energy.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this amendment has been accepted to \nevery appropriations bill the Senate has passed this year. I ask that \nmy colleagues support it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that requires the \nDepartment of Agriculture to use essentially a 3-year base for energy \nuses and requires them to cut their energy use by 5 percent.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment, and we \nhave agreed to it with some modifications being made to the amendment \nby the Senator from New Mexico. We urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2693) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2688, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, is the pending business the Brown \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I yield such time to Senator Nunn, of Georgia, as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Brown amendment No. \n2688, which would prohibit the outlay of any Federal funds for salaries \nand expenses of U.S. Department of Agriculture employees who carry out \nthe peanut program.\n  I know the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Alabama and the \nSenator from Georgia have spoken on this amendment. It is my hope there \nare going to be some changes in the amendment.\n  I speak to the amendment as it now exists. Mr. President, I oppose \nthe Brown amendment on three basic grounds. No. 1, while well-\nintentioned, I am sure the amendment is poorly drafted. No. 2, even if \nthe Brown amendment was drafted correctly, it singles out the \nadministrative cost of the peanut program and raises questions that are \nbeyond the scope of the bill, and No. 3, the Brown amendment preempts \nthe legislative process and, I think, would undermine a very serious \neffort by a bipartisan group of Senators who are working for reform in \nthe authorization bill to greatly lower, if not eliminate, the cost of \nthe price support program from the agriculture budget.\n  First, let me speak to the language of the amendment. The amendment \nhas two basic sentences. The sentence No. 1 says:\n\n       None of the funds made available under this act may be used \n     to pay the salaries and expenses of USDA employees who carry \n     out a price support or production adjustment program for \n     peanuts.\n\n  And then No. 2:\n\n       Assessment.--The Secretary of Agriculture may charge \n     producers a marketing assessment to carry out the program \n     under the same terms and conditions as are prescribed under \n     section 108B(g) of the Agriculture Act of 1949.\n\n  Mr. President, as I read this amendment, this means that an \nAgriculture Department employee who might spend 1 percent of his or her \ntime administering the peanut program and 99 percent of his or her time \nadministering the cotton or the CRP program or other programs will not \nreceive any salary.\n  The amendment says that no funds may be used to pay salaries and \nexpenses of anyone who runs the peanut program, period. It does not say \n``unless that money is reimbursed.'' That is what the second sentence \nimplies, but that is not the way the amendment reads.\n  Even if a peanut grower paid the portion of the salary of a CFSA \nemployee who administers the peanut program, that person, under a \nliteral reading of the Brown amendment, could not receive a Federal \nsalary at all for administering other commodity programs--\n\n[[Page S13807]]\ncotton, feed grains, CRP program, and others.\n  The peanut program is run by county employees of Consolidated Farm \nService Agency, and these same employees administer the other programs \nin the Department of Agriculture. So if read literally, as I think any \ninterpretation would have to read it, the Brown amendment could \nterminate the operation of every Federal farm program in every county \nwhere peanuts are grown. Again, I do not think that is what the Senator \nfrom Colorado means, but that is what the amendment says.\n  Second, the Brown amendment singles out peanut producers to pay for \nthe administrative costs of their own program. Notwithstanding the \nBrown sense-of-the-Senate amendment adopted yesterday on tobacco, no \nother group of producers has been asked to pay for the administrative \ncost of their program.\n  Furthermore, the other American groups, like bankers, do not pay for \nthe cost of administering the banking program, the FDIC program and \nmany other programs.\n  If we are going to do this, it ought to be done on a broad basis and \nnot simply for one commodity. Why not do it for the feed program, \nsugar, dairy, and so forth? If this kind of reform is going to be \nundertaken, and there may be some merits for it, it would imply a much \nbroader set of reforms going far further than the Department of \nAgriculture and really encompassing our entire Federal Government. That \nis not to say that the support price of it should not be addressed, and \nI am sure it is going to be addressed in the reform bill that is now \noccurring.\n  Finally, this amendment preempts the legislative process. Later this \nweek, the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand, will begin \nmarking up commodity titles for the 1995 farm bill which will be part \nof the reconciliation bill. The Brown amendment, as I view it, would \nundermine a very serious effort by a number of Senators who are working \nfor reform of the program in the authorization bill.\n  Peanuts are grown in 72 of Georgia's 159 counties. Yesterday, the \njunior Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, noted that in 75 \npercent of those counties, the poverty rate exceeds 20 percent. If we \nmake an unreasoned and abrupt change, rather than an evolutionary \nchange, in the peanut program, the economies of these counties will be \nhit very, very hard. That means that farm workers, not just landowners, \nwill be deeply affected, as well as small and rural communities.\n  The top two peanut-producing counties in Georgia are Worth County--I \nbelieve that is the birthplace of our good friend from Alabama, Senator \nHeflin--and also Early County. In 1993, 9.71 percent of the population \nof Worth County received aid to families with dependent children \nbenefits and 19.4 percent received food stamps. In Early County, 13.38 \npercent of the population received AFDC benefits; 28.9 percent of the \npopulation received food stamps.\n  Mr. President, no question about it, farming and the peanut program \nare vital to these economies. Nevertheless, peanut producers have not \ncircled the wagon and said they are against all change. They have not \nrejected cost reductions. Indeed, peanut producers are working with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle toward a sound, workable program \nthat will eliminate the taxpayers' cost of the overall support program. \nI do not believe we want to send a signal that a process like that will \nbe thrown out the window by an amendment to the appropriations bill.\n  I concur with the Senator from Colorado that Government expenses \nought to be eliminated from the peanut program to the greatest extent \npossible. I know that my colleagues, Senator Coverdell, Senator \nCochran, and Senator Heflin also generally agree with this sentiment.\n  I also agree with the Senator from Colorado that the program must be \nreformed to reflect new challenges and new opportunities presented by \nboth the NAFTA Agreement and the GATT Agreement, but the amendment by \nthe Senator from Colorado does not help in that regard. I think it \nimpedes progress for real reform. Many in the peanut program did not \nsupport GATT or NAFTA, but these major trade programs passed, and they \nhave been enacted into law. I voted for them.\n  We are now working through the farm bill to make sure the peanut and \nother programs reflect these new realities. This amendment would short \ncircuit that process. NAFTA and GATT will require peanut producers to \nface new realities. They understand that. Our authorizers in the \nAgriculture Committee are working on orderly, but effective, reform of \nthe peanut program.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the bill, S. 1155, the Agriculture \nCompetitiveness Act of 1995, which was introduced by Senator Cochran \nlast month. This legislation eliminates the cost of the price support \nprogram to the U.S. Treasury. The Senator from Colorado mentioned that \nthe peanut program cost $120 million last year. I agree with him that \nthat cost has to be driven down. As I understand S. 1155, these costs \nwould be eliminated over a period of time under that bill.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly proud of the leadership of Georgia's \npeanut growers in supporting legislation that will eliminate the costs \nof the price support program. The peanut title in S. 1155 is a real \nreform measure. It delivers real savings to the Government--$96 million \nin fiscal year 1997, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate that I agree with the \nSenator from Colorado that the costs of the peanut price support \nprogram to the taxpayer should be eliminated. I also agree with him \nthat with the enactment of GATT and NAFTA, the program must reflect the \nrealities of foreign competition. I am confident that under the \nleadership of Senators Heflin, Coverdell, and Cochran, the Senate will \nproduce peanut legislation that meets both of those goals. But the \nBrown amendment undermines this process.\n  I urge that the amendment of the Senator from Colorado be defeated. \nUnless it is substantially redrawn, I hope it will be defeated. It is \nmy hope, after talking with the Senator from Alabama and the Senator \nfrom Colorado and others, that there may be some redrafting underway.\n  I yield back any time I have remaining that was yielded to me by the \nSenator from Alabama, and I thank him for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by the senior Senator from Colorado.\n  The Agriculture Committee, of which I am a member, has been working \ndiligently over the past several months to craft the 1995 farm bill. I \nhave been working closely with other members of the committee to craft \na bill that will achieve the cost savings necessary to reach a balanced \nbudget, make our farm programs more market oriented, and ensure the \ncontinued success of the American farmer.\n  We have nearly reached that goal. As I am sure you are aware, there \nexists disagreement over the future of farm policy. But members and \nstaff of the Agriculture Committee are working to forge a consensus.\n  Last month, I was pleased to join with six of my colleagues on the \nAgriculture Committee, including the Senator from Mississippi, to \nintroduce the Agricultural Competitiveness Act of 1995. This bill sets \nforth our vision for the future of agriculture. Part of our consensus \nrests on the peanut program.\n  My colleagues and I on the committee have set forth a reformed peanut \nprogram that will operate at no cost to the taxpayer--none. We have \noutlined a program that will contribute upwards of $400 million towards \ndeficit reduction and our ultimate goal of achieving a balanced budget. \nAnd we have championed a plan that will ensure the continued success of \nthe family farmer, to ensure that he will be there producing the \nhighest quality, safest, and most abundant food supply in the world.\n  All parties recognize the need for reform. And we all know that the \nbudget is driving the debate over agriculture. So, I commend my \ncolleague from Colorado for his contribution to the cause.\n  But as my colleague from Mississippi mentioned yesterday, we are \ncrafting a comprehensive farm bill, one that will address farm policy \nin a coherent, unified manner. And that is a goal I believe we will \nhave achieved, when all is said and done.\n\n[[Page S13808]]\n\n  But we cannot address farm policy in a piecemeal manner on an \nappropriations bill, singling out not just farmers, but one type of \nfarmer--our peanut farmers--to bear an extra burden.\n  Let me speak to that burden. This amendment is nothing more than a \ntax on farmers. During my travels around the State and my discussions \nwith Virginia farmers, one message is delivered: Reduce the regulatory \nand tax burden on the farmer. This amendment does the opposite.\n  In addition, this amendment singles out one type of farmer: the \npeanut farmer. Now, I know the calls to reform this program have been \nheard. As I have said, in the Agriculture Committee, we are working on \na reformed peanut program.\n  But some insist on attacking the farmer wherever they can. \nAppropriations is not the vehicle for setting farm policy--particularly \nwhen it's bad farm policy.\n  The Federal Government administers numerous programs. I see no reason \nwhy peanut farmers should be singled out for what is nothing more than \nanother tax. If we are going to proceed with this policy, then let's \napply it across the board, and make everyone pay for the incidental \nadministrative expenses associated with their programs. But let's not \njust single out one group of farmers.\n  Reasonable people will disagree about the future of farm policy. But \nthis is the very debate we are undertaking in the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  This is a battle for another day. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, and also Senator Coverdell for their helpful comments in \nthis area. It is clearly an area they are very knowledgeable in, as \nwell as the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who has been very \nhelpful in this regard.\n  The Senator from Georgia is right when he says the normal job of \ndealing with this is in the authorizing committee. I have served in \nCongress now for 15 years--10 of it in the House and the remainder here \nin the Senate--and through that entire period of time, I would find it \ndifficult to name a single time when the authorization bill was really \non the floor and available for markup in either body. It may have been \nbecause of what was going on when I was in each particular House. But \nin the House of Representatives when it came up, there were restricted \nrules.\n  Frankly, what happens is reform in this area is difficult to come by \nbecause it is difficult to author. Why do you need reform? For this \nreason: This program hurts the consumers of America. The world price of \npeanuts runs in the neighborhood of $350 a ton. Members will appreciate \nthat it varies, as any commodity price does. But the established target \nprice under the marketing control program here is $678. In other words, \nthe price that American consumers pay for the domestic consumption is \nnearly double the real price. If somebody said you are going to pay \ndouble for this commodity what anybody else in the world pays, I do not \nthink you would necessarily think they were consumers' friends.\n  This program clearly hurts consumers. This program hurts producers, \ntoo, Mr. President. How can that be? It hurts producers even though the \nprogram allows producers to produce other than products for the target \nprice maintained under a special loan program. Even though it does \nallow them to produce additional peanuts that can be sold worldwide or \ninventoried to meet future quotas, what it does do is lead to the \nexport of this industry.\n  This is a relatively new adjustment, but let me explain why I think \nit is so important that this be noted and that people understand why \nthis program, as currently configured, does hurt producers. Under the \nnew GATT market rules, access to the U.S. market has increased. Now, in \nthe past, we could maintain a higher price in the world market because \nwe had a protected market, because we not only restricted producers' \nability to sell in the domestic market, but we restricted foreign \ncompetitors from selling under the U.S. rules.\n  Under the new GATT rules, foreign producers will gain greater access \nto the U.S. market. As that happens, it will be very difficult to \nmaintain the target prices, and the cost of the program will skyrocket. \nMembers want to do something about that.\n  Secondly--and this is perhaps the most important of all--it ought to \nbe noted--this is, I think, quoted from Government sources, but I will \nquote it because I think it is so important here: ``However, future \nimports of peanut products from Mexico under NAFTA are exempt from this \nquota.'' There are some exceptions.\n  Mr. President, what that means is, with NAFTA, we have let the \nMexicans produce peanuts and sell them into our markets. They have not \nproduced as big quantities in the past as they will in the future. They \nare rapidly expanding production in Mexico, and that will come out of \nUnited States production, because they will have access to our \nprotected market. They will have the benefit of the significantly \nhigher prices, even though they are not part of our program directly.\n  What is happening right now is processors of peanuts are trying to \ndecide as to whether they pick up their processing equipment and move \nit to Mexico. If they do, they accommodate the vast expansion of \ncompetition for us in Mexico, and incidentally, they reduce our ability \nto process and maintain an industry here in the States.\n  So whether we want to deal with this or not, we are being forced to. \nHaving signed the trade agreement under NAFTA, we have new competition \nin Mexico, and that Mexican competition can produce peanuts at world \nprices, and those prices can dramatically undercut what we have in this \nprogram. Unless we act to change the program, we will drive much of \nthis industry overseas.\n  It is a shame because American farmers are the best in the world. \nThey are the most efficient, productive, and creative, and they are \nsome of the hardest working people anywhere on the globe. To lose an \nindustry that we do not have to lose because we cling to an out-of-\ndate, above-market-price program would be a tragedy; it would be a \ntragedy for the good farmers and for this country's competitiveness.\n  Mr. President, I am sensitive to the argument that was so eloquently \nmade by the Senators from Georgia and Alabama and other Members who \nhave spoken on the floor about this. I think they are right when they \nsay the best way to draft these reforms is in committee. I do not want \nthis moment to pass without having this body go on record that we ought \nto at least address that and that it ought to be part of the \nconsideration of a new farm bill.\n  So, Mr. President, at this point, in an effort to move the body \nforward, I would like to offer for consideration for the Senate a \ncompromise that I believe has the approval of Members on both sides, \nwhich assigns this task of redrafting this area to the committee. But \nit puts the Senate on record of doing exactly what this original \namendment was intended to do, and that is to add an assessment that \ngoes to the people who enjoy the benefit of the program, have that \nassessment be big enough to cover the administrative costs.\n  Having stated clearly in this bill that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat we should do that, I think it gives a strong foundation for the \nauthorizing committee to do just that when they reauthorize this \nprogram and reconsider the changes that need to be made in it.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2688, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``It is the Sense of the Senate that the current \n     nonrefundable marketing assessment for the peanut program \n     should be amended to direct that the current assessment is \n     utilized in a manner to help defray the cost of the peanut \n     program, particularly to cover all administrative costs of \n     the peanut program, including the salaries and expenses of \n     Department of Agriculture employees who carry out the price \n     support or production adjustment program for peanuts.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I believe this amendment is approved by both sides. It \nsays this:\n\n       It is a sense of the Senate that the current nonrefundable \n     marketing assessment for the \n\n[[Page S13809]]\n     peanut program should be amended to direct that the current assessment \n     is utilized in a manner to help defray the cost of the peanut \n     program, particularly to cover all administrative costs of \n     the peanut program, including the salaries and expenses of \n     the Department of Agriculture employees who carried out the \n     price support or production adjustment program for peanuts.\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. I thank him for his original \namendment, which I think is in the right direction, I think, reducing \nthis cost to the Government. He recognizes this as someone who sees \nthis program as really a flawed, but futilely flawed program--not \nfatally, but futilely, as in ``futilism.'' He recognizes this is a much \nbigger issue than just the administrative costs. We are talking about \nliterally millions or more dollars to the consumers of America in \npaying more for peanuts.\n  I think the key point, I think that Members who may not be familiar \nwith the peanut program, the key point that the Senator from Colorado \npointed out is that this system is doomed to fail. It cannot be \nsustained because of what is going to happen with NAFTA and with other \ntrade agreements.\n  Mexico is in the process right now of planting more peanuts. They \ncome into this country without the restrictions in place. They are \ngoing to replace growers here in this country, which means of course \nthat we will be paying more money here at the Federal level to maintain \nthat target price.\n  I think it is a system that if you talk to peanut growers and people \nwho hold the quotas, as the Senator from Colorado pointed out, 70 \npercent of the quotas are held by people who do not grow peanuts.\n  It is a feudal system. You do not have to grow peanuts to own these \nquotas. To allow you to grow peanuts you basically have this passed \ndown from your grandfather or great-grandfather. You hold and you \ncollect all this money for someone else to grow peanuts on their land.\n  As I said, feudal system best describes it. Seventy percent are owned \nby people who do not farm the land. They are the ones getting rich on \nthis program. They are the ones making all the money on this program. \nThey are the ones running the ads that say, boy, you cannot touch the \npeanut program. I would not either.\n  I have a lot of peanut quota holders in Pennsylvania who do not like \nwhat I am doing, but I have a lot of jobs leaving the State of \nPennsylvania from Hershey's, which just moved a plant to Mexico because \nof the sugar problem, which is another thing we need to talk about.\n  Peanuts is another problem. We lost jobs to Canada and other places \nin the confection industry, and by the hundreds.\n  If we were benefiting small farmers who are trying to grow their \npatch, that is one thing, but these are large quota interest holders \nwho simply are making money because their granddaddy was around at the \ntime they were passing them out.\n  I think that is not what our tax dollars should be used for. It is \ndestroying the market. It is costing consumers literally billions of \ndollars a year.\n  The Senator had a very modest amendment. I agree with his \nmodification in the sense that this should be worked out by the \nAgriculture Committee. It should be worked out in the reconciliation \nbill and in the farm bill.\n  We had meetings, as I am sure the Senator from Colorado did, today we \nhad meetings in the Agriculture Committee on the Republican side and we \nwill continue to meet to see if we can work out something to address \nthis program, save the taxpayers' dollars and save the consumer money \nin peanut butter costs downstream.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Colorado who has really been a stalwart \non this issue, who has been out here fighting this battle. I am a \nrecent joiner of his forces. I want to congratulate him for coming to \nthe floor, offering this amendment, keeping the pressure on the \ncommittee, keeping us moving forward so we can get rid of this system \nwhich is simply indefensible under any kind of budget restrictions.\n  I yield back the time of the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. It is my understanding Senator Domenici desires to speak. \nSince this was worked out I did not intend to make a speech, but there \nhave been certain statements that I do not want to leave that are \nerroneous.\n  No. 1, the peanut program does not have a target price and does not \nhave a subsidy. It has a loan rate. Historically, the loan rate has \nevery year been substantially lower than the price paid to the peanut \nfarmer for his peanuts.\n  Historically over 10 years, the peanut program has averaged only $13 \nmillion a year in cost to the U.S. Government. It varies as to what may \nhappen at various times.\n  In regard to the savings of the consumer, there was a GAO study that \nindicated that there could be savings to the first purchaser of \npeanuts.\n  In testimony before the Agriculture Committee of the House the GAO \nrepresentative who was there testifying made a distinction between the \nfirst purchaser and the final consumer, and he went on to say that in \nthe study they contacted the manufacturers and asked them, ``Will the \nsavings be passed on to the consumer?'' The answer was ``Well, we may \ndevelop new products and have a different promotional program.''\n  There have been many studies over the years that have shown that as \nthe price of peanuts goes up and down they are not passed on to the \nconsumer. Purdue University has conducted two such studies and have \ntraced over the history what the price has been.\n  I just wanted to make those statements. I can go into much more \ndetail and make a further statement and speech but I see Senator \nDomenici is on the floor.\n  I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might ask that chairman of the \ncommittee, as I understand it, Senator Brown has changed his amendment \nto a sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct. Senator Brown is on the floor \nand has modified his amendment substantially.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to Senator Brown, it is a \nlittle known fact that New Mexico is a peanut grower. We all know about \nthe South, but New Mexico grows a rare peanut called Valencia peanuts. \nThey are a little bit different than peanuts grown in your State, \nSenator Heflin, or in Georgia.\n  Our program does not cost any money, and I understand that \nreconciliation is going to look at all the farm bill and all the \ncommodity programs and in the process they will look at the peanut \nprogram, which would include New Mexico and a piece of Texas of the \nValencia peanuts, and the industry is committed to a program that has \nno cost to the Federal Treasury.\n  As I understand it, Senator Heflin, that is not just what the \nValencia peanut industry is saying but the peanut industry at large is \ncommitted to working out a bill in reconciliation with no cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  That is all I wanted to say. With that interpretation I assume we are \nnot seriously opposed to this sense-of-the-Senate proposal that the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado offers.\n  I want to thank the Senator for leaving the issue--the real issue of \nhow they go about doing that--to the Committee on Agriculture in the \nReconciliation Act.\n  I was going to argue on your first amendment that you were not really \nsaving money but I do not want to do that now. The truth of the matter \nis you would not have been, so maybe I will just say it.\n  Actually, unless you were willing to reduce the caps, that money \nwould be spent by some other committee somewhere else. I was going to \nmake that point, but you were judicious and amended it before we had to \ncome down and do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor being enlightened, and I hope he has not given up on that task \nbecause I suspect that effort will be needed again.\n  I simply add to the Record, Mr. President, information included by \nthe Congressional Research Service on this subject because we talked \nabout the costs of the program.\n  CRS reports that in 1983 to 1986 the program averaged a cost of $9.9 \nmillion a year; in the periods of 1987 to 1991 the program averaged a \ncost of $15.5 million; more than a 50-percent increase; \n\n[[Page S13810]]\nthe period of 1992 to 1996, the program averaged $54.8 million a year, \nwhich is 3.5 times what it was in the previous period.\n  As we have noted, the program last year appears to be in the \nneighborhood of $120 million. CRS says $119.5 million is their \nestimate. That is not a finalized figure.\n  Mr. President, the other point that I think is important, that the \nreal cost of this program is not what it costs the taxpayers, which is \nsignificant and growing dramatically. It is what it costs the consumers \nof America, which CRS indicates may be in the neighborhood of $300 \nmillion to $500 million a year.\n  It is clear this is an area that merits reform. I appreciate my \ncolleagues pointing out the proper role of the authorizing committee \nhere. I hope we will make progress on it. Since we have reached \nagreement on the revised amendment, I believe Members will be \ncomfortable in voting on this by voice. A rollcall vote will not be \nnecessary.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a \nresponse, the amendment now is acceptable, I am told, on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I understand, too, that the yeas and nays had been ordered but that \nwe can vitiate the yeas and nays and no rollcall vote would be \nnecessary.\n  If there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest to Senators who have time under the agreement \nif we yield back all time we can vote on the amendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield such time as I have.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I yield back what time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, and no one \nwishing to speak on this amendment, the question now occurs on the \nBrown amendment, No. 2688, as modified, to the committee amendment on \npage 83, line 4 of the bill.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2688), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Vote On Committee Amendment, On Page 83, Line 4 Through Line 2, Page \n                             84, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the committee \namendment, as amended.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the committee \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13804-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13810-S13812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PRIME TIME TELEVISION--THE NEW FALL TV PROGRAM LINEUP\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to bring the attention of the \nSenate an article entitled ``Sex and Violence on TV'' from the most \nrecent issue of U.S. News & World Report--September 11, 1995. The \narticle reviews television network programming for the upcoming fall TV \nseason. I am particularly troubled by the direction of the networks. \nThe lead in the article describes the season as ``to hell with kids--\nthat must be the motto of the new fall TV season.'' The article \nsuggests that the family viewing hour--the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. period--is \ndead, and that sex, vulgarity and violence rules prime time.\n  Tom Shales in his review this weekend of fall television network \nprogramming in the Washington Post makes similar observations. He \nremarked, ``vulgarity is on the rise. Sitcom writers make big bucks \ncoming up with cheap laughs. Buried in the dust of competition is the \nold family viewing concept that made the 8 p.m. hour--7 p.m. on \nSundays--a haven from adult themes and language.''\n  As my colleagues are aware, earlier this summer, the Senate and House \nof Representatives debated at length the issue of television violence \nas part of the telecommunications bill, S. 652 and H.R. 1555. Both the \nHouse and Senate bills include provisions requiring that new television \nsets be equipped with technology to permit parents to block television \nprogramming with violent, sexual or other objectionable content. The \nmeasure also encourages the development of a voluntary rating system by \nthe television industry, a system that would enable parents to make \ninformed decisions about television viewing for their children.\n  Mr. President, with all the attention focused on television violence \nover the past few months--including a recent pledge by my distinguished \ncolleague senator Robert Dole to clean up television and movies--it is \nastonishing that television networks are promoting a fall TV season \nthat demonstrates so much disregard for the wishes of American families \nand the clear majority of the House and Senate. American people want \ntelevision networks to develop programming with considerably less \nviolence, sexual and indecent content. The new fall television schedule \nis a tragedy.\n  Time and time again, I, and members of the Citizens Task Force on \nTelevision Violence have been told by the media that Government \nintervention to reduce violent and objectionable television programming \nis not necessary. We were assured that the media will act responsibly. \nThe networks argue that the technology for parents to block programming \nand a rating system for programming are not necessary.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. News & World Report's review of fall TV \nprogramming suggests otherwise. It is regrettable that the networks are \ndemonstrating such disregard for the wishes of American families. The \nUCLA Center for Communications Policy's Network Violence Study released \nearlier today confirms some of these continuing concerns regarding \nviolent programming. The UCLA study points out that while some \nprogramming shows improvement in the overall reduction of violence, the \nstudy identified serious problems regarding the level of violence in \ntheatrical films on television, on-air promotions, children's \ntelevision and the lack of parental advisories. I urge the American \npublic to let their Senators and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives know their views on programming for the upcoming fall \nTV season, and to express strong support for the v-chip legislation \nwhen it is considered by the House-Senate Conference on the \ntelecommunications bill. I ask unanimous consent Mr. President, that \nthe text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report be printed in \nthe Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just want to conclude by saying the \nevidence is, really, overwhelming. I have been working on this issue \nfor 5 years. I have put together a national coalition that involves \nchurch groups, law enforcement, all of the children's advocacy groups, \nthe principals of America, the teachers, the National Education \nAssociation, group after group after group who have said, ``Enough is \nenough. Let us reduce the mindless, repetitive violence that is on \ntelevision. Let us reduce that objectionable sexual content. Let us \nhave television realize the promise that it offers the American people, \nto uplift, to educate, to inform.'' That is what our society \ndesperately needs.\n  And over and over the networks have told us, ``Be patient, just wait. \nWe are going to act.''\n  Now, we have the fall schedule and we can see how hollow those \npromises are. Over and over we have been told, ``We are going to do \nbetter. We are going to reduce the level of violence. We are going to \nreduce other objectionable content.''\n  Mr. President, they have not kept the promise. I call on my \ncolleagues to stand fast. We passed here, by 73 to 26, the ``choice \nchips'' that will permit parents to decide what their children are \nexposed to. That is the appropriate response.\n  I, once again, call on the networks to take action to keep their \npromises and, hopefully, to support this legislation that will provide \n``choice chips'' in new television sets so parents can choose; \n\n[[Page S13811]]\nso parents can decide what their children are exposed to.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From U.S. News & World Report, September 11, 1995]\n\n                         Sex and Violence on TV\n\n                            (By Marc Silver)\n\n       The family hour is gone. There's still a splattering of \n     guts in prime time, but the story of the fall lineup is the \n     rise of sex. Will the networks ever wise up?\n       To hell with kids--that must be the motto of the new fall \n     TV season. You want proof? Look at the network lineups. Many \n     of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8 p.m.-to-9 p.m. \n     hour have gone to the TV graveyard, replaced by racier fare \n     like ``Cybill'' and ``Roseanne.'' As a Wall Street Journal \n     news story put it in a recent headline, ``It's 8 p.m. Your \n     Kids Are Watching Sex on TV.''\n       Vulgarity also rules in the first hour of prime time. In \n     ``Bless This House,'' an 8 p.m. CBS show starring shock comic \n     Andrew Clay as a blue-collar dad, the mom accuses her 12-\n     year-old daughter of ``spend[ing] all morning staring at your \n     little hooters.'' Chatting with a promiscuous chum who's said \n     to be so eager for sex that she'd ``do it on the coffee \n     table,'' the mother wonders, ``My God, don't you ever get \n     your period?''\n       Say goodbye to the ``family hour,'' the 8 p.m.-to-9 p.m. \n     period ABC, CBS and NBC once reserved for you and the kids, \n     and say hello to the Fox in the henhouse. The success of \n     sexually frank programs like the Fox network's ``Beverly \n     Hills 90210'' at 8 p.m. has uncorked a wave of me-tooism in \n     the quest for a young (but not too young), hip and urban \n     audience. As Alan Sternfeld, an ABC senior vice president, \n     says of shifting ``Roseanne'' and ``Ellen'' to 8 p.m.: ``We \n     get reimbursed by advertisers when we deliver adults 18 to \n     49.''\n       Despite the outcry over TV violence this year, it is the \n     rise of sex on TV that is the real story of the fall lineup. \n     Some media critics are pointing to moralistic plots on shows \n     like ``ER,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Seinfeld'' as evidence that \n     network TV is becoming as wholesome and earnest as The Little \n     Engine That Could. But that's just a small part of what's \n     happening in prime time.\n       ``A lot of Hollywood says, `If you criticize us about \n     violence, then let's have some good, wholesome sex at 8 \n     p.m.,''' says Lionel Chetwynd, a prominent writer, director \n     and producer who has worked in TV for 20 years. ``The idea \n     that family viewing includes some sense of sexual propriety \n     doesn't seem to have sunk into the Hollywood community.''\n       Chetwynd sees a defensive reaction from his colleagues. \n     They complain that they're an easy target, and also believe \n     that only someone on the far right could possibly be upset by \n     sex on TV. But that's not so. Plenty of ``lifestyle \n     conservatives''--a term coined by film critic Michael \n     Medved--are fed-up viewers despite their moderate or liberal \n     political views.\n       Those lifestyle conservatives have plenty to grouse about. \n     A groundbreaking study by Monique Ward, a postdoctoral fellow \n     in education at the University of California at Los Angeles, \n     tracks and analyzes sexual content in the 1992-93 prime-time \n     shows most popular among youngsters 2 to 12 and 12 to 17. On \n     average, 29 percent of all interactions involved sex talk of \n     some kind. ``Blossom'' at 58 percent and ``Martin'' at 49 \n     percent led the pack. Sex is most often depicted as a \n     competition, a way to define masculinity and an ``exciting \n     amusement for people of all ages,'' Ward found. Looks are \n     everything. In an episode of ``Blossom,'' a teenager's \n     grandfather says of a blind date: ``In case she's a dog, I \n     can fake a heart attack.'' Ward's study will appear in the \n     October Journal of Youth and Adolescence.\n       Then there's soap-opera sex, talk-show sex chatter, sex \n     crimes on the news--how do kids process all that? Little \n     academic work has been done in this area. Yet, researchers \n     are moving ahead gingerly, and certain conclusions are \n     emerging. In a study of how middleclass teenage girls react \n     to sex in the media, Jane Brown, a professor in the school of \n     journalism and mass communications at the University of North \n     Carolina at Chapel Hill, identified three types of viewers: \n     sexually inexperienced teens who find the whole thing \n     ``disgusting'': ``intrigued'' girls who ``suck it up,'' \n     buying into the TV sex fantasy, and ``critics,'' who tear \n     irresponsible sexual messages to shreds. ``but the media are \n     so compelling and so filled with sex, it's hard for any kid, \n     even a critic, to resist,'' says Brown. ``I think of the \n     media as our true sex educators.''\n       Kids agree. This year, Children Now, an Oakland, Calif., \n     advocacy group, polled 750 children ages 10 to 16. Six out of \n     10 said sex on TV sways kids to have sex at too young an age. \n     Some shows to promote teenage abstinence or conversations \n     about the consequences of sex, but that's the exception. One \n     suggestion endorsed by Douglas Besharov, a scholar at the \n     conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute: Force TV \n     honchos to show their products to their spouses, kids and \n     parents.\n       Murder at 8 p.m.--Violence also is barging into the early \n     evening this fall. Fox's ``Space: Above and Beyond,'' a 7 \n     p.m. sci-fi spatterthon, features flamethrowers, stun guns \n     and, for nostalgia buffs, a crowbar and a noose of chains. \n     ``John Grisham's The Client,'' an 8 p.m. CBS drama, serves up \n     two corpses and two bloody, on-screen murders in the first 15 \n     minutes. That's more grist for politicians on the warpath \n     about TV violence.\n       The ``V-chip'' is currently a favorite solution. Both \n     houses of Congress have supported legislation requiring that \n     new TV sets come with a chip enabling parents to block \n     violent programs. The technology is a snap. Deciding which \n     shows deserve a ``V'' for violence is the problem. The \n     networks aren't eager to cooperate. A government committee \n     raises the specter of censorship, along with thorny \n     questions--for example, would violence in ``M*A*S*H'' be in \n     the same category as shootings in ``The Untouchables''?\n       In any event, the V-chip is a few years away. In the \n     interim, children will see thousands of violent acts on TV. A \n     study by the American Psychological Association figures that \n     the typical child, watching 27 hours of TV a week, will view \n     8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence from age 3 to age \n     12. (Of course, that wouldn't apply to fans of ``Mister \n     Rogers' Neighborhood'' or sitcom viewers.)\n       An upcoming report by the UCLA Center for Communication \n     Policy sees some improvements on the TV-violence front. ``The \n     networks know what the public is looking for,'' says Jeffrey \n     Cole, director of the center, which was hired by the networks \n     to conduct what is arguably the most thorough review ever of \n     violence in prime-time media. Looking at nearly 3,000 hours \n     of television, the report concludes the overall level of \n     violence is dropping.\n       Bloody promos.--But gratuitous violence is on the rise. \n     ``All violence is not equal,'' says Cole. ``Context is \n     everything, and in some instances, violence is unwarranted \n     and not helpful to the plot. Some movies and made-for-TV \n     movies about crime are just vehicles for violence.'' Promos \n     for violent shows are especially prone to ``condensed \n     violence'' with no context.\n       Hollywood isn't convinced that media mayhem inspires the \n     real thing. ``When I was little, I went to the movies every \n     week and saw violent cartoons and two or three Westerns in \n     which the entire Sioux nation was massacred by the cavalry,'' \n     recalls Steven Bochco, creator of ``NYPD Blue.'' ``I never \n     had a question that what I was watching was make-believe, \n     because I was raised by a family that gave me a moral \n     compass.''\n       On the other side of the debate stand 1,000-plus studies \n     establishing links between TV violence and the way people \n     behave in real life. In a 1970 study at Pennsylvania State \n     University, psychologist Aletha Huston and a colleague \n     regularly showed cartoons of fist-flying superheroes to one \n     group of 4-year-olds and bland fare to another. Among kids in \n     both groups known to be above average in aggressive behavior, \n     those who saw the action heroes were more likely to hit and \n     throw things after watching. Nor do the effects of TV \n     violence fade after childhood. Psychologist Leonard Eron of \n     the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research \n     has tracked 650 New York children from 1960 to the present, \n     looking at viewing habits and behavior. Those who watched the \n     most violent television as youngsters grew up to engage in \n     the most aggressive behavior as adults, from spouse abuse to \n     drunk driving.\n       The flaw in Bochco's argument, Eron says, is that not all \n     homes have a moral compass. Besides, no one's saying that all \n     violence is inspired by television. One estimate, based on an \n     analysis of 275 studies by George Comstock, S. I. Newshouse \n     professor of public communication at Syracuse University, is \n     that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can be \n     linked to TV. ``But wouldn't it be great if we could reduce \n     the occurrence of violence in this nation by 10 percent?'' \n     asks Eron.\n       Family fare?--Fans of family TV won't find much to cheer \n     about in the fall 1995 season. ``More channels doesn't mean \n     more choices,'' says Kathryn Montgomery of the Center for \n     Media Education, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. In \n     fact, one of the best family dramas on television, CBS's \n     ``Christy'' was canceled this spring despite a slew of \n     awards. ``Christy,'' the story of a young teacher in \n     backwoods Tennessee in 1912, had superb writing and acting--\n     and lovely lessons about life with nary an ounce of schmaltz \n     or sex, violence or swearing. The audience of about 10 \n     million weekly viewers was ``fairly substantial and intensely \n     loyal,'' says David Poltrack, executive vice president of \n     research and planning for CBS. But the young adults whom \n     advertisers crave weren't watching in force, so ``Christy'' \n     got the ax. Reruns will air on the Family Channel on \n     Saturdays at 7 p.m. starting in October.\n       Since most new network shows weren't designed with a family \n     audience in mind, Warner Bros. new WB network is trying to \n     fill the 8 to 9 p.m. void with ``family friendly'' fare. On \n     the menu this fall: a fairly clever carton called ``Steven \n     Speilberg Presents Pinky & the Brain'' on Sundays at 7 p.m., \n     about a smart lab rat trying to take over the world, and \n     supposedly wholesome sitcoms that are, in fact, generally \n     mediocre and occasionally offensive. In ``Kirk,'' the lame \n     tale of an older brother who assumes custody of three \n     siblings, the younger brother brags of peeping into a nearby \n     apartment and seeing a beautiful woman in a ``Wonderbra and \n     nothing else.'' Turns out the gal is a guy, even though he \n     has ``girl things.''\n       Raunchy family fare is nothing new. In an episode of CBS's \n     ``The Nanny,'' a returning show that pitches itself to kids \n     with promos during cartoons, the nanny comes home \n\n[[Page S13812]]\n     drunk and mistakenly stumbles into bed with her cold-ridden boss. The \n     next day, neither can recall if they had sex. ``We try to do \n     a sophisticated 8 p.m. show,'' says ``Nanny'' Co-executive \n     Producer Diane Wilk. ``We wouldn't want to put anything on \n     the air we wouldn't want our children to see.'' Counters \n     Debra Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and \n     Education Council of the United States: ``I wouldn't let my \n     10-year-old daughter watch. `The Nanny'--or practically any \n     other prime-time show--without me, so I can discuss the \n     sexual messages with her.''\n       Smart TV.--On Saturday mornings, network cynicism is \n     symbolized by ABC's canning of ``Cro,'' one of the few \n     genuinely educational cartoons around. ``Cro'' wasn't the \n     greatest show ever produced by the Children's Television \n     Workshop, creators of ``Sesame Street.'' But it managed to \n     tuck science lessons into the adventures of a prehistoric \n     tribe and did win its time slot last season. ABC says the \n     show ``underperformed.'' As ``Cro'' bowed out, an animated \n     version of the movie Dumb and Dumber joined ABC's Saturday \n     lineup. ``This is beyond irony,'' says Reed Hundt, chairman \n     of the Federal Communications Commission. ```Dumb and Dumber' \n     is a description of this decision, not just a title.''\n       PBS still has a fine roster of educational fare. But \n     ``Ghostwriter,'' a popular show for ages 6 to 11 that \n     stresses reading skills in the mysteries it weaves, will have \n     no new episodes, just reruns. Corporate money dried up for \n     the series, and two commercial networks weren't interested in \n     new episodes for Saturday mornings. ``Wishbone,'' a new PBS \n     daily series, debuting October 9 and aimed at the same age \n     group, is a strong breed. The eponymous star is a terrier who \n     imagines himself in literary works like Romeo and Juliet. The \n     dog is appealing, yet a purist might wonder if this is the \n     best way to introduce kids to great literature.\n       But ``Wishbone'' is a gem compared with Disney's new, \n     allegedly educational syndicated series ``Sing Me a Story: \n     With Belle.'' To keep costs down, Disney is recycling old \n     cartoons with new didactic voice-overs. In one episode, the \n     lesson is: Friends are good, friends are good, friends are \n     good. The live-action host is Belle, star of Beauty and the \n     Beast.\n       Nonetheless, Disney could be the salvation of family-\n     friendly television when it takes over ABC. Dean Valentine, \n     president of Walt Disney Television and Television Animation, \n     predicts the glut of adult-oriented 8 p.m. shows will provide \n     an opening for something different. ``In the next year or \n     two, the hit shows will be family programs from Disney at 8 \n     p.m.,'' he says.\n       Parents don't have to just sit and wait for better TV. \n     Public outrage can play a role in reforming the media--that's \n     why Calvin Klein decided last week to pull controversial ads \n     for jeans depicting young people in various stages of \n     undress. Then again, few have lost money being crass in the \n     vast wasteland.\n\n\n a guide to media literacy--what tv-savvy parents can do to help their \n                                  kids\n\n       As TV gets wilder and wilder, more parents are opting to \n     junk television altogether. Those not ready for this drastic \n     step can find solace in media literacy--the art of \n     deconstructing television. Schools in Canada have taught \n     media literacy for years, explaining to students that \n     programs exist to deliver an audience to advertisers, that \n     sex and violence sell and that TV news isn't all the news \n     that's fit to air--it's more likely the news that gets the \n     best ratings. American schools are just beginning to catch \n     up. Here are six key precepts for a crash course at home.\n       1. Rethink your image of TV.--Newton Minow, former chairman \n     of the Federal Communications Commission, suggests imagining \n     a stranger in your house blathering on to you and your \n     children about sex and violence all day long. No one dares \n     interrupt or tell the stranger to shut up or get out. That \n     stranger is your TV set.\n       2. Keep a diary.--Ask your kids how much TV they think they \n     watch. Then have them write down everything they watch for a \n     week. Parents might do the same. Both generations may be \n     shocked by the results. A reasonable goal for kids: two hours \n     a day. Several primers help with this and other steps: The \n     Smart Parent's Guide to Kids' TV by Milton Chen (KQED Books, \n     1994, $8.95); ``Taking Charge of Your TV,'' from the National \n     PTA and the cable-television industry (free copies from 800-\n     743-5355 or http://www.widmeyer.com/ncta/home.htm on the \n     Internet); and guides from the Center for Media Literacy \n     (call 800-226-9494 for a free catalog).\n       3. Be choosy.--You wouldn't stroll into a library and pick \n     up the first book, and you shouldn't just turn on the TV and \n     watch whatever's on. Media literacy mavens suggest choosing a \n     week's worth of programs in advance. Sorry, no channel \n     surfing.\n       4. Watch with them.--Unless parents are confident that a \n     show is safe for youngsters (rarely the case these days), \n     they should watch with their kids, then talk about \n     controversial content. Sample queries: ``Why was that the \n     lead story on the news?'' ``Could a cop really be back at \n     work a week after being shot in the chest?'' ``When the star \n     of the sitcom decided to have sex with a woman he just met, \n     should she have suggested that he use a condom?''\n       5. Just say no.--And also why--which means you first need \n     to watch the series in question. ``My daughter, who's 11, \n     wanted to see `Married . . . With Children,''' says Karen \n     Jaffe of Kidsnet, a children's media resource center in \n     Washington, D.C. ``I said no. I don't like the way the \n     parents talk to the kids or the kids talk to the parents.''\n       6. Media literacy isn't a cure-all.--No child can be \n     immunized against all the bad stuff on TV. So parents (and \n     children) need to make their objections known. Letters to the \n     local station, with a copy to the local newspapers and the \n     FCC, can carry weight, especially if you use the words feared \n     by TV executives: ``failing to serve the public interest'' \n     and ``doesn't deserve to have its license renewed.''\n\n\n                       does kids' tv need fixing?\n\n       Officials are debating whether to toughen the Children's \n     Television Act: Should they require stations to air more \n     quality kids' programming?\n       The Children's Television Act is either the last best hope \n     for children's programs or an irksome symbol of how \n     government meddles where it shouldn't. Enacted in October \n     1990, the act requires local stations to meet the \n     ``educational and informational needs of children'' to renew \n     their licenses. The act's supporters want to strengthen its \n     terms by requiring, among other things, that a specific \n     number of hours be devoted to children's programming; its \n     critics say Uncle Sam has no business regulating a local \n     station's schedule.\n       Pro:\n       Without government intervention, the television industry \n     will not produce enough quality children's programming.\n       Broadcasters must serve the public.--They use spectra owned \n     by the public and it's only right that their work benefit the \n     public interest. ``The law requires that broadcasters uphold \n     public-interest standards regardless of the share of 18-to-\n     49-year-olds that they capture for advertisers,'' said \n     Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt in a \n     recent speech.\n       Children need an advocate.--Federal courts have already \n     recognized that government has a role in protecting kids' \n     interests that extends beyond the constitutional protections \n     of free speech. One recent decision affirmed that role when \n     it upheld the FCC's regulations restricting ``indecent'' \n     programming to certain hours.\n       Broadcasters cut corners.--The children's Television Act \n     vaguely defines educational as furthering ``the positive \n     development of the child in any respect.'' Broadcasters love \n     that loophole. The Center for Media Education says some \n     station license renewal applications have listed cartoons \n     like ``Casper'' and ``GI Joe'' as educational. The definition \n     of the word educational must be firmed up so that shows \n     airing prior to 7 a.m. should not qualify and local stations \n     are required to air a certain number of hours per week.\n       Threats of regulation bring results.--When presidents \n     threaten to regulate the television industry, more \n     educational shows are produced for children. Former ABC \n     children's television chief Squire Rushnell has charted the \n     relationship: Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford both advocated \n     that there should be more educational children's programming \n     or else the government would insist on it. As a result, the \n     networks averaged almost 10 hours of such programming per \n     week by 1975. By the end of Jimmy Carter's term, in 1980, the \n     total was up to 11\\1/4\\ hours. By 1990, after Ronald Reagan's \n     tenure, it dropped to 1\\3/4\\ hours. (Broadcasters dispute \n     Rushnell's counting methods.)\n       Con:\n       While there is industry support for the Children's \n     Television Act, the free market does a good job of creating \n     quality shows without government edicts.\n       Strict regulations violate free speech.--When government \n     tells broadcasters how much children's educational television \n     they should produce and what time slots they should use for \n     such programs, the First Amendment rights of those \n     broadcasters are violated. ``It takes away the discretion of \n     the broadcasters,'' says Jeff Baumann, general counsel for \n     the National Association of Broadcasters.\n       Government cannot make children watch ``educational \n     programming.''--If TV producers have to scramble to produce \n     educational shows to fulfill a requirement, the result will \n     be a spate of mediocre programs that won't capture the \n     imagination of children.\n       Broadcasters have responded to the act.--FCC Commissioner \n     Rachelle Chong points out that since the act took effect, \n     children's educational fare has increased from about one hour \n     per week to three hours on average. She believes that \n     broadcasters are getting the message about educational fare \n     and plans to follow up with broadcasters who promise her that \n     the trend will improve. Quantitative guidelines should be \n     ``our last resort.''\n       The free market works.--Cable stations like the Disney \n     Channel, the Learning Channel and Nickelodeon and several \n     satellite and online services have all come into being to \n     serve children (though 36 percent of American homes do not \n     have cable). With new players entering the entertainment \n     business, the choices for children will only increase. ``If \n     there's a program niche there, the marketplace will find \n     it,'' says Ben Tucker, president of Retlaw Broadcasting and \n     chairman of government relations for the CBS affiliate's \n     advisory board.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am, again, glad to join my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Conrad, in commenting on the state of \ntelevision today. I do not know that the Conrad-Lieberman review of the \nfall television season will rival Siskel and Ebert's review of movies. \nBut I would say Senator Conrad and I are quite clearly saying we give \nthis fall TV season two thumbs down. That is, really, what I want to \ntalk about today.\n  Three months ago this body voted overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan \nbasis, in support of V-chip--or C-chip, C for choice--legislation that \nSenator Conrad and I initiated. With that vote we said, in effect, that \ntoo much of television in America today has become so wild, so vulgar, \nso morally repugnant that it has actually become a threat to our \nchildren, a threat from which they need protection.\n\n  As Senator Conrad indicated, there is new evidence out today on the \nextent of violence in television in the form of a study released by the \nCenter for Communication Policy at UCLA which, while it does note some \nimprovement, shows by its content that violence remains a serious \nproblem in TV programming. But the American people do not need a study \nto tell them what they already know about the state of television \ntoday. Not only does violence remain a problem, but vulgarity is \nincreasing as a problem.\n  I hear complaints whenever I go home and talk about this subject. \nPoll after poll depicts a citizenry fed up with the plummeting \nstandards of the TV industry and the constant barrage of foul \nprogramming that is being thrown at our children.\n  Mr. President, our purpose--Senator Conrad's and mine--in raising \nthis issue today is to call our colleagues' attention to the industry's \ncurious reaction to the public's anger about the state of television \nprogramming. For the fact is that the broadcast networks this week are \nembarking on a new fall season that is far more crude, more rude, and \nmore offensive than anything we have seen before.\n  That is the conclusion reached by the television critic at \nConnecticut's largest newspaper, the Hartford Courant, James Endrst, \nwho characterized a collection of new series this fall as the product \nof a ``slow but steady slide into the gutter involving the Nation's \nmost pervasive and persuasive medium.'' He went on to say that \n``viewers may be struck not so much by the shows, but by the scenes--TV \nmoments signaling an aggregate acceptance of rude language, foul \nimagery and gross behavior in the entertainment mainstream.''\n  It reminds me of Senator Moynihan's searing and profound comment that \nwe are defining deviancy down by lowering the standards of what we \naccept on television, particularly in what used to be family \nprogramming hours. We are lowering the standards of what is acceptable \nin our society, and we are sending a message to our children.\n  The Cincinnati Enquirer's editorial page bluntly talked about the \n``reeking crud of puerile trashcoms'' that are so common this fall \nseason. And Tom Shales, respected critic from the Washington Post, used \nthe words ``depraved'' and ``soul-killing'' after viewing some of the \nsame shows.\n  Mr. President, I would encourage my colleagues to watch some of these \nnew shows, new shows that are premiering this week. Those of you who \nonce may have watched ``Car 54, Where Are You?'' will probably end up \nasking ``Common Decency, Where Are You?'' on television today.\n  Mr. President, I am going to reference and read from a few lines from \nthese shows, and perhaps I should issue a warning to any children that \nmay be watching on C-SPAN or their parents to remove them from the \nsets. So I am going to quote from shows that are shown in the family \nhour on television today. It makes me feel like my childhood was a long \ntime ago, and I am sure parents are yearning again for the time when \nthey could turn on the television and not worry about being embarrassed \nto sit there with their children and hear what they hear--being worried \nabout letting their children watch without them.\n  So let me cite from some of the shows that are new to the television \nthis year.\n  ABC's ``Wilde Again'' in which the lead character advises her \nstepdaughter to ``call me what you called me when we first met, \n`Daddy's little whore'.'' Or, you can watch another ABC offering, a \nnighttime soap called ``The Monroes,'' which in its premier last week \nshowcased a woman making what we once referred to as an obscene gesture \nwith her middle finger. That may be the most fitting symbol to \ncharacterize what too much of television is saying to the American \npublic today, and also to our concerns about the degradation of our \nculture.\n  One of the most controversial new shows is a sitcom on CBS called \n``Bless This House.'' And it is controversial for good reason. On its \npremier last Monday night, the mother on the show tells her daughter \nthat she would not need her own bathroom if ``you didn't spend all \nmorning staring at your little hooters.''\n  What makes the crassness of ``Bless This House'' profoundly \ndisturbing is that the network has made a decision to air the show at 8 \np.m. during what we once thought of as the traditional family viewing \nhour.\n  Some of this stuff is obviously appropriate for adult viewing. But to \nput it on at 8 p.m. when families have been watching television is an \ninsult to those families. The networks' commitment to that concept of \nthe family television viewing hour has obviously eroded. But the fall \nseason has slipped even further, as is evident from the number of what \nI would call sophomoric sitcoms that are being aired between 8 and 9 \np.m. For instance, joining ``Bless This House'' is another CBS series, \n``Can't Hurry Love,'' which has featured in its premier episode some \ntruly outrageous language from the lead characters.\n  Mr. President, the abandonment of the family viewing hour is evident \nalso in the networks' decision to shift the number of established \nsitcoms with adult themes--such as ``Cybill'' on CBS and ``Friends'' on \nABC--to this earlier time period. Those two shows which I have watched \ncan be very engaging, very witty, and very entertaining. But they are \noften clearly not appropriate for children, particularly younger \nchildren. That is exactly the point which Senator Conrad and I are \ntrying to make.\n  I must say just as jarring as the language on new shows are some of \nthe comments from network officials to justify their programming \ndecisions. One high-ranking official at ABC said, ``The society to some \nextent, has become crasser, and we move with that.'' That is not what I \nunderstood the purpose of entertainment to be, particularly not in the \nfamily viewing hours.\n  An executive from NBC explained that ``life includes sexual \ninnuendoes.'' And another NBC official also went so far as to say, \n``It's not the role of network television to program for the children \nof America.'' But the children of America are watching those programs. \nThat official added that most small children ``are watching Nick at \nNite.'' Most of them do not watch network television in prime time.\n  If many young children are indeed watching Nickelodeon or the Disney \nChannel, it's because their parents are deeply troubled by the content \nof the major network's programming, and are searching for refuge from \nthe tawdriness that characterizes too much of television today.\n  But the reality is that many children are watching broadcast \ntelevision and these tasteless trashcoms, and the legion of perverse \nand near-pornographic talk shows that air each afternoon. No matter how \nhard parents work to monitor their children's viewing, habits, and no \nmatter how many technological gadgets they have at their disposal, many \nchildren will continue to watch these channels, and their behavior will \ncontinue to be influenced by what they see on TV.\n  Mr. President, I realize that the TV industry is not a monolith. \nThere are many responsible leaders in that community, just as there are \nsome outstanding. thought-provoking series on the major networks. Some \nof them, such as the hit ABC comedy ``Home Improvement,'' showed that \nyou can be successful and funny, without being vulgar.\n  PBS obviously continues to offer both adults and children a number of \nengaging, challenging, thought-provoking, and entertaining series. And \neven among the new network offerings NBC \n\n[[Page S13814]]\nis earning favorable reviews for a family-oriented program called \n``Minor Adjustments,'' a show about a child psychologist which will \nappear on Sunday nights.\n  But there is a clear direction that the networks are moving in. It is \nnot just Senator Conrad and I who see it. It is all or most of the TV \ncritics who have reviewed this current fall season. We have reason to \nbe deeply troubled about it. I can tell you that I am troubled about it \nnot just in my capacity as an elected representative, but as a father \nof four kids, one of whom is 7 years old. Television executives need to \nrecognize that they are part of a larger civil society to which they, \nlike we, have obligations, and that the first amendment is not a \nconstitutional hall pass that excuses them from their responsibilities \nto that civil society.\n  Mr. President, in the end, the new fall season I hope will clear up \nany doubts that our colleagues have about the need for the leadership, \nor the V-chip, and the need to help parents protect their kids as best \nthey can from the messages that television is sending them that are so \noften inconsistent with what the parents are trying to send and teach \ntheir own children.\n\n  When the telecommunications bill comes out of conference, I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in calling on the networks to acknowledge their \nresponsibility to society and the impact that they have on our society \nand to remember this important point. They are obviously private \nbusinesses, but they are using the public airwaves, and they should not \nuse those airwaves to hurt the public. The networks need to be reminded \nthat they would not exist if the public and we, their representatives, \ndid not grant them access to those airwaves.\n  No one here wants to talk about censorship. No one here wants to talk \nabout constraining the freedom of the networks to program. But the \nreality is that the networks are moving so far away from reflecting the \nvalues commonly shared by most people in this country, let alone the \ninterests of most people in this country, that they are inviting a \nreaction unless they discipline themselves.\n  Mr. President, one of television's finest moments was the Edward R. \nMurrow documentary ``Harvest of Shame,'' which was broadcast four \ndecades ago. I am afraid that the 1995 fall season might also be titled \nthe ``Harvest of Shame.'' I hope its excesses will inspire a reaction \nfrom the American people, a reaction from us, their representatives, \nhere in Congress, and ultimately a reaction from those who can do most \nto diminish this problem, and that is those who own, operate and \nprogram our television networks today.\n  I thank the Chair.

Senator McCain has an amendment dealing with education \nfunds for tribal colleges, and we are happy to consider that amendment \nat any time the Senator would like to offer it. We may very well be \nable to work that out without a rollcall vote. We hope we can.\n  I am saying all this to let Senators know that we are making \nprogress.

I should be ready to \npropose this amendment within a few minutes as soon as I get one \nadditional piece of information.\n  Would the Senator from Mississippi want me to suggest the absence of \na quorum while we talk?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand that my colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, will shortly be offering an amendment to \nprovide funds for American Indian postsecondary institutions. And I \nwant to speak very briefly in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain, as chair of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, is offering this amendment which I am proud to cosponsor which \nwill provide funds to those institutions that are authorized in the \nEquity in Educational Land Grant Status Act of 1994. That act was \nincluded as part of the Improving America's Schools Act, which we also \npassed in the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I sponsored that legislation in the last Congress to \nrectify what I saw as an unjust situation. That is, that every State \nand territory in the country had a land-grant college that received \nfunds by virtue of that designation, but none of the Indian-operated \ninstitutions were designated as land-grant institutions in spite of the \nvery important work that they did preparing people for careers in \nagriculture.\n  Mr. President, we had the anomalous situation where the University of \nthe District of Columbia was a land-grant college, but those \ninstitutions in my own State and elsewhere in the country which were \ndedicated to training Indian Americans to pursue careers in \nagriculture, as well as other careers, were not so designated. So the \nEquity in Educational Land Grant Act authorized land-grant programs for \nthe 29 tribal and Indian-serving institutions, which came to be known \nas the 1994 institutions as a result of our passage of that legislation \nlast year.\n  Those institutions serve 25,000 students from 200 different tribes. \nThe legislation then passed in October 1994 had bipartisan support and \nhad the endorsement of the Department of Agriculture, the National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land-grant Colleges, the 1890 \nhistorically black land-grant colleges and the existing land-grant \ncolleges in States with tribal colleges.\n  The appropriation that Senator McCain is calling for here would make \nfunds available for four different purposes, as I understand it, for \npayment into the endowment, which would be much-needed; a certain \namount of funding to strengthen curriculum in food and agriculture \nsciences in these 1994 institutions; a certain amount for capacity-\nbuilding grants; and, again, a separate amount for competitively \nawarded extension programs administered through the existing State \nland-grant colleges in cooperation with these 1994 institutions.\n  The offset would be from a very small amount of the dollars provided \nfor the benefit of the land-grant college system. I am persuaded that \nthese funds will be well spent. The programs that the amendment \nprovides for in all 29 colleges are roughly equal to the \n\n[[Page S13815]]\namount that the Department of Agriculture allocates to fewer than one \nof the existing land-grant colleges each year.\n  This funding will develop expertise in training to improve the \ntraining and use of over 50 million acres of Indian agricultural and \nforest land. The most recent surveys of tribal colleges found that even \nin the economically depressed areas where these schools are located, \ntribal college graduates are employed at rates of 74 to 85 percent, \ngenerating very large amounts in Federal taxes.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator McCain and his amendment. I hope it is adopted by the full \nSenate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank my friend and colleague from New \nMexico for his efforts on this issue but also many others that he and I \nhave been involved in over a period of many years on behalf of native \nAmericans. And, as he stated so eloquently, this is a matter of simple \nfairness.\n  I am pleased to note, Mr. President, that the distinguished manager, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and Senator Bumpers have agreed to a \ncompromise on this amendment which I will be proposing shortly. And, \nMr. President, the compromise amendment that I will be proposing on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Domenici, Inouye, Bingaman, and Conrad is \nfundamentally the same.\n  In the interest of time, I will make my remarks and then propose the \namendment when the paperwork is finished, making the changes that are \nbeing implemented as a result of the compromise that Senator Bumpers, \nSenator Cochran, and I have achieved.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would provide funding for extension \neducation and capacity building and programs at the 29 tribally \ncontrolled community colleges in the United States.\n  These programs were fully authorized to be funded by the Department \nof Agriculture by the Improving America's School Act of 1994. I want to \nemphasize again, Mr. President, these programs were authorized in 1994.\n  What the distinguished chairman has agreed to is that we have \napproximately $4.1 million in funding for these 29 tribal-controlled \ncommunity colleges. The funds necessary to fund these efforts, of \ncourse, will be small in comparison to the approximately $855 million \nthat is provided in this bill for research and extension programs of \nthe Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service budget \nof the Department of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, the tribally controlled community colleges and \ninstitutions in America share an unfortunate fact with other tribal \norganizations in Indian country: They perform an extremely important \ntask on behalf of the poorer citizens in our country, yet they have \nbeen long ignored. While many colleges and universities in America are \nworried about protecting State and Federal funding, tribal colleges in \nIndian country are struggling to survive.\n  It is really not appropriate that while many universities continue to \nreceive this great amount of money, tribal colleges live in fear of \nlosing their accreditation due to an urgent lack of funds.\n  Recently, we have seen actions in this body that have not been \nfavorable to native Americans, as we noted in the Interior \nappropriations bill. The 29 tribal colleges in America, often called \nthe ``1994 institutions,'' due to the fact that Congress gave them \npartial status as land-grant colleges last year, are extremely \nimportant to the goal of providing access of native Americans to \neducation.\n  Many of these colleges are the only chance native Americans have to \npursue their dreams of acquiring the skills and education they so \ndesperately need to pursue their dreams. I think it is likely many \nAmericans, and perhaps many Members of Congress, are unaware of the \nimportance of tribally controlled colleges in Indian country. These \ncolleges include among the 29, the Black Feet Community College in \nBrowning, CO; the Sinte Gleska University in Rosebud, SD; the Southwest \nIndian Polytech Institute in Albuquerque, NM; and the Turtle Mountain \nCommunity College in Belcourt, ND.\n  Mr. President, there is a problem that native Americans have many \ntimes when they enter a college or university. Many of these young \npeople have spent their entire lives in remote parts of our respective \nStates, sometimes never coming in contact with more than 50 or 100 or \nat most 200 people for most of their lives, and then they are thrust \ninto a large university situation.\n  In my own State, there are two large universities of 40,000 students \neach. When a native American student goes from the very small and very \nlowly populated environment to this very large scenario, they find many \ntimes it is a culture shock which is very difficult to cope with. As a \nresult of this, the dropout rates of our large universities across the \ncountry, but also in Arizona, is extremely high, as high as 85 and 90 \npercent.\n  We find that in the tribal community colleges that the environment is \nmuch different and the success rate is dramatically improved.\n  Last year, a bipartisan coalition of Senators took note of the \nimportant work of tribally controlled colleges and the difficult \ncircumstances they face and passed legislation authorizing the \nDepartment of Agriculture to assist agriculture-related programs at \nthese schools.\n  It is very fitting for Department of Agriculture funds to be used to \nsupport native American colleges, as this amendment would achieve. \nAmerican Indian lands span over 54 million acres in the United States, \nwith 75 percent of this total being agricultural land and another 15 \npercent forestry land.\n  Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources, millions of acres of these \npotentially productive lands lie fallow or are underutilized. The \nmodest amount of funds provided by this amendment would empower \ntribally controlled colleges and students to assist their communities \nand effectively develop their agricultural resources.\n  Obviously, I believe this amendment is a matter of equity. The \nCongress and the President joined together last year to offer new hope \nto native American schools and students but are on the verge of failing \nto deliver a promise yet again due to the lack of funds in this bill. \nTribal colleges will use very well this amount of money, and it will be \nvital to the existence of some of them.\n  Mr. President, I would like to, just for purposes of the Record, \nmention a couple of facts: The median age for American Indians residing \non reservations was 20.7 years of age in 1990, the median age for the \nentire United States was 32.9 years.\n  Fifty-seven percent of the total American Indian population was age \n24 or younger in the United States in 1990, as compared to 36 percent \nfor the mainstream population of the United States.\n  The population age group 5 to 17 comprised an average 31 percent of \nthe total American Indian population, as compared to the national \naverage of only 18 percent.\n  The American Indian population increased 38 percent between 1980 and \n1990; the total United States population increased by 9.8 percent in \nthe same period.\n  The American Indian baby boom has now reached college and employment \nage. In 1989, 31 percent of American Indians lived below the poverty \nlevel; the national poverty rate was 13 percent in that same year.\n  Unemployment rates on Indian reservations averages 45 percent, while \nsome reservations served by the tribal colleges have unemployment rates \nas high as 86 percent.\n  From a 1994 sample of 16 tribal colleges, fully 74 percent of tribal \ncollege graduates are successfully employed; 42 percent of tribal \ncollege graduates go on to continue their education in other \npostsecondary institutions.\n  Mainstream public colleges are geographically inaccessible to many \nyoung American Indians, and by depriving American Indians of an equal \neducation, we are preventing American Indians from finding adequate \nemployment opportunities.\n  Mr. President, 1,340 out of 1,575 graduates in a sample of six tribal \ncolleges were successfully employed and paid a total of $2.73 million \nannually in taxes. This is a dramatic difference than there is, \nobviously, from the average \n\n[[Page S13816]]\nnative American, and I think it proves that in the long run, educating \nIndian children is just as productive, in fact in some ways more so, \nthan as it is non-Indian children.\n  I note the presence of my friends from North Dakota and from Hawaii \non the floor. I will state, hopefully the amendment will be finished in \na few minutes so I can formally present the amendment. In the meantime, \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to commend my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, for his leadership and for his wise \ncounsel in sponsoring this amendment. I hope that the Senate will adopt \nthe amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, and others, who are supporting this initiative for working \nwith the managers to craft the language so this will be acceptable. We \nare going to recommend the approval of the amendment. It is being \ndrafted, and I understand as soon as it is, it will be offered, and we \nwill recommend that the Senate adopt it on a voice vote.\n  I know other Senators are here with other amendments. Until we have \nan opportunity to formally act on the amendment, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, for his leadership on this amendment. Senator McCain and \nSenator Inouye have been true friends of the Indian peoples of this \ncountry. Over and over and over, they have taken initiatives to try to \nmake a difference in the lives of people who desperately need that \nassistance.\n  The amendment that the Senator from Arizona has offered this \nafternoon is especially important to me, because I remember very well \nspeaking at the Turtle Mountain Community College that the Senator from \nArizona referenced. I spoke at their graduation. I wish my colleagues \ncould have been there to see the difference these community colleges \nare making. The idea that people were having a chance to make the most \nof themselves, that there was an educational opportunity, that there \nwas a chance to go beyond what had been the experience of their parents \nand their grandparents, that there was a chance to develop themselves, \nwhich had filled them with such hope and such a sense of self-worth \nthat you could see it in the eyes of the hundreds of students who were \nthere. You could see that pride when they reached out and received a \ndiploma that said they had mastered the subject matter.\n\n  Mr. President, in all of the time I have been in the U.S. Senate, \nthere has never been a time that I was as moved personally by what I \nsaw as I was on that day at graduation at the Turtle Mountain Community \nCollege. I was absolutely persuaded that this is making a difference in \nthe lives of people.\n  If you could have gone to that reservation, like I did 25 years ago, \nand seen the conditions there and seen the difference that community \ncollege is making today, it is so dramatic that it is almost hard to \nbelieve you are in the same place. They now have several industries \nthat are at work, that are producing goods for the military of this \ncountry that are second to none. Their tribal industry built the water \ntrailers used in Desert Storm, and the Army says they are the finest \nwater trailers they have ever had, and they were absolutely critical in \nthat conflict. They were made by people who were the graduates of that \ncommunity college. It is precisely the kind of thing we ought to be \ndoing.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership and initiative.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, concerning the \nwater trailers, were they constructed by the tribal authority?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The tribal industries had built the water trailers that \nwere used in Desert Storm.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What kind of an impact does that have on the tribal \neconomy?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very dramatic because their contracts run in the \ntens of millions of dollars a year. It has made a dramatic difference \nto the economy of that reservation. I might say to my colleague, not \nonly has that industry made a difference, they have also--this is very \ninteresting--formed a computer company. That computer company now does \nthe work for the Treasury Department. They manage the computer systems \nof the U.S. Treasury Department. They have done a first-class job. They \nemploy literally hundreds of people in doing that service, and they \nhave done a superb job, by the way, an absolutely superb job, and they \nare graduates of that particular community college.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, would they be able to conduct and manage both \nindustries if they did not have the community college training that is \nprovided at Turtle Mountain?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, clearly not. That community college has formed the \nbasis of providing an educated cadre of employees that make those firms \nsuccessful.\n  I say to my colleague, if you could go there and see the difference \nit is making in the self-confidence of those people, in their sense of \nself-worth, it is just a dramatic thing. Again, I thank my colleague \nfor what he has done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from North Dakota, I would consider it \na privilege to come up sometime and visit Turtle Mountain Community \nCollege, because I really believe that these 29 community colleges \nprovide what, frankly, we are not able to provide.\n  As I said earlier, at the University of Arizona and Arizona State \nUniversity, we get many native American students entering those \nschools. Those 40,000 students are probably more people than some of \nthe native American students have ever laid their eyes on in their \nlives. It is culture shock. And the dropout rate is high. As much as we \ntry to design what are almost affirmative action programs, and special \ntutoring in special areas, we have great difficulty keeping them.\n  Yet, at the community colleges--for example, Navajo Community \nCollege, the dropout rate is very small because the environment and the \nclimate is so conducive to an atmosphere where they feel a great degree \nof comfort. I think when we look at these community colleges, they play \na far greater role than, perhaps, we could ever appreciate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I could not agree more with the Senator from Arizona. If \nany colleague had a chance to go there and witness what I have seen, \nthey would conclude that this is the single best expenditure we have \nmade in the country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe I am about 1 minute from being \nable to dispose of this amendment. If my friend from Massachusetts will \nindulge me, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2694\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2694.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 25, line 14, strike ``$568,685,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$564,685,000''.\n       On page 15, line 13, after the semicolon insert \n     ``$1,450,000 for payments to the 1994 institutions pursuant \n     to Sec. 534(a)(1) of P.L. 103-382;''.\n       On page 15, line 17, strike ``$418,172,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$419,622,000''.\n       On page 18, line 2, after the semicolon, insert \n     ``$2,550,000 for payments to the 1994 institutions pursuant \n     to Sec. 534(b)(3) of P.L. 103-382;''.\n       On page 18, line 11, strike ``$437,131,000'' and insert \n     ``$439,681,000''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I support the amendment which would \nprovide $4.0 million in funding to support extension, education, and \ncapacity building programs at the 29 tribally \n\n[[Page S13817]]\ncontrolled community colleges and institutions in the United States.\n  I would also like to thank the committee for the $4.6 million already \nin the bill for the Native American Institutions Endowment Fund.\n  The amounts already provided in the bill and the amount in amendment \nwill enhance educational opportunities for Native Americans by building \neducational capacity at the 29 institutions.\n  These institutions are in urgent need for additional resources to \neducate their 20,000 students from over 200 tribes.\n  This funding would enhance student recruitment and retention for \nNative Americans, curricula development, faculty preparation, \ninstruction delivery, and scientific instrumentation for teaching.\n  The programs that are funded under this amendment are authorized \nunder last year's elementary and secondary education amendments which \nwas signed into law in October, 1994.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not believe that the amendment \nrequires any further debate or discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2694) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2695\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds for providing \n assistance to the United States Mink Export Development Council or a \n                    mink industry trade association)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Bryan, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2695.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . MINK INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1989, the Federal government, through the \n     Department of Agriculture Market Promotion Program, has \n     provided more than $13,000,000 to the Mink Export Development \n     Council for the overseas promotion of mink coats and \n     products; and\n       (2) the Department of Commerce has estimated that since \n     1989 the value of United States exports of mink products has \n     declined by more then 33 percent and total United States mink \n     production has been halved.\n       (b) Funding.--None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be used to carry out, or to pay the salaries of personnel \n     who carry out, the market promotion program established under \n     section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n     5623), in a manner that provides assistance to the United \n     States Mink Export Development Council or any mink industry \n     trade association.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, my colleague, Senator Bryan, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nSmith. I know that Senator Smith, I think, intends to speak on this \namendment. But we will not take very long at all.\n  Over the course of the last few years, we have become accustom to \nidentifying a series of programs on the floor of the Senate that most \npeople have come to a quick conclusion do not make sense, against \nalmost any standard or judgment. I think there are a lot of programs, \nwe have come to realize, that have outlived original purposes, but they \nare still staunchly defended by entrenched special interests. There are \na lot of other programs which never served the national interest at \nall, but they were initiated to satisfy a very powerful political \ninterest. This appears to be one of those programs that may even fit \nboth of those criteria, but which at this point in time does not make \nsense.\n  We had a debate earlier today about the Market Promotion Program. I \njoined as a cosponsor with colleagues in trying to do away with the \nwhole program because there is, on its face, an enormous, legitimate \nquestion as to whether or not while we are cutting so much and so in so \nmany other areas and particularly when we are making important \njudgments about the ability of the private sector to do what the \nprivate sector ought to do, there are huge concerns about the \nGovernment ponying up money to pay for what very big ongoing concerns \nought to be able to do on their own.\n\n  There is even a greater concern--just on a philosophical basis--there \nis a huge concern about why the public sector ought to be subsidizing \nprivate sector entities that are entirely profitable, but we are \nsubsidizing things that are wholly within the mainstream of the normal \ncommercial business.\n  There is a second question about why we ought to do that at a moment \nwhen we are asking a whole lot of Americans to give up things.\n  So I am particularly asking my colleagues to think about a component, \none component, of the Market Promotion Program which is the money that \nwe pay to the Mink Export Development Council.\n  No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, it would seem to \nme that we ought to be able to reach the common sense rational \nconclusion that for the United States to be asking taxpayers to \nsubsidize the sale of mink abroad does not meet any rational test.\n  Since 1989, we have spent $13.2 million for overseas promotions of \nminks. We ought to stop it now. We ought to signal to the country that \nwe are prepared to stop it now.\n  That is an average, and it averages because it is different each \nyear, about $2 million a year, of hard-earned taxpayers' money that \ngoes to promote foreign fashion shows and advertising. It is precisely \nthis kind of special interest that most Americans are saying, when are \nyou going to cut out this nonsense?\n  We are about to say a teenaged mother is not going to be able to get \nchild care paid for, for a certain amount when she goes to work, but we \ncan pay $2 million to a company that makes a profit in order to help \nthem promote mink sales abroad.\n  We will tell an elderly couple that we are cutting Medicare but we \nare going to keep the mink subsidy so this profitable company can sell \nmink.\n  We are going to tell a college student we have cut back on the Pell \ngrants but we are not going to cut back on the mink subsidy.\n  We are going to tell a child we are not going to have Head Start but \nwe are not going to cut back on the mink subsidy.\n  I think the arguments are very obvious and I do not need to belabor \nthem.\n  I will share with my colleagues an advertisement which shows what \nthis money is going to.\n  Here is money spent by the council on the sale of mink. This is in a \nJapanese magazine. It is in Japanese. I might add, nowhere does it say \nanything about America, or American mink or anything like that. It just \nsays buy the mink.\n  Here is the translation: ``Announcing the newest and best mink \ncollection. Excellent material and design. A step above the rest. With \nour pride we will provide you with a unique opportunity to upgrade your \npersonal style.''\n  That is it. That is what the taxpayers of America are paying for.\n  Now, of the $13 million that we spent in the last few years, 90 \npercent of it has gone to three companies. One of those companies is a \nsubsidiary of a large foreign-owned corporation, and every American \nought to be outraged by that.\n  The two principal recipients of this largess are very large companies \nwith significant revenues who simply do not need the average taxpayers \nof America giving them money to subsidize a foreign fashion show.\n  Mr. President, let me point to these two companies. From 1990 to \n1994, Hudson Bay's North America Fur and American Legends received \n$11,840,866 during that period. North American Fur has revenues of $49 \nmillion and it is affiliated with a Canadian conglomerate that has \n53,200 employees and $3.9 billion in sales. \n\n[[Page S13818]]\n\n  This advertisement, this program, speaks for themselves. At a time of \nchange in Washington this program ought to be included in that change. \nI hope my colleagues will join the House of Representatives who voted \noverwhelmingly to get rid of this ridiculous subsidy.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my \ncolleague, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This is an amendment that is necessary. It should be so obvious, \nconsidering the types of debate we have been having about cuts and \nreductions in spending and balancing the budget.\n  I have always voted against market promotion programs but some like \nto refer to it as ``corporate welfare.'' I am satisfied with simply \ncalling it a costly program that frankly does not work.\n  That is really the issue here. If you are going to be providing \nsubsidies, it ought to be accomplishing something, if you take a \nposition that subsidies are necessary.\n  The amendment that passed the House focuses on one particularly \ndisturbing use of Federal tax dollars which the Senator from \nMassachusetts has outlined. That is a $2 million subsidy for the Mink \nExport Development Council.\n  I came in late and I apologize to the Senator from Massachusetts, I \ndo not know if he got into the amendment specifically in terms of the \nlanguage.\n  I will read that amendment verbatim, so we know exactly what it is \nthat we are voting on. A virtually identical amendment passed the House \nby a vote of 232-160.\n  It is very interesting, the findings in the amendment. This is right \nout of the House of Representatives amendment:\n\n       (a) Findings, (1) since 1989, the Federal Government \n     through the Department of Agriculture Market Promotion \n     Program, has provided more than $13 million to the Mink \n     Export Development Council for the overseas promotion of mink \n     coats and products; and\n       (2), the Department of Commerce has estimated that since \n     1989 the value of the United States exports of mink products \n     has declined by more than 33 percent and total U.S. mink \n     production has been halved.\n\n  The third finding is in the area of funding.\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     carry out, or pay the salaries of personnel who carry out the \n     market promotion program established under section 203 of the \n     Agriculture Trade Act . . . in a manner that provides \n     assistance to the United States Mink Export Development \n     Council or any mink industry trade association.\n\n  Mr. President, if I had my preference I would zero out the entire MPP \nprogram. We do not need it. That is very obvious. That is not really \nwhat the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about here.\n  What we are saying is if we are going to continue to fund this \nprogram, do not use it to subsidize the mink industry. Since 1989 this \nprogram, as I indicated in the findings of the amendment, has funneled \nnearly $13 million into the pockets of mink producers.\n  What are the funds being used for? What is the use of these funds? \nWell, they put on fashion shows for mink coats in Europe. I am sure \nthat people who work hard for a living every day trying to make ends \nmeet are very thrilled about that, paying their tax dollars.\n  They take out advertisements to promote these shows. That is what \nsome of the money is being used for.\n  Who is paying for that? Who is paying for it? It is not you and me. \nIt is probably not even our children. It is our grandchildren and their \ngrandchildren. They will pay for these fashion shows. They will pay for \nall of that interest that accumulates on the money we borrow to pay for \nthe mink ads. That is who is going to pay, Mr. President.\n\n  So, some of my colleagues might say, what the heck is $2 million? \nThat is nothing, $2 million.\n  I guess when you are talking about trillions it probably is nothing. \nBut we borrow money at about 7 or 8 percent. Let us say 7 percent. So 7 \npercent of $2 million is $140,000 in interest on that $2 million we are \nspending on this subsidy. Talk about borrowing $2 million, not just 1 \nyear, not just this year, every year, year after year after year, \npaying it all back with interest.\n  As I said many times in speaking about some of the spending in this \nplace, there is not a big fund sitting in the Treasury Department that \nhas a surplus in it. We have a big debt and a big deficit. So we are \nborrowing this $2 million from hard-working men and women across this \ncountry who are trying to meet their child care responsibilities, maybe \nsomebody on Medicare who really needs the money who is going to see a \ncut in Medicare, and we are going to fund $2 million in mink subsidies \nfor mink coats and advertisements in Europe. It is a wasteful, \nridiculous and, frankly, embarrassing spending program. I commend the \nSenator from Massachusetts for bringing it here to the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n  To fully understand how reprehensible this program is, there is \nanother side to it. Some may not choose to get into it. It is the whole \nissue of the inhumane manner in which these animals are treated.\n  Some might say the funding is paramount, and it is. But I think, \nalso, you have to look at this other issue. I would like to point it \nout. If it gets another vote and that makes a difference, then I am \nmore than happy to point it out.\n  There are a couple of letters. The ASPCA, in a letter to me dated \nAugust 28 this year, said:\n\n       [They were] surprised to learn that the mink industry \n     receives such a subsidy at all. Mink-rearing practices are \n     extremely cruel. The animals often die by suffocation with \n     hot, unfiltered carbon monoxide from motor vehicles, or are \n     killed by lethal injection of the pesticide Black Leaf 40, \n     diluted with rubbing alcohol. These wild animals are raised \n     in small cages and exhibit classic signs of serious stress \n     such as constant pacing, throwing themselves against the \n     sides of the cage walls, and self-mutilation.\n\n  So I think that is an issue that may be of interest to some, the fact \nwhen you wear that coat you are participating in that cruelty and you \nare also spending a lot of hard-earned taxpayer dollars.\n  So another letter, which came to me from Wayne Pacelle, Vice \nPresident of Government Affairs of the Humane Society of the United \nStates, in which he said:\n\n       The mink subsidy is not providing a good return on \n     investment. While the taxpayer subsidy to the mink industry \n     has increased by 20 percent over the last 5 years, total U.S. \n     exports of mink pelts have declined by 35 percent.\n\n  We are not getting any return on the investment we are making. So the \nbottom line is, it is inhumane to the animals, No. 1. No. 2, it is \ncosting taxpayers a lot of money they should not be asked to spend, \nunder these difficult budget times.\n  We ought to respect the fact that this money belongs to the people of \nthe United States of America. It belongs to the taxpayers. We are not \nrespecting that. The mink subsidy is not only opposed by the ASPCA and \nother animal rights groups, it is opposed by the National Taxpayers \nUnion, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, the Heritage Foundation, and the Competitive \nEnterprise Institute--liberals, conservatives, both sides of the \npolitical agenda; pro-business, pro-labor; Democrats, Republicans. All \nare opposed to a very wasteful program.\n  In fact, just this morning--I think the Senator from Massachusetts \nmay have referred to it--the Washington Post ran an excellent article \nabout this mink marketing program. Just a couple of paragraphs from \nthat article in today's Washington post. The lead story by Guy \nGugliotta:\n\n       Let's face it. At a time when Congress is talking about \n     cutting off welfare mothers, student loans and low-income \n     housing, it is pretty hard to argue that the nation's few \n     hundred mink ranchers need a $2 million federal subsidy.\n\n  You cannot really say it much better than that:\n\n       It just looks bad for the feds to be paying for overseas \n     advertising and fashion shows to promote the only item on \n     Earth that blends naturally with diamonds and a Cadillac \n     limo.\n\n  That really is not the image that I want to have as a Member of this \nSenate and it is wrong. I do not think we ought to be promoting it.\n  People just are not interested, frankly, anyway, for the most part, \nin wearing mink. That is why the exports have gone down. You can do all \nthe marketing in the world, but if people do not like the product they \nare not going to buy it.\n  So, if we decided to start pumping millions of Federal tax dollars \ninto \n\n[[Page S13819]]\nmarketing zoot suits next, would people start buying them? I doubt it. \nBut probably somebody around here might think up a Federal subsidy for \nzoot suits and probably would make an attempt to get it passed, if they \nmade zoot suits in their State. But they are not in fashion. Frankly, \nmink coats are not in fashion anymore, either.\n  Where mink coats were once seen as a status symbol, now they are a \nsymbol of cruelty. And, in addition, now, because we know they are \nbeing subsidized so extensively by the taxpayers, they are a symbol of \nGovernment waste. People are not interested in either one.\n  Over in the House, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, they voted \nto eliminate the mink subsidy. It was an easy decision. It was \nlopsided.\n  Yet here they tell me the vote is close. It is an easy decision for \nme. How can we tell men and women serving their country that we cannot \nafford to keep their military base open but we can toss away $2 million \nfor overseas fashion shows? Or how do we tell a young man or young \nwoman serving in some faraway country--maybe in Bosnia, in the very \nnear future--at a recruit pay, basic pay, some of them on food stamps; \nwe are going to tell them that we are going to fund the mink subsidy \nbecause that is more important than them?\n  Will you tell the thousands of other taxpaying businessmen and women \nwho have never received a nickel of Government subsidy? I ask my \ncolleagues to just think a little bit about the people in your State, \nbusiness men and women whom you have run into in the past few years as \nyou have campaigned or gone around meeting your constituents. Think \nabout them: Barbers, construction workers, union guys, business guys. \nThey work hard. Think about them. Do you think they would support this \nsubsidy? You ought to ask them. Give them a call and ask them, if they \nsupport this kind of subsidy; that they think their dollars should go \nfor this?\n  They have to save or even borrow money to pay college expenses or to \nperhaps promote their business, perhaps to buy a car, or even the basic \nessentials of life. Maybe they cannot afford to do that. So maybe they \njust go around and put a leaflet on the car promoting their business. I \ncould find hundreds of ways to use the $2 million subsidies and so \ncould they. Every one of them--think about it; $2 million. That is not \nhow the free market works.\n  Most successful businessmen fully understand it. The brilliance of \nthe competitive marketplace is if you provide a service that people \nwant for a decent price there is no limit to your success. At the same \ntime, if you are marketing a product that nobody wants, or very few \npeople want, you will either go bankrupt, you will go out of business, \nor you will start making something else, some other product that \nsomebody else might be interested in.\n  That is why stores do not have racks full of outdated clothes. Once \nthey go out of style, people are not interested in them anymore so they \nget rid of them. When people stop buying them you take them off the \nrack and you replace them with the latest fashion. This principle has \nworked for over 200 years in this country--200 years, long before \nsubsidies. You start confusing the system when you start to pump money \ninto an industry that, frankly, cannot cut it, it cannot cut it on the \nopen market, it cannot handle it. And we ought not to be putting \nFederal dollars, hard earned, working men and women's dollars into such \nan outrageous--outrageous subsidy.\n  For the Government to be using tax dollars to bring an outdated \nfashion back into vogue flies right smack in the face of the whole free \nmarket system. There are a lot of us in here on this side of the aisle, \nand some on the other side of the aisle, who profess to be strong \nadvocates of the free market system. If you are a strong advocate of \nthe free market, if people want to buy mink coats and there is plenty \nof mink out there, why do we have to have the taxpayers subsidize \ngrowing mink to provide those coats? Give me one good reason. I would \nlike to hear one good reason.\n  If the voters said anything in the last election, they said cut \nspending and restore the free market principles to our country. That is \nwhat we are doing. This is $2 million, not a lot of money under a huge \n$1.5 trillion budget. But, my goodness, what a small, little step. If \nwe cannot take this little, tiny step to stop subsidizing the \nproduction of mink coats, if we cannot do that, then I do not have a \nlot of hope that we are ever going to get to reconciliation and balance \nthe budget. The House got the message. They supported this amendment \n232 to 160. They did the right thing. Let us not be the laughingstock \nof the Congress and approve such an outrageous subsidy. That is an \ninsult to every hard-working man and woman in this country. I would \nventure to say even the very few people left who wear mink coats would \nprobably be opposed to this subsidy. How can anybody be for this \nsubsidy? What is the justification for this subsidy? Let us show the \nvoters that the Senate got the same message that the House got and not \nbe the laughingstock of the Congress by passing such an outrageous, \nabsolutely outrageous, subsidy.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my remarks will be brief.\n  I could rise to talk about the MPP program. But that is not what this \namendment is about. This amendment is about excluding an industry from \nparticipation in this program simply because of a group that doesn't \nlike mink, more specifically, mink coats--95 percent of which are \nexported.\n  The Senate voted yesterday to support the MPP program. The Senate has \nspoken. Why are we talking about fur? Why not grapes, cotton, raisins, \nwheat, or wine?\n  The Kerry amendment does not reduce spending for the MPP; it just \nprohibits funding for mink production. This amendment saves no money. \nMr. President, that is the bottom line.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the \nbackground of this amendment is that when the House, the other body, \nwas considering this legislation, an amendment was offered on the floor \nwhich provides as follows: That no funds in the bill should be \nallocated under the Market Promotion Program to the U.S. Mink Export \nDevelopment Council or any mink industry trade association.\n  So by this legislation there was a prohibition suggested in the \namendment against allocating MPP funds for this purpose, to promote \nexports of U.S.-grown mink.\n  I think we have a big problem in trying to substitute our judgment \nfor the decisions that the administrators of the Market Promotion \nProgram have. This amendment does not seek to strike any funds. This \namendment does not reduce the appropriation of money to the Market \nPromotion Program activity. As a matter of fact, we have already \ndebated that issue. The issue was presented to the Senate by Senators \nBryan and Bumpers. We debated it at length last night for a full hour. \nMost Senators had left for the evening. But we debated it, and we had a \nvote on it today. The vote was about 60-40, as I recall, to table the \namendment.\n  The point was made during the discussion--I will repeat it here just \nbriefly--that this program promotes the export of U.S.-grown \nagriculture commodities: food products, and the like. It is big \nbusiness for the United States to sell what we produce in the export \nmarkets, and with the changes in the Uruguay round of GATT, more and \nmore market opportunities are becoming favorable. This program has \nproved very helpful.\n  The difficulty I have as manager of the bill with this amendment is \nthat it seeks to substitute the judgment of the Senate, and calls upon \nit to act on the floor of the Senate for the judgment of the \nadministrators. I have received from the Department of Agriculture \ninformation about the program which says that mink exports in 1994 are \nestimated at about $100 million. That is a substantial increase from \nearlier levels.\n  The suggestion in the information we are given is that exports to \nKorea alone could exceed $40 million, which almost doubles the 1993 \nlevel. One of the associations that is involved in trying to promote \nthe export of these products says that if it had not been for MPP \nfunding here and the assistance that they provided to promote \n\n[[Page S13820]]\nU.S. mink industry products, we would not have a domestic mink industry \nin the United States. The fact is 28 States have mink production. In \nthe State of Wisconsin, I remember the number is $19 million in the \nlocal economy which depends on this industry alone.\n  So I am hopeful that the Senate will approve our motion to table this \namendment and not get into the business of trying to micromanage and \nlegislate changes in this program on an appropriations bill. That is \nwhat is being sought.\n  So at the time when Senators have spoken as much as they want to \nspeak, it will be my intention to move to table and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished manager will move \nto table literally within minutes. I just have one quick response, \nunless somebody else wants to speak. My friend from Mississippi is \nabsolutely correct. This is a question of whether or not we want to \nsubstitute our judgment. That is exactly what it is. I think most \nSenators would agree this is an outrageous, stupid judgment. We are not \ntalking about computers here. We are not talking about foodstuff that \nis the mainstay of some developing country like wheat or something. We \nare talking about minks that my friend from New Hampshire appropriately \nsaid, and the Washington Post said today, blends in with diamonds and \nCadillacs.\n  If those folks want to, let them pay a little more for the cost of \nthe advertising, which I always thought was the notion of capitalism. \nThat is the private sector. You make your money. You go out and you do \nthe cost of doing business. And everybody here has railed forever about \nthe Government being involved in the process. Here is an opportunity to \nget the Government out of it. It is very, very simple and very \nstraightforward.\n  So my friend is absolutely correct. Do we today want to substitute \nour judgment and suggest that the judgment of some people that want to \nspend this money is wrong?\n  I hope my colleagues will join together and say it is wrong. I am all \nfor exports. I am not saying no to the mink industry. I have a mink \nfarmer in Massachusetts. I hope my mink farmer in Massachusetts does \nvery well, and continues to. That is fine. I just do not want the \ntaxpayers subsidizing this particular endeavor. That is what this vote \nis about.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] and \nthe Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] is \nabsent due to illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 18, nays 78, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 445 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--18\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Feingold\n     Gorton\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Specter\n\n                                NAYS--78\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Frist\n     Hatfield\n     Johnston\n     Simpson\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2695) was \nrejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2696\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2696.\n       On page 32 of the bill, strike lines 7 through 11 and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       Sec.   . For necessary salaries and expenses of the Office \n     of the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment \n     to administer the laws enacted by Congress for the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, $677,000: Provided, That none \n     of these funds shall be available to administer laws enacted \n     by Congress for the Forest Service; Provided Further, That \n     $350,000 shall be made available to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to administer the laws enacted by Congress for \n     the Forest Service; Provided Further, That notwithstanding \n     Section 245(c) of Public Law 103-354 (7 U.S.C. 6961(c)), the \n     Secretary of Agriculture may not delegate any authority to \n     administer laws enacted by Congress, or funds provided by \n     this Act, for the Forest Service to the Under Secretary for \n     Natural Resources and Environment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in 1948, the Congress passed a law that \nprovided that ``no part of any appropriation for the Bureau of \nReclamation contained in this Act shall be used for the salaries and \nexpenses of a person of any of the following positions:''\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order. It is \nvery difficult to hear the Senator from Alaska. That really means we \nare not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will please \ncome to order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall not take umbrage at my friend \nfrom Arkansas, because normally I can be heard. I do appreciate his \nconcern.\n  As I was saying, in 1948, Congress passed a law which, in effect, cut \noff the salary for the Commissioner for the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  In 1987, under the leadership of the now deceased Jamie Whitten, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Congress passed Public \nLaw 100-202, which read as follows, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthis be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to read it:\n\n       Office of the Assistant Secretary for Special Services. For \n     the necessary salaries and expenses to continue the Office of \n     the Assistant Secretary for purposes of providing special \n     services to the Department, $416,000: Provided, that none of \n     these funds shall be \n\n[[Page S13821]]\n     available for the supervision of Natural Resources and Environment \n     activities, the Soil Conservation Service, or the Forest \n     Service.\n\n  By that amendment, Mr. Whitten, in effect, defunded the salary of a \ngentleman named Dunlop. He held the same position in the Department of \nAgriculture that my amendment applies to. My amendment applies to the \nOffice of the Under Secretary of Agriculture that primarily deals with \nthe area of natural resources and environment. He has been supervising \nthe Forest Service. I hope that the Senators from Colorado and \nWashington, and others, will address this matter.\n  I am concerned that the Secretary of Agriculture has considered this \namendment to be an amendment that deals with a dispute as to policy.\n  Let me assure the former Member of the House and now Secretary of \nAgriculture, this has nothing to do with policy. This has to do with \nthe decision of one person of the executive branch not to follow the \nlaw as enacted by Congress and adopted by the President.\n  Mr. Lyons was one of those who was the author of the President's \nNorthwest timber plan that promised 2 billion board feet of timber. \nUnder his leadership, the Forest Service produced 300 million board \nfeet. After Congress released the timber sales in the recent \nrescissions bill, Mr. Lyons tried to prevent that sale from being \nreleased, and the Federal court immediately agreed with Congress. The \nSenator from Washington will discuss this. In terms of Alaska, Mr. \nLyons has repeatedly refused to follow the law as passed by the \nCongress.\n  In Montana, he decided on his own not to follow the law passed by \nCongress with regard to a roadless area in Montana, basically making \nthat area wilderness, although Congress had specifically decided not to \ndesignate it as wilderness.\n  In Alaska, we have had flagrant refusal to follow the law that has \nbeen passed by Congress. In recent months, we had an amendment that was \nadopted that asked the Forest Service to limit the so-called habitat \nconservation zones in the national forests to the size that was the \nlargest size used for such zones in what we call ``the lower 48.''\n  Under Mr. Lyons' leadership in the Forest Service, he had designated \nover 600,000 acres of the area that was available for timber harvest in \nthe State of Alaska as habitat conservation zones. One of them was one-\nfifth the size of Rhode Island.\n  After the Congress passed the law and set the maximum area for such \nzones, Mr. Lyons just simply refused to follow it. I do not think this \nis a disagreement policy. We have had our arguments on policy and we \nhave them here. When a law is passed and that law is ignored and really \njust faces a complete refusal of the person with the authority to \nadminister it, refusal of that person to follow the law, I think it \nsets a very bad standard for our country as a whole.\n  We expect our people to follow laws that are enacted by Congress. As \na matter of fact, most of those people that are not in Government \nemployment, if they do not follow a law passed by Congress, they are \nfined immediately. I have an appeal from one miner that was fined \n$48,000 for failing to follow a directive issued orally by a person in \nthe Government. We have repeated incidents of members of the public who \nare cited and brought into court, and many other things are done when \nthey do not follow the law.\n  In this instance, there is nothing to be done. That is why I have \nraised this question. I raised the question of whether or not the \nCongress wants to follow the example set on at least two previous \noccasions and, in effect, remove the area of the Forest Service from \nthe delegated authority of the Under Secretary. I have not gone as far \nas Mr. Whitten did, or the 80th Congress, in totally defunding the \nfunction. All this amendment really does is says to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, we no longer have faith in this person to fairly and \nimpartially administer the laws of the Forest Service and, therefore, \nwe redelegate the authority back to the Secretary. It is a simple \nmatter. There is no change in the money available to the Department of \nAgriculture. There is no change in the money available to the Under \nSecretary's office, as far as his functions are concerned. But the \nmoney for the supervision of the Forest Service is restored to the \nSecretary's office, and the Secretary is placed back in the position of \nfull responsibility for the Forest Service.\n  I cannot believe that we would allow a person to completely disregard \nthe acts of Congress and refuse to carry them out. I am hopeful, as I \nsaid, that the Senator from Oregon may have a comment; and the Senator \nfrom Colorado, I know, wishes to come to the floor. I hope they will \ncome to the floor and speak on this amendment.\n  I consider it to be just a modest shot across the bow, Mr. President. \nWe in the West are tired of this war against the West. We want the laws \nthat Congress passes, after long battles here in the Congress, to be \nobserved. They have not been observed by this man. He has refused to \nfollow them. He has refused to even keep his own word, as you will hear \nfrom other Members, concerning what he stated he would do and what he \nhas actually done in carrying out the authority delegated to him in the \npast.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will adopt this amendment and the House \nwill see fit to adopt it. If we do not take action and require these \npeople to follow the law, how can we expect the public to obey the laws \nwe pass?\n  Mr. President, to me, this is a matter of simple justice.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, never before in my career in the U.S. \nSenate have I considered or supported taking an action of this nature. \nYet, I am convinced that, if anything, the proposal of the Senator from \nAlaska is too mild. Each and every one of us has had differences of \nopinion on matters of policy with persons in a national administration, \nsometimes with members of our own party, but more frequently with those \nof the other party. But these differences of opinion are cast in the \nterms of policy, not in the terms of either truthfulness or a \nwillingness to abide by the law.\n  So I wish to emphasize as clearly as I possibly can that this \namendment proposed by the Senator from Alaska does not stem from a \ndifference of opinion over a matter of policy with Secretary Lyons. We \ndiffer with the entire administration on many matters of policy \nrelating to the forests. But in the case of Mr. Lyons, we do not get \ntruthful answers from him on questions of fact, and we get defiance \nwith respect to the law, whether it has been on the law books for an \nextended period of time or is brand new, consistently. And there is a \nvindictive attitude toward any of those who disagree with him and \ntoward almost all of those who are engaged in the profession of \nforestry in the private sector.\n  Let me give you just a few really very, very recent examples. Two of \nthem come from the rescissions bill, which was passed by this Congress \nand signed by the President only a very few months ago. The most recent \ntook place only last week. The bill on rescissions was, quite \nobviously, a controversial piece of legislation. And it carried with \nit, in addition to the cancellation of some spending programs, a number \nof substantive provisions. The first rescissions bill passed by this \nCongress was vetoed by President Clinton, as was his perfect right, on \na number of grounds, one of which was the so-called ``salvage timber'' \nlanguage that was included in that bill. During the period of time \nbetween that veto and the passage of a second rescissions bill, the \nlanguage on salvage and other timber was negotiated literally line by \nline with the administration. And the administration was consistently \nrepresented by Assistant Secretary Lyons.\n  One of the issues was what timber was covered by one of the \nprovisions in the bill. Secretary Lyons argued for a more restrictive \nprovision. He ultimately asked those of us who were proponents of the \nlanguage to give him a list of the timber sales that were authorized by \nthe bill. That list of timber sales was given to him. The bill was \npassed. The bill was signed by the President of the United States, and \nimmediately Assistant Secretary Lyons said that most of the contracts \nthat were listed in the very list he had been given would not be \nreleased. He interpreted the section concerned in the manner he had \nadvocated in these negotiations and was rejected by those negotiations.\n\n  His position has already been rejected by a U.S. District Court which \nstated that the meaning of the provision was absolutely clear. In spite \nof that ruling, Secretary Lyons has still not released the timber sales \nand a spokesman for his administration said, ``This ruling was not an \norder. It doesn't direct us to do anything.''\n  Obviously, requiring people to go back into court, once again, to \nenforce what Secretary Lyons understood to be the law before the law \nwas passed, understood what it was after it was passed, understood it \nwas after the court ruled, and understands what it is today.\n  Another provision in the same timber language for rescission had to \ndo with other timber sales.\n  There was an extensive debate over the definition of a phrase ``known \nto be nesting.'' We stated it meant (A), Secretary Lyons insisted it be \namended to have the meaning (B). Secretary Lyons' position was rejected \nand the land which was stated to have meaning (A) was adopted and \nsigned by the President.\n  Secretary Lyons immediately interpreted it to mean what he had asked \nus to change it to unsuccessfully. That matter is now in court.\n  Just last week, Assistant Secretary Lyons caused to be issued a final \nrule for the implementation of a 1990 law entitled the Forest Resources \nConservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, dealing primarily with \nthe export of logs from State and Federal lands. Mr. President, that \nlaw was passed in 1990.\n  A proposed rule has been under discussion literally for years and the \ncompanies involved in this business have managed their business in \naccordance with that proposed rule.\n  On September 8, Assistant Secretary Lyons issued a final rule for the \nimplementation of the 1990 law dramatically different from the proposed \nrule--dramatically different--without having had any hearings or having \ngiven any notification as to those changes, as to those differences.\n  That new rule will require dramatically different business practices \non the part of persons in the timber industry, the failure to observe, \nwhich will subject them to great fines in business penalties. Yet, \nSecretary Lyons made the rule effective immediately.\n  The burden he has imposed is an impossible burden to meet. Later on \nthis evening I believe that we here will adopt an amendment to this \nbill directing that there be a 120-day period after the time of the \npromulgation of that rule until it becomes effective, so that people \ncan at least change their business practices so that they are operating \nin accordance with the law. Making it effective immediately can only \nhave been designed to persecute business enterprises engaged in this \nbusiness who had no notice of what was going to be included in this \nrule whatever.\n  Mr. President, other Senators have told me of numerous occasions on \nwhich they have been given specific assurances of a matter of fact by \nthe Assistant Secretary, only to have his actions dramatically and \ndiametrically opposed to the commitments that he has made.\n  Mr. President, this is a Federal officeholder who operates outside of \nthe law who believes that the law is whatever he feels appropriate \npolicy is and who ignores actions by the Congress of the United States \ntotally and diametrically opposed to his philosophies.\n  This is not an amendment that results from a disagreement on a matter \nof policy. It is an amendment to sanction an individual by removing the \nForest Service from his jurisdiction for deliberate falsehoods to the \nCongress of the United States and for deliberate violations of the law. \nIt should not be treated on a partisan matter. It should not be treated \nin the manner in which Members vote to defend actions of this sort.\n  All of us are implicated by this kind of lawless action on the part \nof an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. All of us, by voting in favor \nof this amendment, can pass on the message which should be a message \nfor all administrations of both parties under any set of \n\n[[Page S13823]]\ncircumstances, that policy differences in a free country are totally \nand completely appropriate, but that the law, the administrative law \nwhich applies to a given Department, must be honestly and forthrightly \ncarried out by that Department.\n  That is not the case with this Assistant Secretary, Mr. President. It \nis dramatically not the case. We should sanction, by the adoption of \nthe Stevens amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Stevens \namendment. I want to share with Members why I will be voting for that \namendment.\n  Mr. President, we had discussed on this floor some of the problems \nassociated with water policy during the current administration and \nprior administrations. This may seem somewhat far afield for Members \nwho come from States where they have ample water and great resources, \nbut, Mr. President, let me assure you the principle involved in it is \nextremely important for all of us.\n  The problem revolves around the ability to cross Federal grounds or \nuse Federal grounds under a permit. That is an important question in \nColorado because 37 percent of the State is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Obviously, in Alaska it is a much higher percentage.\n  Let me suggest it is a question that every single Member of the \nSenate has to be concerned about. If the Federal Government owned title \nto a property, your State may need to get a permit to cross that ground \nto put down a utility line, to put down a waterline, to put down a \nsewer line, to lay highways and so on.\n  The reality is, Mr. President, the ability to get permits to cross or \nuse Federal ground is essential for every State in this Nation. It is \npart of being good partners and part of working together.\n  What happens when those permits run out? The permits vary in length. \nIn Colorado, they can be issued for 20 years, and some of the \nextensions have gone beyond that period.\n  What happens when a permit expires? Does it mean ``tear down the \nhighway\"? Does it mean dig up the lines? Does it mean close down \nmunicipal drinking water? Believe it or not, the State of Colorado was \nfaced with that decision.\n  The Forest Service, under a previous administration--not this \nadministration, but the previous administration--suggested that for \ncities to renew their permit for a water line across Federal property, \nthey would have to surrender a portion of their water rights. These \noffers to surrender a city's water rights started at a third with \nsubsequent offers made for less than that.\n  Literally, the Forest Service suggested that to renew a Government \npermit to carry vital drinking water across Federal property, with no \nchange whatever in function, the city would have to surrender a third \nof their water rights or less to renew their permits.\n  Frankly, some of Colorado's cities did not have a choice. They had to \ncross Federal grounds to get water from the reservoir to the city and \nits inhabitants. ``Extortion'' is not too strong a word to describe \nthat policy.\n  As all Members can understand, strong protests were raised, and when \nit was brought to the attention of the Secretary of Agriculture, \nSecretary Madigan wrote me a letter and reversed the policy, directing \nhis Department to issue renewals of permits without conditioning them \non the forfeiture of a city's water rights.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Madigan's policy is very important. It \ncorrects a practice that I believe was not only illegal but terribly \nunfair and damaging to the citizens of Colorado and, frankly, damaging \nto the citizens of any State that is dependent upon Federal permits to \nreceive their water.\n  Why should I offer that background for this particular amendment? I \noffer that background because, included in the information I will \nsubmit at this point in the Record, are a series of letters that I \nreceived from Secretary Madigan as he put that policy into place. Those \nletters formed the core of the policy followed by the Secretary of \nAgriculture which relates to the current Secretary and the current \nUnder Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Because renewing Federal permits is a continuing problem and a \ncontinuing concern, when the current Under Secretary came before the \nSubcommittee for Resource Conservation, Research and Forestry of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, Under Secretary Lyons was called before \nthat committee to testify. He was asked directly about the Madigan \nletter and that very important policy. Let me quote from Congressman \nAllard.\n\n       . . . I'd like to proceed to a letter that was written to \n     Senator Brown in 1992 by then-Secretary of Agriculture \n     Madigan. And in that letter he said, and I quote from the \n     letter, ``I want to assure you that it is the policy of the \n     Forest Service to ensure the private property rights, \n     including water rights will be recognized and protected in \n     the course of special use permitting decisions for existing \n     water supply facilities. In addition, the Forest Service will \n     recognize and respect the role of the States [in] water \n     allocation and administration.''\n\n  Mr. President, that is a quote from the letter and the commitment of \nSecretary of Agriculture Madigan.\n  Congressman Allard is asking Mr. Lyons if that is still their policy. \nHis response as is apparent, and included in the transcript from that \nrecord is this: ``Mr. Lyons. Yes, sir, we still operate in that \nmanner.''\n  Congressman Allard had quoted to him the Madigan letter and the \npolicy and asked if that is still the Agriculture Department's policy \nand Mr. Lyons responds yes, it is. And indicates they operate in that \nmanner.\n  Later on, Congressman Allard quotes again and says:\n\n       Well, I would just remind you that and refer you back to \n     the letter of Secretary Madigan, of which you said you \n     haven't changed the policies from that letter, that you do \n     recognize the role of the States in water allocation \n     administration. And if you do recognize that, then there \n     shouldn't be a constant demand for water.\n\n  Mr. President, he said that. Again, Under Secretary Lyons did not \ncorrect it.\n  What is wrong with this? The date of that testimony was February 15, \n1995, earlier this year.\n  What is wrong with it is this. Just recently, on September 8 we were \nadvised by Mr. Lyons and his staff that the Madigan letter, which he \nhad said was still in effect when he testified on February 15, had been \nwithdrawn, in effect repealed, and all of the letter was no longer the \npolicy of the administration.\n  Moreover he said the withdrawal of that letter was done in August \n1994. Mr. President, what is apparent here is that the recorded \ntestimony of the Under Secretary about the specific provision was not \ncorrect. And, moreover, he had to have known it was not correct at the \ntime.\n  Mr. President, what this man did was mislead the congressional \ncommittee in response to direct questions on a direct subject.\n  As Under Secretary, he is in immediate supervision of the Forest \nService. One may disagree with the policy--although I doubt if any \nMember would want their State to have permits for crossing Federal \ngrounds canceled or have water extorted from their cities, or other \nextortive conditions placed upon the continued functioning of their \ncities or towns. But one may disagree about the policies. Nonetheless, \nthis question with the Under Secretary is not about the policy. Men and \nwomen of good faith and good conscience can disagree about the policy. \nBut the Under Secretary has a responsibility to the Senate and to the \nHouse and to this Government that goes beyond simply giving the \nPresident his best advice and doing the kind of job that he feels is \nappropriate. He has a responsibility to be honest and candid and frank \nwith the American people and with committees of this Congress.\n  If this Congress turns a blind eye to an administration official who \ncomes, testifies and misleads congressional committees, we forfeit our \nlegitimate and important role of overview and oversight of the \nexecutive branch. In addition, we forfeit our elected responsibilities \nin ensuring that critical administrative policy decisions that affect \nthe most basic needs of the citizens in our States are subject to the \nvoices of the elected representatives of the people.\n  This case is as clear as it can be. We have the testimony from the \ncommittee--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the transcript \nof the hearing be printed in the Record of our proceedings at this \npoint. \n\n[[Page S13824]]\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent that copies of the letter that Mr. \nAllard and I sent to Secretary Glickman, and copies of the letters we \nreceived in 1992 from Secretary of Agriculture Madigan, be printed in \nthe Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nHearing Before the Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research and \n  Forestry of the Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, \n             104th Congress, 1st Session, February 15, 1995\n\n       Mr. Allard. Mr. Lyons, I want to thank you for showing up \n     to testify before this Committee.\n       I would agree with you that there are a lot of good things \n     about the way the water is managed in Colorado. In fact, that \n     is there because of a water management system developed by \n     the State. And many of the streams that you talked about of \n     free flow-in 50 years ago didn't have a flow year-round and \n     today there is a year-round flow.\n       And because we provided the laws in order to manage that \n     very valuable resource in the State of Colorado called water \n     so that all the water comes down in the spring doesn't get \n     dissipated out so that when we get into August and into the \n     fall, the streams end up drying up. In fact, I can think of a \n     number of rivers right now where there is a year-round flow \n     out of the State of Colorado, but if you look back into the \n     early journals of the settlers and explorers that came back \n     into the State, they talk about digging down into the sand in \n     order to find the water. In other words, there wasn't a \n     flowing stream of water.\n       So in light of that, I'd like to proceed to a letter that \n     was written to Senator Brown in 1992 by then-Secretary of \n     Agriculture Madigan. And in that letter he said, and I quote \n     from the letter, ``I want to assure you that it is the policy \n     of the Forest Service to ensure that private property rights, \n     including water rights, will be recognized and protected in \n     the course of special use permitting decisions for existing \n     water supply facilities. In addition, the Forest Service will \n     recognize and respect the role of the States and (sic--in) \n     water allocation and administration.\n       Is this still the Forest Service policy?\n       Mr. Lyons. Yes sir, we still operate in that manner.\n       Mr. Allard. Can you explain what happened in Arapaho and \n     Roosevelt National Forests with bypass flows, then?\n       Mr. Lyons. Well sir, I have with me Forest Supervisor Skip \n     Underwood from the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests. he \n     can explain in detail what the negotiations led to in terms \n     of the development of a solution to a concern that was \n     expressed by a number of permittees regarding conditions for \n     their permits.\n       But the short of it is we worked with the permittees \n     to develop a joint operating plan for waters flowing in \n     the Cashelocuta drainage. This successfully avoided the \n     need for the establishment of bypass flows, which I think \n     is your primary concern, with the exception of one stream \n     segment, and that was a stream segment which benefitted or \n     which was part of the permit that operated for the benefit \n     of the City of Fort Collins.\n       Mr. Allard. The agreement was with Forth Collins. But what \n     about the other communities in that area? You've got Greeley \n     and Loveland and Boulder.\n       Mr. Lyons. They were all part of the joint operating plan. \n     And, in fact, we've recently signed easements with all those \n     permittees, for the continued operation of their facilities.\n       Mr. Allard. And part of that arrangement was you've \n     demanded as part of the agreement of bypass flow, \n     irregardless of whether that was adjudicated water through \n     the State water courts .\n       Mr. Lyons. Well, I don't believe we demanded that, Mr. \n     Chairman, What we attempted to do was determine a mechanism \n     by which we could meet our obligations under law to protect \n     aquatic resources in a manner that would minimize the impact \n     on the permittee. And, in fact, I think the permittee has \n     indicated that he felt that the impacts or the permittee felt \n     that the impacts would be fairly limited.\n       Mr. Allard. Well, the point is that you did end up with \n     bypass flows.\n       Mr. Lyons. On one segment, yes, sir.\n       Mr. Allard. Yes. And you didn't go through the State courts \n     to acquire that water right.\n       Mr. Lyons. That was through negotiated agreement with the \n     permittee as a condition of the permit.\n       Mr. Allard. So it did avoid the State court provisions.\n       Mr. Lyons. Yes, sir.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mr. Allard. Well, I would just remind you that and refer \n     you back to the letter from Secretary Madigan, of which you \n     said you haven't changed the policies from the letter, that \n     you do recognize the role of the States in water allocation \n     administration. And if you do recognize that, then there \n     shouldn't be a constant demand for water.\n       Now you may not have a right, but you ended up with the \n     water. You know, the States have traditionally recognized \n     water as a private property right and has protected that \n     right through their adjudication process, usually in the \n     State court. And all the Western States have that type of \n     legal process. And I think that's of real interest to this \n     Committee. It's certainly of a lot of interest to me \n     personally.\n       So I would encourage you work with the State of Colorado \n     through the current water law that they're administering in \n     that State.\n       Mr. Lyons. We fully intend to do that, Congressman. As I \n     indicated, we have a whole slew of permits yet to be \n     reviewed. We intend to work with the permittes, with other \n     interested parties, and with the State. And we'll certainly \n     work with you and other members of the delegation to try and \n     achieve a balance in resolving these permit issues.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, \n           Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research, and \n           Forestry,\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: On Friday September 8th, your staff \n     asserted in a briefing that the October 6, 1992 letter from \n     Secretary Madigan which confirmed that the Forest Service \n     would not impose new bypass flows on existing water supply \n     facilities had been rescinded in August, 1994. If this \n     assertion by your staff is accurate, we have several very \n     serious concerns about this action.\n       First, the interpretation of the law contained in the \n     Madigan letter is not only correct from a legal perspective, \n     but is also critically important to the West. Colorado and \n     other states are experiencing significant growth at a time \n     when it is very difficult to develop new water supplies. This \n     means that the continued availability of existing water \n     supplies is absolutely essential. The illegal imposition of \n     new or additional bypass flow requirements on existing water \n     supplies takes water away from municipalities that need this \n     water to supply and support their citizens and farmers that \n     have long used this water to grow crops. In addition, the \n     loss of these water supplies increases the demand for \n     acquisition of new or substitute water supplies. In the case \n     of Colorado's Front Range, the loss of these existing water \n     supplies increases the need for new water storage facilities, \n     which will have environmental impacts. More importantly, the \n     loss of these supplies also leads to the conversion of \n     agricultural water rights to municipal uses, and the \n     resulting loss of socially and environmentally important open \n     space currently provided by irrigated agriculture.\n       Second, the assertions by your staff are directly contrary \n     to explicit representations made by you and Undersecretary \n     Lyons in full Committee and Subcommittee. At a hearing before \n     the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, \n     Research, and Forestry on February 15th of this year, we were \n     assured by Undersecretary Lyons that the Madigan policy was \n     still in effect;\n       ``Mr. Allard. Mr. Lyons, I want to thank you for showing up \n     to testify before this Committee.\n       ``I would agree with you that there are a lot of good \n     things about the way the water is managed in Colorado. In \n     fact, that is there because of a water management system \n     developed by the State. And many of the streams that you \n     talked about of free flow-in 50 years ago didn't have a flow \n     year-round and today there is a year-round flow.\n       ``And because we provided the laws in order to manage that \n     very valuable resource in the State of Colorado called water \n     so that all the water comes down in the spring doesn't get \n     dissipated out so that when we get into August and into fall, \n     the streams end up drying up. In fact, I can think of a \n     number of rivers right now where you look back into the early \n     journals of the settlers and explorers that came to the \n     State, they talk about digging down into the sand in order to \n     find the water. In other words, there wasn't a flowing stream \n     of water.\n       ``So in light of that, I'd like to proceed to a letter that \n     was written to Senator Brown in 1992 by then-Secretary of \n     Agriculture Madigan. And in the letter he said, and I quote \n     from the letter, ``I want to assure you that it is the policy \n     of the Forest Service to ensure that private property rights, \n     including water rights, will be recognized and protected in \n     the course of special use permitting decisions for existing \n     water supply facilities. In addition, the Forest Service will \n     recognize and respect the role of the States in [sic-and] \n     water allocation and administration.''\n       ``Is this still the Forest Service policy?\n       ``Mr. Lyons. Yes, sir, we still operate in that manner.''\n       In addition, at a full committee hearing, you also assured \n     the Committee that the Madigan policy was still effective;\n       ``Mr. Allard. Mr. Secretary, welcome. I'd like to join some \n     other members of this Committee in congratulating you on your \n     appointment and subsequent confirmation as Secretary of \n     Agriculture. And I do look forward to working with you on the \n     issues that are facing agriculture.\n       ``One issue that is particularly important in all of the \n     Western United States is an issue pertaining to water and how \n     the Forest Service is working with the States on the \n     management plans for water.\n       ``As you know, the Forest Service has been going around \n     State water laws and demanding bypass water flows. And this \n     has been a concern through 3 Secretaries of Agriculture and \n     two Presidents.\n       ``When Secretary Madigan was running the Forest Service, he \n     sent a correspondence to \n\n[[Page S13825]]\n     Senator Brown assuring him that--that's the senator from the State of \n     Colorado--assuring his that it is a policy of the Forest \n     Service to ensure that private property rights, including \n     water rights, will be recognized and protected in the course \n     of special use permitting decisions for existing water supply \n     facilities.\n       ``He further stated in his letter, ``In addition, the \n     Forest Service will recognize and respect the role of the \n     States in water allocation and administration.''\n       ``Mr. Lyons assured me in February that it is the Forest \n     Service's policy, now that you are heading up the Department \n     do you agree that this should be the policy of the Forest \n     Service?\n       ``Mr. Glickman. Absolutely.''\n       The entire focus of the Madigan letter was on the issue of \n     bypass flows. The letter promised that the Forest Service \n     would protect private property rights and preserve state \n     water allocation systems, and explicitly explained that this \n     interpretation of the law meant that new bypass flows would \n     not be imposed on existing water supply facilities. Both you \n     and Undersecretary Lyons affirmed, without any qualification, \n     limitation, or exception, Secretary Madigan's interpretation \n     of the law on this issue. In light of your ``absolute'' \n     ratification of these principles, your staff cannot credibly \n     assert that your commitment meant something other than a \n     complete acceptance of Mr. Madigan's conclusion that the \n     Forest Service did not have the legal authority to impose new \n     bypass flows on existing water supply facilities.\n       Finally, the purported recision of the Madigan letter \n     occurred over a year ago. Since that time we have discussed \n     the Madigan letter with you and Mr. Lyons on numerous \n     occasions, and made it clear that this is a very important \n     issue. Your failure to even disclose the existence of the \n     August, 1994, action in the course of these subsequent \n     discussions is incomprehensible, particularly in light of \n     your absolute affirmation of the letter before the full \n     committee.\n       In light of the withholding of this information, it is \n     necessary for us to obtain, within 30 days of the date of \n     this letter, copies of all documents, including telephone \n     messages and logs, information generated or stored in \n     computerized form (including E-mail), correspondence, \n     memoranda, and other form of data or information in the \n     possession of the Forest Service and USDA which relate or \n     refer to the Madigan letter from November, 1992 through the \n     present time. We would also like a written response by \n     Monday, September 18th as to whether you will comply with \n     this request.\n       We are deeply disappointed by this turn of events. We had \n     hoped that you would use your tenure at the Department to \n     ease tensions between western members of Congress, their \n     constituents and the Department. Unfortunately, it appears \n     that instead you are continuing the anti-West agenda this \n     Administration began in 1993.\n     Hank Brown,\n       Senator.\n     Wayne Allard,\n       Congressman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1992.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Hank: Thank you for your August 12 letter regarding \n     the renewal of special-use permits for water supply \n     facilities on the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest in \n     Colorado. I understand the importance of this issue to cities \n     throughout the west that depend on facilities located on \n     national forest lands for their water supplies.\n       This is a complex issue, but one that I believe has been \n     resolved in a manner that is satisfactory to all interests. \n     This progress is due in no small part to your ongoing \n     interest and leadership in this important area.\n       I want to assure you that it is the policy of the Forest \n     Service to ensure that private property rights, including \n     water rights, will be recognized and protected in the course \n     of special-use permitting decisions for existing water supply \n     facilities. In addition, the Forest Service will recognize \n     and respect the role of the States in water allocation and \n     administration.\n       I agree that the Forest Service should not take actions \n     that reduce historical water supplies from facilities located \n     on national forest lands. The Forest Service will reissue \n     permits for existing water supply facilities for 20 years \n     with provisions to recognize and respect both the rights of \n     the applicants and the multiple use objectives of the \n     national forests. New bypass flow requirements will not be \n     imposed on existing water supply facilities. However, unless \n     amended, all permits will authorize only historical water \n     rights associated with existing facilities. The permits will \n     also obligate the permittee to accommodate resource goals of \n     the Forest. This accommodation will be to the extent feasible \n     without diminishing the water yield or substantially \n     increasing the cost of the water yield from the existing \n     facility.\n       In summary, special-use permits for existing water supply \n     facilities will:\n       Authorize the use, operation, maintenance, repair, and \n     replacement of the existing facilities described in an \n     enclosure to the permit for the exercise of the water rights \n     and water conservation or management practices described in \n     an additional enclosure to the permit. The permit will not \n     authorize expansion or enlargement of the facilities or water \n     rights, water conservation, or management practices described \n     in the enclosure.\n       Require the permittee to operate the facilities in a manner \n     that accommodates the resource goals of the national forest \n     without reducing the yield of the water rights or \n     significantly increasing the cost of the water yield from the \n     existing facility.\n       Require the permittee to provide the Forest Service, on an \n     annual basis, a copy of the official records of the State \n     agency having responsibility for administration of the water \n     rights for the facilities described in the enclosure.\n       I am pleased to see that progress has been made on this \n     issue and will instruct the Forest Service to reissue permits \n     in accordance with this letter. I have asked the Chief of the \n     Forest Service to initiate discussions with local interested \n     parties to identify ways for carrying out the provisions and \n     objectives of the individual permits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------ ------,\n     (For Edward Madigan, Secretary).\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 1992.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Hank: This letter is a follow-up to the one I sent to \n     Senator Wallop on October 6 in response to his August 12 \n     letter regarding special-use permits for water supply \n     facilities on the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest in \n     Colorado.\n       You asked for clarification of what is meant by the \n     following sentence in paragraph 4 of my October 6 letter: \n     ``New bypass flow requirements will not be imposed in \n     existing water supply facilities.''\n       The entire October 6 letter is directed at clarifying \n     conditions for renewing permits for existing water supply \n     facilities only, and is not intended to pertain to new water \n     supply facilities or expansions of existing ones.\n       An underlying principle for renewing permits for existing \n     facilities, as stated in the same paragraph of the October 6 \n     letter as the sentence in question, is: ``. . . unless \n     amended, all permits will authorize only historical water \n     rights associated with existing water supply facilities.'' \n     The sentence in question is intended only to emphasize that \n     no new bypass requirements will be imposed beyond any that \n     may have been specified in the old permit for the existing \n     facility.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------ ------,\n     (For Edward Madigan, Secretary).\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1992.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: Thank you for your September 21 letter \n     to Secretary Edward Madigan on behalf of the cities of \n     Greeley and Loveland, and the Grand County Water and \n     Sanitation District, regarding the Forest Service position on \n     bypass flows. The Secretary has asked me to respond to your \n     letter.\n       Secretary Madigan's October 6 letter to you clarified our \n     policy that ensures protection of private property rights, \n     including water rights, when renewing special use permits for \n     existing water supply facilities. This same policy applies to \n     Greeley, Loveland, and the Grand County Water and Sanitation \n     District facilities. The Forest Service will reissue special \n     use permits for the city of Loveland's hydroelectric project \n     on the Big Thompson River and Public Service Company of \n     Colorado's hydroelectric project on Middle Boulder Creek \n     consistent with the conditions of the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission licenses for the two projects.\n       We appreciate the interest of the respective City Officials \n     in operating these facilities in harmony with the \n     environment. The Forest Service will continue to work with \n     the municipalities to achieve this objective.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               John H. Beuter,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n     Natural Resources and Environment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the documentation is clear. I see before us \non our desk a letter from Secretary Dan Glickman. Mr. President, I want \nto tell you I have the utmost respect for Secretary Glickman. I served \nwith him in the House. I know him to be a person of integrity and \nhonesty. We did not always agree but I respect his judgment and I \nrespect his honesty. I do not believe Secretary Glickman would ever \nintentionally mislead this body or mislead the House or mislead anyone \nelse. He is a person whose word can be counted on.\n  That does not mean that he was never incorrect. All of us get \ninaccurate information and Members will see referenced in those items a \nquestion that was raised. But I have no doubt in my mind that Secretary \nGlickman was honest and forthright and gave the best information which \nhe had been given by his staff.\n  Mr. President, the question that is before us does not simply concern \nSecretary Glickman's letter. It ought to \n\n[[Page S13826]]\nbe given heavy weight. He is a thoughtful, reasonable person and his \npreferences deserve significant consideration. But as Members ponder \nthe question placed before us by Senator Stevens, they must also ask \nthemselves this question: What do you do with an official who is \nactively involved and supervises the repeal of a major policy decision \nin 1994, and a few months later in testimony before Congress conceals \nthe fact that the policy decision was reversed and the letter stating \nit withdrawn, and in fact testifies to the contrary?\n  Mr. President, this Senate must act. We cannot turn a blind eye. If \nwe are to complete our responsibilities and do our job, we must insist \nthat the Under Secretary either be frank, straightforward, and honest \nwith Congress or we must get a new Under Secretary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must disagree with my good friend. I \nunderstand his concern. I understand his disagreement with the Under \nSecretary. But I hope one might take a look at the letter from the \nSecretary of Agriculture. Let me read one of the things Secretary \nGlickman says.\n\n       When Congress differs with the Department's policies \n     carried out by the Under Secretary, I recommend, and hope, we \n     debate those policies on their merits; we will arrive at a \n     much more satisfactory resolution of whatever disagreements \n     may exist than we would by permitting policy debates to \n     devolve into personalities.\n\n  The Secretary, who was a distinguished Member of Congress himself, \nwas not unaware of how Members of Congress can express dissatisfaction \nwith administration and administration policies. The Secretary served \nhere in both Democrat and Republican administrations, as have I and the \nSecretary, like I have, would disagree with policies of both Democrat \nand Republican administrations and would fight to change those \npolicies. But he, like I, would not think to do it by making basically \npersonal attacks, an ad hominem attack against a member of the \nadministration.\n  Secretary Glickman goes on to say:\n\n       The amendments would, if adopted, set an alarming precedent \n     that will no doubt continue under future Administrations. The \n     precedent will, I fear, encumber, not enhance, our ability to \n     resolve disagreements and will unnecessarily complicate \n     arriving at mutually acceptable public policies.\n\n  Frankly, if each time we disagree with the Secretary, or anybody \nelse, if we take our disagreement to the floor and try to eliminate \nthat person's job, I agree that is not the precedent to set. I say that \nagain, as one who, over 21 years here, has disagreed with policies set \nby those in the administration, both Democrat and Republican. But where \nwe have disagreed I have sought ways to change those policies either by \ngoing directly to the administration and, when unsuccessful there, to \nwrite new legislation that might change the policy. I cannot recall any \ntime that I sought to eliminate the person's job in doing it because I \ndaresay in virtually any policy that is going on in any administration \nwith 100 of us, there are going to be 40 to 50 different disagreements.\n\n  Are we going to be here as in the Dracula hours of legislation, those \nhours when actually legislation gets voted on after dark, after our \nfamilies have gone home, after our families have gone to bed, and in \nkeeping with the new family-friendly Congress, when we finally get \naround to decide to start voting on these things? Are we going to have \n40, 50, 60 amendments out here attacking 40, 50, 60 individuals in the \nadministration, this administration or the next administration or the \nadministration after that? I do not think it is the way to do it. It \ndoes not make for good legislation. It does not make for good public \npolicy, and it does not change things that we might want to change.\n  It is far better, if we have differences, to go to the Cabinet member \nwho is the head of the agency. I know Dan Glickman, the Secretary of \nAgriculture. I daresay there is not a Member of this body who, if he or \nshe called Secretary Glickman, who would not get a phone call back \nimmediately, and they would be able to talk to him.\n  I have worked with Secretary Lyons, who I have found to be very \nhelpful. I have found him to be very forthright, forthright not to tell \nme when he disagrees with me, and he will not do the things I might \nwant. But we either agree or we disagree. If we go off and say that \nsomehow because we disagree with him because of the law that he should \nbe stripped of his authority, would we not have done that in the past \nadministration? If we wanted to do that, think of the previous \nAssistant Secretary under the Bush administration.\n  The Federal court in Seattle found the Bush administration had \nviolated the National Forest Management Act. That is not just one \nindividual Senator's feeling that maybe they were not following the \nlaw; a Federal court found they violated the act. Have we seen Members \nof the Senate on either side of the aisle rush to the floor to \nintroduce legislation to say the Bush administration has been found by \nthe Federal courts to be in violation of the law, and, thus, the \nAssistant Secretary who is in charge of carrying out that law--we are \ngoing to get rid of him? I do not recall anybody doing that.\n  Nobody went to strip Assistant Secretary Jim Moseley of his \nauthority. What we did was say here is what the Federal court has \nruled. Here is what we are going to do as a law, and, if we want some \nchanges in that law so they will fit under our policies, we will vote \nand we will change the law. But nobody came in here and said the \nFederal court has said the Bush administration is not following the \nlaw, and therefore, we are going to strip the Assistant Secretary.\n  We have a difference of policy. We have a difference of policy. We \nare not changing policy by legislatively firing somebody. Section 318 \nmeans in the end it is going to have to be decided by the courts. If we \nfire every Assistant Secretary who loses a lawsuit, we would have fired \na whole lot in the last administration and, I suspect, the \nadministrations before them. But that is not the precedent that we want \nto start.\n  I have found the Assistant Secretary to be forthright in his dealings \nwith me. Like everybody else in this administration, I found times when \nI agree and sometimes when I disagree. I have found disagreements in \nthe members of the Clinton administration, the Bush administration, the \nReagan administration, the Carter administration, the Ford \nadministration, and all administrations which I served in. I do not \never recall having a disagreement with anybody in any one of those \nadministrations where I came in the floor and said, ``Let us pass a law \nto fire him'' because of my disagreement with him. I would not want to \nsee that precedent started. I did not see that precedent in the Ford \nadministration nor the Carter administration nor the Bush \nadministration, and I certainly would not want to see something to \nstart in the present administration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator recall a precedent of Jamie Whitten \nsecuring the defunding of precisely this position in 1987 for about the \nsame reasons? This is not a partisan matter. This is not a personality \nmatter. This has happened before. It is not a precedent.\n  Does the Senator know that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I can think only of the things I recall on the floor of \nthe Senate, and that was not a matter I recall on the floor of the \nSenate, I say to my friend from Alaska. I am saying we can change \npolicy. We can vote to change policies. But I do not ever recall voting \nto support the legislative firing of any member of any administration, \nRepublican or Democrat. That is not the way we do things in Vermont. \nThat is not the way I do things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is not a question of changing the law \nor not changing the law. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, we \npassed a law in the rescissions bill to facilitate the Forest Service \nto carry out salvaging timber operations. The law was changed, and \nimmediately after that in dealing with Mr. Lyons, he did not agree with \nthe law, and said as much, and said, ``I am not real happy about that. \nI do not think I will carry it out.'' And he said it before a \n\n[[Page S13827]]\ncommittee, the Energy Committee. So we changed the law.\n  If he has been less than candid and straightforward with the \ncommittees and with the Congress of the United States of America, can \nwe also say that maybe he is less than candid when he starts advising \nhis President and the President has to start making decisions based on \nthe information given to him by the Under Secretary of Agriculture?\n  I am saying the credibility has disappeared. And he is not serving \nhis President or this country very well. In that rescissions law there \nwas nothing in there that told the Under Secretary of Agriculture to \nsign a memorandum of agreement with four other agencies or three other \nagencies in order to carry out the salvaging of timber, both that \ntimber that was damaged by fire, the fires of 1988 and the fires of \n1994, or the dead and dying trees that we have in our National Forest. \nFor, you see, when a tree dies, the longer it stands it loses value, \nand pretty soon the value is such that they will not be bid on at all.\n  So if you do not like the policy that has been put forth even by the \nPresident or by the Congress, you go into a delaying action. Basically, \nthat is what has happened here. So it is not a question of partisan \npolitics.\n  It is a question of arrogance, a question of being less than candid \nand less than straightforward with the Congress of the United States, \nand I would also say probably with the President and his people who \nhave to make decisions on policy with regard to management of natural \nresources on our public lands.\n  That is what this debate is all about. My heavens, if it was one \nperson who disagreed with Mr. Lyons, I do not think you would hear \nanybody standing on this floor supporting this amendment. So the \nfrequency and the variety of it also lends to that of being pretty much \non target whenever we start trying to make some policy decisions. Here \nis somebody who is getting in the way of public land managers, \nprofessional land managers who know how to manage national forests, who \nknow how to grow and harvest a product for the United States of America \nand for all the people who live here and yet has his own personal \nlittle agenda, and he disregards the law of the land in his dealings \nwith the Congress of the United States.\n  So I rise in support of the Stevens amendment. It is not an action \nthat we enjoy. It is not an action that is without precedents. In fact, \nit is an action that we would try not to be a part of but is serious.\n  So I support the Stevens amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I feel inclined to share with my \ncolleagues my own personal feeling about the process that is underway \nhere. Ordinarily, the President has the right to name his team to carry \nout his policies, and that is just the way it goes. You may not agree \nwith those policies from time to time, but ordinarily we are able to \nwork under a situation where we are able to communicate our point of \nview. While we may not always prevail in a situation such as we have \nhere, where we have both the House and the Senate controlled by one \nparty and our executive branch controlled by another party, we can \nstill communicate and maintain a dialog and represent our \nconstituencies.\n  Now, we are able to do that with the Secretary of Agriculture. There \nis absolutely no question. We have invited him up to our State of \nAlaska. He has met with us. We have expressed concerns. He has been \nresponsive. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about the Under \nSecretary for Natural Resources, Under Secretary Lyons.\n  I serve as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nThe Under Secretary has appeared before us on numerous occasions. While \nthis debate may seem a debate focused on the West, let us remember that \nwe have some unique natural resources, and timber is certainly one of \nthem. We are blessed with those resources. Timber is a renewable \nresource. There is an industry that is dependent on it. It previously \nhad been managed within the Forest Service by professionals who have \ndedicated themselves to, and come from, an approach to forest \nmanagement based on the renewability of that resource. We need wood \nfiber; we need timber; we need paper products. With proper management \nwe have that capability on a sustained basis.\n  That has been the whole concept of harvesting within our national \nforests. For the most part, that process has worked. Unfortunately, we \nseem to have in Mr. Lyons an Under Secretary who is going to manage \nlands as he sees how the public lands should be managed as opposed to \nthe professionals.\n  We have seen a mass exit of professional forest managers from the \nForest Service within the last few years. That is, indeed, unfortunate. \nIt is my understanding that the proposal from the senior Senator from \nAlaska would be to not fund the Office of Under Secretary for Natural \nResources. It has been addressed that, indeed, this is not a precedent. \nIt has been done before. The purpose would be to transfer his reporting \nauthority directly to the Secretary.\n  I hope my colleagues who are not from the West have listened to this \ndebate carefully, because you have heard from all points of the West. \nYou have not just heard from Alaska or Colorado. You have heard from \nWashington; you have heard from Idaho; you have heard from Montana. All \nof these are areas that have been heavily impacted by this Under \nSecretary's management according to the world as he sees it.\n  I am not going to repeat the specific points that have been brought \nup, the references to meetings, the references to not carrying out what \nwere perceived agreements. But clearly, Members of the Senate, we have \nhere an Under Secretary whose policies are not working. They are not \nworking in communications with us. They are not working in concert with \nus.\n  I think it is appropriate to reflect that, in the last year of the \nClinton administration, this is the first time we have had this unique \nsituation where we have an individual with whom we simply cannot deal. \nSo I would encourage you to reflect that something is clearly wrong \nhere. We have a situation that is not working.\n  This is an extreme action, I agree, but we have had many \nconversations. We have tried to work out differences. But he seems to \nhave a personal agenda virtually disregarding those of us who have a \ndependence on the national forests.\n  This is simply not the way to carry out public administrative \nresponsibility. I can honestly say in my efforts to communicate with \nMr. Lyons, I found a total insensitivity in the manner in which, while \nlistening to our concerns, there was virtually no policy direction \ntoward the points that we made or the people who were affected in our \nvarious States.\n  So I think this action is in order. And while I listened to the \ncomments from the Senator from Vermont suggesting this is not the way \nto do things, I do not know how we should do things relative to the \nmanner in which Mr. Lyons is carrying out his responsibilities, because \nit is simply not working. It is not my intent, by any means, to \nembarrass the administration. If this were a different situation, \ndifferent administration, and we had the same set of circumstances, I \nwould like to think I would be up here doing the same thing. I firmly \nbelieve we have an extraordinary situation that we simply cannot \nignore, and we would be shirking our responsibilities as Senators \nrepresenting States with national forest lands to just suggest this is \na situation we can live with, because clearly we cannot. So I intend to \nsupport the Stevens amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I \nwould like to yield to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Bumpers, for \nyielding. I am here, Mr. President, not to participate in this debate \nbut just to state that it is now 8:20 p.m. There seems to be a large \nnumber of Senators gathering in the Senate.\n  I assume that means there are going to be more speakers. I am just \nwondering if we could get some sort of word \n\n[[Page S13828]]\nfrom the distinguished manager as to whether we might set a time \ncertain to vote on this amendment or as to the possibility of perhaps \nstacking this vote early in the morning with another series of votes, \notherwise we might go until midnight and never have a vote. I am just \nwondering if the distinguished manager might comment on this.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield to me.\n  I am prepared to respond and advise the Senate that the majority \nleader has given his consent and as a matter of fact requested that we \ntry to identify the amendments, get time agreements on them, and stack \nvotes tomorrow, and vote on final passage tomorrow. The point is, that \nwe will continue to work here tonight though on those amendments we \ncannot agree on for votes, and with time agreements tomorrow. So this \nmay not be the end of the session as far as the managers are concerned \nand Senators who have amendments.\n  But we know of, for instance, this amendment which will require a \nvote. We know the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Nevada, have \nanother amendment on the Market Promotion Program; and that will \nrequire a rollcall vote. The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, \nhas an amendment to strike special grants, research grants from this \nbill. And we cannot accept that, so we will have to move to table that \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Those are three amendments that I know of that will require rollcall \nvotes. We hope that the others will either not be offered or we can \naccept them on a voice vote and work out something that is satisfactory \nthat would not require a rollcall vote. We are trying to see if we can \ndo final passage on a voice vote. I would have no objection to that, if \nno one Senator insists on a rollcall vote. That means we could vote on \nthe conference report when it comes back with a rollcall vote.\n  I am told we do have to have one vote. We have to vote on the Stevens \namendment. I have just been advised on that. It would be nice if \neverybody got their stories straight and requests before I made these \nannouncements like I knew what I was doing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why do we not just vote on it?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think we are prepared to vote. There are a couple \nother Senators that need to speak on the Stevens amendment. Why do not \nwe do this and get the Stevens amendment over, and as we vote on that \nwe can announce the schedule for the evening and tomorrow rather than \ntalk about what we are doing. Rather than talk about it, let us just do \nit.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief, and following the \nfew remarks I have will move to table the amendment. So we will have a \nvote here very shortly.\n  First of all, I want to say that I understand some of the \nfrustrations my Western Senator friends experience. Let me also say \nthat while I am not a Western Senator, I have experienced a lot of the \nsame frustrations but in other areas. I got terribly agitated at one \ntime about the National Forest Service not allowing what I thought was \nan adequate timber cut in the Ouachitas and Ozarks that was having an \nadverse effect on the industry.\n  But let me just say--and I do not want to argue about these specific \nthings. I know that Judge Hogan handed the Northwest a big victory this \nweek in Federal court. That is exactly where these issues ought to be \nresolved. I labored 12 years under Presidents Reagan and Bush \ndisagreeing with a vast majority of their policies and their \ninterpretations of the law.\n  When I was Governor--and this is not unusual at the State level--\noccasionally some legislator would establish some little cabal with \nother members of the legislature because they had it in for somebody \nbecause they did not get what they wanted, and I would invariably have \nto deal with them or use a line-item veto.\n  Now, Mr. President, bear in mind we have serious disagreements on \npolicy around here. We have serious disagreements on the interpretation \nof the law. Some people hate the Endangered Species Act and they do not \nwant it enforced under any conditions, and so any excuse they can find \nto lambaste whoever is charged with the responsibility of enforcing it \nbecomes the focal point.\n  But the Senate cannot be judge, jury and executioner under our \nConstitution. The genius of the Constitution is we have three branches \nof the Federal Government, Mr. President. And there is not a single \nMember of Congress that would change one jot and tittle. Sometimes \nthere are so many changes proposed around here on the Constitution you \nwould think it was just a rough draft, and that we were charged with \nthe responsibility of finishing it.\n  Whether you like Bill Clinton or not, he is the President. Whether \nyou like the people he hired or not, that is his prerogative. Whether \nyou like the policy or not, they are charged under the last election \nwith the responsibility of setting policy. And if you do not like the \nway they enforce the law, take them to court, as the Northwest did. \nJudge Hogan just gave, as I say, I think 1,700,000,000 feet. And that \nis a real victory for Oregon and Washington. I might also say that it \nwas Bill Clinton who went to the Northwest and crafted a plan, which \nsomebody said tonight Secretary Lyons was the focal point of this \ndebate, Secretary Lyons crafted the agreement, and got it out from the \ncourt.\n  Let me remind you of something. The Northwest had been stopped dead \nin its tracks for timber cutting, long before Bill Clinton was elected \nPresident, by the courts. And because of the Constitution, there is not \nanything much anybody can do about that except appeal it or elect \nsomebody who will change the law.\n  So I just want to say, I might agree with the Senator from Alaska \nabout a particular personality, I might even agree with the Senators \nfrom Alaska, Montana and Colorado and Idaho on a policy that I think \nthe administration is wrong on. But I have never, nor will I ever, come \nto the floor of the U.S. Senate and try to cut somebody's salary off or \nsay, ``You may not, Mr. Secretary, delegate this responsibility and \nthat responsibility to this person or this office.''\n  This amendment does not categorically say that we are cutting the \nsalary of Secretary Lyons. What it says is we are giving the money from \nhis office to the Secretary, and the Secretary is charged with the \nresponsibility of taking away from Secretary Lyons any responsibility \nin the area he now administers relating to forest management issues. It \nis a dangerous precedent.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to remind my good friends over on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, things always change. There is just a \npossibility, just a possibility, that one day in the not too distant \nfuture there will be more seats on this side of the aisle than there \nare on that side, there will be a Republican in the White House. You \nset a precedent like this, those things that are bad policy for the \nU.S. Senate have a tendency to come home to haunt you.\n  It is a very bad, in my opinion, flailing of the Constitution to say, \n``Mr. Executive Branch, we will decide who you can hire. We will decide \nwho you can keep.''\n  We are the legislative branch. We should recognize it and we ought to \nhonor the Constitution and the legislative branch.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not know how many more people want \nto speak around here. Everybody has been parading to my desk to say, \n``Let us vote. Let us vote.'' I thought everybody on this side that \nspoke--even the Senator from Idaho had forsaken his chance for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Would the Senator not move to table for maybe 5, 6 \nminutes? I think the Senator from Idaho would \n\n[[Page S13829]]\nlike to make a brief statement, and certainly I would like to make a \nbrief statement.\n  I would urge the Senator to withhold.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want people who have not spoken to have \nthe opportunity to do so. If the Senator from Idaho wants to speak for \n5 minutes; the Senator from Montana wants to speak for 5 minutes, I am \nnot going to disagree with them.\n\n  Let me propound this unanimous consent request: That the Senator from \nIdaho be given 5 minutes and the Senator from Montana 5 minutes, after \nwhich I will be recognized to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a great deal of what the Senator from \nArkansas has spoken to this evening is true. He and I do not disagree \nin the way that policy should be managed. We may disagree on the \nsubstance of policy, but I think both he and I respect the process, and \nwe certainly respect the law.\n  The great frustration we have this evening, Mr. President, when we \ntalk about this particular Under Secretary, is his arrogance in \nignoring the law. Right after this administration came to power and \nthis Under Secretary took power, he inherited a set of draft \nregulations that were being formulated as a result of this Congress \nunder Democrat rule having passed an appropriations bill with appeals \nlanguage. Very specifically, that bill spoke to the kind of appeals \nlanguage we wanted to see inside the U.S. Forest Service.\n  This Under Secretary ignored that law, ignored the draft regulations, \nand went in an opposite direction totally. That is why we have this \nfight on the floor tonight. Amongst other things, he ignored the law. \nHe ignored law that was crafted by a majority Democrat Party of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  That is the reality we are facing. Try to find a reason to defend \nthis man for his actions and my guess is, you will have difficulty.\n  I would like to add to the Record a letter tonight which speaks to \nhow this Under Secretary has handled his responsibility.\n  This letter is addressed to Michelle Gilbert, U.S. Department of \nJustice, Environment and Natural Resources Division, and it says:\n\n       This letter is to inform you that the Northwest Forest \n     Resource Council will move this week for an order to show \n     cause to hold Jim Lyons in contempt of court.\n\n  Yes, the judge ruled, but Under Secretary Lyons ignores. That is what \nwe are facing.\n  I would agree with you, we should not be crafting policy in the \npublic courts of this land, but when a member of this administration \nignores the law and the court tells him to do something and he \ncontinues to ignore it, then one finds it necessary to move for \ncontempt of court. It is beyond my memory that any member of the Bush \nadministration was held in contempt of court. That is why I very \nreluctantly agree with the Senator from Alaska.\n  This is no way to deal with anyone in Government, but when nothing \nelse can deliver the message to this person, and now he is being held \nin contempt of court, it is time that this Senate speaks out. Time and \ntime again, he has ignored our actions.\n  I cannot understand why anyone from either side of the aisle would \nargue in defense of this person when he puts together a Forest Service \nreorganization plan and begins to implement it and does not even seek \nour counsel. We have that responsibility to craft public policy. We \ndemanded that he come up here, and that was a bipartisan request.\n  The Senator from Montana is here. The Under Secretary attempted to \nwipe out a major unit of the Forest Service in that Senator's State. \nAnd we said, ``No, that is no way to run this place. Come sit down with \nus and work out the differences,'' and we finally forced him to do \nthat.\n  That is why the Senator from Alaska, and a good many of us, have \nthrown our hands in the air and said, ``What are we to do if we write \nlaw and it is ignored. This individual is ultimately gutting an \norganization in a way that makes it incapable of managing the public \nlaws of this land that we have passed?''\n  So I hope tonight the Senate will uphold the motion of the Senator \nfrom Alaska and not vote to table. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am not going to take my full 5 minutes. \nWe are presented with a problem here. On the one hand, those of us who \nknow Under Secretary Lyons, who have dealt with him, at the very least, \nquestion his policies and question the advisability of him staying in \noffice. On the other hand, I think we all agree that it probably is not \nwise, and it is not good policy to fire somebody by legislation.\n  The better route would be for us to change policy when we disagree \nwith what an administration is doing, and work to try to get the person \ninvolved to change the views he has taken.\n  I, frankly, am disappointed with Under Secretary Lyons for many \nreasons. I supported his confirmation, voted for the confirmation. \nUnfortunately, due to a whole host of things that have occurred, some \nof which have been referred to tonight, I must say the time has come, \nin my judgment, for Under Secretary Lyons to gracefully tender his \nresignation.\n  I do not support the amendment before us, only because I think this \nis just not good policy. It is not good policy for us by legislation to \nfire somebody in the executive branch. There are better ways of doing \nthis. I urge Senators to not support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Alaska. But I also urge Under Secretary Lyons to not only \nlisten to the words, but listen to the music and realize that he should \nprobably leave.\n  We have a saying in the West that when someone has crossed the line \nand gone too far ``he's broken his pick.'' Regrettably, Under Secretary \nLyons has broken his pick in the West. The time has come to make some \nchanges, not by legislation, but by urging Secretary Lyons and the \nadministration to find some graceful way for him to no longer hold the \nposition that he now has.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I strongly urge \nnot only Under Secretary Lyons but others involved to take appropriate \naction and put this matter to rest.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and \nthe Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] is \nabsent due to illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], \nthe Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn], the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. \nJohnston], the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 446 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm \n\n[[Page S13830]]\n\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Dorgan\n     Glenn\n     Hatfield\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Moynihan\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2696) was \nrejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2696) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous-\nconsent agreement in hopes the Senate will approve our setting over \nuntil tomorrow all remaining votes on amendments that require votes. So \nI put the following request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments in order to \nH.R. 1976 under the previous consent agreement must be offered and \ndebated tonight and that any rollcall votes ordered with respect to \nthose amendments be postponed to occur beginning at 9:45 a.m. on \nWednesday.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FORD. He is just reserving.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the managers, we have worked for \nsome time today to try to figure out if there was a way of working out \nan amendment. We have just received word from CBO that the means of \npaying for it are not acceptable, and I am wondering if there is a way \nfor us to have the evening and potentially a vote tomorrow; that we \nhave a place reserved for a vote if we are able to find an offset, but \none that might not be agreed to on both sides so that we can at least \nhave a vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield under his \nreservation, I think that certainly would be possible in this way. The \nSenator can offer his amendment tonight, say whatever he wanted to in \nsupport of it, and I could move to table it and ask for the yeas and \nnays. That will be voted on tomorrow. The Senator could be assured that \nthere would be a vote on his amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me ask this. Will the managers agree to permit me to \nmodify the amendment, if we were able to find an alternative means of \nfinancing it, overnight, working collectively, together?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I \ncertainly would not arbitrarily or capriciously refuse a legitimate \nrequest for a modification. If the amendment is changed entirely in its \nnature, I could not agree to that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, if we were to have a gentleman's understanding--I \nhave full faith in the word of the Senator from Mississippi and in his \ngood faith.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think the Senator could be assured we would not \narbitrarily refuse such a request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That will certainly be sufficient for me. Would we be \nmodifying, then, this unanimous-consent agreement, or would it not \nrequire a modification?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not think it is necessary with that understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Mississippi?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from North \nDakota has an amendment for which he has not yet found a suitable \noffset. It needs to be understood by everybody, if he offers the \namendment tonight he will be offering it without an offset. That is, I \nassume, the modification that he wants to make, as soon as he hears \nfrom CBO.\n  What we need to clarify for sure is, if the Senator from Mississippi \nmoves to table his amendment tonight, the agreement should be that even \nthough a motion to table had been made, that he would have a right \nbefore the vote tomorrow to modify, to set out what the offset is. Is \nthat a fair statement?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That accurately reflects my assurance and the \nunderstanding I would be happy to have with the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a minute? I ask the manager of \nthe bill, should that not be in the agreement? If the offset is found, \nit has to be agreeable, I suspect, to the manager. You just would not \ntake any arbitrary offset.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am not agreeing to support the amendment, that is what \nI am saying.\n  Mr. FORD. I just want to be sure that someone who is not here \ntonight, in all respect to their position and their ability, if it is \nnot in the unanimous-consent agreement and they come in here and object \nto it--even though the Senator is very persuasive that does not \nhappen--then my friend from North Dakota is excluded, I think, from \nmaking his modification once the Senator has moved to table and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I respect the suggestion. I have no problem including \nthat in this agreement if the Senator would like to insert that in this \nagreement.\n  Mr. FORD. I think the Senator needs to do that, and I hope he would.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I modify the request to include the right \nof the Senator from North Dakota to modify his amendment to show a \ndifferent offset on tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nthere will be no further votes this evening. However, Senators who \nintend to offer amendments must remain this evening to debate those \namendments, and any rollcall votes ordered with respect to the \namendments would occur beginning at 9:45 a.m., in a stacked sequence.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if we could have a time \nagreement with the Senator from Wisconsin, a 20-minute time agreement \nwith 15 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin and 5 minutes for the \nmanagers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2697\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds for the special \nresearch grants program that are not subject to a competitive approval \n                                process)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2697.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SPECIAL RESEARCH GRANTS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available under \n     this Act for the program established under section 2(c) of \n     Public Law 89-106 (7 U.S.C. 450i(c)) may be used for a grant \n     that is not subject to a competitive process and a scientific \n     peer review evaluation by qualified scientists in the Federal \n     Government, colleges and universities, State agricultural \n     experiment stations, and the private sector.\n       (b) Deficit Reduction.--Any funds made available under this \n     Act that are not expended because of subsection (a) shall \n     revert to the general fund of the Treasury for deficit \n     reduction.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment I am introducing tonight \nwill make a very simple change to the way in which some of USDA's \nresearch funds are distributed.\n  Right at the beginning, let me just correct a statement by the senior \nSenator from Mississippi which I think \n\n[[Page S13831]]\nwas just a brief description. He suggested that our amendment would \nstrike the special purpose grant within the Department. It does not do \nthat at all. It does not change the amount of the grant. It changes the \nway in which the grants are given. It requires a competitive approach \nrather than what is, in effect, an earmark approach.\n  So I want to be very clear throughout this debate that we are not \nstriking the grants nor changing the way they would be given out.\n  The amendment would require any funds appropriated under the Special \nResearch Grants Program within the Cooperative State Research Education \nand Extension Service be subject now to scientific peer review by \nscientists outside of USDA and that all research grants be awarded \nunder this program on a competitive basis.\n  I am happy that the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is a \ncosponsor of the amendment as well.\n  This particular program, the Special Research Grants Program, \nprovides grants to State agricultural experiment stations, 1,890 \ninstitutions and land grant colleges to carry out applied agricultural \nresearch in fulfillment of USDA's mission to encourage and support \nagricultural research within the federal land grants and other research \ninstitutions. In conjunction with the many other programs conducting \nagricultural research, the Special Grants Program has helped foster \nimportant agricultural research.\n  As members of this Chamber may be aware, I have been working with \nbipartisan coalition of Senators to reduce the amount of so-called pork \nbarrel spending in appropriations legislation. This amendment is \nintended to further that goal by addressing what I call hidden pork in \nthis appropriations bill. The Special Research Grants Program while \nfairly straight forward on the surface, is actually not what it seems \nupon closer inspection.\n  USDA's Special Research Grants Program receives a single \nappropriation each year to fund the many grants for agricultural \nresearch conducted by universities around the country. Last year, \nCongress provided $52 million for these special research grants. This \nyear, the Senate Appropriations Committee has provided about $50.5 \nmillion for special grants, of which some $9.8 million is to be focused \non improved pest control research.\n  The funding for this program is very straightforward with only four \nlines devoted to it in H.R. 1976.\n  However, when I looked at the committee report accompanying this \nbill, I noticed an extensive list of projects that the Committee has \nrecommended for funding under special research grants. I counted over \n90 in all for this upcoming fiscal year. Looking at last year's \nconference agreement, I found 121 such projects, most of which are \nidentified by one or more states.\n  Then I learned, that in fact, while these projects are not \ntechnically earmarks, in that they are not line-itemed in the actual \nappropriations legislation, USDA treats them exactly as if they were \nearmarks.\n  So they are in the committee report. But they end up being treated \nlike earmarks. Of the 121 projects recommended for funding last year, \nall but one grant was awarded and that single grant had its funds \nrescinded. Based on information I received from USDA, of those 120 \nprojects, not a single grant was awarded on a competitive basis and \neach grant was made in accordance with the Agricultural appropriations \nSubcommittee's recommendations.\n  I am sure that are many Members in this Chamber who will tell me that \ncommittee reports of course are technically non-binding. That may be \ntechnically true, but if the agency administering the program considers \nthose recommendations to be binding, they most surely are. Mr. \nPresident, the recommendations for projects to be funded under the \nSpecial Research Grants Program are most certainly earmarks. Every \nMember of this Chamber who has even had a project in his/her State \nrecommended for funding under this program, or has asked for a project \nto be on that list of recommendations, knows that is the case.\n  In fact, in the bill before us today, very little of the money \nproposed to be provided to universities will be awarded competitively \nand subject to scientific peer review. These institutions listed in the \ncommittee report simply submit their proposals and receive their funds \nwith few questions asked by the agency.\n  I do not want to pick on any particular State or university, but I \nthink it is important that Members understand specifically what \nprojects they are agreeing to fund under this program. Let me just list \na few of the 90 some projects that are earmarked in the committee \nreport: there are recommendations for eight separate research projects \nrelating to aquaculture to be provided to six different universities \nfor a total of $2.5 million for fiscal year 1996. Some of those \nrecommendations are for projects that are described by the committee, \nothers are for research generally on ``Aquaculture''. We have earmarks \nfor: $300,000 for molluscan shellfish research at Oregon State \nUniversity; $127,000 for multicropping strategies for aquaculture--\nUniversity of Hawaii; $370,000 for Chesapeake Bay aquaculture--\nUniversity of Maryland; $305,000 for seafood and aquaculture \nharvesting, processing, and marketing research--Mississippi State \nUniversity; $308,000 for alternative marine and fresh water species \nresearch--Mississippi State University.\n\n  And then there are the less descriptive earmarks: $592,000 \naquaculture, Mississippi State University; $330,000 aquaculture, \nLouisiana State University; $169,000 aquaculture, University of \nIllinois.\n  All totaled $2.5 million earmarked for eight different research \nprojects on aquaculture for six different research institutions.\n  Should not it be enough for Congress to merely recommend that \naquaculture, generally, be a research priority and leave the specific \nprojects, funding amounts and research institutions up to the USDA and \nexternal peer-review panels.\n  Mr. President, here is a sampling of some of the other projects that \nthe Senate will be earmarking in this bill: $296,000 for jointed \ngoatgrass research by the Washington State University; $303,000 for \nsoybean cyst nematode research--University of Missouri; $162,000 for \npeach tree shortlife research at Clemson University.\n  Some of the projects have vague descriptions such as ``forestry'' or \n``dried beans,'' so it is difficult to know what the designated \ninstitutions will be doing with the money nor is it clear why these are \nprojects of national priority that they are specifically identified in \nthe committee report.\n  Mr. President, the question for my colleagues is not whether research \non aquaculture, jointed goatgrass, or the soybean cyst nematode should \nbe conducted. That is not at issue.\n  At issue is whether Congress should be making these very technical \ndecision for the agricultural sector and for the USDA.\n  First, should Congress be defining for USDA research specialists the \ncurrent research needs of agriculture down to the exact dollar and \nfacility conducting the research?\n  Second, should Congress determine which research projects have the \ngreatest scientific or economic merit?\n  Third, should Congress pick and choose among competing research \ninstitutions and decide, based on political circumstances, which \nUniversities should receive the funding?\n  Fourth, is it at the business of Congress to decide how much of \ntaxpayer dollars each project should receive? Can Congress effectively \ndetermine for over 90 research projects what costs are reasonable and \nwhich ones are not?\n  Mr. President, I believe that in a time of shrinking Federal dollars \nfor vital agriculture research, the answer to all four of these \nquestions has to be ``no.'' Congress is not equipped to make these \ndecisions, and it should not be our job to make those decisions. In too \nmany cases too many projects are being funded for political reasons \nrather than scientific reasons. An agricultural researcher's chance of \ngetting Federal tax dollars should not depend on whether that \nresearcher has a person on the Appropriations Committee.\n  The amendment I am offering today ensures that research moneys under \nthe Special Research Grants Program will be awarded to research \ninstitutions that submit proposals for projects that are consistent \nwith the research needs of agriculture, that are competitive with \nrespect to the cost of \n\n[[Page S13832]]\nthe project and the non-Federal matching funds, and have scientific or \neconomic merit as determined by an external peer review panel.\n  Congress under this can still recommend projects for funding, but \nthose recommended projects will have to compete among a pool of other \nqualified research institutions. If they cannot pass the competitive \ntest of merit and peer review, then the project should not and will not \nbe funded.\n  In 1994, the National Research Council stated that there remains \nconsiderable scope for expansion of the use of competitive grants at \nUSDA and, equally important, the use of peer review.\n  The advantages of this different more competitive approach are \nindisputable.\n  First, competitive grants are responsive and flexible and can be \nadjusted to agricultural funding priorities consistent with national \nneeds and the public interest.\n  In 1993, before the Senate Subcommittee on Agriculture Research, the \nGAO reported that congressional earmarking of research dollars was \nidentified as one of the factors inhibiting USDA from focusing research \ndollars on current research priorities.\n  During that same hearing, USDA witnesses indicated specifically that \ncongressional earmarking had prevented them from redirecting research \ndollars for the more current needs.\n  Second, competition attracts new scientists, researchers and \neconomists to an area of research typically reserved to a few select \ninstitutions with entree to Congress. That can only be good for \nresearch that attempts to solve otherwise unresolved problems.\n  Third, competition in grant awards provides taxpayers and farmers \nwith greater assurances that limited research dollars are being spent \nwisely and in the most cost-beneficial manner possible. It is that last \npoint that I think is really critical.\n  Over the last 25 years, USDA's research budget in terms of real \ndollars has actually declined. Of course, now in our efforts to balance \nthe budget research funds will probably continue to take greater hits. \nThe proposed budget for CSREES research in fiscal year 1996 is down $14 \nmillion from fiscal year 1995. Compared to just 2 years ago, the \nfunding for the Special Research Grants Program alone is down by $18 \nmillion.\n  Congress can no longer afford to operate the way we have for the last \n25 years. It is time to open up the Special Research Grants Program to \ncompetition and peer review. While this programming accounts for only 5 \npercent of the budget, it accounts for about one-third of the \nnonformula research grants made by the agency, so it is pretty \nsubstantial. It is a critical component of this Nation's research \nagenda for agriculture.\n  So to conclude, let me be clear. My amendment does not cut any \nfunding for the Special Research Grants Program. It does not, as was \nstated earlier in the Chamber, strike any of that funding. It merely \nimposes a process whereby research grants will be directed towards the \nmost relevant research in the most cost beneficial manner. I think we \nowe it to taxpayers and consumers and farmers and others in the area of \nagriculture to adopt this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time under the \nagreement as I may consume.\n  The debate about special grants and research projects for agriculture \nis not a new debate. There have been differences of opinion about how \nmuch should be allocated for basic research, how much should be in \napplied research, whether the Agriculture Research Service Federal \nlaboratories ought to do it all, whether State land-grant universities \nand the experiment stations attached to them should do some of the \nresearch and, if so, how much? What is the role of State government in \nall of this? Do they have an obligation to participate? Are matching \nfunds to be required in every instance for research and the \nconstruction of research facilities?\n  There are a lot of different issues involved in the agriculture \nresearch portion of this bill. We have tried to carefully review the \nrequests this committee has received from Members of Congress, from \noutside groups, from others--the administration in its budget request.\n  We have considered their suggestions to try to have a careful and \nthoughtful balance among all of these competing interests and to do it \nin a way that safeguards the interests of the taxpayers that their \ndollars not be wasted.\n  There is no question that this bill is loyal to the responsibility of \nassuring that these dollars are invested to benefit American \nagriculture. They are not boondoggles. They are not pork barrel \nprojects with no merit. As a matter of fact, many studies have \ndocumented the substantial public benefits which result from these \ninvestments in agriculture research. We need to maintain our \ntechnological advantage in American production agriculture to help \nensure that our farmers can continue to operate profitably and protect \nthe soil and water resources we have that are in many cases very \nfragile. And so we have a lot at stake in how these dollars are spent. \nWe want them to be spent correctly.\n  The debate really is in some instances not on whether the research \nought to be done but who does it and who decides who does it. This \nargument about peer review is suggesting that those who are the self-\nstyled and self-anointed experts decide.\n  As Members of the Congress we have the responsibility of ensuring the \ncareful and frugal expenditure of public taxpayer dollars so we are \ndirectly accountable and answerable to the public for any appropriation \nof funds along these lines that we approve. I am not ready to delegate \nthe responsibility that the people of my State of Mississippi have \nentrusted in me to come here and help ensure that our State's \ninterests, our State agriculture interests are taken into account in \nthe research decisions that are made.\n  I am not going to delegate to some fancy group of scientists in some \nother State the authority to decide where the tax dollars that are paid \nby Mississippians are spent in agriculture research. I am not sure they \nwill always come down on the side of the agriculture interests that we \nhave in our region. So I wish to continue to play a role in it, and to \ndo that we have to continue to exercise our responsibilities as Members \nof the Congress to determine how our tax dollars are spent.\n  That is what this bill does. It gives our colleagues and this Senate, \na voice in where these dollars go and for what they are spent. The \nargument for competitive peer-review grants versus special grants, in \nmy opinion, focuses on who is going to make the decisions regarding the \nallocation of Federal funds among competing legitimate demands. There \nis competition between the experiment stations, land-grant \ninstitutions, and other institutions.\n  It has been suggested that since each system has strengths and \nweaknesses, the arguments about the merits of the system should be cast \nin terms of the relative mix rather than their absolute merit. But we \nthink we have done a good job.\n  Mr. President, $707 million for basic and applied research in this \nbill will be conducted at Federal laboratories, $40.7 million will go \nto special grants, and $99.5 million will go to competitive grants \nthrough the National Research Initiative. We think special grants play \nan important role because they address special local and regional \nneeds. The authority for these special grants is spelled out in the \nlaw, Public Law 86-106. This authority provides that grants may be \nawarded to State agriculture experiment stations, land-grant colleges, \nuniversities, and other qualified institutions for the purposes of \nfacilitating or expanding ongoing State-Federal food agriculture \nresearch programs.\n  Those who argue against these special research grants suggest that \njust because they are recommended by Members of Congress they have no \nmerit or not as much as if they had been recommended by somebody else. \nI disagree with that. And so I think this is based on an erroneous \nassumption. The Senate ought to reject the amendment. I argue strongly \nfor Senators to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  \n[[Page S13833]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \nSenator from Mississippi. I admire his leadership in the agriculture \narea.\n  Let me use the brief time I have remaining to respond to a couple of \npoints he has made about our amendment.\n  First of all, I just do not see how it is possible for a committee, \ndespite its tremendous efforts with the staff and resources of the \nAppropriations Committee, to make this kind of sophisticated analysis \nand competitive determination that is sufficient to make a fair \ndetermination of competition.\n  The Senator says these are meritorious projects. I do not deny that. \nCertainly many of them are meritorious. How do we know? What is the \ncriteria for evaluating whether or not the 120 out of 121 projects that \nwere mentioned in the committee report last year were actually of merit \nto justify the taxpayers' dollars?\n  And given the comments of the Senator from Mississippi, in \nparticular, how he does not want this process left up to a fancy group \nof scientists, well, this is about a $50 million program. The National \nResearch Initiative, Mr. President, is a $100 million program, and that \nis left up to a fancy group of scientists. We do have peer review when \nit comes to $100 million worth. Why not have that fancy group of \nscientists--actually that is what they are, people who know what they \nare talking about from an economic and agricultural point of view--why \nnot have those people handling the other $50 million and make it a fair \ncompetition?\n  What it comes down to, Mr. President, is what kind of competition are \nwe going to have? The Senator from Mississippi fairly points out there \nis a competition of sorts for these earmarks. It is a political \ncompetition. It is a question of political muscle, who has got the most \nmuscle to get a grant. I suggest that we need a different kind of \ncompetition, a competition based on merit. Many of us were elected and \nmany of us particularly last year who came to this body were elected on \nthe notion that we should run this Government like a business on the \nbasis of merit, on the basis of quality, quality control. That is what \nthis is all about, having some quality control in the midst of a very \nwell intended series of efforts to improve agricultural research in \nthis country. I thank the Chair and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, has all time been used on the amendment \nunder the agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we have other amendments that can \nbe disposed of tonight, or argued.\n  I notice the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Arkansas have a \nMarket Promotion Program amendment which they intend to present. The \nSenator from North Dakota has an amendment which he can propose and \ndescribe, if he chooses, at this time or we can defer it to later.\n  But we are going to proceed to try to meet the challenge of getting \nall these amendments argued tonight so we will know what we are going \nto vote on tomorrow. We appreciate the cooperation of the Senators.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2698\n\n(Purpose: To provide that producers of a 1995 crop are not required to \n repay advance deficiency payments made for the crop if the producers \n       have suffered a loss due to weather or related condition)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2698.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . REPAYMENT OF ADVANCE DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR 1995 \n                   DISASTER LOSSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (G) and (H) \n     of section 114(a)(2) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1445j(a)(2)), if the producers on a farm received an \n     advance deficiency payment for the 1995 crop of a commodity \n     and suffered a loss in the production of the crop due to \n     weather or related condition, the producers shall not be \n     required to repay an amount of the payment that is equal to, \n     subject to subsection (b), the product obtained by \n     multiplying the applicable crop acreage base and the farm \n     program payment yield.\n       (b) Limitations.--The amount of the payment that the \n     producers on a farm are not required to repay under \n     subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) not exceed $2,500; and\n       (2) not be available for production on which crop insurance \n     coverage is available, as determined by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n       (c) Funding.--Up to $35,000,000 that has been made \n     available to carry out the export enhancement program \n     established under section 301 of the Agriculture Trade Act of \n     1978 (7 U.S.C. 5651) during fiscal year 1996 may be used to \n     carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the patience and the \nindulgence of the Chair as well.\n  Mr. President, I will try to be brief. The amendment that I have sent \nto the desk would deal with a very serious problem that is developing \naround the country. I am sure it affects producers in the State of the \nChair; I am certain it affects the producers in the States of the \nmanagers. It deals with the problem of producers suffering crop losses \nthis year because of very serious planting problems that developed \naround the country.\n  In many parts of the country we had excess moisture; in other parts \nof the country we had an extraordinary wave of heat that dropped the \nvalue of crops and in many cases destroyed crops for our producers.\n  Unfortunately, producers lucky enough to plant a crop were often met \nwith these difficult conditions, and in some cases producers were not \nable to get a crop at all. The result is that producers who had the \nexpense of planting a crop received an advance deficiency payment.\n  On wheat that amounted to 35 cents a bushel. Because of the crop \nsituation in this country and around the world, prices then went up \ndramatically, which will require farmers to repay those advance \ndeficiency payments, and in some cases they do not have a crop at all. \nIn other words, farmers are being sent a large bill but have no crop \nfrom which to derive income to pay the bill back.\n  Now, in previous years a disaster payment would have been available \nto meet this situation. But now we do not have a disaster payment. We \ndo have crop insurance. And what my amendment would do is say to \nproducers, to the extent your crop could not be covered by crop \ninsurance, you would be forgiven the advance deficiency payment if you \nhave had a crop failure. We would also attach an additional provision. \nWe would provide that no farmer would get more than $2,500 in \nforgiveness of advance deficiency payments.\n  Now, I understand $2,500 may sound like a lot to some people. To \nfarmers who have very large expenses, it may sound like not much, but \nat least it would help offset the costs of putting in a crop, not \ngetting any production, and then being expected to repay an advance \ndeficiency payment when you have no income with which to pay it. And \nagain I want to emphasize to my colleagues, we have provided that this \nis only available to the extent that crop insurance could not cover the \ncrop affected.\n  In other words, let us say that a farmer took out the 75 percent \ncoverage under crop insurance; only the 25 percent that could not be \ncovered under crop insurance would be eligible for this forgiveness of \nadvance deficiency payment. So on no bushel, not one, would any farmer \nreceive crop insurance and a forgiveness of an advance deficiency \npayment.\n  In addition, if a farmer had chosen only to get 60 percent coverage \nand 75 percent coverage was available, he would only qualify as if he \nhad the 75 percent coverage. Obviously we do not want to create a \nperverse incentive by saying to the guy that went out and purchased the \n75 percent coverage, ``You know, you were a fool to do that because the \nGovernment is going to come in here and at least forgive your \n\n[[Page S13834]]\nadvance deficiency payment on that part not covered by crop \ninsurance.''\n  So we have tried to target this in a way that makes sense. We worked \nwith the Congressional Budget Office. They now tell us this would cost \n$35 million. We have offset that by reducing the amount available for \nthe Export Enhancement Program next year by that $35 million. In other \nwords, we say reduce by up to $35 million the amount available in the \nExport Enhancement Program for next year in order to fully pay for the \nforgiveness of advanced deficiencies for farmers who had disaster this \nyear.\n  Again, I think we have crafted this in a careful way. Let me just say \nthat this year on the EEP program we had $800 million authorized. We \nknow we are going to only use $400 million. We had $800 million \nauthorized, and we will use something less than $400 million.\n  I say to my colleagues, at least for the purposes of getting this to \nthe conference committee, let us have a vehicle out there that allows \nus to forgive these advanced deficiencies to a total of $2,500 per \nfarmer, and only on those bushels where they do not have crop insurance \nor could not have had crop insurance to offset some of the disaster we \nsee around the country.\n  Many parts of the country--I know in the South the cotton crop was \nadversely affected by unusual heat. It came at a critical time and as a \nresult that crop was damaged. In my part of the country we had \nflooding, most unusual flooding. I know in the State of the Chair, that \nflooding and wet conditions were serious. As a result, we have a whole \nseries of disease problems.\n  With that, I would thank the chairman for his assistance this \nafternoon and this evening in trying to put something together.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when the Senator from North Dakota \nbrought this amendment to my attention and said that he would offer it, \nmy immediate reaction was I favored it. I thought it certainly tried to \ndo some of what we were doing yesterday, or endeavoring to do, when we \noffered the disaster assistance proposal to benefit those cotton \nfarmers in the South who had suffered such terrible losses this year \nbecause of the infestation of army budworms, tobacco budworms, beet \narmy worms.\n  These damages were heightened and made much worse because of the \nserious weather conditions. The excessive heat in many areas of our \nState, and I think this is true of Alabama and other Southern States, \nmade this disaster possible. We are told by the entomologists and the \nexperts this is a weather-related disaster, but it is more commonly \nreferred to as infestation of pests that have caused these damages. In \nmy State alone, over $100 million in losses are going to be sustained, \nthey say, by cotton producers alone.\n  So I think this amendment may very well help some of those farmers. \nThey were denied any extra help under the amendment that we had before \nthe Senate on a rollcall vote. I think one of the reasons that \namendment was defeated is because it was crop specific; it was targeted \nonly to cotton producers. This amendment is not targeted to any \nspecific kind of crop or farmer or region or State.\n  Before we get to a point of voting on the amendment, I am going to \ntry to find out from those who know whether it will apply and provide \nassistance to Mississippi cotton farmers. I may end up voting for the \namendment. I hope I can support it. But at this time tonight, I am not \nable to recommend approval of the amendment, because of the questions \nabout the offset and the scoring.\n  If it is going to cost $35 million, where does the Department, or the \nones making these estimates, think the benefits will go? Will they all \ngo to the prairie, the North part of the farm belt, the Dakotas and \nthat part of the country, and if so, how will it actually work? So \nthere are questions that we still have to explore, and I hope by \ntomorrow when we get to a vote on this amendment, we will have those \nanswers.\n  I am certainly not going to criticize the Senator for bringing this \namendment up. My heart is where his is, and that is with these farmers \nwho have sustained these terrible damages. I regret that the crop \ninsurance program that we have now is big on promise but short on \ndelivery of benefits to help in the recovery from serious disasters. \nThat is what we learned, I think, in Mississippi this year, that the \nnew Catastrophic Crop Insurance Program is a disaster in itself.\n  There has been a lot of hype. Farmers were told, ``Don't worry, \nyou're automatically eligible for these benefits. For $50, you're \nsigned up.'' It sounded too good to be true, and guess what? It is too \ngood to be true, because the benefits they are getting do not nearly \nequal what others had been getting from ad hoc benefit assistance \nprograms in the past. They were told, ``You are going to get about the \nsame level of benefit that you would have under a disaster assistance \nprogram passed by Congress.'' It has not turned out that way. I \nsympathize with the farmers who have been misled and have not bought \nadditional insurance to make up for what their losses could have been.\n  Those are my reactions to the amendment, and comments. We will have \nan opportunity to vote on the amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I just say that this has been \ndesigned with all farmers in mind. This has not been designed to \nbenefit just one region or one crop. We know that losses have been \nsevere throughout farm country from different situations in different \nparts of the country. In our part of the country, in an unusual turn of \nevents, we have had too much water. That is a rarity in North Dakota, I \nmight say. We have a million acres not planted in the State of North \nDakota. That is truly a rarity.\n  But we know that there are different circumstances. In Indiana, they \nhad excess heat at the time the crop was forming and, as a result, \nsignificant losses. I know Missouri has had the same problem North \nDakota has, and terrible disease problems as a result of excess \nmoisture. I know Mississippi has had problems as a result of weather \nconditions there.\n  The one thing farmers cannot do much about are the vagaries of \nweather and price. This year, prices have shot up, and that is terrific \nfor those farmers who have a crop, but if you do not have a crop, it \nmeans you are going to have to pay back your advance deficiency payment \nat the very time you do not have the crop to get the income to pay it \nback.\n  I had a farmer call me the other day and he said, ``Senator Conrad, I \nhave a bill coming due to pay back my advance deficiency payment, \n$8,000. I got no crop, and I got no money. I had the expense of \nplanting. I had the expense of fertilizing, and I had the expense of \nputting it all in. Then we had disastrous flooding. So I've got no \ncrop, and I have a bill coming due for another $8,000, and there's no \nway I can pay it. It is really not fair.''\n  And just as the Senator from Mississippi described, those of us who \nare very wary of this notion of doing away with disaster programs, we \nare right because the crop insurance program does not make up for the \nlack of a disaster program. For many producers, that is going to be a \ndisaster in and of itself.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2699\n\n(Purpose: To provide that funds made available for the market promotion \n  program under this Act may be used to provide cost-share assistance \nonly to small businesses or Capper-Volstead cooperatives and to cap the \n                       market promotion program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 2699.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13835]]\n\n       On page 65, line 18, before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``:Provided further, That funds made available \n     under this Act to carry out the market promotion program \n     established under section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act \n     of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) may be used to provide cost-share \n     assistance only to organizations that are recognized as small \n     business concerns under section 3(a) of the Small Business \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)) or to associations described in the \n     first section of the Act entitled `An Act to authorize \n     association of producers of agricultural products', approved \n     February 22, 1922 (7 U.S.C. 291). Provided further, that such \n     funds may not be used to provide cost-share assistance to a \n     foreign eligible trade organization: Provided further, That \n     none of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to carry out the market promotion program established under \n     section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n     5623) if the aggregate amount of funds and value of \n     commodities under the program exceeds $70,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate voted rather \ndecisively--I believe it was 59 to 41--not to abolish the Market \nPromotion Program. Several Senators said to me they did not much like \nthe program, but some industry in their State benefited from it or some \nagriculture cooperative in their State benefited from it.\n  And so my objection to the Market Promotion Program is that it is for \nthe very biggest corporations in America, and at a time when we are \ntrying to cut Medicaid and welfare and everything else, to reward the \nbiggest corporations in America with Federal largess is inconsistent \nand, I think, almost immoral.\n  So Senator Bryan and I have crafted an amendment that we think will \nmeet, certainly meets our objections, and we believe it will meet the \nconcerns of Senators who feel obligated to vote for market promotion \nevery year.\n  There are four points to it. First, we eliminate the eligibility of \nforeign trading organizations. Right now, roughly $10 million of this \nmoney goes to foreign corporations. We eliminate them.\n  Second, we convert it into something of a small business program, \nbecause we make small businesses eligible and small business will be \ndetermined by the Small Business Administration. Generally, these \nbusinesses range in the area of 500 employees and gross sales of $50 \nmillion a year.\n  If people want to put their money where their heart is, maybe I \nshould say where their mouth is, here is an opportunity to do something \nfor small business to help them export, because they need more help, \nwhere big corporations do not.\n  Third, we make all the agricultural cooperatives in the country \neligible. They are eligible now, and they stay eligible, and I know a \nlot of Members of the Senate voted for this because they have a \ncooperative. I have one in my State, Riceland Foods, who does a lot of \nexporting.\n  So we make all cooperatives of all sizes eligible under the \namendment.\n  And fourth, we reduce the funding from $110 million to $70 million. \nYou make it an attractive, palatable program that gives small \nbusinesses a chance to export. You take care of the agricultural \ninterests because you allow the agricultural cooperatives to still \napply for and be eligible for grants to help them export. You eliminate \nforeign corporations, which I think everybody will applaud and perhaps \nthey will applaud louder for the reduction of $110 million to $70 \nmillion than anything else, a savings of $40 million. We do not take \nthe $40 million and allocate it someplace else. It can go on the \ndeficit. You could not find a better place for it.\n  Mr. President, those are all the remarks I care to make on it \ntonight. I will be glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the hour is late, and \nthis has been debated extensively during the course of the last day or \ntwo.\n  Let me commend my colleague from Arkansas. He and I, it is clear I \nthink to all Senators, if given a preference would like to eliminate \nthe program.\n  We have tried, he and I together, for the past several years--and \nprior to my arrival in this body, I am sure he was trying even then--\nand it is $110 million in the appropriations bill this year. As he just \npointed out, this is a carefully crafted compromise. We have preserved \nthe right for small businesses, as defined under the Small Business \nAdministration, to be eligible to participate in this program. We \neliminate foreign companies from their eligibility. I think the more \ncurrent number my colleague mentioned was $10 million. The information \nI have in the current year is that the program currently provides some \n$12 million. So we eliminate all foreign companies.\n  Certainly, my colleagues would agree that the American taxpayer has \nno business in providing money for the advertising accounts of foreign \ncompanies. Certainly, we ought to be able to agree to that. As he \npointed out, the various co-ops in the country, representing a broad \ndiversity of products that are exported abroad, would continue to be \neligible as they are under current law under this program, and we limit \nit to $70 million.\n  We made some progress. The last time this issue came before us for a \nvote, my recollection is that we got 38 votes. This morning, we got 41 \nvotes. That is incremental progress, and I suppose we should be \ngrateful for that. But in an effort to accommodate the concerns that a \nnumber of our colleagues that say, look, we are not enamored with the \nprogram, but it provides help to small businesses, it provides \nassistance to local co-ops involved in export promotion, this is the \ncompromise that is offered in good faith. I hope my colleagues--\nparticularly those who have rejected efforts in the past to eliminate \nthis program--will take a fresh look at this approach and say, look, we \ntried to strike a reasonable and responsive balance--not going as far \nas the Senator from Arkansas and I would like to go, but recognizing \nthe concerns that a number of our colleagues have with respect to small \nbusinesses, and agricultural co-ops, and to eliminate the money that \ncurrently goes to foreign companies, some $12 million, and to try to at \nleast begin to wean these programs from their current level of \nexpenditure, which is $110 million, and to reduce that to $70 million.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider their previous position and \nsupport this amendment, which is offered in the spirit of compromise.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion about the \nmarket promotion program today and yesterday. Last night, we were here \non the floor for an hour--these three Senators--talking about this \nprogram and their amendment to actually do away with all funding for \nthe program--cancel it, kill it. We had a full debate. We voted on a \nmotion to table their amendment. The motion was agreed to by about 60 \nto 40, about the same amount of the vote that was cast earlier this \nyear when the Senate rejected, by a vote of 61 to 37, the same proposal \non the bill--the rescission bill, the supplemental we had before the \nSenate. April 6 was the date of that vote.\n  The point is this has already been fully discussed. I am not going to \ntake a lot of time to argue against the amendment. I am going to make \none point since this is a different approach to this issue.\n  This amendment seeks to rewrite the program, in effect, not only to \nauthorize the funding at a lower level, which I think is $70 million, \nbut to change a number of the provisions of the bill with legislative \nlanguage, in effect, describing the kinds of eligible entities who can \napply for funds under the market promotion program--the size of the \nentities, character of the entities, description about ineligible \napplicants. My problem with that is not that these may not be good \nsuggestions, but that the Senate is being asked to function as a \nlegislative committee.\n  Think about that, Mr. President. We are trying to function as a \ncommittee of the whole. They do that in the House when they go into \nsession as a committee of the whole to take up amendments to \nlegislation, and then the House actually reports the bill or approves \nthe bill, and they have a vote on the legislation itself. But here in \nthe Senate we do not have a committee of the whole. We have legislative \ncommittees that have that responsibility.\n  I think it is a big mistake to have legislative proposals presented \nto the Senate for the first time, a case of first impression, here in \nthe Senate Chamber and we are called upon to listen to a few minutes of \ndebate or, as is the \n\n[[Page S13836]]\ncase tonight, with almost nobody here but those of us here who are \nmanaging the legislation, to listen to the argument and make a decision \nbased on what is best for this program. Should this program be \nreauthorized? And how should it be managed? What would the level of \nfunding be? These are decisions for the legislative committee to make. \nThey are to look at the options. They are the experts.\n  Senator Bumpers is not on the Agriculture Committee. Senator Bryan is \nnot on the Agriculture Committee. Maybe they should be on the \nAgriculture Committee. Maybe they want to be on the Agriculture \nCommittee and they are frustrated. They would like to have the \nopportunity to help write this authorization bill that we are going to \nbe writing in the Agriculture Committee as a part of our reconciliation \ninstruction. And I am told by those who are familiar with some of the \nproposals in the committee that there will be changes in this program \nrecommended by the Agriculture Committee, and that there may be a \nreduction in the funding authorized by that committee. That is for them \nto decide.\n  We should not be on an appropriations bill trying to legislate a new \nkind of program. So I have a serious problem with the procedure. I urge \nthe Senate to reject this amendment. It is an amendment that we cannot \naccept, and I hope that the Senate will follow the decision that it \nmade earlier on this bill, on a similar amendment offered by these \ndistinguished Senators.\n  Mr. President, as I understand the procedure, we need to get the yeas \nand nays ordered on the amendments that we have not been able to \naccept, so that votes will occur tomorrow.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to request the yeas and nays on those amendments that will \nrequire record votes, and they are: The Feingold amendment, the Conrad \namendment, and the Bryan-Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on those \nthree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, there \nare several amendments we have agreed to take and to recommend that \nthey be included in this bill. We have a package, a managers package \nthat will be presented to the Senate. We will do that tonight.\n  Other than that package of amendments, which have been cleared on \nboth sides, I know of no other amendments that are going to be offered, \nor intend to be offered, tonight. But just to be sure, I am going to \nyield the floor and await a call from the Cloakroom or someone coming \nto the floor to offer an amendment that we may not have heard about, \nthat is described in the agreement and that would be eligible to be \noffered tonight. We expect to hear from anybody who intends to offer \none that we have not indicated a willingness to accept.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator will yield, I am sure my colleague and I \nhave no further amendments. Has there been a time set, or a sequence \nfor the votes to occur on the amendments offered this evening?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Under the agreement, there is time. It starts at 9:45 \na.m. on Wednesday. The sequence would be, I presume, the order in which \nthe amendments were offered. The yeas and nays were granted. So the \nsequence would be the Feingold amendment, the Conrad amendment, and the \nBryan-Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is certainly acceptable to me. Mr. President, I have \na further question. If I might inquire of the chairman, is there any \ntime allocated under the protocol that we are adopting for tomorrow to \nexplain any of these amendments? I know that, previously, we have had \narrangements where each side is given a couple of minutes. I simply \ninquire.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am advised 4 minutes equally divided \nhas been made part of the agreement. That is the understanding.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. For the clarification of this situation, of course I \nwill be happy to read this agreement.\n  Let me read it, and if there are any problems, we will be told about \nit, I am sure, by Senators who have any questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13814-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1995\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON UNITED STATES-CANADIAN \n                   COOPERATION CONCERNING AN OUTLET TO RELIEVE \n                   FLOODING AT DEVILS LAKE IN NORTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) flooding in Devils Lake Basin, North Dakota, has \n     resulted in water levels in the lake reaching their highest \n     point in 120 years;\n       (2)(A) 667,000 trees are inundated and dying;\n       (B) 2500 homeowners in the county are pumping water from \n     basements;\n       (C) the town of Devils Lake is threatened with lake water \n     nearing the limits of the protective dikes of the lake;\n       (D) 17,400 acres of land have been inundated;\n       (E) roads are under water;\n       (F) other roads are closed and will be abandoned;\n       (G) homes and businesses have been diked, abandoned, or \n     closed; and\n       (H) if the lake rises another 2 to 3 feet, damages of \n     approximately $74,000,000 will occur;\n       (3) the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of \n     Reclamation are now studying the feasibility of constructing \n     an outlet from Devils Lake Basin;\n       (4) an outlet from Devils Lake Basin will allow the \n     transfer of water from Devils Lake Basin to the Red River of \n     the North watershed that the United States shares with \n     Canada; and\n       (5) the Treaty Relating to the Boundary Waters and \n     Questions Arising Along the Boundary Between the United \n     States and Canada, signed at Washington on January 11, 1909 \n     (36 Stat. 2448; TS 548) (commonly known as the ``Boundary \n     Waters Treaty of 1909''), provides that ``. . . waters \n     flowing across the boundary shall not be polluted on either \n     side to the injury of health or property on the other.'' (36 \n     Stat. 2450).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States Government should seek to establish a \n     joint United States-Canadian technical committee to review \n     the Devils Lake Basin emergency outlet project to consider \n     options for an outlet that would meet Canadian concerns in \n     regard to the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to let my \ncolleagues know about the very serious flood my State is experiencing. \nDevils Lake is located within a completely closed basin with no \noutlet--much like the Great Salt Lake.\n  Due to several years of above-average rainfall, the lake has risen \nover 13 feet and increased in size by two-thirds within the past 2 \nyears. The ever-advancing waters of Devils Lake have caused millions of \ndollars in damage to roads, farmland, public facilities and private \nproperty.\n  The Devils Lake flood has been especially difficult for farmers and \nranchers in and near the basin. Eighty to 90 percent of the pasture and \nhayland around the lake are affected by the flood. Fields are flooded, \nroads used by producers are inundated with water, and wet conditions \nkept many farmers from planting last spring.\n  If water levels continue to rise--as they are likely to do for the \nforeseeable future--the lake could overrun the dike protecting the city \nof Devils Lake, threatening lives and causing millions more dollars in \ndamage.\n  Let me give you just a few facts about this terrible flood: The water \nlevel of Devils Lake has risen 13 feet in the past 2 years, and is at \nits highest level in 120 years; Federal agencies have spent over $30 \nmillion to mitigate this disaster, including more than $21 million from \nthe Federal Highway Administration to fix flood-ravaged roads; The \nCorps of Engineers recently placed a protective berm around the \nMinnewaukan city sewage lagoon because it was about to be overtaken by \nthe lake. When constructed in 1956, the lagoon was more than 8 miles \nfrom the lake--8 miles, Mr. President; 1,768 Disaster Survey Reports of \ndamage to public property have been submitted to FEMA's Disaster Field \nOffice. 2,082 claims for Disaster Unemployment Assistance have been \napproved; and 2,500 homes in Devils Lake are pumping seepage from their \nhomes, and many have basement floors that are heaving because of high \nwater levels.\n  Much has been done to deal with the flood so far.\n  Federal Emergency Management Director James Lee Witt formed an \ninteragency task force to deal with this disaster. Director Witt formed \nthe task force to bring every relevant Federal, State and local agency \ntogther--with the active participation of many Devils Lake Basin \nresidents--to examine every feasible solution and work to find answers \nto this flood. The task force recently issued its report which \nidentifies 17 action items to help mitigate the flood's damage.\n  One of the most promising of those action items is the construction \nof an outlet from Devils Lake. An outlet could drain water from the \nlake and help prevent further--and catastrophic--damage. The Corps of \nEngineers and the Bureau of Reclamation are in the process of studying \na long-term lake stabilization plan that would make an outlet possible. \nMr. President, this problem is of such enormity that every option must \nbe considered.\n  However, an outlet raises international considerations. Water drained \nthrough an outlet would flow into the Sheyenne River, which in turn \nflows into the Red River of the North, which flows northward into \nCanada. Canadian officials have expressed concern about an outlet due \nto water quality issues. The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 provides \nthe basis for protection of boundary waters interests of both the \nUnited States and Canada.\n  As a result, it is critically important that both the State of North \nDakota and the U.S. Government work with Canadian officials as outlet \nplans are considered. The U.S. State Department participated in the \ninteragency task force which has considered Devils Lake flood relief \noptions. I was in Devils Lake recently and encouraged efforts to \ninvolve Canadian officials, especially from the province of Manitoba, \nin discussions of flood relief efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is precisely because of our desire to work with our \nneighbors to the North that my colleague and I introduce this \namendment. Allow me to read from the amendment before us:\n\n       . . . It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     Government should seek to establish a joint United States-\n     Canadian technical committee to review the Devils Lake Basin \n     emergency outlet project to consider options for an outlet \n     that would meet Canadian concerns in regard to the Boundary \n     Waters Treaty of 1909.\n\n  In short, the amendment says two things. First, Devils Lake Basin \nflooding is a serious problem. Second, we want to work with the \nCanadians to find a treaty-compliant way to resolve it. The committee \nwould seek to find a way to construct an outlet while fully complying \nwith the treaty. Only by seeking the active participation of Canada can \nthis project go forward.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President, it is in the best interest of my \nState and of our Nation to work with Canadian officials to assuage \ntheir concerns about an outlet. That is why this amendment emphasizes \nthe importance of the treaty, and states that the committee should work \nto meet Canadian concerns regarding the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this sense of the Senate Amendment to H.R. \n1976 is in response to the devastating flooding being experienced \nwithin the State of North Dakota. This amendment will provide for a \njoint United States-Canadian technical committee to review the Devils \nLake basin emergency outlet project and consider options for an outlet \nthat would meet Canadian concerns regarding the Boundary Waters Treaty \nof 1909.\n  The Devils Lake basin is an enclosed basin (no outlet) with water \nloss through natural evaporation from the lake surface during periods \nof drought. With more rain than drought in recent \n\n[[Page S13838]]\nyears, the surface of the lake has been rising dramatically. In 1993, \nthe surface of Devils Lake totaled 44,000 acres, today it covers over \n72,000 acres. Eighty to 90 percent of the pasture and haylands around \nthe lake have been flooded, saturated, or isolated by flood waters. \nThere are eight counties represented in the Devils Lake basin. In just \ntwo of these eight counties, flooding has impacted 247,000 acres \n(nearly 386 square miles). For comparison, the District of Columbia \ncovers only 67 square miles.\n  In the basin above the lake level, where crops can still be grown, \nthe rains of this spring allowed only about half of the normal planting \nof small grains (wheat, durum, barley, and oats). Wet conditions also \nprevented proper weeding with the result that crop yield is expected to \nbe significantly reduced.\n  Six hundred sixty-seven thousand trees in the basin are now flooded \nand will probably die within the next year.\n  Tribal roads and facilities have also been flood damaged. Tribal \nauthorities report that their manufacturing (Dakotah Tribal Industries, \nSioux Manufacturing) has declined in an area where unemployment is \nabout 60 percent.\n\n\n         we desperately need relief from this natural disaster\n\n  The Corps of Engineers in association with the Bureau of Reclamation \nplus other Federal and State agencies is investigating the feasibility \nof solutions to perennial flooding in the Devils Lake basin. Among the \npotential solutions, there are expected to be an outlet from the basin \nto relieve the flooding and an inlet to stabilize the lake level during \nperiods of drought.\n  The outlet would allow basin water to reach the Red River and \neventually the Hudson Bay in Canada. Some Canadian officials are \nconcerned that releasing water from the Devils Lake basin could \npotentially allow the introduction of foreign biota and higher levels \nof dissolved solids to their vital waters. The Boundary Waters Treaty \nof 1909 between the United States and Canada states, in part, that ``. \n. . water flowing across the boundary shall not be polluted on either \nside to the injury of health or property on the other.'' It is implicit \nfrom our treaty obligations that the governments involved in this issue \nshould commence technical discussions.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this ``no additional cost'' amendment \nto establish a joint United States-Canadian technical committee for the \nreview of the Devils lake emergency outlet project. I understand that \nthis amendment has been cleared on both sides, and I thank the \nchairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, for \ntheir support and cooperation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2701\n\n(Purpose: To fund the Grain Marketing Research Laboratory in Manhattan, \n                                Kansas)\n\n       On page 13, line 23, insert the following after ``law'': \n     ``: Provided further, That of the funds made available under \n     this heading for the National Center for Agricultural \n     Utilization Research, not less than $1,000,000 shall be \n     available for the Grain Marketing Research Laboratory in \n     Manhattan, Kansas''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2702\n\n    (Purpose: To eliminate certain unnecessary advisory committees)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VII, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 7  .

Any fines assessed pursuant to 36 CFR \n     Part 223, from the effective date of said regulation to the \n     date of enactment of this Act, shall be null and void. During \n     the 120 day period, the interim regulatory guidelines \n     published pursuant to 55 CFR 48572 and 56 CFR 65834 shall \n     remain in effect.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1996 Agriculture Appropriations bill that would delay final \nregulations implementing the 1990 Forest Resources Conservation and \nShortage Relief Act. This act governs the export of State and Federal \nlogs in the Western United States.\n  Since 1990 the timber industry in the States of Washington, Oregon, \nIdaho and Montana has operated under interim regulations promulgated to \nenforce the 1990 law. The legislation is very complicated, and sets up \na series of requirements for companies that wish to export State or \nFederal logs. Consequently, the regulations implementing the law must \nbe very precise, and an entire industry--for the most part--must react \nto any regulations on this subject with painstaking attention to the \ndetails.\n  On Friday, September 8, the Department of Agriculture implemented--\neffective immediately--final regulations implementing the 1990 log \nexport law. Let me say this again--the regulations were made effective \nimmediately. The final regulations were dramatically different than the \nregulations as initially proposed, and, as a result completely and \ntotally overwhelmed the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest.\n  The regulations are overly burdensome, and must be re-written. Let me \ngive you a brief example of the specificity of these regulations, and \nwhy any rational person would not make the effective date immediate on \nthe regulations.\n  For example, the regulation establishes a procedure for exporting \nfinished lumber. When a company exports lumber, the new regulations \nrequire that company to keep in its possession for each shipment or \norder, a lumber inspection certificate, and a company certificate to \nensure that export restricted timber is in fact processed before \nexport.\n  The regulation establishes a procedure for marking Federal and \nprivate timber that originates from within a sourcing area. All private \ntimber that is harvested inside a sourcing area must be marked on both \nends of the log with highway yellow paint, before it can be removed \nfrom the harvest area. This paint signifies that the logs must be \ndomestically processed. Based upon the industry reading of the \nregulation, this provision appears to apply to logs that will be \nprocessed in the company's own mill. The log must be marked throughout \nthe entire process, from harvest to ``mill in-feed,'' no matter how \nmany times it has been cut.\n  The regulation establishes a procedure for disposing of private \ntimber that originates from within a sourcing area. The regulations \nmandate a complex procedure of identification, notice, paperwork and \nrecord keeping process. The process is as follows:\n  Before a company sells any export restricted private timber, that is, \nprivate timber that originates from within a sourcing area, the selling \ncompany must do the following: Give notice to the purchaser that the \ntimber cannot be exported; give notice that the timber has been marked \nand the mark must be retained; agree to send in the transaction \nstatement to the Regional Forester within 10 calendar days; retain \nrecords of acquisition and disposition for 3 years from the date of \nmanufacture or disposition, and make such records available for \ninspection by the Forest Service; acknowledge that failure to identify \nthe timber as mentioned above and to accurately report is a violation \nof the act, and the ``False Statement Act''; certify that the form has \nbeen read and understood. The purchasing company is required to follow \na similar set of requirements.\n  As you can tell, the regulations are specific, and would require some \nmajor adjustments to current operating practices. When this is coupled \nwith the fact that a violation of each aspect of the regulation carries \nwith it a potentially heavy fine, it is clear that these regulations \nmust be delayed.\n  According to the regulations, fines can be assessed for each \nviolation--which includes the omission of just one paint stripe on a \nlog. In addition, civil penalties are high--the Forest Service has the \ndiscretion, based upon the nature of the violation, to assess penalties \nof up to $500,000 or three times the gross value of the timber \ninvolved, \n\n[[Page S13839]]\nplus the option to cancel all Federal timber contracts.\n  This Senator believes that a regulated entity--whether it's a small \nbusiness or a big business--deserves to understand a set of regulations \nbefore it is implemented. This is just common sense. To do the \nopposite, as was done in this case--to blind-side an industry with \ndraconian regulations that have never been reviewed by the regulated \ncommunity--certainly fans the flame of anti-government sentiment.\n  My amendment, co-sponsored by Senator Murray and Senator Burns, would \ndelay the regulations for 120 days. During that 120-day period the \nregulations issued on September 8 would be treated as proposed \nregulations, affected parties would have the opportunity to comment on \nthe regulations, and the Department is required to make the necessary \nrevisions based upon such comments. During this 120 day period, the \ninterim regulations would remain in place, and any fines assessed based \nupon the September 8 regulations would be null and void.\n  This amendment is not controversial. This amendment makes common \nsense, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2704\n\n       On page 25, line 14, strike $564,685,000 and insert \n     $563,004,000.\n       On page 37, line 8, strike $1,000,000 and insert \n     $2,681,000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2705\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify that tourist and other recreational businesses \n  located in rural communities are eligible for loans under the Rural \n Business and Cooperative Development Service's Business and Industry \n                        Loan Guarantee Program)\n\n       On page 44, line 16, before the period insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That loan guarantees for \n     business and industry assistance funded under this heading \n     shall be made available to tourist or other recreational \n     businesses in rural communities''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2706\n\n       On page 14, strike on line 12, ``40,670,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof, ``42,670,000''.\n       On page 15, strike on line 17, ``$419,622,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$421,622,000''.\n       On page 82, reduce ``$800,000,000'' by $4,444,000.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the managers for accepting this \namendment. It is my intention, and our understanding, that the \nadditional funds included by this amendment, will be used to find the \nPresident's request submitted by the Department of Agriculture on page \n9-32 of the fiscal year 1996 budget request of the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2700 through 2706) were agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service recently issued a proposed rule governing the \nimportation of Mexican Hass avocados into the United States. The \nproposed rule would allow Hass avocados to be imported into the \nNortheastern United States during the winter months of November through \nFebruary.\n  I support the House report language concerning the Department of \nAgriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service proposed rule \non the importation of Mexican avocados.\n  The House Committee report language, although not a permanent \nsolution, adequately cautions the USDA to ensure scientific credibility \non pest risk assessment and risk management, ensure that the USDA will \ncommit the resources necessary to ensure sufficient oversight, \ninspection, and enforcement of any importation system which may result, \nand ensure that the avocado industry is provided the opportunity to \ngive input on any proposed regulatory changes.\n  California avocado growers have expressed their continued concerns \nthat a USDA proposed rule inadequately protects their industry from \nharmful pests or disease that imported avocados may carry.\n  I am very concerned about the potential impact of the proposed rule \non avocado growers in California. There are about 7,300 avocado growers \nin the United States, 6,000 of whom are in California. On average, \nthese hard-working farmers produce about 300 million pounds of avocados \na year, and last year they produced $250 million worth of fruit.\n  But this proposed rule is not just about the avocado industry. It is \nabout pests that threaten the $18 billion a year California \nagricultural industry: an industry that generates $70 billion a year in \neconomic activity. California's agricultural industry is primarily \nexport-driven, and even the hint of pest infestation threatens trade, \nas we have recently seen with Japan and the medfly threat.\n  The State of California and the Federal Government have spent more \nthan $217 million since 1980 to combat periodic fruit fly infestations. \nEven with this significant commitment of resources, certain \nMediterranean fruit fly eradication efforts remain under-researched and \nunder-funded. The 34 pests that APHIS claims are commonly found in \navocados grown in Mexico could devastate California agriculture. Many \npests found in Mexico infest citrus, grapes, apples, and other \nagricultrual products.\n  California avocado growers are very concerned that APHIS lacks the \nresources to enforce the phytosanitary restrictions in the proposed \nrule. I share their concern. APHIS states in the proposed rule that it \n``agrees that adequate resources and personnel, especially inspectors, \nwould have to be devoted to prevent introduction of avocado and other \nplant pests into the United States.''\n  The Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection budget is primarily user-\nfee funded. Funds are kept in a dedicated account and are subject to \nannual appropriations. Although the budget is not slated for cuts in \nthe fiscal year 1996 agriculture appropriations bill, the question \nremains whether it is realistic to assume that the current funding \nlevel is sufficient to cover the additional needs created by this \nproposed rule. For example, the transhipment of Hass avocados within \nthe United States will be very difficult to control without an \naggressive monitoring program.\n  Since 1914, it has been the policy of the United States to prohibit \nthe entry of fresh avocados with seeds from Mexico and certain other \ncountries of Central and South America. This quarantine, although \nspecifically directed at seed weevils and moths, has also proven \neffective in preventing infestation of fruit flies, and other pests \nfound in Mexican avocados which would adversely impact not only U.S. \navocado production but numerous other fruit and vegetable crops in \nCalifornia, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and other States. I believe that \ncurrent policy should continue until all of the legitimate concerns of \nthe avocado industry are addressed.\n  Our quarantine against Mexican avocados is not unique. It is \nimportant to remember that pest-free fresh avocados enter the United \nStates from other countries, such as Chile, which also prohibits entry \nof Mexican avocados due to pest risks.\n  Mexico has yet to implement an effective pest eradication or control \nprogram. As recently as July 1993, USDA officials concluded that \nMexican avocados continue to pose a significant threat of introducing \nplant pests into the United States. Although the proposed rule details \nsafeguards to be taken by Mexican growers and packers as well as strict \noversight by APHIS, there is still no evidence that effective pest \ncontrol and eradication programs have been developed and implemented by \nMexico.\n  Unless Mexico implements a comprehensive and effective pest \neradication and control program in its growing areas, USDA policy must \nensure that the health of U.S. agriculture and consumers is not \nthreatened.\n  Unfortunately, in the Senate committee report language on Mexican \navocados the Senate committee does not concur with the House language \nand says that the Department published regulations to address the \nconcerns about the protection of domestic avocado production after \nHouse action on this issue. While it may be true that the proposed rule \nwas published after House action, the rule does not sufficiently \naddress concerns and would allow Hass avocados to be imported into the \nNortheastern United States \n\n[[Page S13840]]\nduring the winter months of November through February.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully reconsider this issue as they \nprepare to go to conference with the House, and urge them to defer to \nthe House on this issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I request permission to engage the senior \nSenator from Maine and the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a brief colloquy. As the chairman knows, new fungicide-\nresistant strains of the late blight potato fungus are causing serious \ndamage to potato crops in a number of potato-growing States. Maine has \nbeen hit particularly hard by late blight over the past several years. \nTo address this problem, the Congress provided $1.4 million for late \nblight control and research in Maine through extension in 1994, and it \nprovided $800,000 for the Maine program in the current fiscal year \nthrough the Smith-Lever pest management funds. USDA officials have \ninformed our offices that another $800,000 has been included in the \nPresident's budget for this purpose in fiscal year 1996 under pest \nmanagement.\n  Mr. COHEN. I fully concur with Senator Snowe that this funding is \ncritical to helping potato growers in Maine and other States protect \ntheir crops from the devastation of late blight. We note that the \ncommittee has provided $10.9 million for pest management in its fiscal \nyear 1996 bill, which is the same as the amount appropriated in the \ncurrent fiscal year. Is it the chairman's understanding that the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget request for this account includes \n$800,000 to continue this late blight control program in Maine?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to point out that the \ncommittee recognizes the very serious threats to potato production \nposed by late blight, and the heavy damage that has been incurred to \ndate in Maine and other States. In response to the Senators' question, \nI can confirm that the President's fiscal year 1996 budget request for \npest management does include $800,000 to continue the late blight \ncontrol program described by the Maine senators.\n  Ms. SNOWE. On behalf of the Maine delegation, I would like to thank \nthe Chairman for clarifying this matter.\n\n\n                     agricultural research service\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. As the Senator from Arkansas is aware, H.R. 1976 provides \nfunding for the Agricultural Research Service to continue operating the \nARS potato research facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, as an ARS \nworksite. Research direction and administration will be shifted to a \nprimary ARS laboratory. The ARS Red River Valley Agricultural Research \nCenter Northern Plains Area office in Fargo, North Dakota is located \njust 75 miles away, and is well equipped to handle administrative \nfunctions for the East Grand Forks facility. Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that ARS should transfer the administrative \nresponsibilities called for in this legislation to the Fargo ARS \nfacility?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct. ARS should transfer \nadministration of the East Grand Forks facility to the ARS research \ncenter in Fargo, North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Chairman of the Subcommittee indicate whether \nhe has the same understanding?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do agree with the Senator regarding the Fargo ARS \ncenter.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In addition, the bill contains funding for the Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service to continue a cattail management \nprogram for blackbird control. Is it the Subcommittee's intention that \nAPHIS should continue to use a portion of those funds for cattail \nmanagement and blackbird control in North Dakota?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct. APHIS should continue using a \nportion of available funds to continue the cattail management program \nin North Dakota.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Let me add that I share Senator Bumpers' understanding.\n\n\n               distance learning and medical link funding\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman for \nassistance in dealing with two matters that are very important to me \nand the people of Nebraska.\n  The Distance Learning and Medical Link Program was designed to \ndemonstrate the ability of rural communities to utilize existing or \nproposed telecommunications systems to achieve sustainable cost-\neffective distance learning or proposed medical link networks.\n  In Nebraska, there is a distance learning partnership between the \nSchool at the Center Project, the Nebraska Math and Science Initiative, \nProject EduPort and the Nebraska Rural Development Commission that \nwould provide access to advanced telecommunications services and \ncomputer networks and improve rural opportunities.\n  Another program designed to provide much needed technology to rural \ncommunities is the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP). Included \nin RCAP is the Rural Business Enterprise Grant Program.\n  The Nebraska Department of Economic Development operates a program \nfor innovative information technology applications that assists small \nand rural Nebraska businesses in becoming more competitive through \neffective use of information technology and telecommunications.\n  I feel that these are the types of projects contemplated under the \nDistance Learning and Medical Link Program and the Rural Business \nEnterprise Grant Program, and I would ask the chairman to join me in \nencouraging the Department to give consideration to funding both of \nthese proposals.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The committee did urge the Department to give \nconsideration to funding a number of applications for both of these \nprograms. I appreciate the Senator bringing these proposals to my \nattention. I would urge the Department to give equal consideration to \nthese applications as those included in the committee report.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have been advised that Senator Heflin \nhas two colloquies. These have not been submitted and will be submitted \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, let me make this unanimous consent request: Following \nthe final vote on the Bumpers amendment, that it be in order if the \ncolloquy has been submitted at that time and accepted by the floor \nmanagers, that a colloquy by Senator Heflin and Senator Cochran be \neligible to be submitted for the Record, and a Heflin colloquy with \nSenator Cochran on agricultural weather stations, that those two be in \norder to be inserted in the Record prior to final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13836-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13840-S13841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nAbraham, and I would like to engage the distinguished manager of the \nbill in a brief colloquy regarding an important Cooperative State \nResearch Extension and Education Service [CSREES] grant that has \nsupported innovative work conducted by Michigan State University [MSU] \nand the Michigan Biotechnology Institute [MBI]. Through CSREES support, \nMSU/MBI have been working to commercialize agricultural technologies, \nparticularly those that stimulate new uses for agricultural \ncommodities, from our Nation's universities and Federal laboratories.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Due in part to past CSREES Special Research Grant \nsupport, MSU/MBI has succeeded in creating five new companies using \nagricultural technologies. One company was created to market a new \nbiodegradable plastic resin for applications such as plastic knives, \nforks and spoons used in fast food establishments. The new resin has \nall the benefits of conventional petroleum-based technology but you can \nthrow it away and it will decompose without adding to our nation's \nlandfills. This research has created new companies, new jobs, and \nincreased Michigan's tax base. I strongly support these efforts.\n\n[[Page S13841]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The House fiscal year 1996 Agriculture Appropriations bill \nproposes to fund the Michigan Biotechnology Consortium--also read \nInstitute--at $1 million. This is approximately a 50% reduction from \nthe FY95 level of $1.995 million. I understand that the budget deficit \ndemands sacrifice from all agencies and grant recipients, but a 50% cut \nwill severely affect the cutting-edge work done by and the pace of \ntechnological innovation at MBI.\n  The Senate FY96 Agriculture Appropriations bill does not include \nfunding for MBI under CSREES. However, the Senate conferees have \nreceded to the House level for MBI in past years, with strong support \nfrom the Michigan Congressional delegation. I urge the Senate Conferees \nto once again accept the House's funding level and, if possible, return \nMBI funding to its FY95 level.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am aware of the valuable CSREES work that has been \nconducted by MSU/MBI. I assure my colleagues from Michigan that I will \nrevisit MBI's FY96 funding in conference and will remember the \nSenators' strong support for MBI.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13840-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13841-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 464.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to use \nstewardship contracting in a demonstration program to restore and \nmaintain the ecological integrity and productivity of forest ecosystems \nto insure that the land and resources are passed to future generations \nin better condition than they were found; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n       the forest ecosystem stewardship demonstration act of 1995\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I introduce the Forest Ecosystem \nStewardship Demonstration Act of 1995. On May 18, 1995, my colleague \nfrom Montana, Congressman Pat Williams introduced this bill which would \nallow the experimental use by the U.S. Forest Service of a variety of \nstewardship contracts on private land.\n  About a month ago I held a meeting in Kalispell about the Forest \nStewardship Demonstration Act of 1995. The meeting was attended by \nloggers, environmentalists, and timber landowners. I received input \nfrom many individuals, businesses and organizations, including the \nMontana Wilderness Association, the Montana Logging Association, \nFlathead Audubon Society, the Montana Wilderness Association and the \nFlathead Economic Policy Center. I was pleased to see people from all \nwalks of life joining together to find common ground on what is usually \na divisive issue and reach a consensus on a sound land-management \nprogram for a section of private property near Columbia Falls. The \nstewardship plan, created by the Flathead Forestry Project, emphasizes \nforest management strategies that will allow contracts to be written \nwith enough flexibility and diversity to accommodate each system's \nneeds.\n  This bill does not add red tape; does not reduce competition; and \ndoes not eliminate any existing public participation processes or \nenvironmental laws. Instead, this bill allows public forest owners and \nresource managers to directly selected qualified forest contractors. \nThis new contract format allows landowners to custom design their own \nspecific plans. Contractors will work directly for the public. In turn, \nthis will increase the pool of contractors who can bid on public forest \nprojects.\n  We all know that it is in the best interest of our forests to manage \nour public lands in a manner that maintains their overall health. At \nthe same time, it is important to recognize that these are public lands \nand citizens should be fully involved in participating in the decisions \nthat affect our national forests.\n  The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 proposes a \nunique plan to protect the health of our forests while also protecting \nthe economic well-being of those who utilize the natural resources that \nour forests have to offer us.\n  This bill will give the Flathead Forestry Project the opportunity to \ntest this proposal on a section of private property in Montana. If \nsuccessful, this plan can be used as a model for similar land \nmanagement programs on public lands.\n  I want to recognize the hard work of some of the men and women in \nMontana who are personally responsible for this unique legislation; \nFloyd Quiram, Jack Jay, Rem Koht, Bob Stone, Carol Daly, Lex Blood, \nKeith Olson and Steve Thompson. I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation on their behalf, and I urge my colleagues to give it their \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Ecosystem Stewardship \n     Demonstration Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following finding:\n       (1) In many of the units of the National Forest System, \n     current conditions--such as unnatural fuel loads, high tree \n     density, threat of catastrophic fires, disease, and insect \n     infestations, habitat loss, and loss of historic species, \n     stand diversity and integrity--adversely affect the \n     biodiversity, health, and sustainability of the forest \n     ecosystems of such units.\n       (2) A new and innovative contracting process for the \n     National Forest System is required to meet Federal goals of \n     improving forest resource conditions through implementation \n     of ecosystem management.\n       (3) Ecosystem management is not just a biological concept. \n     It is the convergence of a set of activities that is \n     simultaneously ecologically sound, economically viable, and \n     socially responsible.\n       (4) The improvement of the health and natural functioning \n     of the forest resource is vital to the long-term viability of \n     species found on National Forest System lands.\n       (5) Ecosystem restoration and conservation work performed \n     with revenues from forest activities would improve employment \n     opportunities in communities near units of the National \n     Forest System to the benefit of long-term economic \n     sustainability and community viability.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To improve and restore the health of forest resources \n     through implementation of ecosystem management.\n       (2) To provide for employment opportunities and economic \n     health and viability for rural communities near units of the \n     National Forest System.\n       (3) To provide for flexibility in procurement and funding \n     practices to enter into stewardship contracts to achieve \n     management objectives and requirements prescribed in the \n     following provisions of law:\n       (A) The Act of June 4, 1897 (commonly known as the Organic \n     Administration Act; 16 U.S.C. 473-475, 477-482, 551).\n       (B) The Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. \n     528-531).\n       (C) The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Act of \n     1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614).\n       (D) Section 14 of the National Forest Management Act of \n     1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a).\n       (E) The Act of May 23, 1908, and section 13 of the Act of \n     March 1, 1911 (16 U.S.C. 500).\n       (F) The Federal Grants and Agreements Act of 1977 (31 \n     U.S.C. 6303-6308).\n       (G) National Forest Fund Act of March 4, 1907 (16 U.S.C. \n     499).\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Account.--The term ``Account'' means the Stewardship \n     Account established under section 4.\n       (2) Design specification contract.--The term ``design \n     specification contract'' is used to describe contracts in \n     which the contracting entity specifically identifies all the \n     tasks \n\n[[Page S13843]]\n     to be performed, and the contractor performs per the designed \n     specifications.\n       (3) Forest stewardship council.--The term ``Forest \n     Stewardship Council'' means any one of the local councils \n     established under section 3(f) of this Act to, in cooperation \n     with resource managers: prioritize and select stewardship \n     projects, set operational goals in the context of current \n     national forest management policies and local forest plans, \n     evaluate contractor performance and accomplishments, \n     recommend progress payments for work successfully completed \n     by contractors, and make recommendations for the improvement \n     of the stewardship contract process.\n       (4) Performance specification contract.--The term \n     ``performance specification contract'' is used to describe \n     contracts in which the contracting entity identifies the \n     parameters of the project, and the contractor identifies the \n     method to accomplish the work.\n       (5) Resource activities.--The term ``resource activities'' \n     includes area access, site preparation, replanting, fish and \n     wildlife habitat restoration or enhancement, silvicultural \n     treatments, watershed improvement, fuel treatments (including \n     prescribed burning), and road closure or obliteration.\n       (6) Resource manager.--The term ``resource manager'' refers \n     to the line officer responsible for management decisions \n     associated with project implementation on a national forest.\n       (7) Roadside sale.--The term ``roadside sale'' refers to \n     the sale by the Forest Service to the highest bidder(s) of \n     all contract-designated products of the forest removed as \n     part of the management activities conducted under a \n     stewardship contract. (Non-designated products may be \n     assigned to the contractor for salvage.) A roadside sale is a \n     completely separate transaction from the awarding of the \n     stewardship contract itself.\n       (8) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n       (9) Statement of work contract.--The term ``statement of \n     work contract'' is used to describe contracts in which the \n     contracting entity gives a general overview of the project, \n     and the bidding contractor provides the specifics on how he/\n     she envisions the project and the end result he/she would \n     obtain using his/her particular approach to land stewardship.\n       (10) Stewardship contract.--The term ``stewardship \n     contract'' means a contract for carrying out resource \n     activities for the improvement and restoration of forest \n     ecosystems of units of the National Forest System and to \n     encourage or enhance the economic sustainability and the \n     viability of rural and regional communities. A stewardship \n     contract could use a design specification format (definition \n     2, above), a performance specification format (definition 4, \n     above), a statement of work format (definition 9, above), or \n     some combination thereof.\n\n     SEC. 3. USE OF STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Use Authorized.--The Secretary shall establish and \n     implement in the Forest Service a demonstration program \n     through which forest- and/or district-level resource managers \n     use stewardship contracts to carry out resource activities in \n     a comprehensive manner to restore and preserve the ecological \n     integrity and productivity of forest ecosystems within the \n     National Forest System and to encourage or enhance the \n     economic sustainability and the viability of nearby rural \n     communities. The resource activities undertaken should be \n     consistent with the precepts of ecosystem management and with \n     the forest's management plan for achieving the desired future \n     conditions of the area being treated.\n       (b) Use Limited.--Within the limits of available financial \n     resources, each forest within the National Forest System may \n     use stewardship contracts to carry out ecosystem management \n     projects, if those contracts:\n       (1) Provide for payment to the contractor based on the \n     number of acres satisfactorily treated in accordance with an \n     approved plan to create a desired future condition on the \n     land.\n       (2) Are used for projects where the harvest of timber is \n     secondary to creating specific resource conditions (e.g., \n     wildlife habitat enhancement, watershed improvement, insect \n     and disease control).\n       (3) Are not used for projects involving the construction of \n     new permanent roads or entries into roadless areas.\n       (4) Will result in the removal of no more than 300,000 \n     board feet of merchantable timber per project.\n       (5) Provide for the roadside sale of all contract-\n     designated merchantable timber which is extracted.\n       (6) Are awarded competitively to qualified contractors with \n     no more than 25 employees.\n       (7) Include stewardship skill and experience qualification \n     requirements which have been established by the local Forest \n     Stewardship Council and approved by the Forest Service.\n       (8) Are monitored not only by the Forest Service, but also \n     by the local Forest Stewardship Council.\n       (9) Provide for periodic progress payments to contractors \n     based on successful completion of contract activities on a \n     per acre basis. The acceptability of the contractor's work \n     shall be determined by the Forest Service, taking into \n     account the recommendation of the local Forest Stewardship \n     Council.\n       (c) Demonstration Research Objectives.--The Secretary shall \n     insure that in the carrying out of the provisions of this Act \n     enough flexibility is provided to resource managers to enable \n     them to test various approaches to solving questions left \n     unresolved in previous demonstrations of stewardship and end \n     results contracts authorized in fiscal year 1991 and 1992 \n     through the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Appropriation Acts. These questions include, but are not \n     limited to:\n       (1) The need for the bonding of stewardship contractors \n     and/or possible alternatives which could reduce the financial \n     burden on small businesses.\n       (2) Preferred methods of marketing timber or other products \n     of the forest removed as a result of stewardship contract \n     activities.\n       (3) The standards to be used in evaluating the quality and \n     acceptability of the work performed by a stewardship \n     contractor.\n       (4) The desirability of multi-year contracts for \n     stewardship projects.\n       (5) The relative merits of using design specifications, \n     performance specifications, or statements of work in \n     offering, awarding, and evaluating stewardship contracts.\n       (6) The costs, benefits, problems, and opportunities \n     resulting from increased community involvement in the design \n     and monitoring of stewardship contracts.\n       (7) The benefits and problems resulting from restricting \n     stewardship contracts to very small (no more than 25 \n     employees) contractors.\n       (8) The extent to which local economic sustainability and \n     rural community viability are affected by the use of \n     stewardship contracts.\n       (9) The difference between estimated and actual revenues \n     derived from roadside sales of timber.\n       (10) The level of utilization of timber and other products \n     of the forest derived from stewardship contract projects as \n     compared with conventional timber sales.\n       (11) The extent to which stewardship contracting \n     contributes to the achievement of forest ecosystem management \n     plans.\n       (12) The extent to which the revenues from stewardship \n     contracts cover the cost of such contracts or are offset by \n     the costs which could reasonably be expected to result if the \n     contracts are not carried out (e.g., fire suppression costs \n     in areas with heavy fuel loads).\n       (13) The administrative costs or savings involved in the \n     use of stewardship contracts.\n       (14) The benefits and/or disadvantages of using local \n     Forest Stewardship Councils as part of the stewardship \n     contracting process.\n       (15) The benefits and/or disadvantages of various methods \n     of selecting members, organizing, administering, and \n     conducting the business of local Forest Stewardship Councils.\n       (d) Development and Use of Contracts.--Each resource \n     manager of a unit of the National Forest System may enter \n     into stewardship contracts with qualified non-Federal \n     entities (as established in regulations relating to \n     procurement by the Federal Government or as determined by the \n     Secretary.) The local Forest Stewardship Council, in \n     cooperation with the Forest Service resource manager, shall \n     select the type of stewardship contract that is most suitable \n     to local conditions. Contracts should clearly describe the \n     desired future condition for each resource managed under the \n     contract and the evaluation criteria to be used to determine \n     acceptable performance. The length of a stewardship contract \n     shall be consistent with the requirements of section 14 of \n     the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a).\n       (e) Selection of Areas for Contracts.--In selecting areas \n     within units of the National Forest System to be subject to \n     stewardship contracts, the Secretary, resource managers, and \n     local Forest Stewardship Councils shall base the selection on \n     the need to improve forest health, maintain and improve soil \n     and water quality, and improve fisheries and wildlife \n     habitat. Priorities for activities within individual units \n     will be established by local resource managers, in \n     consultation with the appropriate local Forest Stewardship \n     Council.\n       (f) Establishment of Local Forest Stewardship Councils.--\n     Local Forest Stewardship Councils shall be established for \n     each unit of the National Forest System which offers \n     stewardship contracts. The role of a Forest Stewardship \n     Council will be to, in cooperation with the resource \n     managers, prioritize and select stewardship projects, set \n     operational goals in the context of current national forest \n     management policies and local forest plans, evaluate \n     contractor performance and accomplishments, recommend \n     progress payments for work successfully completed by \n     contractors, and make recommendations for the improvement of \n     the stewardship contract process. Each participating National \n     Forest System unit shall establish, after soliciting the \n     comments of local citizens, the size of the local council, \n     the method of selection or election of council members, the \n     terms of service of members, and the council administrative \n     budget, if any. At least 51 percent of members of any Forest \n     Stewardship Council shall be drawn from the private sector, \n     in a manner which insures representation of a broad range of \n     public interests. The functioning of the Forest Stewardship \n     Councils must assure a continuing and open process and \n     must in no way interfere with the broad public involvement \n     in Federal resource management decision making required \n     under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1976.\n       (g) Application of Contracts.--Subject to subsection (h), \n     the revenue received from the sale of timber or any other \n     products of the \n\n[[Page S13844]]\n     forest resulting to the Federal Government as a result of work carried \n     out under a stewardship contract shall be deposited into a \n     Stewardship Account as established in section 4(a).\n       (h) Effect on Other Revenue Requirements.--Twenty-five \n     percent of the revenues received from roadside sale of \n     products extracted through stewardship contract activities \n     shall remain available for payments to States, as required \n     under the Act of May 23, 1908, and section 13 of the Act of \n     March 1, 1991 (16 U.S.C. 500). The Secretary shall first \n     collect revenues to make such payments before exercising the \n     authority provided in subsection g.\n\n     SEC. 4. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES.\n\n       (a) Receipts.--Monetary receipts received as payment for \n     contract-designated timber and other products of the forest \n     extracted through stewardship contract activities shall be \n     deposited in a designated fund to be known as the \n     ``Stewardship Account''. Amounts in the Account shall be used \n     to make payments to States under the Act of May 23, 1908, and \n     section 13 of the Act of March 1, 1911 (16 U.S.C. 500), and \n     to fund resource activities. Amounts in the Account are \n     hereby appropriated and shall be available to the Secretary \n     until expended, except that those amounts found by the \n     Secretary to be in excess of the needs of the Secretary shall \n     be transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of \n     the United States. Any additional revenues made available \n     through direct appropriations to the Forest Service for \n     stewardship contracting and ecosystem management purposes \n     also shall be deposited in the Account.\n       (b) Expenditures.--Not less than 80 percent of amounts in \n     the Account available for resource activities shall be used \n     for the direct costs of such resource activities. The \n     revenues received from sales of contract-designated products \n     resulting from stewardship contracts shall be returned to the \n     national forest from which they were generated, to be used to \n     fund additional stewardship contracts. To the extent that \n     additional revenues are received in the Account from direct \n     appropriations by the Congress of funds for stewardship \n     contract activities, such funds shall be made available to \n     those forest units using stewardship contracts through a \n     process to be developed by the Secretary.\n       (c) Reporting.--As part of the annual report of the \n     Secretary to Congress, the Secretary shall include an \n     accounting of revenues, expenditures, and accomplishments \n     related to the stewardship contracts.\n\n     SEC. 5. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       All stewardship contracts shall comply with existing \n     applicable laws, and nothing in this Act may be construed as \n     modifying the provisions of any other law except as \n     explicitly provided in this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall be effective upon passage.\n\n     SEC. 7. TERMINATION DATE.\n\n       Unless extended by a subsequent act of the Congress, this \n     Act shall terminate five years from its effective \n     date.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1260. A bill to reform and consolidate the public and assisted \nhousing programs of the United States, and to redirect primary \nresponsibility for these programs from the Federal Government to States \nand localities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         the public housing reform and empowerment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, on behalf of \nSenators D'Amato and Bond, the Public Housing Reform and Empowerment \nAct of 1995. This bill represents the first serious effort in decades \nto reform and consolidate the Nation's public and tenant-based assisted \nhousing programs, and to redirect the primary responsibility for these \nprograms away from the Federal bureaucracy and toward States and \nlocalities.\n  Public housing is home to 1.4 million American families, and much of \nit is good. Unfortunately, to many Americans the pictures in the \nnational media of high rise public housing projects being imploded \nsymbolize the failure of our housing policy. Clearly, some public \nhousing, particularly in major cities, has fallen into a vicious cycle \nof crime, drug abuse, welfare dependency, and hopelessness. In far too \nmany places, public housing developments, which are supposed to provide \na housing platform from which lower-income families can achieve their \nown aspirations of economic independence and self-sufficiency, are \nlittle more than warehouses that rob the poorest of the poor of their \ndignity and hope.\n  The underlying principle of the Public Housing Reform and Empowerment \nAct is resident choice. By encouraging cost-effective and efficient use \nof resources, the bill gives housing authorities the ability to offer \ntheir residents tenant-based assistance where it is economically \nfeasible. It also requires that distressed public housing be vouchered \nout to protect the right of residents to decent and safe housing.\n  A key to increasing resident choice is improving the ability of \ntenant-based assistance programs to meet the demand for affordable \nhousing. This bill makes important changes in the section 8 voucher \nprogram. It repeals program requirements, such as ``take one, take \nall,'' that discourage landlords from participating in the tenant-based \nprogram, and it emphasizes lease requirements similar to those in the \nmarketplace.\n  Micromanagement by both Congress and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development [HUD] has saddled housing authorities with rules and \nregulations that make it almost impossible for even the best of them to \nrun their developments effectively and efficiently. Under today's \nrules, the residents of public housing face powerful disincentives to \nwork and to achieve economic self-sufficiency. The public housing \nsystem must be changed radically before it is entirely discredited.\n  Our bill addresses the crisis in public housing by consolidating \npublic housing funding into two block grants and transferring greater \nresponsibility for the operation and management of public housing to \nthe housing authorities. It provides greater flexibility to housing \nauthorities to utilize their resources in a more efficient, effective, \nand creative manner to improve housing quality, while also providing \nfor local accountability in the use of those resources.\n  The bill ends Federal requirements that have prevented housing \nauthorities from demolishing their obsolete housing stock, concentrated \nand isolated the poorest of the poor, and created disincentives for \npublic housing residents who want to work and improve their own lives. \nIt would, among other things, permit housing authorities to change \ncounterproductive rent rules that currently discourage employment and \nprevent the creation of mixed-income public housing communities.\n  It also repeals Federal preferences and allow housing authorities to \noperate according to locally established preferences that are \nconsistent with a community's housing needs.\n  While allowing well-run housing authorities much more discretion, our \nbill would also crack down on those housing authorities that are \ntroubled. Although small in number, these authorities with severe \nmanagement problems control almost 15 percent of the Nation's public \nhousing stock. HUD would be required to take over or appoint a receiver \nfor PHA's that are unable to make significant improvements in their \noperations. This legislation would also give HUD expanded powers to \nbreak up or reconfigure troubled authorities, dispose of their assets, \nor abrogate contracts that impede correction of the housing authority's \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will help protect the Federal \nGovernment's sizeable investment in public housing. It will also \nempower residents by increasing their involvement in developing housing \nagency management plans, expanding tenant management opportunities, and \nmaking public housing a springboard to dignity and hope.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the inventory \n     of public housing units owned and operated by public housing \n     agencies, an asset in which the Federal Government has \n     invested approximately $90,000,000,000, has traditionally \n     provided rental housing that is affordable to low-income \n     persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into a single \n     program for the operation and capital needs of public \n     housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements; and\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing residents \n     and localities; and\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to consolidate the \n     various programs and activities under the public housing \n     programs administered by the Secretary in a manner designed \n     to reduce Federal overregulation, to redirect the \n     responsibility for a consolidated program to States, \n     localities, public housing agencies, and public housing \n     residents, and to require Federal action to overcome problems \n     of public housing agencies with severe management \n     deficiencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Public housing agency.--The term ``public housing \n     agency'' has the same meaning as in section 3 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act or \n     the amendments made by this Act, this Act and the amendments \n     made by this Act shall become effective on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS; ELIMINATION OF OBSOLETE \n                   DOCUMENTS.\n\n       (a) Technical Recommendations.--Not later than 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives, \n     recommended technical and conforming amendments to carry out \n     the amendments made by this Act.\n       (b) Elimination of Obsolete Documents.--\n       (1) In general.--Effective 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, no rule, regulation, or order \n     (including all handbooks, notices, and related requirements) \n     issued or promulgated under the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 before the date of enactment of this Act may be enforced \n     by the Secretary.\n       (2) Proposed regulations.--Not later than 6 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Congress proposed regulations that the Secretary \n     determines are necessary to carry out the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937, as amended by this Act.\n                   TITLE I--PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING\n\n     SEC. 101. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       Section 2 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2.

Acknowledges the concentration of the very poor \n     in very poor neighborhoods, disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency, and lack of resident choice have been the \n     unintended consequences resulting from Federal \n     micromanagement of housing programs in the past.\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       To reform the public housing system by consolidating \n     programs, streamlining program requirements, and providing \n     maximum flexibility and discretion to public housing \n     authorities (PHAs) who perform well with strict \n     accountability to residents and localities, and to address \n     the problems of housing authorities with severe management \n     deficiencies.\n\n\n                            basic provisions\n\n       Program consolidation.--Consolidates public housing \n     programs into two flexible block grants--one for operating \n     expenses and one for capital needs. Requires HUD to establish \n     new formulas through negotiated rulemaking.\n       Elimination of obsolete regulations.--Eliminates all \n     current HUD rules, regulations, handbooks, and notices \n     pertaining to the 1937 Housing Act one year after enactment; \n     requires HUD to propose new regulations necessary to carry \n     out revised Act within 6 months.\n       Public housing agency plan [PHAP].--As a condition for \n     funding, requires each PHA to submit annually a written \n     agency plan to HUD, developed with an advisory board made up \n     of residents and members of the community. The plan is \n     intended to serve as an operating, management and planning \n     tool for PHAs. The plan would include: a description of the \n     PHA's uses for operating and capital funds; a description of \n     the PHA's management policies; procedures relating to \n     eligibility, selection, and admission; and policies involving \n     marketing, rents, security, and tenant empowerment \n     activities.\n       Vouchering out of public housing.--Allows PHAs to convert \n     any public housing development to a tenant-based or \n     ``voucher'' system, but requires the vouchering out of all \n     severely distressed public housing. Requires each PHA to \n     assess all public housing for the purpose of vouchering out \n     by performing a cost and market analysis and an impact \n     analysis on the affected community.\n       Choice and opportunity for residents.--Provides families \n     with vouchers and the freedom to move out of housing projects \n     that are in deplorable, unlivable condition. Involves \n     residents in the process of developing a PHA plan that is \n     responsive to their needs. Provides funds for resident \n     organizations to develop resident management and empowerment \n     activities.\n       Federal preferences.--Repeals Federal preferences and \n     allows PHAs to operate according to locally established \n     preferences consistent with local housing needs.\n       Income targeting and eligibility.--Allows PHAs to serve \n     families with incomes up to 80 percent of median income, \n     except that at least 40 percent of the units must be reserved \n     for families whose income does not exceed 30 percent of the \n     area median.\n       Rent flexibility.--Allows high performing PHAs to establish \n     rents with protections for very low income families (families \n     with incomes below 30 percent of the area median would not \n     have to pay more than 30 percent of their income for rent, \n     except that a PHA could charge a minimum rent up to $30 per \n     month). Encourages PHAs to develop rental policies that \n     encourage and reward employment and upward mobility.\n       Ceiling rents.--Allows PHAs to set ceiling rents that \n     reflect the reasonable rental value of units in order to \n     remove the disincentive for residents to work or seek higher \n     paying jobs where rents are based on a percentage of income.\n       Minimum rents.--Allows PHAs to set a minimum rent for both \n     Section 8 and public housing units, not to exceed $30 per \n     month.\n       Income adjustments.--Allows a PHA to disregard certain \n     income in calculating rents to take away the disincentive for \n     tenants to work and earn higher incomes.\n       Troubled PHAs.--Requires HUD to take over or appoint a \n     receiver for PHAs that are in substantial default within one \n     year of enactment. Expands HUD's powers for dealing with \n     troubled PHAs by allowing it to break up troubled agencies \n     into one or more agencies, abrogate contracts that impede \n     correction of the agency's default, and demolish and dispose \n     of a PHA's assets.\n       Demolition and disposition.--Repeals the one-for-one \n     replacement requirement and streamlines the demolition and \n     disposition process to permit PHAs to dispose of vacant or \n     obsolete housing.\n       Criminal activity.--Strengthens the ability of PHAs to \n     evict residents for drug-related criminal activity; denies \n     housing assistance to residents evicted for drug-related \n     activities for up to three years; and provides PHAs with \n     greater access to the criminal conviction records of adult \n     applicants and residents.\n       Consortia and joint ventures.--Allows PHAs to form a \n     consortium with other PHAs, form and operate wholly-owned or \n     controlled subsidiaries, or enter into joint ventures, \n     partnerships or other business arrangements to administer \n     housing programs.\n       Designated housing for the elderly and disabled.--Permits \n     PHAs to separate elderly and disabled persons by designating \n     specific projects or parts of projects for a particular \n     population only.\n       Work requirements.--Requires residents to perform 8 hours \n     of community work per month with the exception for the \n     elderly, disabled and those working full time.\n       Section 8 tenant based assistance.--Merges the voucher and \n     certificate program into a single voucher program that \n     emphasizes lease requirements similar to the market place. \n     Repeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to \n     landlords, such as ``take one take all,'' endless lease, \n     federal \n\n[[Page S13857]]\n     preferences, and ninety-day termination notice requirements.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Public Housing \nReform and Empowerment Act of 1995. I wish to salute Senators Connie \nMack and Kit Bond for their successful leadership in the development of \nthis legislation. Without their guidance and direction, there would not \nbe a public housing reform bill before you today. Both Senators are to \nbe commended for their strong commitment to improving housing \nconditions in America.\n  Mr. President, ``The Public Housing Reform and Empowerment Act of \n1995'' is an important first step in the lengthy process of addressing \nthe housing concerns of our nation. It represents a significant \nstarting point in the passage of long overdue reforms of the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. Given limited Federal resources \nand the need to balance the budget within 7 years, Congress must find \nmore cost-effective ways to provide affordable housing. This bill \nrepresents a concrete step in the fulfillment of Congress' \nresponsibility to the American taxpayer to ensure that every Federal \ndollar is maximized to its greatest potential.\n  Substantial input from HUD, public housing authorities, tenant \nassociations and other interested parties has been received and \nincorporated into this legislation. However, I look forward to \nadditional examination of this bill and further improvement of its \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, the Honorable Senator from Florida has outlined the \nprovisions of the bill in great detail. I would like to comment on \nseveral guiding principles of the legislation. First, it would reform \nthe public housing system through the devolution of control from the \nFederal Government to the public housing authorities and their tenants. \nIt would consolidate programs, streamline program requirements and \nprovide greatly increased flexibility to public housing authorities.\n  The bill also provides incentives to facilitate the transition from \nwelfare to work and empower public housing tenants. This will allow our \nnation's public housing residents a greater opportunity to achieve \neconomic independence. Furthermore, the bill would streamline the \ndemolition and disposition process of distressed housing projects \nthrough the repeal of the one-for-one replacement requirement and other \nmeasures.\n\n  The bill recognizes that public housing is most effective when there \nis a viable income mix among its residents. Federal preferences would \nbe repealed. High performance public housing authorities would be \nallowed to establish rents with protections provided for very low-\nincome families. The ``Brooke Amendment,'' which does not allow a rent \ngreater than 30 percent of tenant income, would be waived in some \ninstances. I will continue to closely analyze the impact, both \nimmediate and future, which such a waiver would have on the tenants \nwhom we are committed to serving. Also, special protections should be \nconsidered for elderly and disabled individuals living on fixed \nincomes.\n  The safety and security of the residents of public and assisted \nhousing is a paramount objective. To that end, the bill would allow \npublic housing authorities increased access to criminal conviction \nrecords and permit greater flexibility in the eviction of drug \ncriminals. Public housing authorities depend on drug elimination \nfunding to provide police to safeguard law-abiding tenants. I will \ncontinue to closely examine the practical effects of the bill's \nprovision which would fold the drug elimination grant program into a \nblock grant.\n  ``The Public Housing Reform and Empowerment Act'' officially embarks \nus on the reinvention of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the redirection of our Nation's housing policy. I would \nlike to personally congratulate Senator Mack for his initiative and \nsteadfastness in producing a public housing reform bill which is \nthoughtful and well-balanced. As chairman of the Banking Subcommittee \non Housing Opportunity and Community Development, he faces the strong \nchallenge of reforming the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nI strongly support the Senator's deliberate and measured approach to \naddressing the complex and difficult housing issues before us.\n  HUD is at a crossroads. HUD's fiscal crisis, poor management, and \nlack of capacity have placed the Department in a situation in which it \ncan no longer continue with business as usual. HUD is expected to do \ntoo much and has too many varied and competing constituencies. We must \ndetermine which current functions should be transferred to other \nFederal agencies or other levels of government and which programs, if \nany, should be preserved within HUD.\n  The Banking Committee and its Housing Subcommittees will continue to \nevaluate proposals for HUD reorganization and elimination. Congress \nwill seek to thoroughly address a myriad of housing issues.\n  I would like to acknowledge Senator Lauch Faircloth, chairman of the \nBanking Subcommittee on HUD Oversight and Structure, for his diligence \nin his oversight role of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. His forthright views on the future of HUD effectively \nserve to widen the debate on the Department's potential for reform.\n  Additional legislative initiatives to reform HUD will be offered. \nHowever, reforms must be made with caution and careful consideration of \nbudgetary and social impacts. Congress must assess fully the potential \nramifications of statutory change on State and local governments and \nentities, the capital and bond markets, property owners and managers, \nlocal communities, and program recipients.\n  We must remember that the fundamental goal of this process is to \naddress adequately the affordable housing and community development \nneeds of our citizens in a time of dwindling Federal resources. It is \nimperative that we protect our needy poor and working class residents \nwhom these programs are intended to serve. I believe this bill balances \nthe social purpose of public and assisted housing programs while also \nresponding to Federal fiscal constraints.\n  I look forward to working with all Members of the Banking Committee \non a bipartisan basis to ensure the swift passage of this important \nhousing initiative.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, Senator Mack, Senator D'Amato, and I \nare introducing a housing reauthorization bill, the Public Housing \nReform and Empowerment Act of 1995.\n  Over the last several months, I have worked with my colleagues on the \nappropriating committee where I serve as chairman of the VA/HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and my fellow members of the housing \nauthorizing committee to do something about the train wreck that has \noccurred in public housing. Within this context, this public housing \nreform bill dovetails with many of the public housing reforms contained \nin the VA/HUD FY 1996 appropriations bill and reflects the need to \nprovide streamlined programs and local responsibility as the most \nappropriate method to address local housing needs. This bill also \nrepresents a complete overhaul of the public housing system and a move \naway from HUD's ``one size fits all'' mentality.\n  As I discussed on this floor this summer, when the rescissions bill \nwas before us, HUD not only is a dysfunctional agency but it has made \nfar too many commitments to be able to live up to those commitments. \nHUD has undertaken advance commitments for new housing beyond its \nability and capacity particularly under these budget constraints to \nfund.\n  We have in the rescissions bill taken over $6 billion out of the \ncurrent year's budget authority for Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. In the coming fiscal year, our subcommittee has over $9 \nbillion less for budget authority than we do in the current year. As a \nresult, the budgetary pressures are forcing us to reevaluate all HUD \nhousing and community development programs, including the public \nhousing programs. It is not only the budget pressures, Mr. President; \nit is the total lack of foresight in planning in HUD that has led us to \nthe situation where reforms are vitally needed.\n  Any of us who go back to our States and talk with people who are in \nhousing, who are concerned about providing housing for those in need, \nknow that reforms are needed. The housing reauthorization bill that I \nam introducing with my colleagues on the Banking \n\n[[Page S13858]]\nCommittee today goes a long way towards making the changes in law that \nwill enable public housing authorities in local jurisdictions to make \nthe decisions that are so vitally important to assure that we continue \nto supply housing to those who are counting on it.\n  In public housing, frankly, we are going to move to two flexible \nblock grants, one for operating funds, one for capital grants. I \nemphasize flexibility; for example, the operating funds should be used \nby well performing public housing authority as that housing authority \nwants and needs. Too many times in too many areas we have seen HUD \ntrying to second-guess the decisions made by those who are on-site \ndirectly responsible to the residents or tenants they serve, and the \ndecisions have been delayed or denied. There has been an inordinate \namount of red tape and delay, hamstringing the ability of public \nhousing authorities to move forward.\n  This block grant system would allow PHAs to make the decisions on \noperating funds. PHAs also would have a separate fund for capital \ngrants. This would enable them to decide how to modernize or \nrehabilitate public housing or, in many instances, demolish unusable \nand obsolete public housing.\n  We also tell housing authorities that if they have uninhabitable \nhousing units that are not good places to raise families, that are \nunsafe, unclean, crime and drug havens, then they ought to tear them \ndown and move those families out. This to me is a very important step \nfor us to clean up our communities and provide decent housing for the \npeople who depend upon publicly assisted housing.\n  We think there are tremendous savings and tremendously improved \nservices that will come about from getting HUD out of the business of \nmicromanaging public housing at the local level.\n  Now, we believe that good performing public housing authorities ought \nto be freed of the day-to-day regulation by HUD. We would require that \nall public housing authorities submit a public housing agency plan to \nHUD that tells how they are going to serve their tenants. They would \nhave an advisory committee made up of 60 percent of the tenants or \nresidents who would work with them on the plan, but the housing \nauthority would have the final authority.\n  That plan would be submitted to the HUD Secretary, and the Secretary \nwould have 45 days to disapprove it. If it were not disapproved, it \nwould be in effect. The only reasons the Secretary could disapprove a \nplan is if it is incomplete, does not comply with law, or HUD has other \ninformation that the housing authority is not living up to the \ncommitments made in its previous plans. So there would be some minimal \noversight for good performing public housing.\n  We also make it clear that where public housing authorities are not \ndoing their job, HUD can then step in and provide more extensive \noversight, and if they are totally failed public housing authorities, \nHUD would be empowered to take over the authorities, be able to \npetition for a receiver and take over the management, turn it over to a \ncompetent manager, either private sector, not-for-profit or for-profit \nmanager to make sure that the people who are in public housing are well \nserved.\n  I have seen too many instances, as I have visited public housing \nauthorities around this country, where they are not being well served; \nthe residents are not being well served because too much time, effort \nand energy is being spent on complying with rules, requirements, and \ndirectives that HUD bureaucrats have laid down that make no sense and \ndo not serve local needs.\n  In addition to the basic structure, we get rid of permanently the \none-for-one hard unit replacement rule on public housing. That has \nprevented many, many housing authorities and communities from tearing \ndown outmoded, obsolete and unsafe public housing units. Even though \nthere may only be 25 percent occupancy, the rules that HUD has \npreviously operated under say if you tear down a dilapidated, unsafe \nhousing project, which is only 25 percent occupied, you have to replace \nit with 100 percent of the units. This removes the ability to make \ncommon sense decisions on the demolition and disposition of public \nhousing. The Secretary of HUD has agreed with us, that the one-for-one \nreplacement rule needs to go. That is essential for our communities.\n  This legislation would still continue to protect the poorest of the \npoor by requiring public housing authorities to continue to make 40 \npercent of all units available to families whose incomes do not exceed \n30 percent of the area median income, and to make all other units \navailable to families with incomes no greater than 80 percent of \nmedian.\n  This bill also addresses the problem of mixed populations in public \nhousing where we house both the elderly and the young disabled, \nincluding drug abusers, alcoholics, and people with mental \ndisabilities. This has been a significant housing problem and this \nhousing legislation would provide local flexibility to designate \nelderly-only housing and disabled-only housing, subject to strong \ntenant protections. The existing, burdensome HUD requirements have \nproven to be unacceptable and unworkable.\n  Finally this bill reforms and consolidates the section 8 voucher and \ncertificate programs into a single voucher program which is designed to \nreduce administrative burden and increase the acceptability of vouchers \nin the private housing market.\n  I think of this bill as part of a downpayment on a larger HUD reform \nwhich I expect will be pursued through appropriations and the Banking \nCommittee. I reemphasize that the job is not simple; as chairman of the \nVA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee and as a member of the Housing \nOpportunities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, I can \npersonally attest to the many complexities of HUD programs and the need \nto redirect federal housing and community development policy from \nfederal micromanagement to state and local decisionmaking.\n  HUD has become the poster child for bad government. Nevertheless, I \nam not recommending that we dismantle HUD, but I do suggest that we \ndevolve many of HUD's responsibilities to states and localities or \nother entities better able to handle them.\n  Mr. President, I see that my time has expired. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter in support of this measure prepared by the \nMissouri National Association of Housing Officers be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Missouri Chapter, National Association of Housing and \n           Redevelopment Officials,\n                           Jefferson City, MO, September 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The members of the Missouri Chapter of \n     the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \n     Officials (NAHRO), representing 250 members of public housing \n     organizations across the state today voted to endorse the \n     draft Bond-Mack Public Housing Reform and Empowerment Act of \n     1995.\n       There is a need for safe, affordable housing in every \n     community. Yet public housing authorities cannot hope to meet \n     the needs of their communities in a new era of spending \n     limitations without the flexibility to design and administer \n     housing programs for their own set of challenges. Further, \n     de-emphasizing the Housing and Urban Development Department's \n     reams of regulations in favor of better accountability \n     assessment and incentives is an idea which is long overdue.\n       The Bond-Mack legislation offers a reasonable step toward \n     continuing a federal housing policy with consistent \n     eligibility guidelines and rent floors, yet allowing the \n     establishment of local priorities by providing broad \n     flexibility for demolishing and disposing of obsolete public \n     housing and simplifying the procedures for designating \n     elderly and disabled public housing.\n       Especially important in this difficult budget time is the \n     Bond-Mack bill's elimination of the numerous, restrictive \n     funding categories administered by HUD in favor of a flexible \n     Operating Fund and Capital Fund with part of the Capital Fund \n     available for use for Operating Fund projects. The bill also \n     consolidates the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs \n     into a single voucher program, which translates into improved \n     administrative efficiencies.\n       Public housing authorities welcome the opportunity to show \n     that we can improve housing and streamline bureaucratic \n     regulations if given the opportunity. The Bond-Mack bill \n     recognizes that only by replacing restrictive federal \n     regulations with local flexibility can public housing meet \n     the needs of its communities in tough budget times, and we \n     appreciate having had the opportunity to work \n\n[[Page S13859]]\n     with you and your staff during the drafting of the bill. Missouri NAHRO \n     looks forward to continuing to work closely with you as the \n     legislation continues to develop and move toward final \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Allen Pollock, PE,\n                                              President, MO NAHRO.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 1261. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe avoidance of tax through the use of foreign trusts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the use of foreign trusts to avoid u.s. taxes\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to stem the use of foreign trusts for the avoidance of U.S. \ntaxes. The administration's fiscal year 1996 budget, which contained a \nseries of proposals for change in the taxation of income from foreign \ntrusts, called attention to this problem earlier this year. Since then, \nI have been committed to developing practical rules to dramatically \nimprove tax compliance when foreign trusts are used, without unduly \nburdening legitimate financial transactions. The bill I introduce today \nrepresents a serious attempt to achieve that balance.\n  It is difficult to estimate precisely the magnitude of tax avoidance \noccurring through the use of foreign trusts. But we have some \ndisturbing evidence. Under current law, U.S. taxpayers are required to \nreport the assets held in foreign trusts that they have established. \nBut the IRS reports that only $1.5 billion of foreign trust assets were \nreported in 1993. The estimates of total U.S. source funds held abroad \nin tax haven jurisdictions are staggering by comparison, in the \nhundreds of billions.\n  In 1989, the New York Times reported that financial institutions in \nthe Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and the Bahamas had $240 billion, $200 \nbillion, and $180 billion, respectively, on deposit from the United \nStates. (New York Times, October 29, 1989, pg. 10.) More recently, \nBarron's estimated that a total of $440 billion was on deposit in the \nCayman Islands in 1993, with 60 percent of that amount--$264 billion--\ncoming from the United States. (Barron's, January 4, 1993, pg. 14.) To \nput this in some perspective, Barron's calculated that there was more \nAmerican money on deposit in the Cayman Islands than in all of the \ncommercial banks in California. Although only a portion of U.S. funds \nabroad are held in foreign trusts, the Treasury Department estimates \nthat tens of billions of dollars are held in offshore asset protection \ntrusts established by U.S. persons.\n  Undoubtedly motivations behind establishing offshore accounts vary, \nand tax advantages may pale in comparison to the ability to protect \nassets from U.S. tort or other liabilities. Whatever the initial \nmotivation for moving assets offshore, however, it seems clear that a \nvery large portion of the assets soon disappear insofar as U.S. tax \nreporting is concerned. The result is rampant tax avoidance. Because \ntax haven jurisdictions typically have bank secrecy laws, the IRS is \neffectively precluded from uncovering the information necessary to \nenforce our tax laws. Tax enforcement is almost entirely dependent upon \nvoluntary reporting by taxpayers, and the evidence is clear that \nvoluntary compliance in this area is lacking.\n  Something must be done, and the intent behind this bill is to end the \nease with which taxpayers can reduce their tax bills by legally or \nillegally taking advantage of existing foreign trust rules.\n  Over the past several months I have received extensive comments from \npractitioners and academics concerning the administration's original \nforeign trust proposals and possible alternatives. These comments have \nbeen very useful. I would like to thank in particular the tax section \nof the New York State Bar Association for their detailed analysis. A \ntremendous amount of work went into their submission, prepared on \nrequest and within a very short period of time.\n  The bill I introduce today is substantially revised from the original \nadministration bill--S. 453--to reflect many of the comments received. \nIt has been developed over the last few months in cooperation with my \ncounterpart on the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Gibbons, who \nhas been unwavering in his efforts to improve tax compliance in the \nforeign area. I have also worked with the Treasury Department to \ndevelop rules that adequately address the needs for effective tax \nadministration.\n  There are a number of aspects to this legislation. The provisions \ndesigned to enable the IRS to obtain better information on foreign \ntrusts are perhaps the most significant. The bill would substantially \nstrengthen the current information reporting rules on transfers to, and \nannual operations of, foreign trusts. Among other changes, the bill \nincludes new rules designed to lead most foreign trusts established by \nU.S. persons to appoint a U.S. agent that can provide trust information \nto the IRS. In addition, the recipients of monies from foreign trusts \nwould be required to report amounts received. Penalties for failure to \ncomply with reporting requirements would be raised so that they have \ngenuine deterrent effect--as contrasted to the nominal penalties of \ncurrent law.\n\n  The bill would also close a number of loopholes in the existing \ngrantor trust tax rules, a series of rules that specify when the \nexistence of a trust will be ignored for tax purposes because the \ncreator of the trust retains sufficient control over the assets \ntransferred to be appropriately treated as continuing to own the \nassets. For example, a foreign person--generally not taxable in the \nUnited States--transferring assets to a trust for the benefit of U.S. \npersons generally would not be treated as the tax owner of the assets \nin the trust unless the trust was fully revocable. Instead, the U.S. \nbeneficiary receiving income from the trust would be taxed on receipt \nof that income.\n  The ability to manipulate other foreign trust rules also would be \ncurbed. A U.S. beneficiary's use of property of a foreign trust would \nbe treated as the receipt of a distribution from the trust, taxable to \nthe beneficiary. In addition, a U.S. beneficiary receiving a \ndistribution from a foreign trust's accumulated income would be charged \na market rate of interest on taxes due--on a prospective basis--rather \nthan the currently prescribed 6 percent simple interest.\n  Finally, the bill includes rules to provide greater certainty as to \nthe classification of a trust as foreign or domestic. Under current \nlaw, there is considerable uncertainty on this issue because the \ndetermination is based on all relevant facts.\n  A more comprehensive description of the bill, and of the major \ndifferences between the legislation that I introduce today and the \noriginal administration proposal, has been prepared. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this summary, together with the bill, be placed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation represents a balanced \napproach to the problem of tax avoidance through the use of foreign \ntrusts, and a significant improvement over the administration's initial \nlegislative proposal. There should be an opportunity to act this year \nto end the use of foreign trusts to avoid U.S. taxes. I look forward to \ncontinuing this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordereed to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Trust Tax Compliance \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

INFORMATION REPORTING\n\n                    A. Transferors to Foreign Trusts\n\n       Current Law. U.S. persons are required to report transfers \n     of money or property to a foreign trust. Any person who fails \n     to file the required information is subject to a penalty of 5 \n     percent of the amount transferred to the foreign trust, up to \n     a maximum of $1,000. A reasonable cause exception is \n     available.\n       Reasons for Change. Existing penalties have not proven \n     adequate to encourage some U.S. taxpayers to report transfers \n     to foreign trusts. Information reporting of transfers to such \n     trusts is necessary to identify transactions subject to \n     existing excise taxes and to identify foreign trusts that \n     must be monitored in the future.\n       Proposal. The proposal would increase the penalty for \n     failure to report a transfer to a foreign trust. The new \n     penalty would be 35 percent of the gross value of the \n     property transferred. In addition, monetary penalties could \n     be imposed for continuing noncompliance with IRS requests for \n     information. The reasonable cause exception is retained. The \n     proposal would be effective for transfers occurring after the \n     date of enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal is similar to the Administration proposal.\n\n                   B. U.S. Grantors of Foreign Trusts\n\n       Current Law. A U.S. grantor of a foreign trust is required \n     to provide an annual accounting of trust activities to the \n     IRS. Any person who fails to file the required information is \n     subject to a penalty of 5 percent of the value of the corpus \n     of the trust, up to a maximum of $1,000. A reasonable cause \n     exception is available.\n       Reasons for Change. Existing information reporting rules \n     predate the significant expansion of the foreign grantor \n     trust rules in 1976. In general, penalties for noncompliance \n     with reporting requirements are minimal. As a result, U.S. \n     grantors of foreign trusts often do not report the income \n     earned by foreign trusts. Because these foreign trusts are \n     frequently established in tax haven jurisdictions with \n     stringent secrecy rules, IRS attempts to verify income earned \n     by foreign trusts are often unsuccessful. A regime which \n     allows the IRS access to information held by the foreign \n     trust is necessary to enforce existing law.\n       Proposal. The proposal would require a U.S. grantor of a \n     foreign trust to cause the trust to (1) appoint a U.S. agent \n     that can provide relevant information to the IRS; and (2) \n     provide an annual accounting of trust activities, including \n     separate schedules (K-1s) for income attributable to the U.S. \n     grantor. If the foreign trust does not appoint a U.S. \n     agent, the IRS would be authorized to determine, in its \n     discretion, the tax consequences of any trust \n     transactions. The proposal would retain the existing \n     penalty for failure to file of 5 percent of the value of \n     the trust corpus, except that the penalty would no longer \n     be limited to $1,000. In addition, monetary penalties \n     could be imposed for continuing noncompliance with IRS \n     requests for information. The reasonable cause exception \n     is retained. The proposal would be effective for taxable \n     years of the U.S. grantor beginning after the date of \n     enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The \n     Administration proposal would have allowed the IRS to \n     redetermine tax consequences if the trust did not appoint a \n     U.S. agent or if the trust did not file the required \n     information. The current proposal modifies the Administration \n     proposal by limiting the special IRS redetermination rule to \n     instances where the trust does not appoint a U.S. agent. The \n     Administration proposal would have imposed a monetary penalty \n     of 35 percent of trust income if either the agent were not \n     appointed or the information were not provided. The current \n     proposal modifies this penalty to 5 percent of trust assets, \n     and only imposes the penalty if the required information is \n     not reported.\n\n                   C. Beneficiaries of Foreign Trusts\n\n       Current Law. U.S. persons receiving distributions from \n     foreign nongrantor trusts are required to report them on \n     their U.S. income tax return. If distributions are not \n     reported, the U.S. person could be subject to general tax \n     penalties for failure to report taxable income. A reasonable \n     cause exception is available. U.S. persons receiving \n     distributions from a foreign grantor trust are not required \n     to report them to the IRS.\n       Reasons for Change. Existing penalties have not proven \n     adequate to encourage some U.S. taxpayers to report \n     distributions from foreign nongrantor trusts. In addition, \n     requiring reporting of distributions from foreign grantor \n     trusts will allow the IRS to verify that the foreign trust is \n     a grantor trust.\n       Proposal. The proposal would require a U.S. person \n     receiving money or property from a foreign trust, whether a \n     grantor trust or a nongrantor trust, to disclose the \n     distribution on the individual's Federal income tax return. \n     If a beneficiary does not disclose distributions or does not \n     have sufficient records to substantiate the tax treatment of \n     the distributions, then the distributions will be considered \n     distributions of accumulated income from the trust's average \n     year (the years the trust has been in existence divided by \n     two). If the beneficiary does not disclose distributions or \n     provides inaccurate information, a penalty equal to 35 \n     percent of the trust distributions would be imposed upon the \n     beneficiary. In addition, monetary penalties could be imposed \n     for continuing noncompliance with IRS requests for \n     information. The reasonable cause exception is retained. It \n     is intended that the IRS respect the privacy of foreign \n     taxpayers to the extent consistent with the interests of tax \n     administration. This proposal would be effective with \n     respect to distributions received after the date of \n     enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The \n     Administration proposal placed the responsibility of \n     reporting trust distributions on the trust. The current \n     proposal places that responsibility on the beneficiary.\n\n\n                  ii. outbound foreign grantor trusts\n\n       Under current law, a special rule applicable to foreign \n     trusts established by a U.S. person for the benefit of U.S. \n     persons provides that such trusts are generally ``grantor \n     trusts'', and the U.S. transferor is treated as the owner of \n     property transferred to the trust. The proposal revises \n     certain exceptions to this foreign grantor trust rule.\n\n                       A. Sales to Foreign Trusts\n\n       Current Law. Sales of property to a foreign trust at fair \n     market value are not transfers that are subject to the \n     foreign grantor trust rule.\n       Reasons for Change. U.S. persons who transfer property to \n     foreign trusts sometimes attempt to inappropriately avoid the \n     foreign grantor trust rule by selling property to a foreign \n     trust in exchange for a note from the trust which the U.S. \n     transferor may not intend to collect. (If there is no bona \n     fide debt, these transactions are subject to challenge under \n     current law, because the exchange would not be at fair market \n     value.)\n       Proposal. The proposal disregards any obligation issued or \n     guaranteed by the trust to any related person in determining \n     whether a sale to a foreign trust is for fair market value. \n     This proposal would be effective for assets transferred to \n     foreign trusts after February 6, 1995.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The \n     Administration proposal would have disregarded any trust \n     obligation issued or guaranteed by the trust to any U.S. \n     person. The current proposal only applies this rule to trust \n     obligations issued to related persons.\n\n                        B. Pre-immigration Trust\n\n       Current Law. The foreign grantor trust rule does not apply \n     to a foreign settlor who transfers property to a foreign \n     trust for the benefit of U.S. persons even if the settlor \n     later becomes a U.S. person.\n       Reasons for Change. Prior to becoming residents of the \n     United States, foreign persons often put their assets into \n     irrevocable trusts in tax haven jurisdictions for the benefit \n     of U.S. persons. As a result, the future trust income escapes \n     U.S. tax until distribution. Thus, under current law, U.S. \n     persons \n\n[[Page S13864]]\n     who have immigrated to the United States are able to avoid current \n     taxation of trust income in ways that are not available to \n     other U.S. persons.\n       Proposal. If a foreign person transfers property to a \n     foreign trust with U.S. beneficiaries and the foreign person \n     then becomes a U.S. person within five years of the transfer, \n     the transferor would be treated as the owner of the trust \n     assets when he becomes a U.S. person. This proposal would be \n     effective for assets transferred to foreign trusts after \n     February 6, 1995.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal is similar to the Administration proposal.\n\n                      C. Outbound Trust Migrations\n\n       Current Law. Although Revenue Ruling 91-6, 1991-1 C.B. 89, \n     describes the rules that must be applied when a foreign trust \n     becomes a domestic trust, current rules do not clearly \n     describe the tax consequences of a domestic trust becoming a \n     foreign trust.\n       Reasons for Change. Outbound trust migrations are becoming \n     more common as tax haven jurisdictions enact legislation to \n     enable U.S. trusts to move to those jurisdictions. Rules \n     should be clarified to ensure that taxpayers will not be able \n     to achieve tax results through the outbound migration of a \n     domestic trust that they could not achieve directly by the \n     creation of a foreign trust.\n       Proposal. If a domestic trust becomes a foreign trust \n     during the life of a U.S. person who transferred assets to \n     the domestic trust, the U.S. transferor will be considered \n     the grantor of the foreign trust. This proposal would \n     generally be effective for trust migrations after February 6, \n     1995.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. Under the \n     Administration proposal, unless outbound trust migrations \n     were part of a prearranged plan, beneficiaries of the \n     migrating trust would be considered the grantors of the \n     trust. Under the current proposal, if a U.S. person who \n     transferred assets to a migrating trust is alive, that person \n     is considered the grantor of the trust. If the transferor is \n     not alive, a migrating trust is subject to the section 1491 \n     excise tax (described below).\n\n                          D. Other Provisions\n\n       Transfers at Death. The Administration proposal would have \n     treated U.S. beneficiaries as grantors of foreign trusts \n     which were funded at the death of a U.S. person. The current \n     proposal does not include these provisions.\n       Discretionary Beneficiaries. Because of changes to the \n     treatment of transfers at death and trust migrations, the \n     provisions in the Administration proposal relating to the \n     determination of a beneficiary's proportionate interests in \n     trusts are no longer necessary. The current proposal does not \n     include these provisions.\n\n\n                  III. INBOUND FOREIGN GRANTOR TRUSTS\n\n       Current Law. A person with certain powers over the trust \n     assets (the ``grantor'') is taxed as if he owned the trust \n     assets directly. This treatment is designed to prevent \n     attempts to shift income from U.S. grantors to U.S. \n     beneficiaries who are likely to be paying taxes at lower \n     rates than the grantor of the trust. Consequently, under \n     existing anti-abuse grantor trust rules, the grantor of such \n     a trust is taxed as if he owned the trust assets directly, \n     even if he retains only minimal economic connections with the \n     trust assets.\n       Revenue Ruling 69-70, 1969-1 C.B. 182, provides that if a \n     foreign person is treated as the owner of a trust, a U.S. \n     beneficiary of that trust is not taxable on trust income \n     distributed to him.\n       However, special rules in the Code modify the general \n     grantor trust rules where a U.S. beneficiary has made prior \n     gifts to a foreign grantor. In such a case, the U.S. \n     beneficiary is treated as the owner of the foreign trust \n     assets to the extent of the U.S. beneficiary's prior gifts to \n     the foreign grantor. The rule is designed to prevent wealthy \n     U.S. persons who have immigrated to the United States from \n     avoiding U.S. tax on their worldwide income. Prior to the \n     enactment of this rule, before moving to the United States \n     some immigrants transferred their assets to a foreign \n     relative, who then retransferred those assets to a foreign \n     trust for the benefit of the immigrant. Because the foreign \n     relative retained limited powers over the trust, the \n     immigrant treated the foreign relative as the owner of the \n     trust assets, and did not pay U.S. tax on trust \n     distributions.\n       Reasons for Change. Existing law inappropriately permits \n     foreign taxpayers to affirmatively use the domestic anti-\n     abuse grantor trust rules. Existing restrictions on the \n     ability of foreign taxpayers to use these rules are not \n     adequate to prevent U.S. beneficiaries, who enjoy the \n     benefits of United States citizenship or residency, from \n     avoiding U.S. tax on their income from trusts.\n       Proposal. The grantor trust rules generally will only apply \n     to a trust if those rules would result in an amount being \n     included (directly or indirectly) in the gross income of a \n     U.S. citizen, domestic corporation, or a controlled foreign \n     corporation. The grantor trust rules would continue to apply \n     to trusts revocable by the grantor of the trust, to certain \n     compensatory trusts, and for purposes of applying the foreign \n     personal holding company rules and the passive foreign \n     investment company rules. It is intended that no inference \n     regarding the interpretation of present law be drawn from the \n     exclusion of certain trusts, including compensatory trusts, \n     from the application of the special rules of the proposal. \n     These rules are not intended to apply to normal security \n     arrangements involving a trustee (including the use of \n     indenture trustees and similar arrangements). The proposal \n     retains current rules regarding the treatment of U.S. \n     immigrants who made prior gifts to a foreign grantor.\n       New rules would harmonize the treatment of purported gifts \n     by corporations and partnerships with the new foreign grantor \n     trust rules. In addition, U.S. persons would be required to \n     report the receipt of what they claim to be large gifts from \n     foreign persons in order to allow the IRS to verify that such \n     purported gifts are not in fact, disguised income to the U.S. \n     recipients.\n       If a foreign trust that is a grantor trust under current \n     law becomes a nongrantor trust pursuant to this rule, the \n     trust would be treated as if it were resettled on the date \n     the trust becomes a nongrantor trust. Neither the grantor nor \n     the trust would recognize gain or loss. The section 1491 \n     excise tax would not be applied to such a trust if the trust \n     migrates before December 31, 1996. Under special transition \n     rules, these rules would not apply to certain foreign trusts \n     where the foreign grantor retains substantial powers over the \n     trust assets, if those trusts were funded prior to September \n     19, 1995. Otherwise, this proposal would be effective on the \n     date of enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal modifies the Administration proposal by providing \n     exceptions for revocable trusts, controlled foreign \n     corporations, and compensatory trusts. The Administration \n     proposal did not contain the special transition rules \n     described above.\n\n\n                     iv. foreign nongrantor trusts\n\n                     A. Accumulation Distributions\n\n       Current law. U.S. beneficiaries of foreign trusts are \n     subject to a nondeductible interest charge on distributions \n     of accumulated income earned by the trust in earlier taxable \n     years. The charge is based on the length of time during which \n     the tax was deferred because the accumulated income was not \n     distributed. Under existing law, the interest charge is equal \n     to 6 percent simple interest per year multiplied by the tax \n     imposed on the distribution. Accumulated income is deemed to \n     be distributed on a first-in, first-out basis. If adequate \n     records are not available to determine the portion of a \n     distribution that is accumulated income, the distribution is \n     deemed to be an accumulation distribution from the year that \n     the trust was organized.\n       Reasons for Change. Current rules need to be revised to \n     eliminate U.S. tax incentives for accumulating income in \n     foreign trusts. Practitioners sometimes advise U.S. persons \n     to accumulate income trust because U.S. tax rules impose \n     interest at such a low rate (6 percent simple interest). \n     Thus, interest paid by U.S. beneficiaries of foreign \n     trusts should be modified to reflect market rates of \n     interest.\n       However, current rules also need to be liberalized to tax \n     more appropriately distributions of accumulated income from \n     foreign trusts. Currently, a U.S. beneficiary pays an \n     interest charge on any distribution of accumulated trust \n     income as if the oldest trust earnings were distributed \n     first. The interest charge on such a distribution may be so \n     high as to discourage the U.S. beneficiary from receiving any \n     distributions from the trust. In addition, current rules \n     effectively require U.S. beneficiaries to obtain extensive \n     information about the foreign trust or, if information is not \n     obtained, pay a substantial interest charge based on the \n     assumption that all trust distributions were made from the \n     year that the trust was organized.\n       Proposal. For periods of accumulation after December 31, \n     1995, the rate of interest charged on accumulation \n     distributions would correspond with the interest rate that \n     taxpayers pay on underpayments of tax.\n       Distributions of accumulated trust income would be deemed \n     to come from a weighted average of the trust's accumulated \n     income. This calculation should be simpler than current law \n     because existing provisions require the taxpayer to maintain \n     separate pools of accumulated income for each year of the \n     trust. Under this weighted average method, the taxpayer would \n     only need to maintain a single pool of undistributed income.\n       If information is not available regarding trust \n     distributions, distributions would generally be deemed to be \n     from income accumulated in the average year of the trust (the \n     years the trust has been in existence divided by two). If a \n     taxpayer is not able to demonstrate when the trust was \n     created, the IRS may use an approximation based on available \n     evidence.\n       Taxpayers have used a variety of methods (e.g., tiered \n     trusts, divisions of trusts, mergers of trusts, and similar \n     transactions with corporations) to convert a distribution of \n     accumulated income into a distribution of current income or \n     corpus. The proposal would authorize the IRS to \n     recharacterize such transactions. Transactions that may be \n     entered into to avoid the interest charge on accumulation \n     distributions (e.g., excessive ``compensation'' paid to trust \n     beneficiaries who are directors of corporations owned by the \n     foreign trust) may be subject to recharacterization.\n       The proposal also clarifies existing law by providing that \n     if an alien beneficiary of a foreign trust becomes a U.S. \n     resident and thereafter receives an accumulation \n     distribution, no interest would be charged during periods of \n     accumulation that predate U.S. residency. The proposal would \n     generally \n\n[[Page S13865]]\n     be effective for distributions after the date of enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal is similar to the Administration proposal \n     liberalizes current law by imposing the interest charge based \n     on the weighted average life of the trust's accumulated \n     income instead of the trust's oldest undistributed income. \n     The current proposal also makes a corresponding change to the \n     treatment of trust distributions when information about the \n     trust is not available.\n\n                     B. Constructive Distributions\n\n       Current law. The tax consequences of the use of trust \n     assets by beneficiaries is ambiguous under present law. \n     Taxpayers may assert that a benefidiary's use of assets owned \n     by a trust does not constitute a distribution to the \n     beneficiary.\n       Reasons for Change. If a corporation makes corporate assets \n     available for a shareholder's personal use (e.g., a corporate \n     apartment made available rent-free to a shareholder), the \n     fair market value of the use of that property is treated as a \n     constructive distribution. Further, if a controlled foreign \n     corporation makes a loan to a U.S. person, the loan is \n     treated as a deemed distribution by the foreign corporation \n     to its U.S. shareholders. The use of nongrantor foreign trust \n     assets by trust beneficiaries should give rise to tax \n     consequences that are similar to those associated with the \n     use of corporate assets by corporate shareholders.\n       Proposal. If a U.S. beneficiary (or a U.S. related person) \n     uses assets of a nongrantor foreign trust, the value of that \n     use would be treated as income to the foreign trust which is \n     deemed distributed to the U.S. beneficiary. Thus, if a \n     nongrantor foreign trust made a residence available for use \n     by a U.S. beneficiary, the difference between the fair rental \n     value of the residence and any rent actually paid would be \n     treated as a constructive distribution to that beneficiary. \n     If a nongrantor foreign trust purported to loan cash or \n     marketable securities to a U.S. beneficiary, the loan \n     proceeds would be treated as a constructive distribution by \n     the foreign trust to the U.S. beneficiary. For this purpose, \n     an organization exempt from U.S. tax would not be considered \n     a U.S. person. It is intended that no inference be drawn from \n     the proposal as to the treatment under present law of the use \n     of trust assetss by beneficiaries and others. The provisions \n     would be effective for loans of cash or marketable securities \n     after September 19, 1995, and uses of other trust property \n     after December 31, 1995.\n       Difference from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal is similar to the Administration proposal.\n\n\n                         V. RESIDENCE OF TRUSTS\n\n                             A. Definition\n\n       Current Law. Under current law, a ``foreign estate or \n     trust'' is an estate or trust the ``income of which, from \n     sources without the United States which is not \n     effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or \n     business within the United States, is not includible in \n     gross income under subtitle A'' of the Internal Revenue \n     Code. Section 7701(a)(31). This definition does not \n     provide criteria for determining when an estate or trust \n     is foreign.\n       Court cases and rulings indicate that the residence of an \n     estate or trust depends on various factors, such as the \n     location of the assets, the country under whose laws the \n     estate or trust is created, the residence of the trustee, the \n     nationality of the decedent or settlor, the nationality of \n     the beneficiaries, and the location of the administration of \n     the trust. See e.g., B.W. Jones Trust v. Comm'r, 46 B.T.A. \n     531 (1942), aff'd, 132 F.2d 914 (4th Cir. 19543).\n       Reasons for Change. Present rules provide insufficient \n     guidance for determining the residence of estates and trusts. \n     In addition, the increasing mobility of people and capital \n     make certain factors (e.g., nationality of the settlor or \n     beneficiaries, situs of assets) less relevant. Because the \n     tax treatment of an estate, trust, settlor or beneficiary may \n     depend on whether the estate or trust is foreign or domestic, \n     it is important to have an objective definition of the \n     residence of an estate or trust. Fewer factors for \n     determining the residence of estates or trusts would increase \n     the flexibility of grantors and trust administrators to \n     decide where to locate the trust and in what assets to \n     invest. For example, if the location of the administration of \n     the trust were no longer a relevant criterion, grantors of \n     foreign trusts would be able to choose whether to administer \n     the trusts in the United States or abroad based on nontax \n     considerations.\n       Proposal. An estate or trust would be considered to be a \n     domestic estate or trust if two factors are present: (1) a \n     court within the United States is able to exercise primary \n     supervision over the administration of the estate or trust; \n     and (2) a U.S. fiduciary (alone or in concert with other U.S. \n     fiduciaries) has the authority to control decisions of the \n     estate or trust.\n       The first factor is intended to refer to the court with \n     authority over the entire estate or trust, and not merely \n     jurisdiction over certain assets or a particular beneficiary. \n     Normally, the first factor would be satisfied if the trust \n     instrument is governed by the laws of a U.S. State. One way \n     to satisfy this factor is to register the estate or trust in \n     a State pursuant to a State law which is substantially \n     similar to Article VII of the Uniform Probate Code as \n     published by the American Law Institute. The second factor \n     would normally be satisfied if a majority of the fiduciaries \n     are U.S. persons and a foreign fiduciary (including a \n     ``protector'' or similar trust advisor) may not veto \n     important decisions of the U.S. fiduciaries. In applying this \n     factor, the IRS would allow an estate or trust a reasonable \n     period of time to adjust for inadvertent changes in \n     fiduciaries (e.g., a U.S. trustee dies or abruptly resigns \n     where a trust has two U.S. fiduciaries and one foreign \n     fiduciary).\n       The new rules defining domestic estates and trusts would be \n     effective for taxable years of an estate or trust that begin \n     after December 31, 1996. The delayed effective date is \n     intended to allow an estate or trust a period of time to \n     conform its governing instrument or to change fiduciaries so \n     that the estate or trust may effectively elect to be treated \n     as domestic or foreign. However, trustees will be allowed to \n     elect to apply these rules for taxable years ending after the \n     date of enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. The current \n     proposal is similar to the Administration proposal.\n\n                      B. Outbound Trust Migration\n\n       Current Law. Under current law, a 35 percent excise tax is \n     imposed upon any appreciation in property that is transferred \n     by a U.S. person to a nongrantor foreign trust. A taxpayer \n     can avoid the excise tax by electing to pay income tax on any \n     appreciation in the transferred property. No excise tax is \n     imposed on transfers to foreign grantor trusts. Current law \n     is not clear as to whether the excise tax applies when a \n     nongrantor domestic trust changes its residence to become a \n     nongrantor foreign trust.\n       Reasons for Change. The excise tax is designed to prevent \n     U.S. persons from transferring assets to a nongrantor foreign \n     trust without paying U.S. tax on the appreciation in those \n     assets. Taxpayers should not be able to achieve tax results \n     through migration of a domestic trust that they could not \n     achieve directly by the creation of a foreign trust.\n       Proposal. The proposal would treat a nongrantor domestic \n     trust that becomes a nongrantor foreign trust as having \n     transferred, immediately before becoming a nongrantor foreign \n     trust, all of its assets to a foreign trust. The section 1491 \n     excise tax would apply to this transfer. Penalties would be \n     imposed for failure to report any transaction subject to the \n     excise tax. The provisions would be effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Differences from the Administration Proposal. Under the \n     Administration proposal, outbound migrations of trust with \n     U.S. beneficiaries would generally have been subject to the \n     foreign grantor trust rule, and the migrations would \n     therefore not have been subject to the excise tax. Because \n     the current proposal limits the application of the foreign \n     grantor trust rule to certain outbound trust migrations, the \n     current proposal applies the excise tax to outbound trust \n     migrations that result in a nongrantor foreign trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 173\n\n       Whereas, dogs play an integral role in our lives, \n     communities and nation, in good and bad times; and their \n     present and future well-being in society requires education \n     about responsible dog ownership;\n       Whereas, many assistance dogs provide valuable service as \n     seeing eye dogs; hearing dogs; disabled assistance dogs; \n     drug, bomb and arson detection dogs; and for tracking and \n     locating missing persons and fugitives;\n       Whereas, as the public good is advanced when we foster the \n     ideas of canine good citizens by promoting the positive \n     interaction between dogs and society;\n       Whereas, raising a canine good citizen, is first and \n     foremost, an obligation of the owner;\n       Whereas, dog owners must make conscientious efforts to \n     develop the essential traits and characteristics that \n     comprise responsible dog ownership;\n       Whereas, the decision to become a dog owner is an emotional \n     and monetary long-term commitment which carries a tremendous \n     responsibility;\n       Whereas, dog owners bear a special responsibility to their \n     canine companions to provide proper care and humane treatment \n     at all times;\n       Whereas, this proper care and treatment includes an \n     adequate and nutritious diet, clean water, clean and \n     comfortable living conditions, regular veterinary care, kind \n     and responsive human companionship and training in \n     appropriate behavior;\n       Whereas, dog ownership requires honesty about an owner's \n     readiness and ability to be responsible for their canine \n     companion;\n       Whereas, this requires personal questioning about one's \n     time commitments, desire for a dog and family situations;\n       Whereas, the next component of choosing a canine companion \n     involves educating oneself about obtaining a dog or puppy \n     from a responsible source;\n       Whereas, a responsible source will provide a prospective \n     dog owner with appropriate information about the breed of \n     dog, training, feeding and care;\n       Whereas, the Senate encourages people to be responsible dog \n     owners and encourages people to recognize the positive \n     ramifications on society of promoting Canine Good Citizens.\n       Whereas, the Senate encourages people to recognize the \n     contributions that our canine companions make to all of us \n     throughout the year;\n       Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate proclaims the week of September \n     24-30, as National Dog Week.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I submit a resolution \ncommemorating September 24 through September 30, 1995, as National Dog \nWeek. Dogs have always been a source of comfort and companionship to \nmen, women and children of all ages. They play an important role in the \nlives of many and provide valuable services such as seeing eye dogs, \ndrug detection dogs and dogs that locate missing persons. Dog ownership \nrequires a serious commitment by the owner, but the rewards are great. \nI urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13866-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE RESOLUTION 174--RELATIVE TO VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Thomas) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe brave Confederate and Union soldiers who fought in a turning-point \nbattle 131 years ago today near Winchester, VA. The Third Battle of \nWinchester claimed more than 9,000 casualties and led to the burning \nand massive destruction of the Shenandoah Valley, which had effectively \nserved as the Confederate Army's breadbasket, supplying food and \nmaterials that were critical to the war effort.\n  It is fitting that today the House of Representatives, under the \nskillful leadership of Representatives Frank Wolf, passed H.R. 1091, \nwhich contains title IV, a section containing the Shenandoah Valley \nNational Battlefield Partnership Act. I have introduced the same \nlegislation here in the Senate. I note to my colleagues that we passed \nthis bill by unanimous consent last year and I hope we will take the \nsame step this year.\n  Mr. President, the Civil War is an important lesson for America and \nindeed, the rest of the world.\n   Here we are, 131 years since the War Between the States, and the \nsame type of fighting and carnage that wrought havoc on Winchester and \nvalley towns like New Market, Toms Brook, Port Republic, and Cedar \nCreek, is brutally being carried out in the Balkans today.\n  I have traveled five times to the war-torn Bosnian region. About 4 \nweeks ago I was there with my good and courageous friend Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska. We were in Croatia, right on the border with Bosnia. We \nwent through villages that had been ravaged by cannons and soldiers.\n  Senator Kerrey and I visited a refugee camp and talked with a doctor \nwho appeared to be the spokesman for his group.\n  I asked this doctor, ``Can you explain to me why we are here, in this \ncentury, fighting this type of war of wanton destruction between people \nwho live in villages and towns together and who live inside the same \ncountry.''\n  The doctor answered by saying, ``Senator, go back and study the \norigins of your Civil War.''\n  His answer, Mr. President, is the reason we must pay tribute to our \nheritage by preserving our Civil War battlefields in the Shenandoah \nValley. We must preserve these battlefields so that we may create a \nbetter understanding in successive generations. The threats to the \nUnited States today are unlike World War I and World War II. The \nthreats today are from the weapons of mass destruction, but also from \nthe cultural and religious civil wars that take place throughout the \nworld.\n  As we see in Bosnia and the Balkans today, these internal civil wars \ncan boil over into neighboring countries and indeed, into Western \nEurope and North America.\n  The lessons for future generations are how best we can deter these \nwars from taking place. How best we, as a nation and leader of the free \nworld, can step forward and try and bring about peace. Often the \nteachings and understandings begin hear at home and on hallowed ground \nlike the Shenandoah Valley battlefields.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I attended the dedication of the Third \nBattle of Winchester. It was a great pleasure to be among so many \nfriends and to join in the celebration of preserving that historic \nbattlefield.\n  The commitment by local government and private preservation groups \nhas energized me to ensure that the battlefields in the valley receive \ntheir long overdue national recognition.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my remarks from yesterday's ceremony be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\nRemarks by Senator John Warner on the Dedication of the Third Battle of \n                     Winchester September 18, 1995.\n\n       Good Morning, Director Kennedy, Director Diehl, \n     distinguished guests and ladies and gentleman.\n       I want to join in applauding the tenacity of Congressman \n     Wolf for successfully bringing the parties to agreement, the \n     generosity of Dave Holliday as a responsible steward of this \n     historic property, the commitment of the APCWS for effective \n     preservation efforts here and throughout Virginia, and the \n     responsiveness of the Civil War Trust for recognizing the \n     urgency of preserving this unspoiled ground.\n       In the many years that I have traveled throughout the \n     Valley, I have heard first-hand the heroic stories passed \n     down from generation to generation about this war of valiant \n     military strategies and brave personal sacrifices.\n       Many persons unfamiliar with the deep, intergenerational \n     scars marking this period often ask, ``why now''? Why, after \n     more than a century, stoke the coals of resentment associated \n     with the most divisive conflict in our history?\n       It is not about reviving old hostilities, but of \n     remembering, and paying homage, to old hurts.\n       So many families, so many businesses were destroyed or \n     damaged irrevocably by forces beyond their control.\n       Innocent civilians bore the burdens of ``the burning.''\n       No one who lived in this valley escaped some vestige of the \n     misery which plagued the area throughout the conflict. Their \n     descendants share the pain and the pride today.\n       This region suffered severely from the destruction caused \n     by the 100 engagements that occurred here. Throughout the \n     war, Winchester was pivotal to both sides, having changed \n     hands seventy-six times.\n       The epic ebb and flow of Confederate and Union forces \n     during this conflict, however, is eloquently preserved in \n     books by America's most respected historians--Bruce Catton, \n     Shelby Foote, Douglas Southall Freeman, and Jim McPherson--\n     and on film for the benefit of future generations. \n\n[[Page S13870]]\n\n       So I often marvel at the passion and the emotion that this \n     chapter in our Nation's history still stirs in the hearts of \n     so many of us.\n       I have come to know that it is the love of this land which \n     brings us together today.\n       It is this land which allows us to visualize the fierce \n     battle between Sheridan and Early.\n       It renews our respect for our forefathers whose lives were \n     changed forever by this war.\n       It is the preservation of these battlefields to serve as \n     outdoor classrooms so that our children may understand the \n     sacrifices that were made for a cause to which each side was \n     deeply committed.\n       It is the land that will remain long after we are gone. And \n     it is the land that we must protect so that these events will \n     not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13869-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate \nUkrainian independence. Tomorrow, Ukrainian-Americans will be honoring \nthe fourth anniversary of Ukraine's independence in observance here in \nour Nation's Capital.\n  Ukraine was established as a state in the 9th century, but has \nstruggled valiantly against several invaders to gain its independence \nfrom foreign domination. On July 15, 1990, Ukraine's efforts \nsuccessfully resulted in its declaration of sovereignty, followed by \nits declaration of independence on August 24, 1991.\n  Upon gaining independence, Ukraine has continued to work for both \neconomic reform and democracy. In particular, Ukraine has taken \nsignificant steps to reform its economy, working to stabilize \ninflation, liberalize prices, and privatize industries. Further, \nthrough the creation and continued improvement of a constitutional \nframework, Ukraine is developing its own strong democratic tradition. \nIn light of Ukraine's efforts, it is fitting that members of this \nChamber join in paying tribute to Ukraine's long struggle for freedom.\n  I also wish to pay to tribute to the Ukrainian-American community. \nDuring the long years when Ukraine suffered under foreign control, \nUkrainian-Americans helped keep alive the flame of Ukraine's culture \nand traditions. On behalf of the Ukrainian community in New Jersey and \nall Americans of Ukrainian descent, I am honored to pay tribute, on \nbehalf of the Nation, to the Ukrainian community in commemoration of \nits independence day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13870-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROSALIND W. WYMAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment today \nto pay tribute to someone I consider to be one of my best friends in \nthe world. She is a fireball of energy and someone who has truly \ntouched the lives of many, many people.\n  Rosalind Wyman is an extraordinary friend.\n  ``Politics, arts, sports and my family are my life,'' Roz Wyman once \nsaid. Roz has indeed turned her passion into results.\n  A native and resident of Los Angeles, Wyman has been involved in the \npolitical world since before she can remember; her baby book includes a \npicture of 2-year-old Roz smiling happily at a portrait of Franklin D. \nRoosevelt. Strongly influenced by her parents' belief that you should \nserve your community, she turned immediately to elective politics \nfollowing her graduation from the University of Southern California.\n  At the age of 22, Roz became the youngest elected legislator in a \nmajor U.S. city when she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council.\n  From 1953 to 1965, Wyman served as a member of the non-partisan \ncouncil, earning particular recognition for her successful drive to \nbring the Dodgers to Los Angeles.\n  The late owner of the Dodgers, Walter O'Malley, often said: ``The \nDodgers would not be in Los Angeles if it had not been for Roz.'' She \nalso played a major role in the move of the Lakers basketball team to \nLos Angeles.\n  In the years since she left the council, Wyman has applied her \nformidable organizational skills to a variety of local, national and \ninternational tasks. Among her many other accomplishments, Roz served \nby appointment of the President on the Independent Commission to Review \nthe National Endowment for the Arts grantmaking procedures. Locally, \nshe became President of the Los Angeles County Music and Performing \nArts Commission in 1992.\n  She served as executive chairperson of the Producers Guild of America \n(1977-1981) and as executive vice chair of the Los Angeles Center \nTheatre Group, which operates the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson \nTheatre.\n  She helped direct State and national campaigns and chaired two \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Dinners, each of which set records by \nraising over $1 million.\n  Roz participated in the U.S. Delegation to the United National \nEconomic and Social Council (UNESCO) and was part of the American \ndelegation to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(Madrid, 1980).\n  But, it was in 1983 that Roz Wyman--this legend from Los Angeles--\nwalked into my life.\n  Roz became the first woman ever selected to be the convention chair \nand chief executive officer for a Democratic Convention. She had been \nselected to chair the 1984 convention in San Francisco. I was Mayor of \nSan Francisco at the time. And I can tell you this: The first time Roz \nWyman walked into my office with her list of items that needed to be \nprovided by the city of San Francisco, I knew I had met someone with \nformidable determination and tenacity. And I knew I had made a friend \nfor life.\n  The convention was a huge success. And every convention since then \nhas been modeled on what Roz made happen in San Francisco.\n  Since then, I always knew that Roz was someone who could get the \njob--any job--done.\n  When I thought about running for the U.S. Senate in 1992, Roz was one \nof the first people I turned to and she was one of the first people to \nvolunteer to be a campaign co-chair.\n  For the last 4 years of my life, Roz has been the truly inspirational \nforce who, in spirit, has never left my side.\n  She has opened her home to a tired candidate and staff. She has been \nthe unyielding cheerleader who was always upbeat even in the face of \ntough times. And she has always been faithful to her vision of what is \nright for our State and our country.\n  One of Roz's dreams, she told me, was to see a woman elected U.S. \nSenator from California. I am so honored, and indeed lucky, to be the \nrecipient of Roz's focused attention.\n  Roz will soon celebrate her birthday with her three children, her \n5\\1/2\\ year-old granddaughter, Samantha, and her many, many friends. I \nam so glad that her family has asked some of Roz's friends to pay \ntribute in some way to our Roz.\n  There are few people in the world as passionate, as loving, as \nstrong, and as inspiring as Roz Wyman.\n  Many may know Roz because she was the youngest person ever elected to \nthe Los Angeles City Council or because she almost singlehandedly \nbrought the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.\n  But, in my own heart, I will always know Roz because she is that \nspecial, life-long friend who helped make my dreams come true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13870-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GLIDERMEN OF NEPTUNE, THE AMERICAN D-DAY GLIDER ATTACK\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention a book written by Mr. Chuck J. Masters entitled, \n``Glidermen of Neptune, The American D-Day Glider Attack.'' The book \nportrays the American soldiers who flew in the ``flying coffins'' of \nthe D-Day invasions of Europe. Unarmed, these gliders carried a brave \ngroup of World War II soldiers known as glidermen. One of these brave \nsoldiers was Senate President pro tempore Strom Thurmond.

He \nand his family were American citizens living in Slovakia when World War \nII broke out. In 1942, before they were able to get visas to America, \nHugo Princz and his family were rounded up and put on a grain to the \nTreblinka concentration camp.\n\n[[Page S13871]]\n\n  While all of his family perished in the camps, Hugo Princz managed to \nsurvive Treblinka, Auschwitz, a labor camp in the Warsaw ghetto, and \nDachau, It is a story of remarkable strength and courage. In 1945, \nwhile en route to an extermination camp, Hugo Princz was rescued from \nhis death train by an American tank division.\n  However, Hugo Princz's tragedy did not end with his liberation. \nBecause he was an American citizen and was not processed through a \nDisplaced Persons Center, in 1955 he was declared ineligible by the \nGerman Government for the reparations paid to other Holocaust \nsurvivors.\n  Hugo Princz did not let the matter drop, for Hugo Princz's war was \nnot yet over. While living in New Jersey, where he worked, paid taxes, \nraised a family, and was a credit to his community, Hugo Princz \ncontinued to pursue justice from the German Government. He showed the \nsame courage and perseverance that had brought him through the horrors \nof the Holocaust.\n  Slowly, over time, Hugo Princz began to find support in this country \nfor his quest. He enlisted the help of two talented lawyers, Steve \nPerles and Bill Marks, who pursued his claims in the courts. The \nadminsitration raised the case with the German Government at the \nhighest levels. Congress, belatedly, went into action and threatened to \nstrip German's sovereign immunity.\n  Finally, yesterday, 50 years after the formal end of World War II and \nthe formal liberation of the concentration camp prisoners, Hugo Princz \nmade his own peace and accepted a settlement. It is not enough in \ndollar terms, Indeed, no amount of money could ever compensate Hugo \nPrincz for his suffering--both during the war and during his quest for \nreparations. But by accepting German's settlement, Hugo Princz has \nvindicated his life of courage. He has won recognition of the justice \nof his cause.\n  Hugo Princz is an inspiration to the people of New Jersey and the \nUnited States. I am proud to congratulate him and wish him well in his \nnew, post-war life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13870-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERIC SHAEFER\n\nMr. SARBANES. Mr. President, over this past weekend Baltimore \nexperienced a devastating eight alarm fire which swept through the \nClipper Industrial Park, claiming the life of one Baltimore city \nfirefighter and seriously injuring three others. I rise to pay tribute \nto Eric Schaefer who gave his life during this tragic event and to \ncommend all of the firefighters who responded so quickly and put their \nlives on the line, including Capt. Joseph Lynczynski, Stu Curtain, and \nBarry Blackmon, who were injured in the blaze. This tragedy reminds us \nthat firefighters risk their own lives every day to protect the lives \nand property of others against the very real dangers of fire. I ask \nthat an article about Eric Sheafer, entitled ``Firefighter Loved \nEverything About the Job,'' from the Baltimore Sun of Monday, September \n18, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  The article Follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept 18, 1995]\n\n                Firefighter `Loved Everything' About Job\n\n                          (By Dennis O'Brien)\n\n       If he wasn't fighting fires or jumping from airplanes, Eric \n     Schaefer was probably working in his garden.\n       The 25-year-old Baltimore native spent much of his spare \n     time raising peppers and tomatoes in the garden behind the \n     Glenmore Avenue home, when he and his wife had settled after \n     their wedding in July.\n       Mr. Scheafer, a Baltimore firefighter who was killed \n     Saturday during a fire at a Baltimore foundry, will likely be \n     remembered and eulogized in Maryland this week for dying a \n     hero's death.\n       But friends and relatives said last night their memories \n     are of a lively, flesh-and-blood personality--a nonstop \n     talker and would-be gourmet cook who loved fighting fires for \n     the city Fire Department and jumping out of airplanes as an \n     Army Reserve paratrooper.\n       ``He loved anything that would give him a rush,'' Tina \n     Schaefer said last night of her late husband.\n       Mrs. Schaefer and other relatives said Mr. Schaefer never \n     talked about the dangers of the job he held for 18 months.\n       ``He loved being a firefighter. He just loved everything \n     about the job,'' said Dorian Schaefer, Mr. Schaefer's father.\n       He enjoyed camping and reading books about World War II and \n     Vietnam. He had an aquarium with eight fish and was \n     fascinated by snakes--keeping 15 of them as pets.\n       ``He'd play games with them, sort of tease you with them, \n     say, `Here take this,' and he'd practically put one on your \n     lap,'' said William Boyd, a longtime friend.\n       Mr. Schaefer had the usual culinary tastes. He liked pizza \n     and enjoyed spicing up his taco chips with salsa. But he also \n     enjoyed cooking exotic meals--tuna steaks and scallops in \n     garlic were his specialties.\n       Mr. Schaefer and the former Tina Robinson had known each \n     other since they were in school together at St. Francis of \n     Assisi Elementary School in Northeast Baltimore.\n       Stories about being a firefighter from his fiancee's \n     grandfather, Kenneth A. Robinson, a retired Baltimore fire \n     captain, and her father, Kenneth B. Robinson, a retired \n     fireboat engineer, inspired the Overlea High School graduate \n     to take the firefighter's exam.\n       When he was accepted into the Baltimore Fire Academy about \n     two years ago, ``He knew he had found his life's work,'' said \n     Mr. Boyd.\n       Mr. Schaefer was born in Hamden, the oldest of three sons \n     raised by Dorian Schaefer, a construction worker, and his \n     wife, Suellyn.\n       Mr. Schaefer attended Archbishop Curley High School for \n     three years and then transferred to Overlea High School, from \n     which he graduated in 1989.\n       He worked as a picture framer at Total Crafts, a shop in \n     the Parkville Shopping Center, until 1992. Then, he joined \n     the Army Reserve, serving with the 450th Civil Affairs \n     Battalion, an airborne unit based in Riverdale. As a \n     paratrooper, he had 10 jumps to his credit, according to \n     relatives.\n       Along with his parents and wife, Mr. Schaefer is survived \n     by two brothers, Todd, 22, a dialysis technician in \n     Baltimore, and Chad, 16, a senior at Overlea High School.\n       Services for Mr. Schaefer are set for 11 a.m. Thursday at \n     St. Francis of Assisi Church on the 3600 block of Harford \n     Road. There will be viewing at the Ruck Funeral Home on the \n     5300 block of Harford Road from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 7 \n     p.m. to 9 p.m. tomorrow and Wednesday.\n       Mr. Schaefer's family has asked that memorial contributions \n     be sent to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Burn \n     Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13871-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13871-S13872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALBANIA AND THE UNITED STATES\n\nMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Albanian President Berisha has \nrecently concluded a successful visit to the United States, \nstrengthening the relationship between his nation and ours. On this \noccasion, I would like to share with my colleagues the following \narticle written by Michael D. Granoff, Director of the US-Albania \nEnterprise Fund, on September 6. I ask that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           Albania and the United States: An Old New Paradigm\n\n       There has been much handwringing lately by politicians, \n     diplomats and pundits of all stripes lamenting the state of \n     US foreign policy. The oft cited vision thing. I recently \n     visited Albania as a Presidential appointee to the Board of \n     the US-Albania Enterprise Fund and observed the beginning of \n     a new relationship that may serve as a model as we confront a \n     changing, and perhaps ironically a more unstable, world \n     landscape.\n       Albania was one of the most isolated nations on earth under \n     the communist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha after World War II. \n     A nation with no relationship to the United States. Now, a \n     democratically elected President, Sali Berisha, has embarked \n     on a set of reforms to promote democratic institutions and \n     the development of the private sector. Albania needs to \n     create a new economy out of whole cloth. Its leaders do not \n     have the benefit of prior experience in the world community. \n     Its existing financial institutions are remnants of a bygone \n     age and are not up to the task. To use the terminology of the \n     venture capital business, Albania is a restart and restarts \n     are always risky. In this case I think it may be a good bet.\n       I found President Berisha, Finance Minister Vrioni and \n     other government officials to be committed to reform, honest \n     about their problems and ready to take tough action. Our \n     political leaders could perhaps learn something from the \n     ``developing'' Albanians. Repressed for 50 years, the people \n     of Albania exhibit a palpable desire to take control of their \n     political and economic lives.\n       The US-Albania Enterprise Fund was initiated by President \n     Clinton as the last of a series of funds first conceived \n     under the Bush Administration to promote private sector \n     development in the formerly communist countries of Eastern \n     Europe. The Funds are controlled by Boards of Directors \n     consisting largely of private business people appointed by \n     the President, who serve without pay. As profit-seeking, \n     privately managed entities, the funds represent a new \n     approach to foreign assistance and offer one answer to the \n     current impasse concerning the US foreign aid program in \n     general.\n       The enterprise Fund's goal in Albania is to coinvest with \n     Albanians in small and midsized businesses to create \n     profitable enterprises. If successful, The Fund will assist \n     Albanian employment, reduce imports and help integrate \n     Albania into the global economic system. In addition to our \n     efforts, the US Agency for International Development is well \n     into a major program to assist with agriculture and housing \n     sector development. \n\n[[Page S13872]]\n     The World Bank and other international financial institutions have \n     weighed in with infrastructure and privatization assistance. \n     Together we have the rare potential to work collectively with \n     a government to substantially improve the lives of its \n     people. Many problems remain. The transition from an isolated \n     society where nearly everyone was poor to a democracy where \n     there will be those with more than others will not be easy. \n     For example, the distinctions between equal opportunity and \n     equal outcome are no more easily understood in Albania than \n     is apparent from the current debate in the US over \n     affirmative action.\n       On the political side, the US and Albania are beginning to \n     cooperate diplomatically and militarily on regional issues. \n     Albania occupies an important strategic position in the \n     southern Balkans and has begun to play a stabilizing role in \n     preventing the spread of the Bosnia conflict. As a long time \n     resident in a tough neighborhood, Albania can provide the US \n     with a vital local perspective. The bottom line is that \n     Albania, a tiny nation with which the US has previously had \n     virtually nonexistent relations, has the potential to become \n     an important ally with a growing comity of interests. In the \n     process, I believe we may be creating a model for future US \n     foreign policy that cuts across traditional political and \n     ideological lines. We are doing what we always say US foreign \n     policy is supposed to do--promote democracy and the \n     development of the private sector. And from a geostrategic \n     point of view we are establishing an important alliance in an \n     increasingly unstable region.\n       When first appointed to the enterprise fund board, I must \n     admit I had to look at a map to see exactly where Albania \n     was.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 174, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 174), expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the Secretary of State should aggressively pursue \n     the release of political and religious prisoners in Vietnam.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I am submitting Senate Resolution \n174, which expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \nState should aggressively pursue the release of political and religious \nprisoners in Vietnam.\n  My resolution has been prompted by the recent sentencing of two \nAmerican citizens for attempting to organize a conference in Vietnam to \ndiscuss democracy and human rights. These two American citizens, Mr. \nNguyen Tan Tri and Mr. Tran Quang Liem, were detained for 2 years by \nthe Vietnamese without charge. Mr. Tri has now been sentenced to a 7-\nyear prison term and Mr. Liem to 4 years. Both are in ill health.\n  The resolution calls for the Secretary of State to pursue the release \nof these two prisoners as well as other American citizens--I understand \nthat American citizens from the State of Virginia are imprisoned in \nVietnam as well--and all political and religious prisoners in Vietnam.\n  The President has just normalized relations with Vietnam. I supported \nnormalization, because I believe it will give us more leverage with the \nVietnamese Government to pursue outstanding issues such as MIA's/POW's \nand the release of those imprisoned in violation of international law \nafter expressing political and religious views. Not only are people \njailed for espousing political views, but those who seek religious \nfreedoms are as well. Persecution of Buddhist leaders is rampant. \nCatholic and other Christian leaders have also been imprisoned \nallegedly for political activities under the guise of their religion.\n  I was disappointed that Secretary Christopher and Secretary Lord did \nnot address this matter with Vietnamese officials in Vietnam shortly \nafter normalization was announced. While I appreciate the efforts of \nconsular officers in Vietnam and lower-level State Department officials \nto address this matter with their peers in the Vietnamese Government, I \nbelieve this issue should have been addressed directly by Secretary \nChristopher.\n  Mr. President, I am told that Vietnam has now agreed to retry the \ncases of at least the two Americans. We do not know when, or if, that \nmay occur. In my judgment, it is important to pass this resolution \nimmediately to show Senate support for a quick resolution of this \nsituation.\n  Passage of this resolution is being coordinated with other concerned \ngovernments. Last week the Canadian Parliament adopted a similar \nresolution, and the Australian Parliament will adopt one very shortly.\n  If we are to have a diplomatic relationship with Vietnam, we must \nwork with them at the highest levels of government to urge them to \nhonor their commitment under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nby releasing all religious and political prisoners. We must also urge \nVietnam to continue our efforts to obtain a full accounting of MIA's/\nPOW's.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the effort to pass this resolution \nunder unanimous consent today.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 174) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S.Res 174\n\n       Whereas there are many outstanding issues between the \n     United States and Vietnam including a full accounting of \n     MIAs/POWs; pursuit of democratic freedoms in Vietnam, \n     including freedom of expression and association; and \n     resolution of human rights violations;\n       Whereas the Government of Vietnam continues to imprison \n     political and religious leaders to suppress the nonviolent \n     pursuit of freedom and human rights;\n       Whereas the Government of Vietnam has not honored its \n     commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights;\n       Whereas two American citizens, Mr. Nguyen Tan Tri and Mr. \n     Tran Quang Liem, are among those recently sentenced to prison \n     terms of 7 and 4 years, respectively, for their efforts to \n     organize a conference, after 2 years of detention without \n     charge; and\n       Whereas these two Americans are in poor health and are not \n     receiving proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby--\n       (1) Urges the Secretary of State to pursue the release of \n     the American prisoners as well as all political and religious \n     prisoners in Vietnam as a matter of the highest priority;\n       (2) requests that the Secretary of State submit regular \n     reports to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     regarding the status of the imprisonment and wellbeing of the \n     two American prisoners; and\n       (3) requests that the President meet with relatives of the \n     two Americans at his earliest convenience.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President and the Secretary of \n     State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13872-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13872-S13874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SIGNING OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n171, relating to the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of \nprinciples, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  \n[[Page S13873]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 2 years and 6 days ago, on September \n13, 1993, my colleagues and I were privileged to witness an historic \nmoment on the White House lawn: the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian \nDeclaration of Principles.\n  Last week, on behalf of myself, Senator Brown, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Pell I submitted S. Res. 171, a resolution expressing the sense \nof the Senate on this important anniversary.\n  Today, I am pleased to welcome this resolution's adoption by the full \nSenate. This is an important demonstration of the Senate's continued \nsupport for the Middle East peace process, and a note of encouragement \nto those working to bring it to a successful conclusion.\n  From time to time, it is worth taking a moment to recognize the \nremarkable progress that has been achieved in the Middle East in such a \nshort time. The Middle East has changed so much in the last 4 years \nthat we often take the changes for granted. But reviewing the changes \nmakes us realize that we are witnessing a true transformation in the \nregion.\n  Think of it:\n  Four years ago, before the Madrid Conference in October 1991, Israel \nhad never sat face-to-face in peace talks with most of its Arab \nneighbors. Today, meetings between Israeli and Arab officials--from \nIsrael's immediate neighbors, from the Persian Gulf States, and from \nNorth Africa--are so routine and so numerous that they scarcely receive \nmention in the news media.\n  Just over 2 years ago, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators remained \nlocked in a fruitless stalemate, and direct talks between Israel and \nthe PLO were deemed impossible. Today, there is Palestinian self-rule \nin Gaza and Jericho, Israel and the Palestinian Authority are on the \nverge of reaching an agreement on Palestinian elections and further \nIsraeli troop redeployments in the West Bank, and handshakes between \nIsraeli and PLO leaders are commonplace.\n  Just over 1 year ago, Israel and Jordan remained officially in a \nstate of war. Today, thanks to the courage and leadership of King \nHussein and Prime Minister Rabin, Israel and Jordan have signed a full \npeace treaty, enjoy full diplomatic relations, and are continually \nexpanding their cooperation in security, economic development, tourism, \nthe environment, and many other areas.\n  Mr. President, no one would deny that peace has not yet been secured \nin the Middle East. Much, much work remains to be done. Although the \nIsraeli-Syrian negotiations have at times showed promise, with senior \nIsraeli and Syrian military officers holding substantive talks on the \nsecurity arrangements that must accompany an agreement, these talks \ncurrently seem caught in a stalemate. Clearly, many hard rounds of \nnegotiations remain.\n  Israel's talks with Lebanon are essentially on hold until there is an \nIsraeli-Syrian deal. Israel and the Palestinians must continue to \novercome obstacles to the implementation of their agreements, and their \nnegotiations will get no easier once final status talks begin next \nyear.\n  In addition, the peacemakers of the Middle East face continual \nopposition from those who would use terrorism to upset the peace \nprocess. We were reminded of this once again on August 21 when a \nsuicide bomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem, killing five Israeli \ncivilians. Like the suicide bombings that preceded it, this was a \nheinous and unforgivable act of terrorism.\n  All who are committed to peace must do everything in their power to \nprevent acts of terrorism. Nowhere is this more true than in the areas \ncontrolled by the Palestinian Authority. While the performance of \nChairman Arafat's Authority in security matters has improved with time, \nit must do even more to prevent and punish all terrorist acts. Suicide \nbombers and other extremists must not be allowed to succeed in their \ngoal preventing the arrival of peace.\n  But, the obstacles and the hard work ahead do not change the fact \nthat real peace in the Middle East is today genuinely within reach, as \nit never has been before. The long-held dream of Israelis to live in \npeace with all their neighbors, in secure borders, is now a real \npossibility.\n  To bring this process to a successful conclusion, the parties \nthemselves must make all the difficult decisions. But the support of \nthe United States has always been essential to Middle East peacemaking, \nand it remains so today.\n  Presidents Bush and Clinton, and Secretaries of State Baker and \nChristopher, deserve enormous credit for their unyielding commitment to \npursuing a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and their efforts \nhave earned them the respect and gratitude of parties throughout the \nregion.\n  The Congress has also been consistent in its strong support of all \nefforts to advance the peace process, and expressions of that support \nhelp bolster the parties in their efforts. One recent expression of \nthat support was the introduction of S. 1064, the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act of 1995, which I was proud to cosponsor along with \nSenators Helms, Pell, Dole, Daschle, Mack, Lieberman, McConnell, Leahy, \nand Lautenberg. This bill would allow the President to continue to \nprovide assistance to the Palestinians and to conduct relations with \nthe PLO, but it includes strict new language mandating compliance by \nthe PLO and the Palestinian Authority with all of their commitments. \nThis bill is now part of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, \nwhich will be considered by the full Senate shortly.\n  This past weekend, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO \nChairman Yasser Arafat met to try to finalize the agreement on the \nsecond phase of the Declaration of Principles. While substantial \nagreements have been reached on Palestinian elections, the redeployment \nof Israeli troops, and the expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the \nWest Bank, differences remain over security arrangements in Hebron and \nthe distribution of water resources. Both sides reiterated their \ncommitment to return to the negotiating table to complete this phase at \nthe earliest possible date.\n  In adopting this resolution today, the Senate lends encouragement to \nIsrael and the Palestinians as they seek to finalize the second phase \nof the Declaration of Principles. In doing so, we also mark an \nimportant milestone on the long road to peace between Israel and the \nPalestinians. As we take note of these achievements, let us also \nreiterate once again that the successful conclusion of a comprehensive \npeace in the Middle East is in the United States' national interest, \nand that we in the U.S. Senate stand firmly behind all those who are \ncommitted to achieving that peace.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements appear at an appropriate place \nin the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 171) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n       Whereas the Bush administration and the Clinton \n     administration have both worked relentlessly to build on the \n     Middle East peace process that began in Madrid in October \n     1991, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive, lasting \n     peace between Israel and all its neighbors;\n       Whereas on September 13, 1993, the first major breakthrough \n     of the Madrid peace process was achieved when Israel and the \n     Palestinians signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim \n     Self-Government Arrangements on the White House lawn;\n       Whereas September 13, 1995, marks the second anniversary of \n     this important breakthrough;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged to support the \n     Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles through \n     diplomatic and political efforts, the provision of \n     assistance, and other means;\n       Whereas the May 4, 1994, Cairo Agreement between Israel and \n     the Palestinians resulted in the withdrawal of the Israeli \n     army from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area and the \n     establishment of a Palestinian Authority with responsibility \n     for those areas;\n       Whereas Israel and the Palestinian Authority are continuing \n     negotiations on the redeployment of Israeli troops out of \n     Arab population centers in the West Bank, the expansion of \n     the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction into the areas \n     vacated by the Israeli army, and the convening of elections \n     for a Palestinian council;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles \n     helped pave the way for the October 25, 1994, signing of a \n     full peace \n\n[[Page S13874]]\n     treaty between Israel and Jordan, which established full diplomatic \n     relations and pledged to resolve all future disputes by \n     peaceful means;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty has resulted in \n     rapid normalization and unprecedented cooperation between the \n     two nations in security, economic development, the \n     environment, and other areas;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles \n     helped pave the way for Israel to establish low-level \n     diplomatic relations with Morocco and Tunisia, and to \n     initiate official contacts with Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain;\n       Whereas the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council \n     have announced their decision to end all enforcement of the \n     secondary and tertiary boycotts of Israel;\n       Whereas extremists opposed to the Middle East peace process \n     continue to use terrorism to undermine the chances of \n     achieving a comprehensive peace, including on August 21, \n     1995, when a suicide bomber blew up on a bus in Jerusalem, \n     killing one American and four Israeli civilians;\n       Whereas the issue of security and preventing acts of \n     terrorism is and must remain of paramount importance in the \n     Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; and;\n       Whereas compliance by the Palestine Liberation Organization \n     and the Palestinian Authority with all of their solemn \n     commitments is essential to the success of the peace process: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the Israeli-Palestinian \n     Declaration of Principles on the second anniversary of its \n     historic signing;\n       (2) supports the efforts of Israel and the Palestinians to \n     conclude an agreement on implementation of the second phase \n     of the Declaration of Principles;\n       (3) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, all acts of \n     terrorism aimed at undermining the Israeli-Palestinian peace \n     negotiations and other tracks of the Middle East peace \n     process, and calls upon all parties to take all necessary \n     steps to prevent such acts;\n       (4) calls upon the Palestine Liberation Organization and \n     the Palestinian Authority to comply with all of their \n     commitments;\n       (5) welcomes the progress made toward peace between Israel \n     and its neighbors;\n       (6) commends those Middle Eastern leaders who have \n     committed to resolve their differences through only peaceful \n     means;\n       (7) reiterates its believe that a comprehensive, lasting \n     peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the national \n     interest of the United States;\n       (8) encourages all participants in the Middle East peace \n     process to continue working to achieve lasting peace \n     agreements while adhering fully to all commitments made and \n     agreements reached thus far;\n       (9) calls upon the Arab states to demonstrate their \n     commitment to peace by completely dismantling the Arab \n     boycott of Israel in its primary, secondary, and tertiary \n     aspects; and\n       (10) strongly supports the Middle East peace process and \n     seeks to effect policies that will help the peace process \n     reach a successful conclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/19/senate-section/article/S13872-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
