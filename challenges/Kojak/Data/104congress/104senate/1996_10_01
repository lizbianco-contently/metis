Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the \nleadership for getting this confirmation in place. I think the Senators \nare aware the name of Kelly Johnston has been officially received by \nthe Senate to be appointed to the Federal Election Commission, and we \nhope in the next couple of days final action will be taken on that \nnomination.\n  I am very pleased and honored today that we have confirmed Gary Lee \nSisco to be our new Secretary of the Senate. I have known Gary for over \n30 years. We were in college together. Even though he is a Tennessean, \nhe had the very great wisdom of attending the University of Mississippi \nat Oxford. The Senators from Tennessee, Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, I \nknow, are very proud of this new Secretary of the Senate, but he did go \nto Ole Miss, and keep that in mind Thursday night.\n  But Gary has been a close personal friend. I have admired him for his \nattitude about Government, his family and his relationships with his \nfriends and his work and his businesses. He is an outstanding human \nbeing.\n  He was born in Belvidere, TN. He is married to the former Mary Sue \nBaylis Sisco of Pascagoula, MS, once again, showing his great wisdom. \nAs a matter of fact, my wife made the arrangements for the first blind \ndate that Gary had with Mary Sue. She is a beautiful lady. They have \nthree children: Stephen, 23; John, 21; and Mary Katherine, 13. I know \nthey are very proud of their father this morning, and they are honored \nthat he would be recognized in this way.\n  If I can take just a few moments to give you some more information \nabout Gary. After he attended the University of Mississippi and \nreceived his bachelor of science in civil engineering in 1967, he also \nreceived a master of science in administration in September 1970 from \nGeorge Washington University, and he attended law school at night at \nthe University of Memphis. Gary is a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves.\n  For the past several years, in Nashville, Gary has been involved in \nreal estate management and sales. And before\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\nthat, he had a very distinguished record in Government. After he \ngraduated first, though, from college, he worked for IBM. He was on \nactive duty in the Army, and then he started working in political \ncampaigns, including, I am sure, Howard Baker's campaigns. He was the \ncampaign State chairman for Lamar Alexander when he ran for Governor \nand was elected. He served as administrative assistant to Congressman \nRobin Beard in the 1975-77 period. So he will understand and have a \ngood relationship with the House.\n  Then he also worked for the Senate in a position I think that is \ncritical and will be very helpful to him in this new position. He was \nthe executive assistant to former Senator Howard Baker, giving him \ndirect involvement and very and very active participation in the \nadministration of a Senate office and understanding the way that that \nworks.\n  So I am really pleased with this election. I know that Gary Sisco \nwill make us all proud as the Secretary of the Senate. So I \ncongratulate him and wish him well. And all I have to say is, ``Go to \nwork.''\n  Gary, good luck to you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resume of Gary Sisco \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Resume\n\n                               Gary Sisco\n\n                              June 1, 1994\n\n       Address: 3833 Cleghorn Avenue, Suite 401, Nashville, TN \n     37215.\n       Telephone: (615) 385-4384.\n       Fax: (615) 385-4752.\n       Date of birth: October 1, 1945.\n       Height: 5'10\".\n       Weight: 175 lbs.\n       State of residence: Tennessee.\n       Spouse: Mary Sue Baylis Sisco of Pascagoula.\n       Children: Stephen Knox Sisco, 23; John Cartee Sisco, 21; \n     and Mary Katherine Sisco, 13.\n\n\n                               experience\n\n       January 1993 to Present: Apartment Management Corporation, \n     3833 Cleghorn Avenue Suite 401, Nashville, TN 37215--\n     President/CEO.\n       Firm specializing in the brokerage and management of \n     apartment communities.\n       Dixon Springs Investment Company, 3833 Cleghorn Avenue, \n     Suite 401, Nashville, TN 37215--Shareholder.\n       Firm specializing in the investments of apartment \n     communities.\n       January 1978 to January 1993: Town & Country Real Estate \n     Companies, 3815 Cleghorn Avenue, Nashville, TN 37215--\n     Chairman/CEO.\n       Diversified Nashville based Real Estate firm with \n     management, sales, development, insurance, and investment \n     divisions.\n       April 1977 to January 1978: Elkington, Keltner & Sisco, One \n     Park Plaza, Nashville, TN 37209--Partner.\n       Partner in charge of the Nashville office of this firm \n     specializing in condominium and association management with \n     offices in Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville.\n       January 1975 to April 1977: Congressman Robin Beard, U.S. \n     House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515--\n     Administrative Assistant.\n       Responsible for all staff operations of Congressman Beard \n     in Washington and the Sixth Congressional District of \n     Tennessee.\n       December 1973 to January 1975: Lamar Alexander for \n     Governor, Box 1974, Nashville, TN 37202--State Campaign \n     Manager.\n       Responsible for all of the gubernatorial campaign \n     activities of the campaign of Governor Lamar Alexander for \n     Governor in 1974 state-wide.\n       October 1971 to December 1973: United States Senator Howard \n     Baker (R-Tenn), 2107 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C. \n     20510--Executive Assistant.\n       Federal Building, Memphis, Tennessee--West Tennessee Field \n     Director.\n       Responsible initially of the Memphis Senate Office and \n     subsequently for all staff operations of Senator Baker in \n     Washington and the five offices in the State of Tennessee.\n       September 1970 to October 1971: IBM Corporation, 1256 Union \n     Avenue, Memphis, TN 38104--Marketing Representative.\n       Marketing Representative and System Engineer--Data \n     Processing Division.

Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to thank again \nKelly Johnston for his work over many years for a lot of different \nCongressmen and Senators. I did not realize that he had worked for so \nmany different present Members of the Senate, I think probably at least \nthree over the years. He has done a great job for Senators, like Jon \nKyl. And, of course, he worked with Don Nickles. He has done an \nexcellent job as the Secretary of the Senate.\n  There are some vacancies at the Federal Election Commission, very \nimportant positions. Kelly has cleared the process you have to go \nthrough in being investigated. We need to get him there because there \nare two vacancies at the present time, and at least one or two more \nthat will be coming up in April, and at a time when obviously the FEC \nis going to be the busiest that they perhaps have ever been.\n  But Kelly will put his great experience in the Congress and the \nGovernment and as the Secretary of the Senate to use for all Senators \nand Congressmen, and will work very hard, I know, to make sure that we \nhave clean and honest and appropriate campaigns.\n  So, Kelly, we thank you very much, and we have been honored by your \npresence.\n  Would the Senator from Oklahoma like to add anything?

Mr. President, one, I want to compliment my colleague, \nthe majority leader, and join him in congratulating Kelly Johnston for \ndoing an outstanding job as Secretary of the Senate. Secretary of the \nSenate is one of the highest positions that we have, maybe the highest \nnonelected position that we have serving Congress.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Kelly Johnston from Chickasha, OK, \nfor a long time. He was my executive director when I was the chairman \nof the policy committee, the Republican Policy Committee. He did an \noutstanding job in that capacity. And I had the pleasure of working \nwith him on the Senate Campaign Committee, and watching him do very \nable leadership as the Secretary of the Senate.\n  On behalf of all Senators, I just want to congratulate him for his \nservice,\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\nthank him for his service, and send him best wishes, as he would assume \nnew responsibilities at the Federal Election Commission.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished senior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I am sure I speak on behalf of all Senators when I \ncommend Kelly Johnston for the fine job he has done. He has worked here \nfor a number of years in many capacities. He has proven himself to be \ndiligent, efficient, capable. And we are all pleased with the way he \nhas handled matters.

Mr. President, this gives me an opportunity to speak \nbriefly at least about those of my colleagues, particularly my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, who are voluntarily retiring from \nthe U.S. Senate this year. I know of no such occasion during my career \nhere in which so many Members whom I regard as my close friends and \nwhom I regard as wonderful contributors to the deliberations in this \nbody, have chosen to move on to another phase in their lives at exactly \nthe same time.\n  In one sense, of course, first among those must be my seatmate in the \nvery next desk to me on my left here, the wonderful, charming and \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum]. Senator Kassebaum, \nto the best of my knowledge, during my time with her here has never \nonce raised her voice, but at the same time I have often been able to \ndescribe her as having a will of iron. I cannot tell you, Mr. \nPresident, how often, even though we are closely allied \nphilosophically, I have had a particular matter on which some other \nSenator has told me Mrs. Kassebaum has made a decision and I have \nattempted to talk to her about, perhaps, reconsidering that decision. I \ncannot count the number of occasions on which that has happened, but I \ncan easily count the number of occasions on which I have been \nsuccessful, because it is none.\n  When the Senator from Kansas has thought out an issue and has \ndetermined a course of action, that is the course of action she is \ngoing to take. It didn't matter whether it was her seatmate here or the \nRepublican leadership or the President of the United States who \nattempted to change that course of action. It would not change.\n\n  For that reason, I found it particularly flattering to have at least \na few occasions on which she has asked me for my own views on a subject \nbefore she has made up her mind. On occasion, at least, it seems to \nhave given my arguments or my position some weight. But it is that \nstrength of character coming from her family and the place in which she \nlives, and her unerring sense of right and wrong, what is proper and \nimproper, that has caused her to make such a profound contribution to \nthis body. She has made better each of the Senators with whom she has \ncome in contact. I believe I can say that she has influenced us all and \ninfluenced us all toward our better natures.\n  During these final 2 years of her career here in the U.S. Senate, she \nhas, of course, been the chairman on the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, and I have had the privilege of serving on that third major \ncommittee as a junior member. I have observed her patience in dealing \nwith a large number of members on that committee who are quite willing \nto speak out on almost every issue, and to do so at length, and I have \nseen, almost without exception, how the patience of Senator Kassebaum \nhas ultimately triumphed, together with her willingness to listen to \nthe views of others and to accommodate them in building a majority for \nimportant pieces of legislation originating in that committee.\n  Her success in the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill is perhaps the \nsingle finest example of that form of cooperation and will remain a \nvery real tribute to a person such as the Senator, but is only one of a \nlegion of such accomplishments during the period of her three terms in \nthis body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12048-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12048-S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM COHEN\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, another close friend who is retiring is \nthe wonderful, talented, thoughtful, and intellectual senior Senator \nfrom Maine, Bill Cohen, whose career in the two Houses of Congress \nbegan in 1973. One level climaxed during his first term in the House of \nRepresentatives when, as a member on the Committee on the Judiciary, he \nsat through the impeachment hearings relating to President Nixon. I was \nnot a Member of this body, or indeed in Washington, DC, during that \nvitally important and profound national debate. But I can remember, \nfrom afar I gained admiration for that very junior minority member of \nthe House Judiciary Committee in connection with his public agonizing \nover an appropriate answer, the way in which he asked questions, and \nthe way in which he justified his ultimately extremely difficult but, I \nthink, correct decision on that matter.\n  He has, of course, been a Member of this body during my entire career \nhere, as a thoughtful, highly independent mind, with a brilliant tongue \nand ability to state his position that is almost entirely unmatched. \nBut, Mr. President, I think I will remember Senator Cohen most for his \nrelationship with another former colleague of ours, Senator Warren \nRudman of New Hampshire. The Presiding Officer remembers Senator Rudman \nvery well. I often describe him as the only person I have known in my \nlife who was always right, was never shy about sharing his absolutely \ncorrect views with everyone else, and who, even in a crowd of eight \nSenators, could occupy 75 percent of the talking time. Yet, with all of \nthose qualities, he was greatly beloved by all who came in contact with \nhim and was a wonderfully effective Senator.\n  The only Member of this body, however, who could ever prick Senator \nRudman's balloon was Senator Cohen. He did so constantly, occasionally \non the floor of the Senate, but literally every day in private \nrelationships. To listen to the conversations between the two of them \nand the way in which Senator Cohen could deal with Senator Rudman was a \nwonderful privilege. While I know Senator Cohen looks forward to \nanother wonderful career, I cannot but suspect that at least one of\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\nthe reasons for his retirement now is the absence of any other person \nin this body with whom he could deal and interact in the way in which \nhe did with our friend from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman. But Senator \nCohen's wisdom and independence and thoughtfulness will be greatly and \nprofoundly missed in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12048-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, you, Senator Brown, happen to be the \nPresiding Officer as I come to the floor to make these remarks. You are \nthe one Member whose decision not to return I can least understand. \nSenator Brown has been a friend, recommended to me by one of his \nclosest friends in the House of Representatives as his closest friend, \nduring the course of this last 6 years. You, perhaps above all of us on \nthis side of the aisle, have been absolutely unafraid to take a \nposition which would gain you only a tiny handful of votes. I know how \nmany times I have come back to you during a rollcall to inquire whether \nor not one of your amendments could reach double digits during the \ncourse of a rollcall. But it has been one of your great features--a \nwillingness to say, ``no,'' the conventional wisdom is not correct, the \neasy way out is not the right way to go; there is a different way, a \nway that is better for the American people, better for all of us, \nalbeit more difficult.\n  I know there have been occasions--a few occasions at least--in which \nthose views have been expressed with such eloquence that they have \nactually prevailed in this body, and there are a number of times in \nwhich you can say, with I hope most of us, that, ``But for me, the \nfinal result would have been different, and we are better off for me \nhaving been here.''\n  Your cheerfulness and happiness and your willingness to deal with \nadversity has, I think, been an inspiration to every single one of us \nin this body. I do have every hope that you will be successful in \nwhatever lies ahead in your career. I do know that not just by this \nSenator, but I believe by all of your colleagues, you will be greatly \nand wonderfully missed.\n  One last point in that connection which I found, about a year and a \nhalf ago, to be particularly profound was your role in the very \ndifficult decision made by my other seatmate, the junior Senator from \nColorado, to change parties, and to come over to this side. I don't \nknow whether he would have been able to bring himself to do that at the \nsame time or in the same way had it not been for the constant \nencouragement, friendship, thoughtfulness, and guidance that you \nprovided for him. That itself will be a part of your heritage, which \nwill live in this body long after you have left it yourself.\n  I must say this will be a lesser place without you. I note that the \nmajority leader is now on the floor. I have several other talks like \nthis to make about other Members, but for the time being, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding, and also for his very kind remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12049-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12049-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, 14 of our colleagues will be retiring from \nthe Senate at the end of this year. That is almost one-seventh of this \nbody. Their departure represents a major turnover in the membership of \nthe Senate, an institution which prizes itself on its continuity and \nits gradual pace of change.\n  With these 14 leaving, surely the Senate will be a different place \nnext year. We have been enriched by these 14 Senators each in their own \nway, and in many ways over the years.\n  In the last 2 weeks it has been very hectic here, and I would have \ntaken the floor earlier to comment about these distinguished Senators \nexcept for that very busy schedule. But I am glad now that I have the \ntime to talk with a little leisure, and maybe even tell some special \nstories that I remember about some of these Senators. Each of them \ndeserve special recognition.\n  I am glad so many Senators have spoken at length about those who will \nsoon leave us. I went back and read several of the statements that were \nmade Friday and Saturday, including some of the statements by Senators \nthat will be leaving--particularly Senator Cohen of Maine. I found his \nremarks very interesting and enlightening, and typical of the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  As everyone knows, the last few weeks have been an extraordinarily \nbusy time. We have managed to deal with many items that have been \nstalled but most importantly we successfully pulled together the \nomnibus appropriations bill that will fund most of the Federal \nGovernment and direct many of its policies for years ahead. It wasn't \neasy for some Members and staff. It took literally weeks, and many of \nthe Senators and staff members stayed up literally all night for 2 \nnights in a row. They did great work, and we are very proud of their \nwork.\n\n  We are proud that we were able to complete our work last night in a \nbipartisan fashion. There was an overwhelming vote for that work \nproduct. I believe the vote was 84 to 15.\n  So now in the little time we have left in this 104th Congress I can \nfinally get around to paying proper respects, although in an \nabbreviated form, to these distinguished Senators.\n  Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, for example, is widely expected \nto remain a force in our national politics. That is a tactful way of \nsaying he is too impressive to ignore and too young to be relegated to \nthe political hall of fame. He spent 18 years in the Senate proving \nthat a Rhodes scholar can play hardball when he has to--and disproving \nthe old adage that Senators can't jump. We wish him well and know that, \nin more ways than one, we will be hearing from him over and over again.\n  As we are preparing to leave, one of the bills that is left is the \nso-called ``parks bill.'' I found myself last night here in the well \ntalking to the Senator from New Jersey. He was involved working with \nthe Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, to find a way to get that \none last bill done. He last left his mark on this institution, and his \nmark on some outstanding legislation. And we look forward to working \nwith him in a different role in the future.\n  Of course, my good friend sitting in the Chair this morning, Senator \nHank Brown of Colorado, leaves us far too soon after only one term in \nthe Senate.\n  I remember very well receiving his call--I believe it was 2 years ago \nright after we had the election. In fact, I was running for a position \nmyself at the time. And he was giving me suggestions. But he also \nwanted me to know. ``And, by the way, I am leaving.'' I almost passed \nout. I could not believe it. I cannot envision serving in the Congress \nwithout Hank Brown. He is just one of the most insightful Members I \nhave ever known--brilliant in a very modest way.\n  I really do wish we had time to get him on the Finance Committee \nbecause his hand on the tax policy of this country would have been a \nwonderful sight to behold.\n  I remember that several of the things I have done over the years, \nthat probably have gotten me into more trouble than I wanted, had been \nsuggested by Hank Brown. I will not forget my friend from Colorado. We \nsurely will miss Hank, and we know that, again like the others, we will \nbe hearing from him, and that his insightful intellectual integrity and \nhis unfailing courtesy will continue to serve him well as he goes back \nto his beloved Colorado.\n  Senator Bill Cohen seems also far too young, both in years and in \nspirit, to have served in Congress for 24 years. Senator Cohen of \nMaine, Senator Cochran of Mississippi, and I were sworn in together as \nMembers of the House of Representatives in 1973. We all have been \ntogether really ever since, even though the two of them came over to \nthe Senate in 1978 and I didn't come over. I trailed along 10 years \nlater. We have been through some incredible experiences together.\n  I have grown over the years to just come to admire and respect Bill \nCohen so much. On the Armed Services Committee we are not just \ncolleagues but comrades. We worked together to advance our Nation's \nsecurity. We have a common interests in the magnificent cruisers and \ndestroyers that defend our shores so well.\n\n  Bill Cohen turned out to be a novelist and a poet. He even published \na book of poems. I mean, can you imagine? Most people would do well to \nwrite\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\none poem. He has written a book of poems, as well as being an expert on \nmatters as diverse as weapons systems and the problems of the elderly--\nand always as an independent thinker for the people of his State and \nfor our country.\n  There are many issues on which we disagree, and we didn't always vote \ntogether, obviously. But none of them could diminish our mutual respect \nor my admiration for his dedication to his State and to his country.\n  We all certainly wish he and Janet Godspeed in the years ahead.\n  Senator Jim Exon from Nebraska has served with distinction as ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee. As a junior member of that \ncommittee, I far preferred him in the latter role in the minority. But \nI respected his commitment and appreciated his fairness no matter what \nparty was in the majority.\n  There may be no more thankless task in the Senate than trying to \nsteer the budget process, from either side of the aisle. And it takes a \nlot of teamwork and cooperation between the chairmen. In the last \ncouple of years Senator Domenici and Senator Exon--I watched them work \ntogether many times standing shoulder to shoulder in the same position. \nI know I speak for all of us in expressing our appreciation for Jim's \nleadership, for his friendship, and for all the times his prairie \npersonality has taken the edge off the sharp issues, and helped us to \nsee the other side.\n  In fact, I have enjoyed this very year. He would come over on to the \nfloor and say, ``You know, Dole is trying to get me to be his running \nmate, and I am giving it a lot of thought.''\n  He always had something to say that just loosened you up a little \nbit.\n  I have enjoyed working with him.\n  Senator Sheila Frahm of Kansas has been with us for only a matter of \nmonths. Coming to the Senate in the aftermath of Senator Dole's \ndeparture, she immediately faced extraordinary circumstances which she \nmet with admirable effort and ability.\n  She has dealt with both her official duties and her political \nposition with a heartfelt commitment to the people of Kansas.\n  Someone once defined courage as grace under pressure. Sheila Frahm \nhas exceeded that standard. To grace she has added an unfailing \ncordiality, a no-nonsense devotion to her work that really defines what \nit means to be a Senator of the United States.\n  In the Senate, it is not how long you are a member of the team. It is \nhow you handle the plays for the time that you are on the field. I know \nI am not alone in looking forward to her next appearance in whatever \narena of public service that she chooses.\n  I referred earlier to the hard work, the long hours, and the positive \nway in which we reached a bipartisan conclusion to our omnibus \nappropriations bill just last night. A lot of the credit has to go to \nthe gentle nature, the intelligence, the modesty, and the persistence \nof Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon. He has been working here for 30 \nyears as a central figure in the progress and the dramas of the \nAmerican Republic. He is now an institution within this institution. He \nhas been more than a witness to great events of the last 30 years. He \nhas been a key participant in many of them.\n\n  I remember when I first came to Washington in 1968 as a 26-year-old \nyoung staffer. Mark Hatfield was already here and making a mark, and \nmaking waves sometimes. But because of Mark's work over these three \ndecades, American education has been transformed, American health care \nand medical research are revolutionized, and public policy is more \nhumane, more just, and more compassionate. That is his memorial, and it \nis far larger a monument than the many statues that line the corridors \nof this Capitol.\n  Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama is often called the Judge, and for \ngood reason. It is more than a reference to his previous position in \nthe State of Alabama. It is a tribute to his temperament and his \nfairness, a special knowledge of the way he deals with issues and with \npeople.\n  Some people say he talks a little funny. I never noticed it. I think \nhe has no accent whatsoever. But I do get a little chuckle out of the \nfact sometimes that people come over and say, ``Intrepret that for \nme.'' But whatever he is saying, it is worth listening to.\n  The Judiciary Committee will be poorer for his absence. We will all \nmiss the way his self-effacing approach to a contentious matter could \nreinforce the comity that should always prevail in this body. While we \nshare his happiness at the prospect of spending more time with his \nfamily, he and Mrs. Heflin will be missed from our Senate family.\n  They truly have been a family. Anytime there was an event off this \nfloor, Mrs. Heflin was there. They were always a team. They were great \nrepresentatives for our country in foreign affairs.\n  So I hasten to add, speaking as a neighbor, that they will be warmly \nwelcomed across the border, and I know we are going to see a lot more \nof them here in Washington also.\n  Senator J. Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana, is another neighbor, and \nwe have often worked together on regional matters.\n  While no one has ever doubted his loyalty to his party, he has often \nhelped us bridge our differences to reach consensus. That has been \nespecially true in his role, first as chairman, then as ranking \nminority member, on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  He now ends 24 years of service in the Senate and the Nation. It is \nhard to believe it has actually been that long. His departure will not \nend the friendship on both sides of the aisle, the best tribute to his \nstanding among us. In fact, just last night there was a tremendous \ndinner held in his honor. Unfortunately, we were having a couple of \nvotes, and it was interrupted a little bit, but a tremendous outpouring \nof affection from his constituents and from his colleagues in the \nCongress showed him just how much we do appreciate him.\n  Senator Nancy Kassebaum, of Kansas, came to Washington many years ago \nas a staff member to then Senator James Pearson, of Kansas. So I guess \nI should say she worked her way up the ladder.\n  Six years ago, when she was contemplating retirement, her colleagues \nsported buttons saying ``Run, Nancy, Run.'' I wore one. We wanted her \nto stay. She ran, and, to no one's surprise she won overwhelmingly. If \nwe had prevailed upon her to run again, she would win again.\n  Now it is time, she says, to go to--I think she calls it a farm. I \nhad occasion to be in Topeka, and I landed at the airport, and there \nwas Nancy Kassebaum, casually dressed and looking awfully relaxed and \nmaking me jealous that she was already in that frame of mind that she \nwas enjoying retirement in her beloved land of Topeka, KS.\n  I could pay her tribute, as other Senators have, in appropriate \nflowery language, but in the final analysis I need only say this: When \nNancy first came to the Congress, she was referred to as Alf Landon's \ndaughter, but henceforth the identification will be reversed. From here \non out, Alf Landon will be known as Nancy Kassebaum's father.\n  Senator Sam Nunn, of Georgia, also has spent 24 years in the Senate, \nduring which time our country and all mankind have gone through \ntremendous changes. One thing that has not changed is Sam Nunn's \nsingle-minded devotion to his country's security in a dangerous world. \nLet me say something indelicate but something every one of his \ncolleagues know. The Senate did not have to be the highest post to \nwhich Sam Nunn aspired. But he made his choices, and we are thankful \nfor them.\n  His independent judgment has steadied the Senate in rocky times. I \nknow that from personal experience. As a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I worked with Sam in a bipartisan way across the aisle on \nmany issues, many times very controversial issues. Even now on the \nSunday morning talk shows, when most of the guests are on, I am \nflipping over to a football game or reading the paper or going out in \nthe backyard to water the flowers. When Sam Nunn is on, I stop and \nlisten because what he has to say is always very important and very \nimpressive. His solid character has given weight to our deliberations. \nHe has been a Senator's Senator, and I thank him for the gift of his \nexample.\n\n  Senator Claiborne Pell now closes out 36 years--36 years--six terms \nin the Senate. That is longer than many Members, particularly in the \nHouse,\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\nhave been alive. As a young diplomat in postwar Europe, he saw the \nimposition of Soviet communism upon Eastern Europe. But he was here to \ngreet the leaders of those same nations when, two generations later, \nthey reclaimed their independence and their liberty. Among us here he \nhas always retained the skills of the diplomat. No one can recall an \nangry word or destructive gesture on his part.\n  I wonder how many college students, present and past, realize that he \nis the ``Pell'' in their Pell grants. It is no matter, for his \nsatisfaction has been in doing, not in the credit. We give it to him \nnonetheless with appreciation for what he has meant to the Senate and \nto the Nation.\n  I was very much impressed with the comments of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms], just recently. He was emotional, and he said, ``I \nadmit it because we all love this man.'' And it is typical.\n  I was going down the hall on the first floor one day when I had the \nwhip office adjoining his little office. He stopped me, and he said, \n``Have you ever seen my little room in here where I do most of my \nwork?'' I had not, and I walked in. It is an incredible room. I \nencourage my colleagues, if you haven't been in it, go. First of all, \nit is not real tidy. It has a smell of history, and it has a look of \nhistory--pictures that go back 50 years, 100 years, documents. It is a \nmuseum, and it is one room of one Senator in this building down on the \nfirst floor. I have enjoyed getting to know Senator Pell.\n  Senator David Pryor, of Arkansas, is a holder of the triple crown of \nAmerican politics. He has served as Governor, Congressman, and Senator. \nI guess you could consider that the ultimate in recycling. They say you \nnever know who your friends are until you run into real trouble. Well, \nwhen David ran into trouble a few years ago with some rather serious \nheart problems, a heart attack while at home alone in his bed, the \nextent and the depth of his friendships in the Senate became clear. \nThere is no greater tribute than having colleagues worry about your \nabsence.\n  No one could say that Senator Pryor is flashy in the traditional \nsense. That is why his quiet work on the Finance Committee and on the \nAging Committee, which he formerly chaired, has made a difference and \nhas rightly been his proudest accomplishment. Even now he is having \nsome difficulty with a family member who has had to have some surgery \nand is going, I believe, to Houston for further evaluation this very \nweek, and I have watched here in the Chamber as Senator after Senator \ngo up to David--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, North, \nSouth, it makes no difference. They genuinely are interested and \nconcerned because David is interested and concerned. We salute him for \nall he has done.\n  Paul Simon, he of the bow tie. I thought it was a great tribute to \nhim last week when we all wore bow ties. We just thought it was an \nexpression of our affection for him. I think he enjoyed it, and we \ncertainly all enjoyed it. He has received so many tributes that day and \nsince from Senators it has left me very little I can say in addition, \nbut he certainly has also left a mark here, not just his trademark bow \nties, as they do not represent the important things about him--a \nthoughtfulness about issues, a civility about disagreements, a coolness \nabout crises. The Senate's loss in his leaving is tempered by our \ncertainty that it is hardly the end of his presence in public life in \nour country. We will be hearing his voice. We will be reading his \ninsights for many years to come.\n  Last and not least is the tall cowboy from Wyoming, Alan Simpson, \nprobably one of the better known Members of the Senate. Once you have \nseen him, it is hard to forget him. Of course, among all his other \nachievements over the years--he has been in leadership, he has been \nhighly involved in many issues--he has done radio shows, I think almost \ndaily, in which he and his friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nexchange pleasantries. It is great to listen to them. It is always hard \nhitting, insightful and funny. They genuinely like each other; you can \ntell it in the radio show.\n  The news media relish his keen and sometimes acerbic comments. He is \nalways good for a laugh with those western stories that he seems to \nembellish more and more every time he tells them. I have heard some of \nthem many times, and they are funny every time. Yet we should not miss \nthe point of his famous humor. He uses it as a tool to deflate \npomposity, to replace tension with camaraderie, to replace argument \nwith communication.\n  The 104th Congress is closing with a landmark victory for Senator \nSimpson, enactment of an illegal immigration bill on which he has long \nlabored. I know in many respects he will consider it his crown jewel, \nhis greatest accomplishment legislatively over the years.\n  It really frustrated me a week or so ago when it looked like we might \nactually lose it or lose major portions of it, but he was determined, \nhe was relentless, he was aggressive, and again he employed his best \nweapon of all, humor. But just this past Saturday, at 2:30 in the \nmorning, Alan Simpson was ramming around these corridors looking for \nwhere the meetings were on illegal immigration. He was not going to let \nthem escape his grasp. Every place the negotiations settled for a \nmeeting to talk about various subjects that always led to illegal \nimmigration, lo and behold the door filled up with the image of Al \nSimpson once again.\n  We all know that there is much more he wanted to accomplish, but the \ntimes, and perhaps the tempers, were not right. So we have much to come \nback to next year, including those hot wires that Senator Simpson had \nthe courage to grasp barehanded. Sometimes we would all stand back and \nsay, ``Al, don't touch that. But if you do, don't mention my name.''\n  No one knows better than I how difficult it is to be his opponent. By \nthe same token, I know firsthand how devoted he is to the Senate, how \nloyal he is to his conscience, and how, many times, come next year we \nwill wish we were there, having him stand tall--very tall--among us \nall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12049-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12051-S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JUDGE JAMES FRANKLIN BATTIN\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nMontana's favorite citizens, who died last Friday. Some will remember \nhis name and some will remember his presence in these halls of \nCongress. Judge James Franklin Battin left a legacy of service to this \nNation and to our State of Montana, and to everyone who came in contact \nwith him. He was 71 years old. He died of cancer at his home in \nBillings, MT. He is survived by his wife Barbara, two daughters, and a \nson who is now serving as a member of the California State legislature.\n  The judge was born February 13, 1925, in Wichita, KS, and was a \npersonal friend to former Senator and now Presidential candidate Bob \nDole, of Kansas. Both of them being born in Kansas, we can see why. But \nhe moved with his family to Billings in 1929.\n  The life story of ``Big'' Jim Battin reads like the life story of \nthis great United States. There are stories like this one all over \nAmerica, but they are not told or given their proper space in American \nlore. When this Nation called during its great time of need and peril \nin World War II, he answered. He served in the U.S. Navy, earned two \nbattle stars at Saipan and Okinawa.\n  He also answered the call to serve the people of eastern Montana, and \nrepresented them and America in the House of Representatives from 1961 \nuntil President Nixon appointed him Federal district judge in 1970.\n  Everyone who knew him here as a Congressman had great respect for \nhim. He was known for his vision, his wisdom, and a quick wit. More \nimportant, he was known for his integrity: His word was his bond. All \nthese great characteristics he carried over in his work on the bench \nand the important decisions he made every day that affected peoples' \nlives.\n\n  To Jim Battin, all people had faces. I know of no one who ever met or \ndealt with Big Jim who had the feeling that he did not care, this tall \nCongressman from Montana, who had a heart as big as the sky and as big \nas the State he represented.\n  From a personal standpoint, I feel a great loss. He was one that I \nwent to when I was confronted with problems arising out of Washington. \nWho better to go to, than a man who was held in\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\nhigh esteem here? No matter how busy his schedule, he always took the \ntime, and we would visit. So, I have lost a great friend, adviser, and \nteacher.\n  There is one other thing, though, I will not miss--his great \nnegotiating ability on the first tee. He loved the game of golf, and he \nplayed it with great passion.\n  We do not say goodbye very often in our country; we just say, ``So \nlong.'' Even though our trails will part now, they will cross again \nsomeday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are two others of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle about whom I would like to speak briefly this \nmorning. The first, of course, is one who has been the subject of \ninnumerable tributes already, the wonderfully delightful and witty \nsenior Senator from Wyoming, Alan Simpson.\n  There is almost nothing I can say that can add to the tributes that \nhave already been made. Alan Simpson is unique. The single wittiest \nMember of the Senate, whose legion of stories is so great that you can \nhear one 3 years after you first heard it, without having listened to \nit in the interim, and it is as funny the second time as it was the \nfirst. I must confess there were a number that I tried to memorize so I \ncould tell them myself. To be in a place of informality with Alan and \nto listen to what he has to say is an extraordinary privilege.\n  But, of course, that does not make him a U.S. Senator. Commitment and \nhard work and dedication to principle are what make an outstanding \nMember of this or of any other legislative body. And the degree of \nthoughtfulness and attention that Senator Simpson has focused on a wide \nrange of issues, those representing his own quintessential rural \nWestern State, but even more significantly those that affect the future \nof the United States, its place in the world, its society and its \nculture, all have fallen within the ambit of Alan Simpson's interest.\n  Whether it has been the almost constant support of a strong and \nsuccessful foreign policy for the United States, whether it has been \nhis thoughtful examination of questions relating to the budget and the \ntax relief of the American people, his dedication to seeing to it that \nthis Congress and administration actually seriously begin the attempt \nof balancing the budget, whether it is on his latest crusade for more \nthoughtful, balanced and strong immigration policy or a myriad of other \nissues, Alan Simpson's views are sought out by his companions and given \ngreat weight by them.\n  Perhaps the finest symbol of the reach and scope of Alan Simpson's \ninterest and influence is his years of short radio debates with Senator \nKennedy, the leading Member of the other party. While I heard only a \nfew dozen of them, each one shows Senator Simpson's patented wit, as \nwell as his ability to get to the absolute heart of the particular \nissue.\n  Those are sets of qualities that are not likely soon to be duplicated \nhere in the U.S. Senate, and as a consequence, every Member will miss \nAlan Simpson as a U.S. Senator, and I believe I can say that every \nMember of the U.S. Senate will miss Alan Simpson as a friend whom they \nsee on each and every day.\n  Last in this series, but far from least, Mr. President, is my friend \nand neighbor, Mark Hatfield, the senior Senator from Oregon. We are \nbrought together, of course, by geography, by the fact that so many of \nthe regional challenges that affect one of our States affects the other \nas well. By the very real geographic fact that rivers join together \nrather than separate and the boundary between our two States, through \nmost of its length, is the Columbia River.\n  So, in any event, we would have been pushed together for the solution \nor for answers to these regional questions, but our association is far \ngreater than that. I can say, Mr. President, that when I arrived in \nthis body in 1981 and viewed my 99 colleagues, the single individual \nwho most closely fit the best possible academic or idealistic profile \nof a U.S. Senator was Mark Hatfield, in bearing, in demeanor, in dress, \nin voice, in mind and in ideas.\n  Mark Hatfield is an individual who, as much as any other I ever met, \nis able to combine a great loyalty toward a set of ideas and directions \nwhich make and preserve a political party, with an independence of \njudgment and an unwillingness to delegate his final decisionmaking \nauthority to anyone else. That is a very difficult balance, Mr. \nPresident, but Mark Hatfield, I am certain from the beginning of his \ncareer, certainly during the 14 years that we have been here together, \nhas perhaps best exemplified that wonderful balance: a chairman of an \nAppropriations Committee, tolerant, willing to listen to the views of \nothers within his own party and in the other party, a firm and fine \nnegotiator with whatever administration is in power, but at the same \ntime, someone who never has lost sight of his goal of a more \nthoughtful, more peaceful, more generous America.\n  Mark Hatfield's influence on this body will live for many years, \nperhaps for generations, after he has left. Others, beside myself, will \nlook back and say that Mark Hatfield was their ideal of what a U.S. \nSenator ought to be.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for much of her life and political \ncareer, Nancy Kassebaum has been in the company of political giants. \nThere was her father, Alf Landon, who had served as Governor of Kansas \nand was the Republican nominee for President in 1936. And there is that \nother Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, who happens to be this year's \nRepublican nominee for President.\n  Entering the U.S. Senate is intimidating enough--but to be following \na path forged by two such powerful figures must have been truly \noverwhelming.\n  Nancy Landon Kassebaum was more than equal to the challenge. She \nquickly emerged as a thoughtful, powerful, and highly respected force \nin this Chamber.\n  In fact, she was elected to the Senate by defeating her opponent by a \nlarger margin than had Senator Dole when he squared off against the \nsame person.\n  In office, she established herself as a moderate, centrist force in \nher party and in the Senate, which she is. But Senator Kassebaum's \nmoderation was never mistaken for lack of fortitude. No one can be more \ndetermined or more tenacious in pursuit of a cause or a principle.\n  Again, her service as chair of the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee has been characterized by fairness, tolerance, and \nmoderation. It has been characterized by her efforts to make America a \nbetter place to live and work, as witnessed by her recent cooperation \nwith Senator Kennedy in securing passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum \nlegislation to improve access to decent health care for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Indeed, Senator Kassebaum has worked to make life better for all \npeople in all lands. As chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee, she has worked to \nimprove the lives of the young and the impoverished on that continent.\n  There is an infectious optimism about her, as she has always found \nthe glass half-full, and she has that wonderful ability to make others \nfeel the same way. There is a basic decency about her as she always \nseeks the high road.\n  In announcing her retirement from the Senate, she did not disparage \npolitics or politicians. There were no cheap\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\njokes or cheap shots. Instead, she announced her retirement by \nencouraging young Americans to choose politics as a future endeavor.\n  ``Politics is the lifeblood of democracy,'' she explained. ``We have \nbecome a great nation because so many Americans before us chose to be \ninvolved in shaping our public life, focusing our national priorities, \nand forging consensus to move forward.''\n  Now, as Nancy Kassebaum moves forward to the next phase in her life--\nas she says, ``to pursue other challenges, including the challenge of \nbeing a grandmother''--I, and every Member of this Chamber, wish her \nthe best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12052-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAREWELL TO SENATOR BROWN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune to know \nSenator Hank Brown for some time.\n  Since being elected to the Senate in 1990, he has been a tenacious \nadvocate for the principles he holds, especially on matters of fiscal \nrestraint. His service on the Senate Judiciary, Veterans' Affairs, and \nBudget committees were all marked by his consistent support of \nconservative-Republican causes.\n  But, I point out, Mr. President, that while few people can be as \nvigorously partisan in pursuit of the causes in which they believe, \neven fewer people could be more respectful or more polite in their \nopposition.\n  Senator Brown is genuinely liked and admired by Members on this side \nof the aisle, many of whom he has worked with during his service on the \nSenate Budget, Judiciary, Foreign Relations, and Veterans' Affairs \ncommittees. This also includes those he worked with under difficult, \nstrenuous circumstances like the Clarence Thomas hearings and the BCCI \nscandal. Furthermore, he has worked with Democrats to help preserve our \nprecious, but limited environment, through efforts like getting the \nRocky Mountain Arsenal declared a national wildlife refuge. Working \nwith Hank Brown has been a pleasure.\n  Although he is leaving us after only one term, this worthy adversary, \nand the qualities he brought with him to the Senate, will be missed by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike.\n  In announcing his retirement, Senator Brown said that he was looking \n``forward to being full time in Colorado.'' I can understand and \nappreciate that. Colorado is a beautiful State filled with wonderful \npeople. I wish him the best.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the 104th Congress winds to a close, I \nwanted to take this opportunity to comment on the demise of the Food \nand Drug Administration reform legislation.\n  It has been extremely disappointing to me that efforts to prod the \nFDA into meaningful reform have not been fruitful. It is doubly \ndisappointing because, our colleague, Senator Kassebaum, and her staff \nhave spent countless hours crafting a solid reform bill, a bill that \nwon overwhelming, bipartisan support from the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee.\n  In remarks before this body earlier this year, I outlined my views on \nthe need for FDA reform and the principles which should be embodied in \nany reform legislation. I continue to believe that reform of this tiny, \nbut important, agency is sorely needed, reform that will both \nstreamline its operations and preserve its commitment to ensuring the \npublic health.\n  I know that many who have worked on the FDA issues are discouraged, \nbut we can be proud of three significant reforms to food and drug law \nthis year: the first being the drug and device export amendments I \nauthored with Representative Fred Upton; the Delaney clause reform \nembodied in the pesticide legislation the President recently signed; \nand the animal drug amendments so long championed by Senator Kassebaum. \nIt seems, therefore, that the revolutionary course we charted for FDA \nreform at the beginning of the 104th Congress, evolved into a path \nevolutionary in nature, but still productive nonetheless.\n  Much more remains to be done, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues next year to advance the work we started this year. There \nare many priorities for further action, among them--speeding up generic \ndrug approvals, clarifying how tissue should be regulated, expediting \nmedical device approvals, deficiencies in the foreign inspections \nprogram, and rigorous oversight of the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act's implementation.\n  Another issue that I would like to see addressed next year is one \nthat has been periodically on the FDA radar screen: the issue of \nnational uniformity in regulation of products that fall within the \nFDA's purview.\n  In 1987, FDA Commissioner Frank Young, in response to California's \nProposition 65, was on the verge of issuing an FDA regulation that \nwould have acted to preempt certain warning statements required by the \nState of California. In fact, in August of that year, Commissioner \nYoung wrote the Governor of California to underscore his concerns about \nthe potential negative effect of Proposition 65 on ``the interstate \nmarketing of foods, drugs, cosmetics and other products regulated by \nthe FDA.''\n\n  Further, Commissioner Young pointed out that ``the agency has \nadequate procedures for determining their safety and taking necessary \nregulatory action if problems arise.''\n  Although ultimately this regulation was not issued, the 1991 Advisory \nCommittee on the Food and Drug Administration, chaired by former FDA \nCommissioner and Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Charles Edwards, \nexamined this issue. The panel recommended that Congress enact \nlegislation, ``that preempts additional and conflicting State \nrequirements for all products subject to FDA regulation.''\n  The issue of Federal preemption is extremely important for several \nindustries, especially over-the-counter drugs, cosmetics, and foods. I \nwas heartened when the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved \nSenator Gregg's amendment on national uniformity for over-the-counter \ndrugs during consideration of the FDA reform legislation, S. 1477, but \nwas disappointed that Senator Gregg did not extend the concept further \nin his amendment.\n  Let us take the cosmetics industry as a case in point.\n  In the United States, the cosmetics sector of the economy represents \nan estimated $21 billion in annual sales, a significant amount by \nalmost any measure. It consists of over 10 billion individual packages \nthat move through the stream of interstate commerce annually. These \ninclude soap, shampoo, mouthwash, and other products that Americans use \ndaily. These hundreds and hundreds of product lines, and thousands and \nthousands of products are each subject to differing regulation in the \nvarious States--even though all must meet the rigorous safety, purity \nand labeling requirements of Federal law.\n  Given this volume of economic activity, it is imperative that \nmanufacturers be able to react quickly to trends in the marketplace; \nthey must have the ability to move into new product lines and move in \nto and out of new geographic areas with a minimum--but adequate--level \nof regulation to ensure the products are not adulterated and are made \naccording to good manufacturing practices.\n  Today, cosmetics manufacturers are competing more and more in a \nglobal economy, and are making products consistent with the \ninternational harmonization of standards in such large marketing areas \nas the European Union. A single nationwide system for regulating the \nsafety and labeling of cosmetic products would be a great step in \nhelping that industry move toward the international trends in \nmarketing. At the same time, it would be a more efficient system, since \nallowing individual States to impose varying labeling requirements \ninevitably leads to higher prices.\n  In other words, the time has more than come for enactment of a \nnational uniformity law for cosmetic regulation. It is my hope that \nthis issue will be high on our congressional agenda next year.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to offer my great respects to \nChairman Kassebaum for the hours, weeks and months of time she has \ndevoted to the\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\nFDA reform issue. Although I have paid tribute to Senator Kassebaum in \nseparate remarks here, I must reiterate again how much her reputation \nfor equilibrium and fairness have lent to development of an FDA reform \nproposal which cleared the committee in such a bipartisan fashion.\n  Finally, I must also pay tribute to the lead staffer on FDA issues, \nJane Williams, who has worked virtually round-the-clock to try to \nfashion a good, fair, bipartisan reform bill. Jane more than exceeded \nthat goal, and I think this body should give her some much-deserved \nrecognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12053-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12054-S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CODDLE A CONVICTED CRIMINAL CAMPAIGN, PART II\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, an administration's crime policies are a \nweb of many factors. They include, for example, the kind of judges a \nPresident will appoint. They include an administration's prosecutorial \npolicies and its outlook on the drug problem and how to combat it. And \nthey include the scope and nature of prisoners' rights an \nadministration asserts against State and local government prisons and \njails.\n  I have spoken several times about soft on crime Clinton \nadministration judges. President Clinton has been soft on drugs. After \nyears of declining use, the drug problem is on the rise--on President \nClinton's watch. And there is no way that he can avoid the criticism.\n  Today, I wish to speak again about the Clinton administration's \ncoddle a convict program. The President is responsible for protecting \nthe constitutional rights of convicted criminals and arrestees \nincarcerated in State and local prisons and jails. This is pursuant to \nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act [CRIPA].\n  I might add that I was the deciding vote on that act, and was the \nprime cosponsor, along with Senator Bayh, of that act many years ago.\n  Convicted criminals do have some constitutional rights and we \nprovided for them in that act; but, understandably, those rights are \nvery sharply circumscribed. And, to my mind, the Clinton administration \ntakes a very liberal view of these rights and reads the rights of the \naccused and of convicted criminals more favorably than the Constitution \nrequires or even permits.\n  On June 4, 1996, I drew the Senate's attention to some of the \nconstitutional violations the Clinton administration claimed the State \nof Maryland was committing at its Supermax facility. This facility \nholds the worst of the most vicious criminals in the Maryland State \nprison system--murderers, rapists, and other hardened criminals.\n  Now, is the Clinton administration citing the State of Maryland \nbecause it beats the convicts at Supermax? No. Is the Clinton \nadministration citing Maryland because it tortures or starves these \nvicious criminals? No.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration is citing the State of \nMaryland, in part, because ``food is served lukewarm or cold'' to these \nmurderers and rapists.\n\n  This is not all. The Clinton administration insists that Maryland \nprovide these killers and rapists ``one hour of out-of-cell time daily. \nAt least five times per week, this out of cell activity should occur \noutdoors, weather permitting.'' [Letter of Mr. Patrick, May 1, 1996, to \nGovernor Parris N. Glendening, page 12]. That is right Mr. President, \nthe hardened criminals who are the worst of the worst, who require \nspecial supervision, have a constitutional right to fresh air, to go \noutdoors. This does not represent law and order. This is the coddling \nof vicious criminals.\n  Mr. President, this coddling campaign does not end at Maryland's \nSupermax facility. While time does not permit a full airing of this \nlittle known Clinton administration campaign, let me share with my \ncolleagues just some of its more egregious outrages.\n  Bear in mind, Mr. President, that certain penal policies may be \ndesirable. But, the Constitution permits criminal prisoners to be \nafforded much less than the ideal. The Constitution certainly does not \nrequire States and localities to adopt model policies, as the Clinton \nadministration seems to be trying to cram down the throats of State and \nlocal governments.\n  The Clinton administration sent a June 1, 1995, letter to the Lee \nCounty jail in Georgia, a jail which had 27 inmates at the time. Here \nis one of the unconstitutional conditions the Clinton administration \nfound at this jail:\n  ``Inmates receive only two meals a day, and crackers and soda for \n`lunch.' They do not receive juice or milk * * *'' [June 1, 1995 letter \nfrom Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Deval L. Patrick to \nJohn L. Leach, III; page 3].\n  Mr. President, doesn't your heart just bleed? The inmates of this \ncounty jail do not get juice or milk. So, let us make a Federal case \nout of it, at least according to the Clinton administration. Let us \nthreaten to sue this Georgia county, let us use the vast power of the \nFederal Government to ensure that the 27 inmates at this county jail \nget their juice or milk.\n  I am confident of one thing, though: these crooks must get their \ncookies during the day. How do I know? Because if they didn't, the \nClinton administration would be claiming a violation of their \nconstitutional rights.\n\n  Moreover, Mr. President, according to the Clinton administration, \nthose arrested and detained for crimes have a constitutional right to \nwear underwear. You don't believe me, Mr. President? Am I satirizing \nthe Clinton administration policies?\n  Let me quote from the Clinton administration's April 16, 1996 letter \nto the Virginia Beach, VA city jail. Here is one of the ``conditions \n[which] violate the constitutional rights of prisoners housed at the \njail.'' Let me go into it again.\n  ``* * * [the jail] fails to provide underwear to newly arrested \npeople who are wearing `unacceptable' underwear at the time of their \narrest. Unacceptable underwear is defined by [the jail] as any \nunderwear other than all white underwear devoid of any ornamentation or \ndecoration * * *. As a practical matter, this practice results in \ninmates having no underwear for extended periods of time * * *.'' \n[April 16, 1996 letter from Mr. Patrick to Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf, \npages 2, 5.]\n  This is ridiculous. Can you imagine it, Mr. President? The Federal \nGovernment, led by the Clinton administration, is fighting for the \nalleged right of inmates to wear underwear, and in the name of the \nConstitution, no less. Some of these inmates include accused murderers \nand rapists. James Madison has got to be rolling over in his grave.\n  On October 18, 1993, the Clinton administration listed ``conditions \nat the [Grenada City, MS] jail [which] violate the constitutional \nrights of the prisoners confined therein.'' [October 18, 1993 letter \nfrom Acting Assistant General Attorney General James P. Turner to Mayor \nL.D. Boone, page 2]. The Clinton administration noted that its \ninspection ``revealed that inmates are not provided an exchange of \nclean linen, such as sheets, blankets, pillows, and pillow cases on a \nscheduled weekly basis.'' [page 4]. On July 21, 1994, the city signed a \nconsent decree at the Clinton administration's behest, which codifies \nin a court decree this requirement of weekly linen service.\n  Just weeks later, however, the Constitution changed according to the \nClinton administration: ``Prisoners should have a clean clothes and \nlinen exchange at least three times per week.'' [August 3, 1994 letter \nfrom Mr. Patrick to Sheriff Robert McCabe, Norfolk, VA city jail, page \n8.]\n  Mr. President, I am sure it is sound penal policy to provide clean \nclothes and linen exchange once or even three times a week. But the \nClinton administration has no business imposing its policy preferences \nas requirements on States and localities under the false guise of \nenforcing the Constitution. Inmates' clothing and linen have to become \nawfully wretched before a constitutional violation occurs. This is an \nextra-constitutional convenience, a Clinton administration coddle, and \nnot the enforcement of the Constitution.\n  The Clinton administration's coddling of criminals does not stop \nthere. The Clinton administration is compelling jails and prisons to \n``ensure that no inmate has to sleep on the floor.'' The Clinton \nadministration told the Tulsa County Jail that it must ``[p]rovide all \ninmates within twenty-four hours of their admission with a bunk and \nmattress well above the floor.'' [September 13, 1994 letter from Mr. \nPatrick to Lewis Harris, page 15.]\n  It is certainly preferable to give inmates a bunk to sleep in. But, \njail and\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\nprison space do not always match the number of criminals and detainees \nrequiring incarceration. The Constitution does not require a bunk for \nevery inmate. Sleeping on a mattress on a floor or on the floor itself \nmay not be convenient, but the Constitution does not require prisons \nand jails to afford comfortable lodging for every criminal.\n  But just listen to the bleeding heart of the Clinton administration, \ntime and again bringing the full weight of the Federal Government down \non the law enforcement systems of our localities and States. On October \n26, 1993, the Clinton administration advised the Lee County jail in \nMississippi that the jail ``is routinely overcrowded. [Its capacity] is \n54, but there were 80 inmates on the first day [of the Justice \nDepartment's tour]'' and occasionally the inmate population is \nabout double the jail's capacity. This means ``that some inmates have \nto sleep on bunks in the day rooms, on mattresses on the floor, and on \ntop of the day room tables * * *.'' That is unconstitutional, according \nto the Clinton administration. [October 26, 1993 letter from Mr. Turner \nto Billy Davis, pages 2, 3.] The Clinton administration demanded that \nthe jail ``house[] only an appropriate number of inmates and that none \nof the inmates sleep on the floor.'' [page 8].\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, take a look at how the Clinton administration \nhandled the Forrest County, MS, jail. The Clinton administration cited \nthe jail because it ``is consistently overcrowded. Although the \nfacility is designed to house 172 inmates * * * [it has] housed up to \n242 individuals on a single day. On the day of [the Justice \nDepartment's] tour * * * the jail housed 203 inmates. Inmates have \nslept on mattresses on the floor for the past year.'' [July 6, 1993 \nletter from Mr. Turner to Lynn Cartlidge, Attachment, page 4].\n  The Clinton administration, with the full leverage of its resources, \nprevailed upon the county to enter into a consent decree nearly 2 years \nlater. The consent decree provides that, ``[t]he jail's population \nshall not exceed the rated capacity of 172 unless temporary conditions \nexist beyond the control of [the County].'' Even then, the county must \ndo all it can within its control to get the inmate population down to \n172 [Consent decree, paragraphs 67-69].\n  Mr. President, the inmates at Forrest County jail, or any other jail \nor prison, do not have a constitutional right to be routinely housed at \na jail with no overcrowding whatsoever. But the inmates' allies in the \nClinton administration have created that right for them.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration has also discovered a \nconstitutional right to fresh air for the inmates. According to the \nClinton administration, the Lee County, MS, jail's ``installation of \nindividual domestic-type air conditioners did not provide minimum \nventilation for the purposes of fresh air supply, air exchange and \noverall cooling, as indicated by the 91 degrees Fahrenheit temperature \nand the 75 percent relative humidity in the cell housing areas. * * '' \n[page 5]. Does that sound like cruel and unusual punishment to you, Mr. \nPresident?\n\n  I know of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Americans who live no \nbetter than that. But our prisonors have to be coddled. We have to take \ngood care of them and make sure they all have air conditioning.\n  The Clinton administration has relentlessly fought for the rights of \ninmates to outdoor exercise and to exercise equipment. It complained to \nthe Onondaga County jail of Syracuse, NY, that, `` `outdoor recreation \nfacilities' consist of only 1 operative basketball hoop and \nunderinflated basketballs [and no other type of equipment.]'' My \ngoodness, here is the Clinton administration's demand on that county \njail: ``Existing outside recreation space must be equipped with \nsufficient sporting/recreation equipment to afford prisoners the \nopportunity to participate in large muscular activity. [The Jail] must \nassure that both indoor and outdoor recreation programs exist for \nprisoners.'' [October 18, 1994 letter from Mr. Patrick to Mr. Nicholas \nJ. Perio, page 14.]\n  I am sure the citizens of New York State and the rest of our States \ncan sleep easier knowing the Nation's jail inmates have this \nconstitutional right to participate in large muscular activity with \nsufficient sporting and recreation equipment. I am sure we all rest \neasier knowing that these inmates have a right to indoor and outdoor \nrecreation programs.\n  Mr. President, while the Constitution may require a minimum \nopportunity for inmates to exercise, there is no constitutional right \nto exercise out of doors. And there certainly is no constitutional \nright to exercise equipment and indoor and outdoor recreation programs.\n  Some of these programs may make sense as a matter of policy. I have \nno particular objection, for example, to outside exercise, which \ninmates can obtain without exercise equipment. But the Clinton \nadministration has no business imposing these programs on States and \nlocalities in the name of the Constitution. The Clinton administration \nis seeking to constitutionalize its notion of enlightened prison policy \nand cram it down the throats of our State and local prisons and jails.\n  The Clinton administration cited the Calhoun County, GA, jail for \nallowing prisoners only 2 hours a week of out of cell exercise, staff \navailability permitting, and providing no exercise equipment. The \nClinton administration demanded that, ``Inmates * * * be provided with \nexercise outdoors when weather permits, one hour per day, five days per \nweek. Reasonable exercise equipment should be provided.'' [June 1, 1995 \nletter from Mr. Patrick to Mr. Calvin Schramm, pages 3, 5].\n\n  On the same day, the Clinton administration read the Constitution \neven more expansively when it cited the Lee County jail for exercise \nviolations--the same jail that allegedly violated the Constitution by \nnot providing juice or milk to the inmates. The Lee County jail must \nprovide not 5 days of outdoor exercise, but 7 days a week of outdoor \nexercise. [page 6].\n  Let me touch on another Clinton administration coddle. According to \nthe Clinton administration's reading of the Constitution, ``loss of \nmeals must never be used as a punitive measure.'' [April 23, 1996 \nletter from Mr. Patrick to Mr. John Moore, Coffee County, Commission, \nGA, page 3.] From time immemorial, parents have sent children to bed \nwithout supper as punishment. But, just let a prison or jail try it on \na convicted criminal, and they will wind up with the Federal Government \non their backs, courtesy of the Clinton administration.\n  Moreover, the Clinton administration objected to a jail's inmate \nhandbook which ``instructs inmates to eat `quickly'. This is contrary \nto generally accepted correctional practice,'' claims the Clinton \nadministration [page ]. But the Clinton administration has no authority \nto impose generally accepted correctional practices on State and local \ngovernments. It can only remove unconstitutional conditions at state \nand local prisons and jails. The Clinton administration is seeking, \nonce again, to constitutionalize what it considers to be sound \ncorrectional policy.\n  Now, let me read, in its entirety, one of the ``unconstitutional \nconditions'' found at the Dooly County, GA, jail. This jail has a \ncapacity of 36 inmates:\n  ``Food sanitation is poor. The Jail does not have a kitchen. Food is \nobtained from a nearby, private establishment. The lunch meal on the \nday of our tour, tuna fish, was served at approximately 65 degrees \nFahrenheit. This is much warmer than food safety standards permit.'' \n[June 1, 1995 letter of Mr. Patrick to Mr. Wayne West, page 5.]\n\n  That is it. The serving of that warm tuna fish violated the \nConstitution.\n  On the same day, the Clinton administration found the following \n``conditions at the Mitchell County, GA, jail violate the \nConstitutional rights of prisoners:\n  ``* * * The food is transported by car in styrofoam or polystyrene \ncontainers not designed to maintain proper food temperatures. During \nour tour, the hot food for the evening meal, which should be served at \na minimum of 140 degrees fahrenheit, was served at 115 degrees \nfahrenheit.'' The Constitution allegedly requires such proper \ninsulation and temperatures for inmates' food. [June 1, 1995 letter \nfrom Mr. Patrick to Benjamin Hayward, page 6, 9.]\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on, about the areas just mentioned, \nas well as additional areas where the Clinton administration seeks to \ncoddle criminals by demanding extra-constitutional privileges for them.\n\n[[Page S12056]]\n\n  Scarce Federal law enforcement resources would be better utilized by \nfocusing on putting more criminals behind bars rather than worrying \nabout whether their tuna fish is too warm once they get there; whether \ntheir hot food is lukewarm, or heaven forbid, cold; whether they get \njuice or milk with their meals; whether they have to sleep on a \nmattress on the floor rather than a bunk a certain number of inches off \nthe floor; whether they get outdoor exercise, exercise equipment, and \nrecreation programs; and whether they get to wear underwear.\n  And the Clinton administration should stop diverting scarce State and \nlocal resources toward defending against, or bowing to, these bleeding-\nheart concerns.\n  Mr. President, I was the author, along with Birch Bayh, of the Civil \nRights for Institutionalized Persons Act. I was the deciding vote on \nthat vote. I believe it was in 1978 or 1979. It could have been 1980. \nIt was an important bill. I believe in it. I do not think criminals \nshould have their constitutional rights violated any more than anybody \nelse.\n  But these assertions of the Clinton administration and these demands \nand these consent decrees and these costs to the taxpayers in those \nState and local areas are absurd. Frankly, we have to get them out of \nthe pockets and lives of our State and local governments. When they \nfind true constitutional issues, true constitutional wrongs, they ought \nto right them. But these are not constitutional issues or wrongs that \nneed to be righted, and we have to give the State and local governments \nsome flexibility. We also have to understand that these murderers and \nrapists and others have committed these crimes and they should not be \ncoddled in the jails of this country.\n  Mr. President, I think we ought to quit making a distortion out of \nthe Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act and do what is \nright. But this is typical of this administration, and I had to make \nthese comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12054-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate, as quickly as \npossible, to address and pass the current piece of legislation relating \nto the airports. I do so for a very special reason.\n  Three airports primarily serve the bulk of the requirements of the \nCongress and the Federal Government, and the Greater Metropolitan \nWashington area: National Airport, Dulles Airport, and Baltimore \nInternational.\n  Some almost now, I think, a decade ago, I, together with others in \nthis Chamber, fashioned the statute by which Dulles and National became \nindependent, subject only to the Washington Metropolitan Airports \nAuthority jurisdiction. In that legislation and in subsequent pieces of \nlegislation, it was the wisdom of Congress that we need to constitute a \nspecial board to have some oversight responsibilities. It was highly \ncontroversial. The thought was that this board could bring to the \nattention of the metropolitan authority and others the particular needs \nof the users.\n  As it turned out, the Federal courts said that was unconstitutional, \nand we finally, now, had a Supreme Court decision which knocked down \nthe functions of that legal entity. This bill puts into place the \nlegislative corrections to implement the decisions of the Supreme Court \nand other Federal courts that have addressed this issue.\n  It is essential that legislation be passed for the very simple reason \nthat as the Members of the U.S. Senate hopefully will begin their \njourneys home later this week, they will go through the airport and see \nboth airports partially remodeled. Unless this legislation is in place, \nthat remodeling, by necessity, will have to stop. The funds will run \nout.\n  I have just talked to the general counsel of the Washington \nMetropolitan Airports Authority. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record certain documentation he will be providing the \nSenate today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority,\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 1, 1996.\n     Hon. John Warner, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Warner: We write to advise you of the critical \n     importance to the Airports Authority of the enactment of the \n     Conference Report on H.R. 3539, the Federal Aviation \n     Reauthorization Act of 1996.\n       In addition to critical measures providing for improved \n     security at all airports, and authorizing expenditures for \n     the continuation of the airport improvement program grants \n     and funding for the FAA, the Conference report contains \n     vitally important provisions to restore the powers of the \n     Airports Authority.\n       Since an April 1995 court order, the Airports Authority has \n     been without basic powers to award contracts, adopt a budget, \n     change regulations, or issue more revenue bonds. This is a \n     serious matter for any public agency; for us, it goes to the \n     heart of our business.\n       As you know, the Airports Authority is engaged in a $2 \n     billion program to reconstruct Washington National and expand \n     Washington Dulles International. We are now at the stage \n     where we must raise more funds through the sale of revenue \n     bonds in order to keep the construction work on track.\n       Enactment of the Conference Report now is essential to our \n     ability to issue bonds next spring, and our overall ability \n     to provide first-class air service to the public.\n       We therefore strongly urge that the Senate take action on \n     the Conference Report before it adjourns.\n       Thank you for your steady support on this matter over the \n     past two years. We look forward to working with you in the \n     future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert F. Tardio,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he said ever so clearly that a bond, which \nwill have to be issued next year to fund the ongoing modernization at \nboth airports, that bond cannot be issued without this legislation in \nplace, and preparations must commence now to go into the financial \nmarkets early in 1997 to get that next increment of funding required \nfor this modernization.\n  That is not an issue that is at contest, but it is an issue that can \nliterally put into semiparalysis the operation of these two airports; \nindeed, not only the inconvenience of a shutdown of remodeling, but \nthere are some safety ramifications in air travel incorporated in \nhaving an ongoing orderly process of modernization and having it \ncompleted on schedule.\n  So, I fervently urge my colleagues to address this legislation as \nearly as possible and to put in place the corrections that are found in \nthis bill that will enable the Washington Metropolitan Airport \nAuthority to continue an orderly modernization process.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to finish a series of speeches \nabout Africa and why Africa matters to the United States. I am sure \nmany of us, over the recent years, have looked at the Continent of \nAfrica with some despair, seeing one crisis after another occur; and \nseemingly, as one is resolved, there is only another nation that has a \nterrible tragedy occur, a coup and civil war ensues.\n  I have spoken in a series of speeches about, one, our vulnerability \nin the United States to infectious diseases coming out of Africa, and \naddressed the many ways in which environmental crises in Africa can \ntouch Americans right here at home. I have also addressed how \ninternational crime, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking in Africa \naffect our own sense of security here at home.\n  I believe that Africa does matter. But I believe there is also a \ngreat deal of hope for the countries of Africa. I believe there are \nmany positive things that we should consider, and should not forget. \nToday, I want to conclude with a topic that I believe many people have \noverlooked in relation to Africa: trade and investment.\n  At the start of this Congress, I began the work of the Subcommittee \non African Affairs in the Foreign Relations Committee by chairing a \nhearing on trade and investment in Africa. I think it is appropriate to \nconclude the work of this Congress on Africa issues by returning to \nthis underemphasized area.\n  The focus of our hearing 2 years ago was not only to examine the \npotential role of private sector development in Africa, but also to \nbring to life the benefits to the United States of increased trans-\nAtlantic commercial ties.\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\n  Over the past few years, investment and trade flows between the \nUnited States and Africa have increased substantially. Many companies, \nparticularly communications, infrastructure and engineering firms, see \nAfrica as a major growth market. In a time of reduced foreign aid, a \nfocus on trade and investment must be a fundamental component of our \noverall foreign policy toward the continent.\n  How many people know that there is more trade between the United \nStates and the countries of Africa than between the United States and \nthe states of the former Soviet Union? One of the best-kept secrets, I \nthink, about U.S. relations with Africa is the tremendous amount of \ntrade and potential trade also that occurs between our country and the \nAfrican Continent.\n  In 1993, U.S. exports of goods and services to sub-Sahara Africa \ntotaled nearly $4.8 billion. This is 20 percent greater than exports to \nthe Commonwealth of Independent States of the former Soviet Union. By \nsome estimates, every extra $1 billion in American exports to Africa \nadds some 19,000 new jobs in the United States. Exports to southern \nAfrica alone are responsible for an estimated 60,000 jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Over the past 50 years, the African Continent has undergone \ntremendous change, as African nations have wrestled with \ndecolonization, independence and, for some, democratization. Africa has \nmany success stories to tell, and the continent's tales of overcome \nhardships are admirable, indeed. But these stories of progress rarely \nmake headlines. More often, the news tells of the political problems \nthat remain, of political and economic instability, waste, corruption, \nunsound economic policies. These problems are serious and, in many \nAfrican countries, they have stifled investment and choked off growth \nand trade. But the truth is that a remarkable transformation is \nunderway in Africa.\n  Nearly two-thirds of African countries are now at some stage of \ndemocratic transition, compared with only four in 1989. More than 30 \nelections have taken place in Africa over the past 6 years. Many \nAfrican nations have taken difficult and courageous steps to keep \nbudget deficits down, maintain realistic exchange rates and increase \ncompetition through domestic deregulation, trade reform and \nprivatization of public enterprises, not easy tasks in very weak and \nstruggling economies and countries that are trying to open a stable and \nfree political society as well.\n  The aim of these reforms has been to create an environment in which \nthe private sector can act as the engine for development. We are \nbeginning to see these efforts pay off. In a time of declining foreign \naid, it is more than practical to emphasize the potential role of the \nprivate sector in the economic development of Africa. It just makes \nsense.\n  Africans themselves want trade, not aid. They recognize that it is \nforeign trade and investment, not foreign aid, that provides the basis \nfor sustained development, economic growth and new jobs, and trade with \nAfrica does not benefit only Africans. As I pointed out, it helps us as \nwell. New markets for American exports mean new jobs here at home.\n\n  In the coming years, we should try to direct more of our foreign \nassistance toward building the foundations for long-term economic \ndevelopment in Africa. We should work in partnership with international \nfinancial institutions, of other donors and, of course, the African \nleaders to help meet the continent's critical infrastructure needs. I \nhave always believed if the continent of Africa had a transportation \nsystem across the continent, whether railroads or roads, it would help \nimmensely the trade between African nations themselves. Without an \nadequate network of roads, airports and telecommunications to knit the \ncountries of Africa together, economic growth in Africa will face \ninherent structural limits.\n  There are, of course, purposes for foreign assistance other than \npromoting economic growth. American assistance plays an important part \nin addressing pressing social and humanitarian needs in many African \ncountries. But the reality is that present levels of aid in Africa \ncannot and will not continue indefinitely.\n  Increased U.S. trade and investment in Africa making the countries of \nAfrica full partners in the world's unprecedented economic prosperity \nprovides the only real basis for future African economic self-\nsufficiency. The many changes underway in Africa, though encouraging, \nare not enough. Countries that have begun economic reforms must do \nmore, and countries that have not, must do so.\n  Sub-Sahara Africa currently attracts less than 3 percent of the total \nforeign direct investment flowing to developing countries and economies \nin transition. Our policies toward Africa should encourage the \nnecessary political and economic changes to provide a stable \nenvironment for sustained domestic economic development and foreign \ndirect investment.\n  Our voice carries far in Africa, and we can make a difference in \nending conflicts, promoting open and accountable governments and \nfostering economic reform. For example, we should encourage the \nliberalization of land tenure laws that prohibit women from owning \nland. Women are the primary agricultural laborers in Africa, but they \ncannot attain the degree of financial control within the sector \nnecessary to spur growth. The World Bank estimates that the value of \nwomen's agricultural output would increase by 22 percent if they had \nthe same access as men to major factors of production.\n  Another example of where we can make a difference is in lowering \ntrade barriers. We should support the removal of barriers to trade \namong African countries and support efforts aimed at regional economic \nintegration. At the same time, the United States must also lower its \nown trade barriers that unfairly discriminate against African goods. \nThis means allowing imports, such as textiles, coffee, and sugar, into \nthe United States in a fair and equitable manner. The laws of economics \napply in Africa as they do elsewhere, and we should do all that we can \nto ensure that the established rules of free trade do as well.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, I am optimistic about the economic \npotential of Africa. During my almost two decades of work on African \nissues in the Senate, I have observed firsthand the tremendous and \ncommendable efforts made by the peoples of the many nations of the \nAfrican Continent.\n\n  At the same time, I also am sober about Africa's future and realize \nthat without continued American engagement, Africa will not be joining \nthe rest of us as we enter the next millennium.\n  Leaving Africa behind would raise important threats to our people and \nour national interests. Emerging and proliferating infectious diseases \ndo not respect international borders, nor do environmental crises on a \nlarge scale.\n  Let me say, even more important to leaving Africa behind would be to \nlose a tremendous opportunity for all of us to benefit from the \ncontinent's rich heritage and potential. As we approach the beginning \nof the new millennium, America's future will be brighter if Africa's is \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12056-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12057-S12058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN LIBERIA\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about \nrecent events in Liberia.\n  The 6-year civil war has killed over 150,000 Liberians and displaced \n1.2 million people. The country's infrastructure has been laid waste, \nand its economy is in ruins. Time and again, Liberians have reached \ntentative peace agreements, only to watch them fall apart.\n  Last fall, many of us held high hopes for the peace accord reached in \nAbuja, Nigeria. For once, the faction leaders appeared to set aside \ntheir personal agendas for a process of disarmament and elections. Our \nhopes were shattered again this past spring as the Liberian civil war \nerupted yet again.\n  After months of renewed fighting, another peace agreement was reached \nlast month among the warring Liberian factions. It is my fervent hope \nthat the current cease-fire and plan for national elections next spring \nwill succeed and lead at long last to sustained peace for Liberia.\n  Like its predecessors, this peace is fragile. Restoring and \nprotecting a secure environment for Liberians is the first requirement \nfor lasting peace.\n  I commend the efforts of the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, \nfor\n\n[[Page S12058]]\n\nits vital role in bringing peace to this war-torn land. It is in \nAmerica's interest that ECOMOG succeed and that we broaden the number \nof African states participating in the regional effort. In April, \nPresident Clinton committed $30 million in aid to the ECOMOG forces, \nand I am pleased that the full amount has been authorized to be \ntransmitted. I urge that the funds be disbursed as quickly as possible \nto provide assistance in the vital areas of need identified by ECOMOG, \nsuch as communications and transportation.\n  Long-term security will require more than a regional peace force--it \nwill require a reestablishment of order in Liberian society itself. \nShort-term relief requires local order as well. Although the UNDP is \ncurrently rehabilitating the airport in Monrovia, and the World Food \nProgram is meeting urgent humanitarian needs in areas severely affected \nby the fighting, most NGO's and private volunteer organizations are \nstill reluctant to return until the security and political situation in \nLiberia is stabilized. The reestablishment of law and order in Liberia \nis a critical requirement for these organizations to function and meet \npressing economic and humanitarian needs. Sooner or later, we will need \nto support efforts to reconstitute Liberian security and judicial \ninstitutions.\n  The second requirement for a lasting peace is the existence of basic \neconomic opportunity. If peace is to endure, America's role cannot end \nwith a cease-fire and an election. Faction fighters will not \npermanently lay down their arms unless they have something else to do \nand other means of sustenance.\n  In this area, Liberia's tragedy may provide its own opportunity. For \nexample, Liberia desperately needs the reconstitution of its roads, \nbridges, airport, and water and electrical power systems. These are \nvital areas in which former belligerents can be employed, exchanging \nswords for plowshares, and contributing to the rebuilding of their \ncountry. Schools also must be reconstituted so the youngest fighters of \nages 9 and 10 can replace their guns with books and return from the \nbattlefields to the classrooms.\n  Mr. President, there are compelling reasons for America to remain \nengaged in Liberia. We share a special history. We also have an \ninterest in eliminating the type of instability that can be a haven for \nthreats that cut across national boundaries--environmental degradation, \ninfectious diseases, and international crime, terrorism, and drug \ntrafficking.\n  Elections alone cannot save Liberia. I trust the administration's \ndiplomacy, with the oversight of Congress, will continue to take that \nfact into account as we try to make peace work in Liberia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon \nto update my colleagues and those who are following this issue, to \nupdate you all on our efforts to pass an omnibus parks bill for this \nNation. My report has both disappointment and hope. I want to explain \nwhy.\n  We have been working nonstop to try to get an agreement from every \nsingle Member of this U.S. Senate to accept the House-passed omnibus \nparks bill called the Presidio parks bill, so that we can quickly act \nand send this bill to the President's desk.\n  It is important to note that the omnibus parks bill in the House, \nPresidio bill, passed with only four dissenting votes. So there was \nnear unanimity over on the House side for this bill, which is very far-\nreaching, very important for American people, very bipartisan and has \nbeen agreed to by the administration.\n  So here we have an extraordinary opportunity, Mr. President, to end \nthis session on a high note, to pass the bill that passed in the House \nin a bipartisan way, to pass a bill here that has bipartisan support, \nsend it to the President, and all of us can go home feeling very good \nthat we did something for this country's environment and that we did it \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  So why is my report filled with some disappointment? First of all, I \nwas very disappointed that the majority leader, who is working hard to \nbuild a consensus for this bill--there is no question Senator Daschle \nand Senator Lott are working hard to build a consensus for this bill--\nbut the majority leader, Senator Lott, has the ability to bring this \nbill up before this body right now. He could have done it yesterday. \nHad he made that decision to bring this bill to the floor, we could \nhave started the process, just as we have on the FAA bill, to vote on \nthis bill.\n  The rules of the Senate can sometimes be confusing. I have had many \npeople call and say, ``Well, don't you have 60 votes in favor of the \nparks bill?'' I said, probably more like 85 votes, maybe 90 votes, but \nwe cannot get a cloture motion filed until the majority leader decides \nto call the bill up. He has not done so to date.\n  He says he prefers to have every single Senator agree. Of course, Mr. \nPresident, that would be a wonderful thing if every single Senator \nwould agree with this bill. Then we could get it done without a \nrecorded vote, without the necessity of filing cloture. But surely it \nseems to me we would have a better way to make this bill the law of the \nland if that bill was to be pending and a cloture motion pending. I \nthink that would bring people to the table in a faster manner, and if \nwe were not able to achieve unanimity, we could then go to the cloture \nroute.\n  So I am very disappointed that to date the majority leader has not \nchosen to bring the parks bill before the U.S. Senate. I urge him to do \nthat right now. We are going to be here. We should be here doing our \nwork. We all want to resolve the FAA dispute, and we will. We surely \nought to want to work on this parks bill. I hope that the majority \nleader will bring that bill before us.\n  Every single Democrat has told me that he or she is very much for \nthis bill. The vast majority of Republicans have said the same. So all \nwe need to do is have the bill brought before us, and if someone did \nfilibuster it, we could bring the debate to a close with 60 votes and \nget on with it, and, as I say, I believe the vote would be \noverwhelmingly in favor of this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to explain why this bill is so important.\n  No. 1, it includes parks for 41 States. Forty-one States in the \nNation will benefit from this parks bill, which has required 2 years of \neffort, Mr. President, to put together, 2 years of effort to put \ntogether this Presidio omnibus parks bill. We could see this chance \nevaporate. I hope we do not. I hope everyone will agree. I surely will \nbe on my feet until the waning hours of this session, if need be, \nproposing that we pass this House bill unanimously.\n  What States are covered? Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, \nKansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nOhio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, \nand Wyoming.\n  As you go into the bill and you read the various titles, you see, Mr. \nPresident, that in many States there is more than one important parks \nproject.\n  Mr. President, every one of these States is counting on us. I am \nvery, very hopeful--very hopeful--that we can resolve our differences. \nI for one have been doing whatever I could do to talk to individual \nSenators.\n  There are some Senators who have disappointments that they did not \nget everything they wanted in this bill. I understand that. You know, \nthe Presidio, for example, which is so important to us; we had to \ncompromise on\n\n[[Page S12059]]\n\nthat legislation, Congresswoman Pelosi and I and Senator Feinstein and \nCongressman Miller. I want to thank all of them for everything they are \ncontinuing to do as we speak to make this work. I had a conversation \nwith Congressman Miller. I have been talking to Senator Murkowski and \nhis staff. We are trying to make this happen.\n  In Alabama we have the Selma to Montgomery Historic Trail \ndesignation.\n  In Alaska there are many, many important provisions, ranging from \nAlaska Peninsula land exchange to Federal borough recognition, \nregulation of Alaska fishing, and University of Alaska.\n  In my State of California, Senator Feinstein and I are so strongly in \nfavor of this bill, not only because of what it will do for the rest of \nthe country, but surely for our State. It includes setting up a trust, \na nonprofit trust at the Presidio to make sure that, as this \nmagnificent park takes shape from a historic military base that started \nso many years ago before California was a State--we need this trust to \nmake the important decisions about the reuse of the various buildings \nand doing it in the right way and doing it in the environmentally sound \nway.\n  We have in that bill San Francisco Bay enhancement, Butte County \nconveyance, Modoc Forest boundary adjustment, Cleveland National \nForest, Lagomarsino Visitor Center, Merced irrigation district land \nexchange, the Manzanar historic site exchange.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is here. The Manzanar Historic Site, we \nknow this is where, during a very dark period of our country, Japanese \nAmericans were held literally as prisoners in their own country. \nManzanar is a historic site. In this bill it will be preserved. Very \nimportant.\n\n  The AIDS memorial grove, timber sale exchange, Santa Cruz Poland \nacquisition, Stanislaus Forest management, Del Norte School conveyance.\n  It goes on in Colorado, in Florida, in Georgia, in Hawaii.\n  I just want to mention one other very important--very important--\nissue. I see my friend from Alaska has come to the floor. How many \ntimes he has been to San Francisco to pledge to work to make this \nhappen.\n  I know that the Sterling Forest in New Jersey is so very important to \nboth Senators from New Jersey and to the entire bipartisan \ncongressional delegation over in the House. We have Senator Bradley \nleaving after a distinguished career. I know he is working with Senator \nMurkowski to try to resolve all of our problems that we have. Sterling \nForest is the largest unbroken, undeveloped track of forest land still \nremaining along the New York-New Jersey border. The bill will allow an \nappropriation of up to $17.5 million for land acquisition. It \ndesignates the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, a Federal \ncommission to manage this land. It goes on.\n\n  Most importantly for New Jersey are the billions of gallons of fresh \nclean drinking water that flow from the boundaries here.\n  When you look at the development that is possible for Sterling \nForest, 14,000 homes, 8 million square feet of commercial space, even \nif the development were concentrated in the least environmentally \ncritical and successful tracks, the construction will, according to \nRepublicans and Democrats who support this acquisition, will \nirrevocably alter this land.\n  As I said when I took to the floor, I am mixed with disappointment \nand optimism. Clearly, I reiterate, not every single thing is in here \nthat Senators feel ought to be in here. I so well understand it. I am \nworking to see if there are ways to get those things done. I am looking \nforward to the remarks of my colleague from Nebraska who may be here on \nthis topic. I hope that we are moving closer.\n  I can assure the Senator that if we can get this done, I will work \nwith him do everything I can in the next Congress to move forward to \naddress some of the concerns that he has raised. I have tried to do \nthat, talking with the administration, as late as very late last night.\n  I hope when I come back to the floor I can speak more with hope and \nspeak with more belief that we will, in fact, get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12058-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GRATITUDE TO SENATE STAFF\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, I rise this morning for the purpose of \nspeaking on legislation I introduced yesterday. This legislation is \nvery important to my State of Alaska. The intention of the legislation \nis to try and address some of the issues regarding subsistence hunting \nand fishing in Alaska. I am under no false hope that at this late date \nthis legislation will move through the Senate this year, but I want it \nto appear in the Record for the purposes of starting a dialog in our \nState and starting a dialog with the various Federal agencies involved.\n  Mr. President, the issue of subsistence hunting and fishing in Alaska \nhas caused a great deal of divisiveness in our State and has led to the \nState of Alaska becoming the only State in the Union which no longer \nretains the sole control of its fish and game resources on public \nlands. This is an extraordinary departure from the norm, but \nnevertheless it is a reality. The influence of the Federal Government \nover fish and wildlife resources in Alaska continues to grow and expand \nwith each passing month.\n  This legislation calls for the Presidential appointment of a special \nmaster to come up with nonbinding recommendations to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, the Governor of the State \nof Alaska, the State of Alaska legislature and to the Congress, as \nwell. The recommendation will be on how to return management of fish \nand game resources to the State and how best to provide for the \ncontinuation of a subsistence lifestyle for Alaska's residence.\n  I hope to have significant discussions with the people of Alaska on \nthis issue in the coming months during the recess and be prepared to \nmove forward with the 105th Congress when we return in January. It \nwould be my intention to introduce more definitive legislation on the \nsubsistence issue at that time.\n  What we are attempting to do is set, if you will, a skeleton schedule \nin place so we can build on it by generating public input.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, S. \n2172, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12060]]\n\n                                S. 2172\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) The State of Alaska received management authority and \n     responsibility for fish and game resources in the State at \n     the time of statehood.\n       (b) The Alaska Constitution requires equal access for all \n     the citizens of the state to these fish and game resources.\n       (c) The State of Alaska developed statutes to implement a \n     rural subsistence priority.\n       (d) In 1980 Congress passed the Alaska National Interest \n     Lands Conservation Act providing that the ``taking on public \n     lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses \n     shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of \n     fish and wildlife for other purposes.''\n       (e) In 1989 the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in McDowell v. \n     Alaska that the rural preference contained in the State's \n     subsistence statute violated the equal provision of the \n     Alaska Constitution putting the State's subsistence program \n     out of compliance with Title VIII of ANILCA resulting in the \n     Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior assuming \n     subsistence management on the public lands in Alaska.\n       (f) The Governor and the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska are \n     to be complimented on their several attempts to resolve the \n     issue and return management responsibilities of fish and game \n     back to the state; however, these efforts have not been \n     successful.\n       (g) There continues to remain an impasse that is creating a \n     divisive atmosphere in Alaska among sport hunters, sport \n     fishermen, commercial fishermen, Alaska natives, as well as \n     urban and rural residents.\n       (h) The Congress hereby declares that it is timely and \n     essential to conduct a review of Federal and State policies \n     and programs affecting subsistence in order to identify \n     specific actions that may be taken by the United States and \n     the State of Alaska to help assure that a fair subsistence \n     priority is provided to the citizens of Alaska and that \n     management authority over fish and game resources is \n     maintained by the State of Alaska.\n\n     SEC. 2. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTER.\n\n       (a)(1) The President shall hereby appoint a Special Master \n     to mediate the issues involved in this impasse, and\n       (2) In making the appointment of the Special Master, the \n     President shall give careful consideration to recommendations \n     submitted by the Governor of the State of Alaska and the \n     president of the Alaska State Senate, and the Speaker of the \n     Alaska State House.\n       (b)(1) The principal office of the Special Master shall be \n     in the State of Alaska.\n       (2) The Special Master shall--\n       (A) review existing state and federal laws regarding \n     subsistence use in Alaska, and\n       (B) after consultation with all interested parties, \n     including, but not limited to, Alaska natives, sport and \n     commercial fishing interests, sport hunting groups recreation \n     groups, the Governor of Alaska, the Alaska legislature, The \n     Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, and the members \n     of the Alaska Congressional delegation, recommend specific \n     actions to the Congress and to the State of Alaska including \n     state statutory amendments, changes in existing management \n     structures, constitutional amendments, and changes to Title \n     VIII of the ANILCA, that--\n       (i) assure the State of Alaska recovers and retains \n     management authority and responsibility for fish and game on \n     all lands in Alaska, and\n       (ii) provide for the continuation of the opportunity for \n     subsistence uses by residents of Alaska, including both \n     Natives and non-natives, on the public lands and by Alaska \n     Natives on Native lands which is essential for Native \n     physical, economic, traditional, and cultural existence and \n     to non-native physical, economic, traditional, and social \n     existence,\n       (c) submit, by no later than the date that is six months \n     after appointment, a report on the recommendations developed \n     under paragraph (2), to the Secretary, the Congress, the \n     Governor of the State of Alaska, and the legislature of the \n     State of Alaska, and make such report available to the \n     public.\n       (d) The Special Master shall have the power to--\n       (1) procure, as authorized by section 3109 of title 5, \n     United States Code, temporary and intermittent services to \n     the same extent as is authorized by law for agencies in the \n     executive branch, but at rates not to exceed the daily \n     equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay in effect \n     for grade GS-18 of such General Schedule.\n       (e) service as a Special Master shall not be considered as \n     service or employment bringing such individual within the \n     provisions of any Federal law relating to conflicts of \n     interest or otherwise imposing restrictions, requirements, or \n     penalties in relation to the employment of persons, the \n     performance of services, or the payment or receipt of \n     compensation in connection with claims, proceedings, or \n     matters involving the United States. Service as a Special \n     Master, shall not be considered service in an appointive or \n     elective position in the Government for purposes of section \n     8344 of title 5, United States Code, or comparable provisions \n     of Federal law.\n       (f)(1) The Special Master is authorized to--\n       (A) hold such hearings and sit and act at such times,\n       (B) take such testimony,\n       (C) have such printing and binding done,\n       (D) enter into such contracts and other arrangements,\n       (E) make such expenditures, and\n       (F) take such other actions, as the Special Master may seem \n     advisable.\n       (2) The Special Master is authorized to establish task \n     forces which include individuals appointed for the purpose of \n     gathering information on specific subjects identified by the \n     Special Master as requiring the knowledge and expertise of \n     such individuals. No compensation may be paid to members of a \n     task force solely for their service on the task force, but \n     the Special Master may authorize the reimbursement of members \n     of a task force for travel and per diem in lieu of \n     subsistence expenses during the performance of duties while \n     away from the home, or regular place of business, of the \n     member, in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of \n     title 5, United States Code. The Special Master shall not \n     authorize the appointment of personnel to act as staff for \n     the task force.\n       (3) The Special Master is authorized to accepts gifts of \n     services, or funds and to expend funds derived from sources \n     other than the Federal Government, including the State of \n     Alaska, private nonprofit organizations, corporations, or \n     foundations which are determined appropriate and necessary to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       (4) The Special Master is authorized to secure directly \n     from any officer, department, agency, establishment, or \n     instrumentality of the Federal Government such information as \n     the Special Master may require for the purpose of this \n     section, and each such officer, department, agency, \n     establishment, or instrumentality is authorized and directed \n     to furnish, to the extent permitted by law, such information, \n     suggestions, estimates, and statistics directly to the \n     Special Master, upon request\n       (g) The provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n     shall not apply to the Special Master established under this \n     section.\n       (h) Upon the request of the Special Master, the head of any \n     Federal department, agency, or instrumentality is authorized \n     to make any of the facilities and services of such \n     department, agency, or instrumentality available to the \n     Special Master and detail any of the personnel of such \n     department, agency, or instrumentality to the commission, on \n     a nonreimbursable basis, to assist the Special Master in \n     carrying out its duties under this section.\n       (i) The Special Master may use the United States mails in \n     the same manner and under the same conditions as other \n     departments and agencies of the United States.\n       (j) The Special Master shall cease to exist on the date \n     that is one hundred eighty days after the date on which the \n     Special Master submits the report required under subsection \n     (c)(5).

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nthe Asian Development Bank [ADB] for its role in the growth and \ncontinuing prosperity in Asian and Pacific developing countries. \nFurther, I urge the ADB to involve our Nation's small business \ncommunity in efforts to further prosperity in this part of the world. \nThe economic and social evolution underway in Asia has taken place at \nan incredible rate over the past decade. The ADB is playing an \nimportant role in this development, providing funds to improve and \nstrengthen Asia's infrastructure.\n  As my colleagues know, the Asian Development Bank was founded in 1966 \nto function as an international development finance institution for the \nAsian and Pacific region. Headquartered in Manila, in the Philippines, \nthe ADB had 56 member countries--40 within the Asian and Pacific region \nand 16 from outside the region--as of March 31, 1996. The ADB is \nengaged in promoting the economic and social progress of the Asian and \nPacific region. Development banks in the world today with similar roles \ninclude the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the \nAfrican Development Bank.\n  Specifically, the ADB extends low interest loans to fund special \nprojects in Asian and Pacific developing countries. The ADB finances \ninfrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, bridges, and other \nventures which have a strong impact on the designated area. This kind \nof financial support is critical to further the dynamic growth of Asian \neconomies--growth that presents tremendous opportunities for U.S. \nbusinesses. Established businesses in the United States, such as AT \nand Price Waterhouse, as well as smaller agricultural firms, such as \nSeminole Fertilizer Corp., benefit greatly from the \n\n[[Page S12061]]\n\nexponential growth and progress of Asia. I encourage the ADB to seek \nopportunities for greater participation by U.S. small businesses as \npart of its future projects. The ADB assists private enterprises in \nundertaking financially viable projects which also have significant \neconomic development merit and catalyzing the flow of domestic and \nexternal resources to such projects. For example, the bank allocated \nover $3.3 billion to develop telecommunications services in Asia's \npoorest areas and will invest almost $1 billion on telecommunications \nnetworks in India alone.\n\n  The ADB also provides loans, equity investments, and technical \nassistance, and also cofinances projects with bilateral and \nmultilateral agencies as well as export credit and commercial sources. \nAs of June 30, 1995, the bank had approved $51.9 billion in loans for \n1,236 projects in 34 countries and $3.9 billion for 3,539 technical \nassistance grants.\n  As a donor member, the United States has contributed to the Asian \nDevelopment Fund [ADF], which is the ADB's window for concessional \nlending to its borrowing member countries. Each year, ADB extends loans \nto fund projects and activities in Asian and Pacific developing \ncountries, and provides several billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts \nto procure goods and consulting services. In 1995, the United States \nranked first among donor member countries in total procurement, with a \ndonor amount of $333 million dollars. The ADF, which is crucial to the \nbank's ability to grant loans, is the ADB's main soft-loan program. \nThis soft-loan program lets donor countries apply for grants at a \ngenerous interest-free level, which makes it feasible for many poor \ncountries to apply and receive loans to improve their environment, \ntransportation, infrastructure, and communications.\n\n  A country that requests an interest-free loan from the ADF must \nfulfill requirements set by the ADB. The ADB stresses that the member \ncountries have good governance which will permit a successful \nmanagement of the development process, which encourages economic and \npolitical stability in the region. As a development partner, the ADB \nhas a clear and direct interest in the capacity of borrowing \ngovernments to fulfill their economic role by implementing the \nassociated policies. The success of the ADB's project investments \ndepends on the efficacy of the institutional framework in development \nmember countries [DMC]. In addition, governments are expected to \nperform certain key functions, including maintaining macroeconomic \nstability; developing infrastructure; providing public goods; \npreventing market failures; and promoting equity. Without macroeconomic \nstability, business prospects are uncertain and investment risks are \nhigh.\n  Further, the bank advises the developing countries regarding human \nrights, social and environmental policies, and other areas before \naccepting the country for a grant.\n  Mr. President, the replenishment of the ADF has been a ongoing \nproblem. At present, ADF is expected to run out of money by year-end. \nIn that respect, the ADB, along with other development banks, have been \ntrying to arrange financing through private financial institutions. \nMultilateral agencies, such as ADB, likely will shift more funding to \nsocially-oriented projects in the future, and have vast projects \nfinanced by private financial institutions.\n  The ADB has confronted and overcome many challenges, thanks to the \nefforts of its leadership. I would like to commend the diligent efforts \nof Ambassador Yang of the Asian Development Bank. Former California \nSavings and Loan Commissioner Linda Tsao Yang of Davis, CA, is the U.S. \nambassador on the 12 member board of executive directors of the ADB. \nMs. Yang has operated her own financial consulting firm since stepping \ndown from the State S post in 1982. Her expertise during these \nchallenging times is certainly welcome at the ADB.\n\n  I may not always agree with the bank's direction on a specific issue, \nbut the overall direction of the ADB has been positive. Ambassador Yang \nis aggressively pursuing creative roles for the ADB to play in a manner \nwhich advances our Nation's commercial interests in that part of the \nworld. Thanks in part to these creative efforts, the Asian continent is \nan exciting and promising region of the world for the residents and for \nthose playing a part in its development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12060-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12061-S12062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR AL SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we near the close of the 104th Congress \nwill adjourn. Adjournment also will bring to a close the distinguished \nSenate career of Wyoming's senior Senator, the honorable Al Simpson. I \nam confident that Senate historians will see Al Simpson the way his \ncolleagues already see him: as one of the truly great Senators of his \nera. I will miss Al Simpson--his leadership, his guidance, his wit, and \nmost of all, his friendship.\n  Al Simpson and I entered the Senate at the same time--in 1979. At \nthat time, he already had accumulated some Senate experience as the son \nof another legendary Wyoming Senator, Milward Simpson.\n  A story is told that Abraham Lincoln once began a meeting of his \nclosest advisors by reading to them a piece from the humorist Artemus \nWard. Lincoln seemed to be the only one who enjoyed the piece and found \nhimself the only one laughing. Lincoln was said to have chastised his \ncolleagues: ``Why don't you laugh? With the fearful strain that is upon \nme night and day, if I did not laugh I should die, and you need this \nmedicine as much as I do.''\n  All of my colleagues would agree that the medicine of humor is best \ndispensed by our senior colleague from Wyoming. Perhaps not since \nAbraham Lincoln has Washington had a better practitioner in the art of \nmedicinal humor. It has become a fond and regular experience to come to \nthe floor for a vote, or visit the cloakrooms and see a small group of \nSenators listening delightfully to the yarns spun by our friend from \nWyoming. When Senator Simpson formally addresses the Senate, we can \ncount on his statements to be both informative and entertaining. I will \nmiss Al Simpson's good nature and quick wit.\n  The full measure of Al Simpson is more than good humor. He is a man \nof enormous intellect and profound leadership. Al Simpson is sharp--as \nsharp as a tack, and as tough as a good piece of saddle leather, as he \nwould probably say. But to see how tough Al Simpson is, and to \nunderstand his deep belief in the cause of public service, one need \nonly take a look at the issues he has championed. Senator Simpson's \nextraordinary career no doubt will be remembered for his efforts on \nthree very challenging issues--immigration, veterans affairs and \nentitlement reform. Each of those issues is vitally important, but \nfrankly each can be thankless tasks.\n\n  It is appropriate that the 104th Congress will conclude with the \npassage of a comprehensive bill to address the serious problem of \nillegal immigration. This is the third major immigration bill \nshepherded in large measure by our friend from Wyoming. That is quite a \nrecord of legislative achievement given the volatile emotions that \nunderlie this issue and the diverse interests involved. It's even more \namazing when one considers that Senator Simpson hails from a great \nState not known for being a magnet for illegal immigrants. The \ntremendous leadership he has demonstrated on this issue is a testament \nto Senator Simpson's commitment to pursue what's in our Nation's \ninterest, and to pursue such issues vigorously.\n  The same vigor is shown in Senator Simpson's commitment to our \nNation's veterans. The Senator from Wyoming, like myself, is a veteran \nof the U.S. Army. Few have the level of understanding, the strong sense \nof compassion and fairness, that Al Simpson has displayed toward our \nveterans. As chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee during a time \nof tremendous budgetary constraints, Al Simpson has made sure that this \nNation maintains its commitment to the brave veterans who answered the \ncall and made sacrifices for their country. All men and women who once \nadorned a military uniform to defend our country, as well as this \nSenate, and this Nation will miss this true friend of the American \nveteran.\n  Finally, Senator Al Simpson is a man of great vision--a man who \nbelieves that Congress has a duty to anticipate and prevent future \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\n He's right. No example demonstrates this belief more than his almost \nlonely effort to address the lurking problem of Federal entitlements, \nfrom Social Security to Medicare. Along with our friend from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Simpson chaired the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform. This commission found ominous signs that \nindicate now is the time to begin the process of reforming our Social \nSecurity and Medicare systems. It's no secret that both systems are \nincredibly important to our senior citizens. No doubt, this Nation owes \na great debt of gratitude to Al Simpson for embarking this Senate, this \nCongress, and this Nation on what we all hope is the road toward true \nreform of Federal entitlements.\n\n  Now our dear friend from Wyoming soon will be speaking not from the \nSenate floor but from a Harvard lecture hall. The Senate's loss is \ncertainly Harvard's gain. No doubt the fortunate young people who \nattend Professor Simpson's class will be entertained and informed. I \nhope the academic world will appreciate one basic fact: Al Simpson \ntells it like it is. For that, he has my admiration.\n  I will miss my Senate classmate. My wife Harriet and I always have \nenjoyed Senator Simpson and his wife Ann. They are great friends, and \nwe look forward to seeing them should our travels take us to Cambridge \nor their's to Washington or South Dakota. I hope my friend from Wyoming \ndoesn't mind if I drop in on his class on occasion, not just to gain \nthe benefit of his thoughtful insights, but to hear again his homespun \nstories and receive yet another dose of his tremendous good humor. I \nwish Al and Ann Simpson the very, very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12061-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12062-S12077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 304(d) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(d)), a \nnotice of issuance of final regulations was submitted by the Office of \nCompliance, U.S. Congress. The notice contains final regulations \nrelated to Federal Service Labor-Management Relations (Regulations \nunder section 220(d) of the Congressional Accountability Act.)\n  The Congressional Accountability Act requires this notice be printed \nin the Congressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the \nnotice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \nExtension of Rights, Protections and Responsibilities Under Chapter 71 \n   of Title 5, United States Code, Relating to Federal Service Labor-\n     Management Relations (Regulations Under Section 220(d) of the \n                   Congressional Accountability Act)\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n       On July 9, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance adopted and submitted for publication in the \n     Congressional Record final regulations implementing section \n     220(d) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), \n     which extends to the Congress certain rights, protections, \n     and responsibilities under chapter 71 of title 5, United \n     States Code, relating to Federal service labor-management \n     relations. On August 2, 1996, the House agreed both to H. \n     Res. 504, to provide for the approval of final regulations \n     that are applicable to the employing offices and covered \n     employees of the House, and to H. Con. Res. 207, to provide \n     for approval of final regulations that are applicable to the \n     instrumentalities of the Congress, i.e., the employing \n     offices and employees other than those offices and employees \n     of the House and the Senate. On September 28, 1996, the \n     Senate agreed to H. Con. Res. 207, covering the \n     instrumentalities, and in addition approved S. Res. 304, to \n     provide for the approval of the final regulations that are \n     applicable to employing offices and covered employees of the \n     Senate,\n       Together with the House's prior approval of H. Res. 504 and \n     H. Con. Res. 207, the Senate's concurrence in H. Con. Res. \n     207 and its approval of S. Res. 304 constitute approval under \n     section 304(c) of the CAA of the Board's section 220(d) \n     regulations as applicable both to employing offices and \n     covered employees of the House and of the Senate (other than \n     those House and Senate offices expressly listed in section \n     220(e)(2)) and to the instrumentalities of the Congress. \n     Accordingly, pursuant to section 304(d) of the CAA, the Board \n     submits these regulations to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     for issuance by publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, the \n     Board finds good cause for advancing the effective date of \n     the House regulations from 60 days after their issuance to \n     October 1, 1996. That date corresponds with the effective \n     date of application of CAA section 220 to the Congress. The \n     Board finds that the effective implementation of the CAA is \n     furthered by making these regulations effective for the \n     House, the Senate, and the instrumentalities on that \n     effective date rather than allowing the provisions of the CAA \n     contained in section 411 and the derivative regulations of \n     the executive branch to control the administration of the \n     statute during the sixty day period otherwise required by \n     section 304(d)(3) of the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 30th day of September, \n     1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

Cross-petitions must be filed in \n     accordance with this subpart.\n       (b) Intervention requests and cross-petitions. A request to \n     intervene and a cross-petition, accompanied by any necessary \n     showing of interest, must be submitted in writing and filed \n     with the Executive Director before the\n\n[[Page S12066]]\n\n     pre-election investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause \n     is shown for granting an extension. If no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing is held, a request to intervene and a \n     cross-petition must be filed prior to action being taken \n     pursuant to Sec. 2422.30.\n       (c) Labor organization intervention requests. Except for \n     incumbent intervenors, a labor organization seeking to \n     intervene shall submit a statement that it has complied with \n     5 U.S.C. 7111(e), as applied by the CAA, and one of the \n     following:\n       (1) A showing of interest of ten percent (10%) or more of \n     the employees in the unit covered by a petition seeking an \n     election, with an alphabetical list of the names of the \n     employees constituting the showing of interest; or\n       (2) A current or recently expired collective bargaining \n     agreement covering any of the employees in the unit affected \n     by issues raised in the petition; or\n       (3) Evidence that it is or was, prior to a reorganization, \n     the certified exclusive representative of any of the \n     employees affected by issues raised in the petition.\n       (d) Incumbent. An incumbent exclusive representative, \n     without regard to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this \n     section, will be considered a party in any representation \n     proceeding raising issues that affect employees the incumbent \n     represents, unless it serves the Board, through the Executive \n     Director, with a written disclaimer of any representation \n     interest in the claimed unit.\n       (e) Employing office. An employing office or activity will \n     be considered a party if any of its employees are affected by \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (f) Employing office or activity intervention. An employing \n     office or activity seeking to intervene in any representation \n     proceeding must submit evidence that one or more employees of \n     the employing office or activity may be affected by issues \n     raised in the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.9 Adequacy of showing of interest.\n       (a) Adequacy. Adequacy of a showing of interest refers to \n     the percentage of employees in the unit involved as required \n     by Sec. Sec. 2422.3(c) and (d) and 2422.8(c)(1).\n       (b) Executive Director investigation and action. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will conduct such \n     investigation as deemed appropriate. The Executive Director's \n     determination, on behalf of the Board, that the showing of \n     interest is adequate is final and binding and not subject to \n     collateral attack at a representation hearing or on appeal to \n     the Board. If the Executive Director determines, on behalf of \n     the Board, that a showing of interest is inadequate, the \n     Executive Director will dismiss the petition, or deny a \n     request for intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.10 Validity of showing of interest.\n       (a) Validity. Validity questions are raised by challenges \n     to a showing of interest on grounds other than adequacy.\n       (b) Validity challenge. The Executive Director or any party \n     may challenge the validity of a showing of interest.\n       (c) When and where validity challenges may be filed. Party \n     challenges to the validity of a showing of interest must be \n     in writing and filed with the Executive Director before the \n     pre-election investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause \n     is shown for granting an extension. If no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing is held, challenges to the validity of \n     a showing of interest must be filed prior to action being \n     taken pursuant to Sec. 2422.30.\n       (d) Contents of validity challenges. Challenges to the \n     validity of a showing of interest must be supported with \n     evidence.\n       (e) Executive Director investigation and action. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will conduct such \n     investigation as deemed appropriate. The Executive Director's \n     determination, on behalf of the Board, that a showing of \n     interest is valid is final and binding and is not subject to \n     collateral attack or appeal to the Board. If the Executive \n     Director finds, on behalf of the Board, that the showing of \n     interest is not valid, the Executive Director will dismiss \n     the petition or deny the request to intervene.\n     Sec. 2422.11 Challenge to the status of a labor organization.\n       (a) Basis of challenge to labor organization status. The \n     only basis on which a challenge to the status of a labor \n     organization may be made is compliance with 5 U.S.C. \n     7103(a)(4), as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) Format and time for filing a challenge. Any party \n     filing a challenge to the status of a labor organization \n     involved in the processing of a petition must do so in \n     writing to the Executive Director before the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause is shown for \n     granting an extension. If no hearing is held, challenges must \n     be filed prior to action being taken pursuant to \n     Sec. 2422.30.\n     Sec. 2422.12 Timeliness of petitions seeking an election.\n       (a) Election bar. Where there is no certified exclusive \n     representative, a petition seeking an election will not be \n     considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months of a \n     valid election involving the same unit or a subdivision of \n     the same unit.\n       (b) Certification bar. Where there is a certified exclusive \n     representative of employees, a petition seeking an election \n     will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) \n     months after the certification of the exclusive \n     representative of the employees in an appropriate unit. If a \n     collective bargaining agreement covering the claimed unit is \n     pending employing office head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c), \n     as applied by the CAA, or is in effect, paragraphs (c), (d), \n     or (e) of this section apply.\n       (c) Bar during employing office head review. A petition \n     seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed \n     during the period of employing office head review under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA. This bar expires upon \n     either the passage of thirty (30) days absent employing \n     office head action, or upon the date of any timely employing \n     office head action.\n       (d) Contract bar where the contract is for three (3) years \n     or less. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect \n     covering the claimed unit and has a term of three (3) years \n     or less from the date it became effective, a petition seeking \n     an election will be considered timely if filed not more than \n     one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days \n     prior to the expiration of the agreement.\n       (e) Contract bar where the contract is for more than three \n     (3) years. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in \n     effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of more than \n     three (3) years from the date it became effective, a petition \n     seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not \n     more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty \n     (60) days prior to the expiration of the initial three (3) \n     year period, and any time after the expiration of the initial \n     three (3) year period.\n       (f) Unusual circumstances. A petition seeking an election \n     or a determination relating to representation matters may be \n     filed at any time when unusual circumstances exist that \n     substantially affect the unit or majority representation.\n       (g) Premature extension. Where a collective bargaining \n     agreement with a term of three (3) years or less has been \n     extended prior to sixty (60) days before its expiration date, \n     the extension will not serve as a basis for dismissal of a \n     petition seeking an election filed in accordance with this \n     section.\n       (h) Contract requirements. Collective bargaining \n     agreements, including agreements that go into effect under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA, and those that \n     automatically renew without further action by the parties, do \n     not constitute a bar to a petition seeking an election under \n     this section unless a clear and unambiguous effective date, \n     renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date \n     are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant \n     accompanying documentation.\n     Sec. 2422.13 Resolution of issues raised by a petition.\n       (a) Meetings prior to filing a representation petition. All \n     parties affected by the representation issues that may be \n     raised in a petition are encouraged to meet prior to the \n     filing of the petition to discuss their interests and narrow \n     and resolve the issues. If requested by all parties a \n     representative of the Office will participate in these \n     meetings.\n       (b) Meetings to narrow and resolve the issues after the \n     petition is filed. After a petition is filed, the Executive \n     Director may require all affected parties to meet to narrow \n     and resolve the issues raised in the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.14 Effect of withdrawal/dismissal.\n       (a) Withdrawal/dismissal less than sixty (60) days before \n     contract expiration. When a petition seeking an election that \n     has been timely filed is withdrawn by the petitioner or \n     dismissed by the Executive Director or the Board less than \n     sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of an existing \n     agreement between the incumbent exclusive representative and \n     the employing office or activity or any time after the \n     expiration of the agreement, another petition seeking an \n     election will not be considered timely if filed within a \n     ninety (90) day period from either:\n       (1) The date the withdrawal is approved; or\n       (2) The date the petition is dismissed by the Executive \n     Director when no application for review is filed with the \n     Board; or\n       (3) The date the Board rules on an application for review; \n     or\n       (4) The date the Board issues a Decision and Order \n     dismissing the petition.\n       Other pending petitions that have been timely filed under \n     this Part will continue to be processed.\n       (b) Withdrawal by petitioner. A petitioner who submits a \n     withdrawal request for a petition seeking an election that is \n     received by the Executive Director after the notice of pre-\n     election investigatory hearing issues or after approval of an \n     election agreement, whichever occurs first, will be barred \n     from filing another petition seeking an election for the same \n     unit or any subdivision of the unit for six (6) months from \n     the date of the approval of the withdrawal by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (c) Withdrawal by incumbent. When an election is not held \n     because the incumbent disclaims any representation interest \n     in a unit, a petition by the incumbent seeking an election \n     involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit \n     will not be considered timely if filed within six (6) months \n     of cancellation of the election.\n     Sec. 2422.15 Duty to furnish information and cooperate.\n       (a) Relevant information. After a petition is filed, all \n     parties must, upon request of the Executive Director, furnish \n     the Executive Director and serve all parties affected by \n     issues raised in the petition with information concerning \n     parties, issues, and agreements raised in or affected by the \n     petition.\n       (b) Inclusions and exclusions. After a petition seeking an \n     election is filed, the Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, may direct the employing office or activity to furnish \n     the Executive Director and all parties\n\n[[Page S12067]]\n\n     affected by issues raised in the petition with a current \n     alphabetized list of employees and job classifications \n     included in and/or excluded from the existing or claimed unit \n     affected by issues raised in the petition.\n       (c) Cooperation. All parties are required to cooperate in \n     every aspect of the representation process. This obligation \n     includes cooperating fully with the Executive Director, \n     submitting all required and requested information, and \n     participating in prehearing conferences and pre-election \n     investigatory hearings. The failure to cooperate in the \n     representation process may result in the Executive Director \n     or the Board taking appropriate action, including dismissal \n     of the petition or denial of intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.16 Election agreements or directed elections.\n       (a) Election agreements. Parties are encouraged to enter \n     into election agreements.\n       (b) Executive Director directed election. If the parties \n     are unable to agree on procedural matters, specifically, the \n     eligibility period, method of election, dates, hours, or \n     locations of the election, the Executive Director, on behalf \n     of the Board, will decide election procedures and issue a \n     Direction of Election, without prejudice to the rights of a \n     party to file objections to the procedural conduct of the \n     election.\n       (c) Opportunity for an investigatory hearing. Before \n     directing an election, the Executive Director shall provide \n     affected parties an opportunity for a pre-election \n     investigatory hearing on other than procedural matters.\n       (d) Challenges or objections to a directed election. A \n     Direction of Election issued under this section will be \n     issued without prejudice to the right of a party to file a \n     challenge to the eligibility of any person participating in \n     the election and/or objections to the election.\n     Sec. 2422.17 Notice of pre-election investigatory hearing and \n         prehearing conference.\n       (a) Purpose of notice of an investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, may issue a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing involving any \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (b) Contents. The notice of hearing will advise affected \n     parties about the pre-election investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director will also notify affected parties of the \n     issues raised in the petition and establish a date for the \n     prehearing conference.\n       (c) Prehearing conference. A prehearing conference will be \n     conducted by the Executive Director or her designee, either \n     by meeting or teleconference. All parties must participate in \n     a prehearing conference and be prepared to fully discuss, \n     narrow and resolve the issues set forth in the notification \n     of the prehearing conference.\n       (d) No interlocutory appeal of investigatory hearing \n     determination. The Executive Director's determination of \n     whether to issue a notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing is not appealable to the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.18 Pre-election investigatory hearing procedures.\n       (a) Purpose of a pre-election investigatory hearing. \n     Representation hearings are considered investigatory and not \n     adversarial. The purpose of the hearing is to develop a full \n     and complete record of relevant and material facts.\n       (b) Conduct of hearing. Pre-election investigatory hearings \n     will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the \n     Executive Director or her designee. There is no burden of \n     proof, with the exception of proceedings on objections to \n     elections as provided for in Sec. 2422.27(b). Formal rules of \n     evidence do not apply.\n       (c) Pre-election investigatory hearing. Pre-election \n     investigatory hearings will be conducted by the Executive \n     Director or her designee.\n       (d) Production of evidence. Parties have the obligation to \n     produce existing documents and witnesses for the \n     investigatory hearing in accordance with the instructions of \n     the Executive Director or her designee. If a party willfully \n     fails to comply with such instructions, the Board may draw an \n     inference adverse to that party on the issue related to the \n     evidence sought.\n       (e) Transcript. An official reporter will make the official \n     transcript of the pre-election investigatory hearing. Copies \n     of the official transcript may be examined in the Office \n     during normal working hours. Requests by parties to purchase \n     copies of the official transcript should be made to the \n     official hearing reporter.\n     Sec. 2422.19 Motions.\n       (a) Purpose of a motion. Subsequent to the issuance of a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing in a \n     representation proceeding, a party seeking a ruling, an \n     order, or relief must do so by filing or raising a motion \n     stating the order or relief sought and the grounds therefor. \n     Challenges and other filings referenced in other sections of \n     this subpart may, in the discretion of the Executive Director \n     or her designee, be treated as a motion.\n       (b) Prehearing motions. Prehearing motions must be filed in \n     writing with the Executive Director. Any response must be \n     filed with the Executive Director within five (5) days after \n     service of the motion. The Executive Director shall rule on \n     the motion.\n       (c) Motions made at the investigatory hearing. During the \n     pre-election investigatory hearing, motions will be made to \n     the Executive Director or her designee, and may be oral on \n     the record, unless otherwise required in this subpart to be \n     in writing. Responses may be oral on the record or in \n     writing, but, absent permission of the Executive Director or \n     her designee, must be provided before the hearing closes. The \n     Executive Director or her designee will rule on motions made \n     at the hearing.\n       (d) Posthearing motions. Motions made after the hearing \n     closes must be filed in writing with the Board. Any response \n     to a posthearing motion must be filed with the Board within \n     five (5) days after service of the motion.\n     Sec. 2422.20 Rights of parties at a pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Rights. A party at a pre-election investigatory hearing \n     will have the right:\n       (1) To appear in person or by a representative;\n       (2) To examine and cross-examine witnesses; and\n       (3) To introduce into the record relevant evidence.\n       (b) Documentary evidence and stipulations. Parties must \n     submit two (2) copies of documentary evidence to the \n     Executive Director or her designee and copies to all other \n     parties. Stipulations of fact between/among the parties may \n     be introduced into evidence.\n       (c) Oral argument. Parties will be entitled to a reasonable \n     period prior to the close of the hearing for oral argument. \n     Presentation of a closing oral argument does not preclude a \n     party from filing a brief under paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n       (d) Briefs. A party will be afforded an opportunity to file \n     a brief with the Board.\n       (1) An original and two (2) copies of a brief must be filed \n     with the Board within thirty (30) days from the close of the \n     hearing.\n       (2) A written request for an extension of time to file a \n     brief must be filed with and received by the Board no later \n     than five (5) days before the date the brief is due.\n       (3) No reply brief may be filed without permission of the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.21 Duties and powers of the Executive Director in \n         the conduct of the pre-election investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Duties. The Executive Director or her designee, on \n     behalf of the Board, will receive evidence and inquire fully \n     into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters \n     that are the subject of the investigatory hearing, and may \n     make recommendations on the record to the Board.\n       (b) Powers. During the period a case is assigned to the \n     Executive Director or her designee for pre-election \n     investigatory hearing and prior to the close of the hearing, \n     the Executive Director or her designee may take any action \n     necessary to schedule, conduct, continue, control, and \n     regulate the pre-election investigatory hearing, including \n     ruling on motions when appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.22 Objections to the conduct of the pre-election \n         investigatory hearing.\n       (a) Objections. Objections are oral or written complaints \n     concerning the conduct of a pre-election investigatory \n     hearing.\n       (b) Exceptions to rulings. There are automatic exceptions \n     to all adverse rulings.\n     Sec. 2422.23 Election procedures.\n       (a) Executive Director conducts or supervises election. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will decide to \n     conduct or supervise the election. In supervised elections, \n     employing offices or activities will perform all acts as \n     specified in the Election Agreement or Direction of Election.\n       (b) Notice of election. Prior to the election a notice of \n     election, prepared by the Executive Director, will be posted \n     by the employing office or activity in places where notices \n     to employees are customarily posted and/or distributed in a \n     manner by which notices are normally distributed. The notice \n     of election will contain the details and procedures of the \n     election, including the appropriate unit, the eligibility \n     period, the date(s), hour(s) and location(s) of the election, \n     a sample ballot, and the effect of the vote.\n       (c) Sample ballot. The reproduction of any document \n     purporting to be a copy of the official ballot that suggests \n     either directly or indirectly to employees that the Board \n     endorses a particular choice in the election may constitute \n     grounds for setting aside an election if objections are filed \n     under Sec. 2422.26.\n       (d) Secret ballot. All elections will be by secret ballot.\n       (e) Intervenor withdrawal from ballot. When two or more \n     labor organizations are included as choices in an election, \n     an intervening labor organization may, prior to the approval \n     of an election agreement or before the direction of an \n     election, file a written request with the Executive Director \n     to remove its name from the ballot. If the request is not \n     received prior to the approval of an election agreement or \n     before the direction of an election, unless the parties and \n     the Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, agree \n     otherwise, the intervening labor organization will remain on \n     the ballot. The Executive Director's decision on the request \n     is final and not subject to the filing of an application for \n     review with the Board.\n       (f) Incumbent withdrawal from ballot in an election to \n     decertify an incumbent representative. When there is no \n     intervening labor organization, an election to decertify an \n     incumbent exclusive representative will not be held if the \n     incumbent provides the Executive Director with a written \n     disclaimer of any representation interest in the unit. When \n     there is an intervenor, an election will be held if the \n     intervening labor organization proffers a thirty percent \n     (30%) showing of interest within the time period established \n     by the Executive Director.\n       (g) Petitioner withdraws from ballot in an election. When \n     there is no intervening labor\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\n     organization, an election will not be held if the petitioner \n     provides the Executive Director with a written request to \n     withdraw the petition. When there is an intervenor, an \n     election will be held if the intervening labor organization \n     proffers a thirty percent (30%) showing of interest within \n     the time period established by the Executive Director.\n       (h) Observers. All parties are entitled to representation \n     at the polling location(s) by observers of their own \n     selection subject to the Executive Director's approval.\n       (1) Parties desiring to name observers must file in writing \n     with the Executive Director a request for specifically named \n     observers at least fifteen (15) days prior to an election. \n     The Executive Director may grant an extension of time for \n     filing a request for specifically named observers for good \n     cause where a party requests such an extension or on the \n     Executive Director's own motion. The request must name and \n     identify the observers requested.\n       (2) An employing office or activity may use as its \n     observers any employees who are not eligible to vote in the \n     election, except:\n       (i) Supervisors or management officials;\n       (ii) Employees who have any official connection with any of \n     the labor organizations involved; or\n       (iii) Non-employees of the legislative branch.\n       (3) A labor organization may use as its observers any \n     employees eligible to vote in the election, except:\n       (i) Employees on leave without pay status who are working \n     for the labor organization involved; or\n       (ii) Employees who hold an elected office in the union.\n       (4) Objections to a request for specific observers must be \n     filed with the Executive Director stating the reasons in \n     support within five (5) days after service of the request.\n       (5) The Executive Director's ruling on requests for and \n     objections to observers is final and binding and is not \n     subject to the filing of an application for review with the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.24 Challenged ballots.\n       (a) Filing challenges. A party or the Executive Director \n     may, for good cause, challenge the eligibility of any person \n     to participate in the election prior to the employee voting.\n       (b) Challenged ballot procedure. An individual whose \n     eligibility to vote is in dispute will be given the \n     opportunity to vote a challenged ballot. If the parties and \n     the Region are unable to resolve the challenged ballot(s) \n     prior to the tally of ballots, the unresolved challenged \n     ballot(s) will be impounded and preserved until a \n     determination can be made, if necessary, by the Executive \n     Director or the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.25 Tally of ballots.\n       (a) Tallying the ballots. When the election is concluded, \n     the Executive Director or her designee will tally the \n     ballots.\n       (b) Service of the tally. When the tally is completed, the \n     Executive Director will serve the tally of ballots on the \n     parties in accordance with the election agreement or \n     direction of election.\n       (c) Valid ballots cast. Representation will be determined \n     by the majority of the valid ballots cast.\n     Sec. 2422.26 Objections to the election.\n       (a) Filing objections to the election. Objections to the \n     procedural conduct of the election or to conduct that may \n     have improperly affected the results of the election may be \n     filed by any party. Objections must be filed and received by \n     the Executive Director within five (5) days after the tally \n     of ballots has been served. Any objections must be timely \n     regardless of whether the challenged ballots are sufficient \n     in number to affect the results of the election. The \n     objections must be supported by clear and concise reasons. An \n     original and two (2) copies of the objections must be \n     received by the Executive Director.\n       (b) Supporting evidence. The objecting party must file with \n     the Executive Director evidence, including signed statements, \n     documents and other materials supporting the objections \n     within ten (10) days after the objections are filed.\n     Sec. 2422.27 Determinative challenged ballots and objections.\n       (a) Investigation. The Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, will investigate objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots that are sufficient in number to affect \n     the results of the election.\n       (b) Burden of proof. A party filing objections to the \n     election bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the \n     evidence concerning those objections. However, no party bears \n     the burden of proof on challenged ballots.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation, the \n     Executive Director will take appropriate action consistent \n     with Sec. 2422.30.\n       (d) Consolidated hearing on objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots and an unfair labor practice hearing. When \n     appropriate, and in accordance with Sec. 2422.33, objections \n     and/or determinative challenged ballots may be consolidated \n     with an unfair labor practice hearing. Such consolidated \n     hearings will be conducted by a Hearing Officer. Exceptions \n     and related submissions must be filed with the Board and the \n     Board will issue a decision in accordance with Part 2423 of \n     this chapter and section 406 of the CAA, except for the \n     following:\n       (1) Section 2423.18 of this Subchapter concerning the \n     burden of proof is not applicable;\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may not recommend remedial action \n     to be taken or notices to be posted; and,\n       (3) References to ``charge'' and ``complaint'' in Part 2423 \n     of this chapter will be omitted.\n     Sec. 2422.28 Runoff elections.\n       (a) When a runoff may be held. A runoff election is \n     required in an election involving at least three (3) choices, \n     one of which is ``no union'' or ``neither,'' when no choice \n     receives a majority of the valid ballots cast. However, a \n     runoff may not be held until the objections to the election \n     and determinative challenged ballots have been resolved.\n       (b) Eligibility. Employees who were eligible to vote in the \n     original election and who are also eligible on the date of \n     the runoff election may vote in the runoff election.\n       (c) Ballot. The ballot in the runoff election will provide \n     for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest \n     and second largest number of votes in the election.\n     Sec. 2422.29 Inconclusive elections.\n       (a) Inconclusive elections. An inconclusive election is one \n     where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the \n     outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:\n       (1) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one \n     of which is ``no union'' or ``neither'' and the votes are \n     equally divided; or\n       (2) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the \n     choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive \n     a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next \n     highest and same number of votes; or\n       (3) When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two \n     labor organizations and results in the votes being equally \n     divided; or\n       (4) When the Board determines that there have been \n     significant procedural irregularities.\n       (b) Eligibility to vote in a rerun election. A current \n     payroll period will be used to determine eligibility to vote \n     in a rerun election.\n       (c) Ballot. If a determination is made that the election is \n     inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices \n     that appeared on the original ballot.\n       (d) Number of reruns. There will be only one rerun of an \n     inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another \n     inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will indicate a \n     majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice \n     and a certification of results will be issued. If necessary, \n     a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.\n     Sec. 2422.30 Executive Director investigations, notices of \n         pre-election investigatory hearings, and actions; Board \n         Decisions and Orders.\n       (a) Executive Director investigation. The Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will make such \n     investigation of the petition and any other matter as the \n     Executive Director deems necessary.\n       (b) Executive Director notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing. On behalf of the Board, the Executive Director will \n     issue a notice of pre-election investigatory hearing to \n     inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact \n     exists, where there is an issue as to whether a question \n     concerning representation exists, and any time there is \n     reasonable cause to believe a question exists regarding unit \n     appropriateness.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation and/or \n     hearing, when a pre-election investigatory hearing has been \n     ordered, the Executive Director may, on behalf of the Board, \n     approve an election agreement, dismiss a petition or deny \n     intervention where there is an inadequate or invalid showing \n     of interest, or dismiss a petition where there is an \n     undisputed bar to further processing of the petition under \n     law, rule or regulation.\n       (d) Appeal of Executive Director action. A party may file \n     with the Board an application for review of an Executive \n     Director action taken pursuant to section (c) above.\n       (e) Contents of the Record. When no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing has been conducted all material \n     submitted to and considered by the Executive Director during \n     the investigation becomes a part of the record. When a pre-\n     election investigatory hearing has been conducted, the \n     transcript and all material entered into evidence, including \n     any posthearing briefs, become a part of the record.\n       (f) Transfer of record to Board; Board Decisions and \n     Orders. In cases that are submitted to the Board for decision \n     in the first instance, the Board shall decide the issues \n     presented based upon the record developed by the Executive \n     Director, including the transcript of the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing, if any, documents admitted into the \n     record and briefs and other approved submissions from the \n     parties. The Board may direct that a secret ballot election \n     be held, issue an order dismissing the petition, or make such \n     other disposition of the matter as it deems appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.31 Application for review of an Executive Director \n         action.\n       (a) Filing an application for review. A party must file an \n     application for review with the Board within sixty (60) days \n     of the Executive Director's action. The sixty (60) day time \n     limit provided for in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f), as applied by the \n     CAA, may not be extended or waived.\n       (b) Contents. An application for review must be sufficient \n     to enable the Board to rule on the application without \n     recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its \n     discretion, examine the record in evaluating the application. \n     An application must specify the matters and rulings to which \n     exception(s) is taken, include a summary of evidence relating \n     to any issue raised in the application, and make specific \n     reference to\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\n     page citations in the transcript if a hearing was held. An \n     application may not raise any issue or rely on any facts not \n     timely presented to the Executive Director.\n       (c) Review. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an \n     application for review when the application demonstrates that \n     review is warranted on one or more of the following grounds:\n       (1) The decision raises an issue for which there is an \n     absence of precedent;\n       (2) Established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or,\n       (3) There is a genuine issue over whether the Executive \n     Director has:\n       (i) Failed to apply established law;\n       (ii) Committed a prejudicial procedural error;\n       (iii) Committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a \n     substantial factual matter.\n       (d) Opposition. A party may file with the Board an \n     opposition to an application for review within ten (10) days \n     after the party is served with the application. A copy must \n     be served on the Executive Director and all other parties and \n     a statement of service must be filed with the Board.\n       (e) Executive Director action becomes the Board's action. \n     An action of the Executive Director becomes the action of the \n     Board when:\n       (1) No application for review is filed with the Board \n     within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive \n     Director's action; or\n       (2) A timely application for review is filed with the Board \n     and the Board does not undertake to grant review of the \n     Executive Director's action within sixty (60) days of the \n     filing of the application; or\n       (3) The Board denies an application for review of the \n     Executive Director's action.\n       (f) Board grant of review and stay. The Board may rule on \n     the issue(s) in an application for review in its order \n     granting the application for review. Neither filing nor \n     granting an application for review shall stay any action \n     ordered by the Executive Director unless specifically ordered \n     by the Board.\n       (g) Briefs if review is granted. If the Board does not rule \n     on the issue(s) in the application for review in its order \n     granting review, the Board may, in its discretion, afford the \n     parties an opportunity to file briefs. The briefs will be \n     limited to the issue(s) referenced in the Board's order \n     granting review.\n     Sec. 2422.32 Certifications and revocations.\n       (a) Certifications. The Executive Director, on behalf of \n     the Board, will issue an appropriate certification when:\n       (1) After an election, runoff, or rerun,\n       (i) No objections are filed or challenged ballots are not \n     determinative, or\n       (ii) Objections and determinative challenged ballots are \n     decided and resolved; or\n       (2) The Executive Director takes an action requiring a \n     certification and that action becomes the action of the Board \n     under Sec. 2422.31(e) or the Board otherwise directs the \n     issuance of a certification.\n       (b) Revocations. Without prejudice to any rights and \n     obligations which may exist under the CAA, the Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will revoke a recognition \n     or certification, as appropriate, and provide a written \n     statement of reasons when an incumbent exclusive \n     representative files, during a representation proceeding, a \n     disclaimer of any representational interest in the unit.\n     Sec. 2422.33 Relief obtainable under Part 2423.\n       Remedial relief that was or could have been obtained as a \n     result of a motion, objection, or challenge filed or raised \n     under this subpart, may not be the basis for similar relief \n     if filed or raised as an unfair labor practice under Part \n     2423 of this Chapter: provided, however, that related matters \n     may be consolidated for hearing as noted in Sec. 2422.27(d) \n     of this subpart.\n     Sec. 2422.34 Rights and obligations during the pendency of \n         representation proceedings.\n       (a) Existing recognitions, agreements, and obligations \n     under the CAA. During the pendency of any representation \n     proceeding, parties are obligated to maintain existing \n     recognitions, adhere to the terms and conditions of existing \n     collective bargaining agreements, and fulfill all other \n     representational and bargaining responsibilities under the \n     CAA.\n       (b) Unit status of individual employees. Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (a) of this section and except as otherwise \n     prohibited by law, a party may take action based on its \n     position regarding the bargaining unit status of individual \n     employees, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(2), 7112 (b) and (c), \n     as applied by the CAA: provided, however, that its actions \n     may be challenged, reviewed, and remedied where appropriate.\n\n              Part 2423--Unfair Labor Practice Proceedings\n\n     Sec.\n     2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n     2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n     2423.3  Who may file charges.\n     2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n     2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or \n         the negotiability procedure.\n     2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n     2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n     2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n     2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n     2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n     2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n     2423.12  Filing and contents of the complaint.\n     2423.13  Answer to the complaint.\n     2423.14  Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing.\n     2423.15  Intervention.\n     2423.16  [Reserved]\n     2423.17  [Reserved]\n     2423.18  Burden of proof before the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.19  Duties and powers of the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.20  [Reserved]\n     2423.21  [Reserved]\n     2423.22  [Reserved]\n     2423.23  [Reserved]\n     2423.24  [Reserved]\n     2423.25  [Reserved]\n     2423.26  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n         Office.\n     2423.27  Appeal to the Board.\n     2423.28  [Reserved]\n     2423.29  Action by the Board.\n     2423.30  Compliance with decisions and orders of the Board.\n     2423.31  Backpay proceedings.\n     Sec. 2423.1 Applicability of this part.\n       This part is applicable to any charge of alleged unfair \n     labor practices occurring on or after October 1, 1996.\n     Sec. 2423.2 Informal proceedings.\n       (a) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of \n     all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be \n     the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage \n     all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons \n     against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good \n     faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of \n     unfair labor practice charges.\n       (b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph \n     (a) of this section, and noting the 180 day period of \n     limitation set forth in section 220(c)(2) of the CAA, it \n     shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to \n     encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice \n     allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to \n     the filing of a complaint by the General Counsel.\n       (c) In order to afford the parties an opportunity to \n     implement the policy referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of \n     this section, the investigation of an unfair labor practice \n     charge by the General Counsel will normally not commence \n     until the parties have been afforded a reasonable amount of \n     time, not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the filing of the \n     charge, during which period the parties are urged to attempt \n     to informally resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n     Sec. 2423.3 Who may file charges.\n       An employing office, employing activity, or labor \n     organization may be charged by any person with having engaged \n     in or engaging in any unfair labor practice prohibited under \n     5 U.S.C. 7116, as applied by the CAA.\n     Sec. 2423.4 Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents.\n       (a) A charge alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. 7116, as \n     applied by the CAA, shall be submitted on forms prescribed by \n     the General Counsel and shall contain the following:\n       (1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) \n     making the charge;\n       (2) The name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office or activity, or labor organization against whom the \n     charge is made;\n       (3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting \n     the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the \n     section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 71 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code made applicable by the CAA alleged to have \n     been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the \n     particular acts; and\n       (4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving \n     the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, \n     including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) \n     has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has \n     been referred to the Board under Part 2471 of these \n     regulations, or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \n     Service, or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by \n     the charging party in a petition pending before the Board \n     pursuant to Part 2424 of this subchapter.\n       (b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall \n     contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under \n     the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its \n     contents are true and correct to the best of that person's \n     knowledge and belief.\n       (c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit \n     to the General Counsel any supporting evidence and documents.\n     Sec. 2423.5 Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability \n     issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part \n     2424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same \n     negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which \n     solely involve an employing office's allegation that the duty \n     to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter \n     proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be \n     filed under part 2424 of this subchapter.\n     Sec. 2423.6 Filing and service of copies.\n       (a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together \n     with one copy for each additional charged party named shall \n     be filed with the General Counsel.\n       (b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall \n     be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge \n     (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the \n     person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a \n     written statement of such service with the General Counsel. \n     The General Counsel will, as a matter of course, cause a copy \n     of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the \n     charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume \n     responsibility for such service.\n       (c) A charge will be deemed to be filed when it is received \n     by the General Counsel in accordance with the requirements in \n     paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. 2423.7 Investigation of charges.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall conduct such investigation of \n     the charge as the General Counsel deems necessary. Consistent \n     with the policy set forth in Sec. 2423.2, the investigation \n     will normally not commence until the parties have been \n     afforded a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed fifteen \n     (15) days from the filing of the charge, to informally \n     resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n       (b) During the course of the investigation all parties \n     involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence \n     and views to the General Counsel.\n       (c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all \n     persons are expected to cooperate fully with the General \n     Counsel.\n       (d) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all \n     parties involved and the voluntary submission of all \n     potentially relevant information from all potential sources \n     during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall \n     be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect \n     the identity of individuals and the substance of the \n     statements and information they submit or which is obtained \n     during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's \n     and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all \n     relevant information.\n     Sec. 2423.8 Amendment of charges.\n       Prior to the issuance of a complaint, the charging party \n     may amend the charge in accordance with the requirements set \n     forth in Sec. 2423.6.\n     Sec. 2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n       (a) The General Counsel shall take action which may consist \n     of the following, as appropriate:\n       (1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;\n       (2) Refuse to file a complaint;\n       (3) Approve a written settlement and recommend that the \n     Executive Director approve a written settlement agreement in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 414 of the CAA;\n       (4) File a complaint;\n       (5) Upon agreement of all parties, transfer to the Board \n     for decision, after filing of a complaint, a stipulation of \n     facts in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2429.1(a) of \n     this subchapter; or\n       (6) Withdraw a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n       (a) If the General Counsel determines that the charge has \n     not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an \n     unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the \n     General Counsel may request the charging party to withdraw \n     the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a \n     reasonable time, decline to file a complaint.\n       (b) The charging party may not obtain a review of the \n     General Counsel's decision not to file a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n       (a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where \n     time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest \n     permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to \n     submit to the Executive Director or General Counsel, as \n     appropriate, for consideration, all facts and arguments \n     concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.\n\n                        Precomplaint settlements\n\n       (b)(1) Prior to the filing of any complaint or the taking \n     of other formal action, the General Counsel will afford the \n     charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time \n     in which to enter into a settlement agreement to be submitted \n     to and approved by the General Counsel and the Executive \n     Director. Upon approval by the General Counsel and Executive \n     Director and compliance with the terms of the settlement \n     agreement, no further action shall be taken in the case. If \n     the respondent fails to perform its obligations under the \n     settlement agreement, the General Counsel may determine to \n     institute further proceedings.\n       (2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses \n     to become a party to a settlement agreement offered by the \n     respondent, if the General Counsel concludes that the offered \n     settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as \n     applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel and the latter shall \n     decline to file a complaint.\n\n                    Post complaint settlement policy\n\n       (c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) \n     of this section, even after the filing of a complaint, the \n     Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may \n     be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. \n     The parties may, as part of the settlement, agree to waive \n     their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may \n     issue an order requiring the respondent to take action \n     appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily such a \n     settlement agreement will also contain the respondent's \n     consent to the Board's application for the entry of a decree \n     by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     enforcing the Board's order.\n\n                 Post complaint prehearing settlements\n\n       (d)(1) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging \n     party and the respondent enter into a settlement agreement, \n     and such agreement is accepted by the General Counsel, the \n     settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Executive \n     Director for approval.\n       (2) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging party \n     fails or refuses to become a party to a settlement agreement \n     offered by the respondent, and the General Counsel concludes \n     that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of \n     chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be \n     between the respondent and the General Counsel. The charging \n     party will be so informed and provided a brief written \n     statement by the General Counsel of the reasons therefor. The \n     settlement agreement together with the charging party's \n     objections, if any, and the General Counsel's written \n     statements, shall be submitted to the Executive Director for \n     approval. The Executive Director may approve or disapprove \n     any settlement agreement.\n       (3) After the filing of a complaint, if the General Counsel \n     concludes that it will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, \n     as applied by the CAA, the General Counsel may withdraw the \n     complaint.\n\n              Settlements after the opening of the hearing\n\n       (e)(1) After filing of a complaint and after opening of the \n     hearing, if the General Counsel concludes that it will \n     effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, \n     the General Counsel may request the Hearing Officer for \n     permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted \n     such permission to withdraw the complaint, may approve a \n     settlement and recommend that the Executive Director approve \n     the settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n       (2) If, after filing of a complaint and after opening of \n     the hearing, the parties enter into a settlement agreement \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, the General Counsel may request the Hearing \n     Officer and the Executive Director to approve such settlement \n     agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement \n     to the Board for approval.\n       (3) If the charging party fails or refuses to become a \n     party to a settlement agreement, offered by the respondent, \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, and the General Counsel concludes that the \n     offered settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter \n     71, as applied to the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel. After the charging party \n     is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing \n     the reasons for opposing the settlement, the General Counsel \n     may request the Hearing Officer and the Executive Director to \n     approve such settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to \n     transmit the agreement to the Board for approval. The Board \n     may approve or disapprove any such settlement agreement or \n     return the case to the Hearing Officer for other appropriate \n     action.\n     Sec. 2423.12  Filing and contents of the complaint.\n       (a) After a charge is filed, if it appears to the General \n     Counsel that formal proceedings in respect thereto should be \n     instituted, the General Counsel shall file a formal \n     complaint: Provided, however, that a determination by the \n     General Counsel to file a complaint shall not be subject to \n     review.\n       (b) The complaint shall include:\n       (1) Notice of the charge;\n       (2) Any information required pursuant to the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office.\n       (c) Any such complaint may be withdrawn before the hearing \n     by the General Counsel.\n     Sec. 2423.13  Answer to the complaint.\n       A respondent shall file an answer to a complaint in \n     accordance with the requirements of the Procedural Rules of \n     the Office.\n     Sec. 2423.14  Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing.\n       The procedures for prehearing discovery and the conduct of \n     the hearing are set forth in the Procedural Rules of the \n     Office.\n     Sec. 2423.15  Intervention.\n       Any person involved and desiring to intervene in any \n     proceeding pursuant to this part shall file a motion in \n     accordance with the procedures set forth in the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office.

When the General \n     Counsel or the Executive Director finds that the required \n     remedial action has not been effected, the General Counsel or \n     the Executive Director shall take such action as may be \n     appropriate, including referral to the Board for enforcement.\n     Sec. 2423.31 Backpay proceedings.\n       After the entry of a Board order directing payment of \n     backpay, or the entry of a court decree enforcing such order, \n     if it appears to the General Counsel that a controversy \n     exists which cannot be resolved without a formal proceeding, \n     the General Counsel may issue and serve on all parties a \n     backpay specification accompanied by a request for hearing or \n     a request for hearing without a specification. Upon receipt \n     of the request for hearing, the Executive Director will \n     appoint an independent Hearing Officer. The respondent shall, \n     within twenty (20) days after the service of a backpay \n     specification, file an answer thereto in accordance with the \n     Office's Procedural Rules.

The exclusive representative shall request \n     such allegation in writing and the employing office shall \n     make the allegation in writing and serve a copy on the \n     exclusive representative: provided, however, that review of a \n     negotiability issue may be requested by an exclusive \n     representative under this subpart without a prior written \n     allegation by the employing office if the employing office \n     has not served such allegation upon the exclusive \n     representative within ten (10) days after the date of the \n     receipt by any employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations of a written request for such allegation.\n     Sec. 2424.4 Content of petition; service.\n       (a) A petition for review shall be dated and shall contain \n     the following:\n       (1) A statement setting forth the express language of the \n     proposal sought to be negotiated as submitted to the \n     employing office\n       (2) An explicit statement of the meaning attributed to the \n     proposal by the exclusive representative including:\n       (i) Explanation of terms of art, acronyms, technical \n     language, or any other aspect of the language of the proposal \n     which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Where the proposal is concerned with a particular work \n     situation, or other particular circumstances, a description \n     of the situation or circumstances which will enable the Board \n     to understand the context in which the proposal is intended \n     to apply;\n       (3) A copy of all pertinent material, including the \n     employing office's allegation in writing that the matter, as \n     proposed, is not within the duty to bargain in good faith, \n     and other relevant documentary material; and\n       (4) Notification by the petitioning labor organization \n     whether the negotiability issue is also involved in an unfair \n     labor practice charge filed by such labor organization under \n     part 2423 of this subchapter and pending before the General \n     Counsel.\n       (b) A copy of the petition including all attachments \n     thereto shall be served on the employing office head and on \n     the principal employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations.\n       (c)(1) Filing an incomplete petition for review will result \n     in the exclusive representative being asked to provide the \n     missing or incomplete information. Noncompliance with a \n     request to complete the record may result in dismissal of the \n     petition.\n       (2) The processing priority accorded to an incomplete \n     petition, relative to other pending negotiability appeals, \n     will be based upon the date when the petition is completed--\n     not the date it was originally filed.\n     Sec. 2424.5 Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure.\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter which \n     involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization \n     also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the \n     same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which \n     solely involve an employing office's allegation that the duty \n     to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter \n     proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or \n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be \n     filed under this part.\n     Sec. 2424.6 Position of the employing office; time limits for \n         filing; service.\n       (a) Within thirty (30) days after the date of the receipt \n     by the head of an employing office of a copy of a petition \n     for review of a negotiability issue the employing office \n     shall file a statement--\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\n       (1) Withdrawing the allegation that the duty to bargain in \n     good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be \n     negotiated; or\n       (2) Setting forth in full its position on any matters \n     relevant to the petition which it wishes the Board to \n     consider in reaching its decision, including a full and \n     detailed statement of its reasons supporting the allegation. \n     The statement shall cite the section of any law, rule or \n     regulation relied upon as a basis for the allegation and \n     shall contain a copy of any internal employing office rule or \n     regulation so relied upon. The statement shall include:\n       (i) Explanation of the meaning the employing office \n     attributes to the proposal as a whole, including any terms of \n     art, acronyms, technical language or any other aspect of the \n     language of the proposal which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Description of a particular work situation, or other \n     particular circumstance the employing office views the \n     proposal to concern, which will enable the Board to \n     understand the context in which the proposal is considered to \n     apply by the employing office.\n       (b) A copy of the employing office's statement of position, \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     exclusive representative.\n     Sec. 2424.7 Response of the exclusive representative; time \n         limits for filing; service.\n       (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of the receipt \n     by an exclusive representative of a copy of an employing \n     office's statement of position the exclusive representative \n     shall file a full and detailed response stating its position \n     and reasons for:\n       (1) Disagreeing with the employing office's allegation that \n     the matter, as proposed to be negotiated, is inconsistent \n     with any Federal law or Government-wide rule or regulation; \n     or\n       (2) Alleging that the employing office's rules or \n     regulations violate applicable law, or rule or regulation or \n     appropriate authority outside the employing office; that the \n     rules or regulations were not issued by the employing office \n     or by any primary national subdivision of the employing \n     office, or otherwise are not applicable to bar negotiations \n     under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA; or that no \n     compelling need exists for the rules or regulations to bar \n     negotiations.\n       (b) The response shall cite the particular section of any \n     law, rule or regulation alleged to be violated by the \n     employing office's rules or regulations; or shall explain the \n     grounds for contending the employing office rules or \n     regulations are not applicable to bar negotiations under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA, or fail to meet the \n     criteria established in subpart B of this part, or were not \n     issued at the employing office headquarters level or at the \n     level of a primary national subdivision.\n       (c) A copy of the response of the exclusive representative \n     including all attachments thereto shall be served on the \n     employing office head and on the employing office's \n     representative of record in the proceeding before the Board.\n     Sec. 2424.8 Additional submissions to the board.\n       The Board will not consider any submission filed by any \n     party, whether supplemental or responsive in nature, other \n     than those authorized under Sec. 2424.2 through 2424.7 unless \n     such submission is requested by the Board; or unless, upon \n     written request by any party, a copy of which is served on \n     all other parties, the Board in its discretion grants \n     permission to file such submission.\n     Sec. 2424.9  Hearing.\n       A hearing may be held, in the discretion of the Board, \n     before a determination is made under 5 U.S.C. 7117(b) or (c), \n     as applied by the CAA.

LEIGHTON W. SMITH, JR., USN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional American hero and one of Alabama's favored sons, Adm. \nLeighton W. Smith, Jr. Recently concluding his 34 years of service in \nthe U.S. Navy, Admiral Smith has served this Nation as a man of honor, \nintegrity, and great courage. It is this leadership which has led our \nforces through many challenges, most recently in Bosnia.\n  On April 4, 1994, Admiral Smith assumed command of Allied Forces \nSouthern Europe, Commander Joint Task Force Provide Promise, and \nCommander U.S. Naval Forces Europe. Twenty eight hours later, under his \ncommand, NATO conducted its first ever air-to-ground combat operations \nnear Gorazde, Bosnia. On numerous occasions between that April and \nAugust, 1995, NATO air forces supported the U.N. forces in Bosnia with \nclose air support and air strikes. Simultaneously, as Commander Joint \nTask Force Provide Promise, he continued to oversee airland and airdrop \nsupport to the U.N. refugee program in Bosnia, saving thousands of \nlives.\n  As tensions continued to rise in the fall of 1995, Admiral Smith \ndirected Operation Deliberate Force, NATO air operations against \nBosnian Serb targets. These successful operations brought the warring \nparties to the peace accords in Dayton that November.\n  In December 1995, Admiral Smith assumed a fourth command hat--\nCommander Peace Implementation Forces, NATO's first ever ground \noperation entrusted with implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement. The \nJFOR became nearly 60,000 strong from 34 different countries. The \nmission was to create a militarily secure environment in order to build \npeace in a country which had been devastated from three and a half \nyears of war.\n  Prior to Admiral Smith's most recent outstanding service, his record \nspeaks to the numerous challenging situations he has faced and \novercome. He was directly involved in operations in support of our men \nand women in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. This included directing combat \noperations into Iraq, the evacuation of civilians from Liberia and \nhumanitarian support for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. As the \nDeputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations, \nAdmiral Smith was a major contributor to Navy staff reorganization and \nthe development of the naval strategy for the 21st century.\n  Throughout his Naval career, Admiral Smith has received numerous \nawards including two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, the Navy \nDistinguished Service Medals and three Legion of Merits, among others.\n  Whether you know him as Leighton, Smitty, Snuffy or Snoofoir, the \nAdmiral is a down-home man of grit and tenacity who has committed \nhimself fully to the duties associated with service. While his easy-\ngoing humor may be disarming, Admiral Smith has the tenacity of a pit \nbull. He will tell you pig-farming stories from his youth and how he \nmade the upper 95 percent of his class at the Naval Academy look good, \nwhile simultaneously going toe to toe with our adversaries in order to \nprotect, defend and support our men and women in uniform. His honor and \nintegrity have anchored those who have had the privilege of serving \nwith him through both internal turmoil and international instability.\n  On his retirement, my wife and I extend our personal wishes to \nAdmiral Smith, his wife Dottie and their three children, Leighton III, \nPage, and Dee Dee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12077-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12077-S12080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SOME DEPARTING THOUGHTS ON OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this is one of a series of general policy \nspeeches I am delivering as my tenure in the Senate draws to a close. I \nwill focus here on national defense and foreign policy issues--what my \npriorities have been as a Senator, where we stand in terms of our \npreparedness, and what the future might bring. It is not my intent here \nto be entirely comprehensive, for that would necessitate far more time \nthan we realistically have. Instead, what I want to do here is simply \nto look back over my 18 years in the Senate and draw upon specific \ndebates, crises, decisions, programs, and legislative efforts to \nreflect upon where we were when I came here, where we are now, and \nwhere we might go tomorrow, after I am again a private citizen.\n  First, I wish to emphasize that we as a nation should be grateful \nthat we face no immediate threat to our borders from foreign military \npowers. I am particularly proud that I have played some role in \nrebuilding our Armed Forces and military strength during the aftermath \nof the Vietnam war. This commitment on the part of our Nation \ncontributed substantially to the collapse of the old Soviet Union and \nits Communist philosophy. In my opinion, it was probably the major \nreason. This commitment proved itself again during the Persian Gulf \nwar.\n  With my own experiences in World War II and observations since that \ntime, I have felt compelled that we must at all times endeavor to \nobtain lasting peace, and that the primary road to achieving this goal \nis through military strength.\n  It is often stated on this floor of the U.S. Senate that for the \nfirst time in decades there is no Soviet missile targeted at the United \nStates. In general, we are fortunate that our national security and \ndefense policy are no longer focused on a single massive Soviet \nadversary. But, in other ways, our decisions are now far more complex, \nfor they must take into account far more players, some of whom may not \nbe clearly identifiable. Moreover, I believe the United States needs to \ncontinue the development of certain initiatives originally intended to \nrespond to the Soviet military threat. Although we no longer need to \nfear a nuclear superpower, other countries now have access to Soviet \nweapons. Many countries also have achieved the technological capability \nto produce nuclear weapons and\n\n[[Page S12078]]\n\nother weapons of mass destruction. We still face the threat of an \naccidental launched missile with no reliable means of defending the \ncontinental United States.\n  Former President Reagan deserves a great deal of credit for pursuing \nhis Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983. SDI has faced tough \nopposition from its inception. I have fought with many of my colleagues \nto fund the program in the Senate. In 1984, we managed to save the \nprogram and, in fact, the American Security Council, then-majority \nleader Howard Baker, and the President credited me with swaying the \ncritical votes to save funding for that year. I will always remember \nthe President phoning me and saying ``Bless you. Bless you.'' It has \nremained a difficult task to continue to provide research and \ndevelopment funds for this program. In 1989, changing relations with \nthe former Soviet Union continued to fuel the opponents of the program \nand debate has continued into the post-cold-war era.\n\n  I feel that we must continue our efforts here in Congress to deploy \nan antiballistic missile system. And in my opinion, we should do it in \nevolutionary stages. The space-based laser incarnation of the \nantiballistic missile program must have continued research technology \nfor the future. Today, we have the technology to develop and deploy a \nmissile system to defend against an attack or accidental launches. We \nshould develop and utilize that technology.\n  Actually, I advocated this position some time before President Reagan \ncalled for the development of the SDI program. In fact, in a meeting \nwith him, I urged him to call for such a program. When the President \nestablished an inter-agency panel to recommend the best way to proceed \nwith the strategic defense initiative, I lobbied for this approach, and \nwas quite pleased to learn that the panel reached the same conclusion. \nIn later years, I introduced amendments that would require the focus of \nthe strategic defense initiative to the deployment of ground-based \nsystems first. Then, as now, we need a ground-based technology rather \nthan a space-based system, like Brilliant Pebbles. The ground-based \nsystem proved itself in a theater concept during the Persian Gulf war.\n  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty has been both a consideration and a \nlimitation in the deployment of this technology. I called for \nreconsideration of the ABM Treaty with the Soviets before it came up \nfor review in 1982 while the nuclear arms race was ongoing. It seems to \nme a wiser approach to develop weapons that will be used only in a \ndefensive nature. More recently, I urged the immediate deployment of a \nsingle antiballistic missile site that would be considered treaty \ncompliant, and I have strongly advocated negotiations to allow the \ndeployment of multiple ABM sites. Ultimately, the Congress hammered out \na compromise the President could accept and which complied with the \ntreaty to allow an unspecified number of sites to be deployed in the \nyear 2003.\n  Since the very early days, when critics labeled the strategic defense \ninitiative as an absurdly futuristic plan, public opinion of ABM \ntechnology has changed. A poll last year indicated that 90 percent of \nthe American people believe that the United States should develop a \nmissile defense system. The Congress and the President of the United \nStates have the support of the people, the technology to accomplish \nthis and the means to deploy these systems. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues in this Congress and future Congresses to not let this \ninitiative die.\n  Mr. President, in order to continue the preeminence of the U.S. \nmilitary strength, I believe we need to continue with the development \nof smart weapons technology connected directly or indirectly to \nstrategic defense. A few examples of programs I have supported over the \nyears include the ASAT [Anti-Satellite Missiles], THAAD and other ABM \ntechnology.\n\n  Even though the United States is preeminent in military technology, \nwe must maintain a large and well-prepared conventional military force. \nThroughout my Senate tenure, I have always been a proponent of the \nAmerican arms buildup. President Carter called for NATO nations to \nincrease its military spending by 3 percent, which I supported. This \nwas the first step toward rebuilding our military. In 1980, I pushed \nfor increased defense spending because I feared that the Soviets had \nsurpassed us in many ways, including conventional weaponry, chemical \nwarfare, and most importantly, trained manpower. In the following years \nof President Reagan's two terms, I consistently supported his efforts \nto increase national security.\n  More recently, I have urged a slowing to our military cutbacks. I \nsupported President Clinton's decision to seek higher defense spending \nlevels to deal with increasing need for the U.S. involvement in world \naffairs, including Haiti, Somalia, Rwanda and Kuwait.\n  The conventional forces of the United States have assumed an \nadditional role during my time in the Senate. In order to cope with the \nnumber of small-scale threats around the world, our Nation desperately \nneeds to maintain its quick-strike capabilities. I first advocated this \ntype of force during the Iranian hostage crisis. At that time, it \nbecame obvious to everyone that the United States could no longer rely \non its nuclear arsenal to combat the increasing number of brush fires \naround the world. We in Congress must make a commitment to see that the \nmen and women in the Armed Forces have the training, the support, and \ntechnology that is deserving of the commitment these young people have \nmade to protect our interests all around the world.\n  Manpower remains a significant element of our national defense \nposture. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979, I \nsupported the reinstatement of draft registration. I have also \nadvocated increased compensation for the men and women in the military. \nThe quality of our forces is essential to our security. Although I \nopposed including women in the draft and in combat, I have fought to \nensure the military uses all of its personnel to the best of their \nabilities. I joined in introducing a bill in 1979 to end sexual \ndiscrimination in promotions, particularly in the Navy and Marine \nCorps.\n  The Navy may well be the most important element of our conventional \nforces. When I first came to the Senate, the United States had two \nocean naval fleets. The Iranian Hostage Crisis, however, led me to \nbelieve that the United States needed to maintain a presence in the \nIndian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. I advocated this position at the \ntime, but of course, it is even more important now. This region will \ncontinue to be a focal point in defense and foreign policy for years to \ncome. We must be prepared to address unforseen developments in other \nregions as well.\n  In 1981, I was alarmed to learn that our Navy had halved its strength \nsince 1969. President Reagan and Secretary John Lehman's leadership \ncalled for the creation of a 600-ship Navy. This buildup turned out to \nbe an effective tool in the cold war and we cannot allow too large a \nreduction in our current naval force. We need to maintain the ability \nto convey our Forces around the world and provide the strike potential \nof our carrier groups. For these reasons, I was particularly proud to \nsupport naming a carrier after President Reagan.\n\n  I also believe that the United States must continue to focus on \ncontinuing to improve air forces. Air superiority on the battle field \noften times determines the outcome before the ground forces are ever \ndeployed. The United States must continue to upgrade its fleet of B-52 \nbombers. In fact, this was an issue in my first campaign. I have been a \nsupporter of the B-1 bomber since 1979, because even then, the 30-year \nold B-52's needed replacement. Stealth technology was still on the \ndesign table and this aircraft in my opinion was the most reasonable \nalternative. Opponents argued that the United States did not need a \nmanned bomber; however, I think the need was proven in the Persian Gulf \nwar. We must continue to embrace the stealth technology and improve \nupon it to maintain our air superiority.\n  In this post Communist world, weapons proliferation still poses \nserious threat to our national security. For this reason, I would like \nto commend my colleagues, Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar, for their \nhard work to prevent the distribution of the weapon stockpile of the \nformer Soviet Union. We must also not lose focus and emphasis on the \nUnited States need to keep control over its own technology. I have \nopposed certain nuclear sales in\n\n[[Page S12079]]\n\nthe past, such as President Carter's uranium fuel deal with India. \nIndia was, in my opinion, a blatant violator of the 1978 Nuclear \nNonproliferation Act and I believe India also violated the 1963 act by \nusing United States supplied nuclear fuel to build a bomb. I tried to \nprevent similar sales by joining in offering an amendment to the Export \nAdministration Act of 1984 to require nuclear regulatory commission \nguidelines in fuel sales.\n  Chemical warfare is another increasing threat to American security. \nIn 1980, I attended a briefing in Fort McClellan, Alabama and learned \nthat the Soviets greatly outmatched our defensive chemical \ncapabilities. The Soviets had significantly more trained specialists \nand their regular troops were much better equipped and informed. \nFurthermore, reports indicated that the Soviets were willing to use \noffensive chemical weapons, and in fact, they had delivered chemical \nattacks in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, and Yemen. I was pleased that \nSecretary Haig called attention to this threat in 1981.\n  To respond to this threat, I supported the construction of a binary \nchemical weapons facility at Fort Smith, AR. My recollection is that \nthen-Vice President Bush voted to break the tie vote on this issue \nafter I cast the tie vote. The existing U.S. chemical weapons dated \nback 30 years; I felt they were obsolete and relatively ineffective. \nThe threat of chemical warfare has not lessened. In fact, the potential \ndanger is probably even greater now, as we learned in the gulf war. \nIncreasing terrorism, like the Tokyo subway bombing, also underscores \nthe need for chemical weapon response readiness. In order to address \nthis problem, the Senate passed a number of chemical weapons provisions \nin its antiterrorism bill last year, including an amendment I offered \nto criminalize the possession of toxic nerve gas, which I was shocked \nto learn was not illegal to possess.\n\n  With this in mind, I have fought since 1990 to keep Fort McClellan \nand its chemical school open. Senator Shelby, Congressman Browder, and \nofficials from Calhoun County and the Federal Affairs committee at the \nCalhoun County Chamber of Commerce headed by Gerald Powell deserve a \ntremendous amount of credit for their efforts to advocate our position \nbefore the Base Closure Realignment Commission.\n  Even though the Defense Department last year recommended the closure \nof this facility, the BRAC Commission twice recognized the need to keep \nthis facility open and viable. General Schwartzkoff offered a ringing \nendorsement to the U.S. Senate of the live agent training and the \ncontinued operation of Fort McClellen. The General noted that chemical \ntraining had bolstered the morale of troops serving in the gulf armed \nwith the knowledge of dealing effectively with these deadly weapons. \nThe commander of British chemical training also argued that live agent \ntraining greatly increased confidence and morale. Even though the third \nBRAC Commission voted to close Fort McClellen--mistakenly, in my view--\nI still hold the conviction that the United States must continue vital \nchemical warfare defensive training and it must keep the live agent \ntraining in the chemical school at the same facility.\n  In order to maintain America's conventional forces at the highest \nlevel during a time of continued fiscal austerity and national debt, I \nwant to emphasize the necessity of keeping the Pentagon at its most \ncost effective. In 1981, I sponsored a measure to establish an \ninspector general for the Department of Defense. At that time, \nestimates indicated that the simple elimination of waste might cut \ndefense spending by nearly one-third. In 1983, Congress created the \noffice, but I thought it was a mistake to make the inspector general \naccountable to the Secretary of Defense rather than being an \nindependent official. I argued that an independent solution would have \nbeen more effective.\n  I have also been an advocate of consolidated development efforts \nwithin the Pentagon, as well as revolving door and contract guidelines \nto increase competition. I also fought for the establishment of a \ncentral procurement office at the Pentagon. My efforts were driven to \nsome degree by revelations made during judiciary subcommittee hearings \nheld in 1985. At these hearings, we learned that the Pentagon had lost \ncontrol of its spending, pouring hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of \ndollars into a single hammer or other simple item.\n  Another way of increasing the cost-effectiveness of our Armed Forces \nis maximizing efficiency through consolidation. I worked throughout my \ntime here to enact such a plan at Fort Rucker, AL. Beginning in 1979, I \nadvocated a plan to merge helicopter training from all four branches at \nthe fort, and continued my efforts during President Reagan's first \nyears in office. I urged the Defense Secretary and the OMB Director to \nadopt the plan, and solicited studies to examine its feasibility. \nSenator Shelby and I renewed this effort under President Clinton, but \nagain, we were unable to get the Department of Defense to carry out the \nimplementation. However, I remain firmly convinced that such \nconsolidation plans, if put into place across the country, are obvious, \ncommonsense ways to address wasteful duplication of effort.\n\n  Increased profit through defense conversion will also be a helpful \nmeans of saving money. To this end, I supported President Clinton's \ntechnical reinvestment project to provide grants for small firms to \nconvert from defense production to the development of technology with a \ndual-use, both civilian and military.\n  With regard to antiterrorism efforts, I believe the United States \nneeds to maintain training to cope with attacks now more than ever in \nits history. One facility which has served our antiterrorism goals well \nis the bomb school at Redstone Arsenal, AL. When I came to the Senate, \nthis school was the only facility of its type in the country. It was \nrun by the Army and funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance \nAdministration. Later, when the LEAA was eliminated, Congress decided \nto fund the school through the FBI. There was a gap in the funding for \nfiscal year 1981, and we succeeded in including a line-item \nappropriation for the school.\n  The importance of these programs only continues to increase. After \nthe Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Judiciary Committee held \nhearings to consider ways to prevent and combat terrorism in the \nfuture. We listened to testimony from the FBI director and officials \nfrom the Southern Poverty Law Center, among others. In fact, the \nbombing hit close to home for me personally, since just a little over 5 \nyears before, a terrorist mailed pipe bombs to four locations in the \nSouth. My close friend, Judge Bob Vance, died in one of these attacks. \nOf course, I strongly believe in the individual rights provided in the \nConstitution, but we must work to strike a balance which preserves \nthese rights, yet also prevents individual terrorist acts.\n  Espionage has also taken on a different form in today's world. We are \nnow faced with spies who embrace a new motivation--greed. They do not \nact out of ideology or beliefs, and have no goals but their own gain. I \nintroduced legislation in 1985 to address this new motivation. It would \nhave stripped any convicted spy of anything acquired through espionage, \nand it would have denied movie or book rights about treason.\n  Since then, the Aldridge Ames case has demonstrated that this problem \nis only growing. We cannot allow ourselves to think that espionage is a \nthing of the past, nor that it exists only as a remnant of the Cold \nWar. Instead, it will continue to increase, and we have as much or more \nto lose in the future if we cannot combat it effectively.\n  We need to keep a close eye on our intelligence community. When Ames \nwas finally caught, I learned that the FBI and CIA did not have access \nto his personal financial records. I introduced a bill to require \nfinancial disclosures from key intelligence officers at the CIA. I \nbelieve such a requirement would protect intelligence officers while \nalso preserving our security.\n\n  I also want to stress the importance of increasing our self-\nsufficiency in terms of energy consumption. In the past, events such as \nthe oil crisis in 1979-1980 have taught us that the United States is \ntoo heavily dependent on foreign countries for its defense materials. \nThose same countries which provide us with vital raw materials could \nbecome our adversaries. At that time, I\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\ncalled for contingency plans and investigation of the possibilities of \nutilizing our domestic resources, including the Alaska oil reserves. \nSince then, we have faced other energy scares, such as that which \ncontributed to the Persian Gulf war. There is no reason to believe that \nsuch crises will not recur, and I urge Congress to continue exploring \nalternatives to dependence on foreign energy sources.\n  Military alignments among nations will be a major consideration in \nthe future. One reason I supported the defense buildup in the 1980's \nwas to reassert the U.S. position among our allies, which needs to be \nsustained. The expansion of NATO into the former Eastern bloc remains a \nkey question of alignment. In 1993, NATO began to consider the \nadmission of new members, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic, but Russia's position was unclear. The fall of communism did \nnot bring a conflict-free Europe, but instead brought back some of the \nold alignments and hostilities that had existed before the two world \nwars. As chairman of the Senate delegation on the North Atlantic \nAssembly, I introduced a plan to provide specific guidelines for \ngetting nations ready for NATO membership pursuant to the Partnership \nfor Peace plan. Congressman Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, a vice chairman \nof the Assembly, joined me in this effort. Our plan calls for NATO \napplicants to demonstrate civilian control of the military and police, \nfree and open elections, policies against international terrorism and \ncrime, and other commitments desirable of NATO members. The plan also \nrequired the NAA's permanent committees to consider and report on any \nreform these countries might need to implement before NATO admission. I \nbelieve we need to be very cautious in the future about not treating \nNATO as a type of European United Nations, and remember that it is \nfirst and foremost a military alliance.\n  In my role as chairman and cochairman of the NAA Senate delegation, I \nhave also gained direct input from European parliamentarians on such \nmatters as lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. Many of these leaders \nfeared that a unilateral lifting of the embargo would cause a \nspillover. I argued that given the complexities of the war in Bosnia, \nthere was simply no good way to know what effect it might have. With \ngreat reservation, I ultimately supported an amendment in the Senate to \nlift the embargo only under the auspices of the U.N. and NATO.\n  While I firmly believe in keeping our military strong--the best in \nthe world--I also believe that reducing nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction should remain a top priority. In so doing, \nwe must again look at recent history as a guide. When President Carter \nsigned the SALT II Treaty in 1979, I had serious reservations about its \nprovisions. Could we rely on the Soviets to be honest about compliance? \nMore importantly, could we confirm their compliance? These questions \nand others weighed heavily on my mind, as they undoubtedly did on those \nof all involved. There were methods available to verify Soviet missile \ntests and other related activities, including telemetry, satellites, \nand radar. But, if our then-adversary violated the treaty, the problem \nof dealing with noncompliance remained.\n\n  At that time, I advocated tough diplomacy backed up by definitive \nintelligence information. I felt this was the only realistic way to \nproceed. Of course, that was easier to say than do. What would the \nSoviet reaction have been? Would we have been able to rely on our own \ntechnology and intelligence for confirmation? Would they view such a \nstand as provocative or threatening?\n  Another problem was the fall of the Shah of Iran. A number of our \nprimary detection stations were in Iran, and the CIA estimated that it \nwould take at least 5 years to recover what we had lost, due to the \ninstability there. Ultimately, the treaty died when the Soviet Union \ninvaded Afghanistan.\n  To make the point even more clear, look at the situation in 1991, \nwhen Presidents Bush and Gorbechev signed the START agreement. I was \nvery hesitant about ratifying that treaty. Its signing came shortly \nafter the attempted coup in August of that year. This kind of \ninstability would almost certainly come into play with other \nunpredictable nations who are becoming nuclear powers. In 1991, the \noutcome was favorable, but we cannot always bank on such an outcome.\n  When we do have to defend our vital national interests, economic \nsanctions and embargoes will continue to be an effective tool. I have \nusually supported sanctions over force, at least initially. I first \ncalled for the use of sanctions against Iran, after the hostage crisis \nbegan. I also introduced legislation to compensate the hostages from \nfrozen Iranian assets in the United States. Similarly, I would have \npreferred the use of sanctions against Haiti rather than the threat of \nforce.\n  But, we must be careful with the sanctions strategy, because it is \nnot always effective, and sometimes it hurts Americans as much as the \ncountry we are trying to influence. I felt this was the case with the \ngrain embargoes against the Soviet Union, which hurt United States \nfarmers more than the Government of the U.S.S.R. Generally speaking, we \nshould ensure the effectiveness of embargoes through a cooperative \ninternational effort.\n  Generally, I have been proud of the Senate for rallying behind the \nAmerican President whenever he has determined the necessity of using \nour Armed Forces. The finest example of this resolve came during the \nPersian Gulf deployment in the fall and winter of 1990-91. I was 1 of \n11 Democratic Senators to vote in favor of authorizing the use of force \nbefore the bombing began, although the entire Senate formally back \nPresident Bush after the hostilities began.\n\n  I have been consistent in embracing the philosophy of supporting the \nCommander in Chief, regardless of the party or what I might have felt \npersonally could have been done differently or better. I supported \nPresident Carter throughout the Iranian hostage crisis. There was \nnothing to be gained by second-guessing his decisions--even after the \nfailed rescue mission of April 1980. I felt this support was especially \nimportant given the Ayatollah's strategy of portraying a weak resolve \non our part. Along these lines, I was particularly horrified by Ramsey \nClark's kangaroo-court style probe of United States policy toward Iran, \nand pressed for a criminal investigation. I also supported the invasion \nof Grenada to protect American citizens and the removal of the corrupt \nManuel Noriega to protect our vital interests in the Panama Canal \nregion.\n  There have been other instances where I have been opposed to military \naction itself, but felt the President had the constitutional authority \nto initiate such action. Haiti was one example of this. I voted against \na resolution requiring the President to adhere to a waiting period, \nalthough I did not want to see United States troops sent to Haiti. \nAnother example was the deployment of ground troops in Bosnia, which I \ndid not view as serving our vital national interests. However, I did \nargue that it was important to unite behind the President once his \ndecision had been made and the troops had been deployed.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to urge the Congress to be \nextremely careful about cutting back our Armed Forces in the years to \ncome. Despite what we think of as a relatively stable world, the \nfuture, in reality, is very uncertain and unclear. The nature of \nthreats to our security is unfocused at this time. Tensions in Iraq \nhave again flared, and instability may return to other areas of the \nworld as well. Although world peace is our ultimate goal, it would be a \nserious mistake to allow ourselves to think we have reached that goal. \nThe tensions that remain all around the world dictate that we continue \nour military preparedness in a manner that will allow America to be \nvictors in any conflict that may arise with the fewest casualties \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12077-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12080-S12090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REFLECTIONS ON PROGRESS IN CIVIL RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, during my 18 years as a U.S. Senator, \nlegislation of all sorts and in all issue areas has come before this \nbody. Of course there were some issues I came to know best, sometimes \nbecause of the nature of my constituency, as was the case with \nagriculture and technology issues. But there are other topics the \nSenate addressed during this time which stand\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\nout in my mind for different reasons, such as judiciary and legal \nissues and national defense policy. Naturally, since I have a \nbackground in the law, I have a greater personal interest here than I \ndo some other areas. But, of all the judicial work the Senate has \ntackled during my 18 years, its accomplishments in the area of general \ncivil rights strike me as among its most commendable.\n  Since 1979, congressional action in the field of civil rights has \nbeen enormously significant. I think it would be appropriate to \nhighlight some of these issues and events.\n  Of all the bills relating to civil rights, perhaps first in my mind \nis the extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which passed during \nmy first term. The fair housing bill, which enforced the provisions of \nthe Fair Housing Act of 1968, also stands out. Another was the Civil \nRights Restoration Act of 1991, which ensured that discrimination would \nnot be tolerated in the workplace. But there were others, including the \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Holiday and Holiday Commission bills, the \nCivil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, the reauthorization of the Civil \nRights Commission, and the Congress' efforts to save the Legal Services \nCorporation from the Reagan administration's cuts.\n  When the Congress considered each of these bills, Members on both \nsides took positions reflecting very different philosophies. But I \nbelieve that the need to reconcile various points of view is the \nessence of progress in civil rights. For this reason, I am extremely \nproud of the Senate for working out the necessary accords to pass these \nbills.\n  In addition to these specific bills, I am also very proud of the \nSenate for its advice and consent role in nominations for the Federal \nJudiciary and executive positions that affected the civil rights \nmovement. During the time since my election, the Senate ensured the \ncontinued transition of the South from the 1950's into the next \ncentury. Many ills had yet to be addressed, and the Senate confirmed a \nnumber of individuals who will fight to resolve these ills and voted \ndown some who might have furthered them.\n  In 1980, the Senate confirmed the first black district judges in \nAlabama. The Congress also worked to preserve the legacy of several \njudges from Alabama who had accomplished much in the area of civil \nrights, including Justice Hugo Black, Judge Frank Johnson, and Judge \nRobert Vance. All of these men furthered the cause of racial progress.\n  When it came to nominations, I would also like to note that the \nSenate occasionally felt it had to oppose some nominees, because it \nfeared that these individuals might impinge on the enforcement of laws \nto protect individual rights. These nominees included some Federal \njudicial nominees as well as executive officials. But in each case, I \ndid my best to remain open-minded until all of the facts were available \nand the arguments had been made. I might best compare my view of a \nSenator's role in the confirmation process to that of a judge rather \nthan an advocate.\n  When it came to some of these bills and nominations, it happened that \nmy own personal perspective and conscience compelled me to vote \ndifferently than some of my constituents might have liked. This was \nparticularly true in some instances, including my very painful decision \nto oppose the special treatment extension of the insignia patent for \nthe Daughters of the American Confederacy, which I will discuss later.\n  My goal here is to reflect upon some of the major \nlegislation, nominations, and issues which have dominated the Senate's \ncivil rights debate since I have been here.\n\n\n            Grove City College Civil Rights Restoration Bill\n\n  In 1984, I supported the passage of a bill known as Grove City. \nFormally known as the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, it did not \npass until 1988. With this bill, the Congress essentially sought to \nrestore civil rights guaranteed under several major laws restricted by \nthe Supreme Court. It had a number of opponents among the religious \ncommunity, especially, since abortion became a major controversy \nsurrounding the bill. In fact, the Congress ultimately needed to \noverride a veto to pass the bill.\n  Grove City took its name from a February 28, 1984, Supreme Court \ndecision, Grove City College versus Bell. With this ruling, the Court \naltered the interpretation of title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972. It found that this law, which prohibited sex discrimination in \nfederally funded institutions, applied only to the particular program \nor activity directly receiving the funds. Therefore, the entire school \nwas not bound by the antidiscrimination language.\n  Perhaps the reason the Grove City case was so significant was its \npotential impact on three other civil rights laws. These laws were the \nCivil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination Act, and the Rehabilitation \nAct, all of which used practically the same language. The Court had \nclearly abridged the Government's rights and abilities to fight \ndiscrimination.\n  According to its stated purpose, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of \n1987 sought to restore the ``broad, institution-wide application'' of \nFederal antidiscrimination laws. It pertained to each of the four civil \nrights laws, and like its previous incarnations, it sought to redefine \n``program or activity.''\n  In 1988, Grove City became Public Law 100-259. But I wasn't \nnecessarily pleased that the fight had been so hard. I had tremendous \npolitical pressure on me to oppose it. Immediately after I voted for \nthe override, the vote was referred to as ``another nail in my \ncoffin.'' To put these thoughts in context, I received over 6,000 \ncontacts, including phone calls or letters from constituents who \ncriticized me for supporting the bill.\n  But I think that it was worth the fight. After its passage, the \nNational Black Law Journal characterized the bill in these terms:\n\n       The passage of S. 557 sends a clear signal: discrimination \n     is illegal and will be prohibited through broad enforcement \n     of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. Consequently, \n     the enactment of S. 557 closes a major loophole in our civil \n     rights laws and preserves two decades of hard-won civil \n     rights for all Americans.\n\n\n                         The Fair Housing Bill\n\n  Since my first year as a Senator in 1979, civil rights activists had \nbeen pushing the Congress for legislation to amend the 1968 Fair \nHousing Act, and I supported their efforts. However, a broad bill \nintended to enforce the provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 did \nnot pass the Congress until 1988.\n  My efforts in that first Congress included attaching a provision to \nthe bill to allow discrimination complaints to be heard by HUD \nadministrative law judges. A compromise version of this idea appeared \nin the final 1988 law.\n  In 1979, several national surveys spurred a House subcommittee to \npass a fair housing bill. HUD Secretary Harris testified that it was \nnecessary to improve the 1968 act. The act, she said, ``. . . defined \nand prohibited discriminatory housing practices but failed to include \nthe enforcement tools necessary to prevent such practices and provide \nrelief to victims of discrimination.''\n\n  A companion bill appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nthe summer of the next year, 1980. During its markups, the committee \nadopted several of my amendments. One would allow HUD discrimination \nsuits to be heard by administrative law judges. These judges would be \nappointed by a Fair Housing Review Commission authorized by the bill, \nand the President would appoint the commissioners. The Fair Housing \nReview Commission would have the authority to review and modify cases. \nThe second of my amendments would limit suits to individuals who \nactually sought fair housing and who felt they had been victims of \ndiscrimination.\n  By this time, the House had passed its version. Its supporters \nincluded the NAACP, the AFL-CIO, the UAW, the League of Women Voters, \nand the ACLU. President Carter was also among this group, calling the \nbill ``the most critical civil rights legislation before the Congress \nin years.''\n  It was the House bill which ultimately came to the Senate floor. It \nhad less luck in the Senate than the House, though; certain Senators \nled a filibuster which killed the bill.\n  Disagreement on the bill focused on two controversies, whether \ndiscrimination should be proven by results or intent, and whether cases \nshould be\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\nheard by administrative law judges or Federal judges and juries. Civil \nrights groups supported provisions requiring the results standard of \nproof; Senate opponents wanted proof of intent. But there did not seem \nto be any middle ground. With regard to the administrative law judge \nprovisions, Senator DeConcini, offered a compromise to allow jury \ntrials in some cases, but opponents were not receptive. This compromise \njust raised too many questions.\n  Unfortunately, we could not compromise that year, and the bill \nultimately died in a filibuster.\n  In 1988, we finally passed a broad bill, H.R. 1158, to address the \nproblem of racial and other discrimination in housing. This bill became \nPublic Law 100-430, to amend the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n  The new law authorized HUD to penalize those who discriminated in \nhousing sales and rentals. In addition to prohibitions on \ndiscrimination according to race, color, religion, sex, or national \norigin specified by the 1968 act, the new law included protections for \nthe handicapped and families with young children. According to \nCongressional Quarterly, this was the first time the Congress protected \nthese latter categories under its laws.\n  Before the passage of this new law, HUD only possessed the authority \nto mediate battles. The Justice Department could file suits in the case \nof discriminatory patterns, and individuals could bring their own \nsuits. But this bill authorized HUD to pursue suits on a victim's \nbehalf.\n  The final law included a compromise version of my administrative law \njudge scheme of the 96th Congress. It provided for cases filed by HUD \nto be heard in front of administrative law judges, if the parties \ninvolved chose to do so. Where compromise failed in 1980, however, the \n1988 law also provided a second option: if just one of the parties \nchose it, the case would be heard in a jury trial. The law required the \nparties to choose within 20 days.\n\n\n                        Voting Rights Extension\n\n  In 1982, the Congress passed a law to extend the Voting Rights Act of \n1965--H.R. 3112, Public Law 97-205. This new law contained four \nessential parts. First, it extended section 5 of the act, the major \nenforcement provision, for 25 years. This section, called the \npreclearance provision, required 9 States, including my own Alabama, \nand parts of 13 others to receive approval from the Department of \nJustice before they could change their election laws. Second, it \nallowed States that could prove a good voting rights record for the \nprevious 10 years to bail out of the preclearance section after 1984. \nBeginning that year, States desiring to bail out would have to prove \ntheir case before a Federal panel of three judges in Washington, DC. \nThird, the extension amended the permanent provisions of the 1965 act \nunder section 2 to make it easier to prove violations. Previously, \nintent to discriminate had to be proven, but under the new law, it \nwould only be necessary to prove that laws had resulted in \ndiscrimination. Last, the new law also extended bilingual requirements \nunder the act for 10 years.\n\n  But passing this bill was not easy. It had opponents in the Senate \nand in the administration. In fact, the chairman of the Senate \njudiciary committee was not friendly to its passage. Compromise was \nrequired to save the bill, and I worked behind the scenes, especially \nwith Senator Dole, to find a proposal which would be acceptable to the \ncommittee.\n  Congressional Quarterly has since noted that Senator Dole and I \nplayed deciding roles on the Senate judiciary committee. As the bill \ncame out of subcommittee, the publication noted that divisions on the \nfull committee left us ``* * * holding the balance of power.'' Seven \nmembers were publicly against the bill, and nine were for it. The \ncommittee had 18 members at the time, and a tie of nine to nine would \nhave resulted in a failure to report the bill to the full Senate.\n  I had an agreement with Senator Dole to work together to forge a \ncompromise which would get committee approval, but not to publicize my \nbehind-the-scenes activity. The reason for my reluctance to receive any \ncredit was due to the fact that this was an unpopular bill with white \nvoters in Alabama, particularly in Mobile.\n  Notably, Senator Denton, from Alabama, was also a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, but he opposed the bill. On June 22, the Talladega \nDaily Home printed an editorial contrasting our positions. ``The next \ntime he comes before Alabama voters to be re-elected or retired,'' it \nread, ``U.S. Senator Howell Heflin may have a problem explaining \nsatisfactorily his vote to extend the so-called voting rights act for \nanother 25 years.'' About Denton, who opposed the bill, the editorial \nwrote he ``won't have the same problem.''\n  And on May 6, the Mobile Register printed an editorial which \ncondemned the compromise, writing that it was no compromise at all; \ninstead, the Register called it ``probably the most discriminatory \nlegal garbage to ever hit Congress.'' This editorial called on me to \nlead a filibuster of the bill for Alabama and particularly Mobile. The \nRegister wrote that, in light of Mobile versus Bolden, the Voting \nRights Extension would allow any Federal judge to change local \ngovernments' election laws at a whim.\n  As I mentioned earlier, section 2 of the 1982 extension made it \neasier to prove violations by requiring proof of results rather than \nintent. This revision would effectively overturn a 1980 Supreme Court \ndecision, Mobile versus Bolden, upholding the intent requirements.\n  It was this provision, known as the results test, which first snagged \nthe bill in the Senate committee; the constitution subcommittee refused \nto incorporate the provision in its March mark-up. President Reagan's \nAttorney General told the panel that the administration was opposed to \nthe new provisions.\n  During this markup, the Senate subcommittee extended section 5, the \nenforcement provisions, for 10 years. But by contrast, the House \nversion of the bill extended section 5 indefinitely. Again, the \nAttorney General supported the Senate subcommittee's move, testifying \nthat the administration opposed a longer extension.\n  Notably, in the month following this subcommittee vote, U.S. District \nJudge Virgil Pittman of Alabama issued an revised opinion on Mobile \nversus Bolden declaring that Mobile had discriminated against blacks \nbased on the results test. This decision, based on results, bolstered \nthe case of civil rights groups who supported the bill provisions under \nsection 2.\n  With these revisions, the bill then came to the full Senate \ncommittee, whose members began to align for or against the extension. \nAs I mentioned above, nine members supported the House version and \nseven opposed it; leaving Dole and me in the middle to work out \nsomething the whole committee could accept.\n  On May 4, the committee passed our compromise version of the bill, \nwith only four Senators voting against it. This compromise included \nchanges to section 2's results language to specify its meaning. Taken \nfrom a 1973 Supreme Court case, White versus Register, the final \nversion declared that a violation could be proved:\n\n       * * * ``if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is \n     shown that the political processes leading to nomination or \n     election in the State or political subdivision are not \n     equally open to participation.\n\n  The compromise also extended section 5 for 25 years, rather than 10, \nas the administration and some Senators wanted, or permanently, as the \nHouse wanted.\n  Still in the way, however, was a filibuster to stop the bill. But the \nSenate voted it down. In the end, the Senate amended the House bill to \nalign it with its own compromise. The House accepted the Senate \namendments on June 23, by unanimous consent.\n\n\n                 The Martin Luther King Federal Holiday\n\n  In my first month as a Senator, I became a joint sponsor of a bill to \nestablish a Federal holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nThat bill, however, did not become law, and it was not until 1983 that \nwe were able to establish the holiday. In 1983, I fully supported its \npassage-H.R. 3706; Public Law 98-144.\n  During the 1983 debate, the measure became the victim of a filibuster \nled by Senator Jesse Helms. According to Congressional Quarterly, \nSenator Helms objected to King's ``action-oriented Marxism,'' and \nalleged that King had connections to the communist party. These claims \nseemed to me to be without merit.\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\n  When the Senate began consideration of the holiday measure, I voted \nto end the filibuster, and I opposed amendments which would effectively \nhave killed the bill. However, there were two amendments I found to be \nin line with my own thinking. They were offered by Senators Randolph \nand Boren to require that the King, Washington, and Columbus holidays \nbe held on the actual dates of the events. In fact, I cosponsored \nBoren's amendment, and after that amendment failed, I signed onto a \nbill to serve the same purpose. My reasons for supporting this \ncondition were the cost of a new holiday--the holidays would \noccasionally fall on Saturdays and Sundays, saving a great deal of \nexpense--and I also wanted to ensure the proper observance of \nsignificant historical events. Dr. King's birthday is a significant \ndate in the history of civil rights in this country, and it is most \nfitting to remember its actual date.\n  The following year, Congress passed a bill establishing a Martin \nLuther King Holiday Commission to encourage ceremonies for the first \ncelebration of the holiday--H.R. 5890; Public Law 98-399. The bill \nmandated a 3-member panel to be funded by donations.\n  Five years later, I cosponsored a bill to make the Martin Luther King \ncommission permanent. The bill became law--(H.R. 1385, Public Law 101-\n30,--and it expanded the commission's role to include the promotion of \nracial equality and nonviolent social change. Again, when this bill \ncame to the Senate floor, a number of amendments effectively to kill it \nwere offered, and I opposed them all. However, I did support an \namendment to bar the Commission from encouraging civil disobedience.\n  I joined Senator Sarbanes as a sponsor in support of four different \nbills, S. 322 in the 100th Congress, S. 619 in the 101st Congress, S. \n239 in the 102d Congress, and S. 27 in the 103d Congress, to set aside \na piece of Federal land in the District of Columbia for the Alpha Phi \nAlpha Fraternity to build a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nHowever, these bills did not pass.\n\n\n                Funding for Historically Black Colleges\n\n  I am especially proud of my efforts to authorize funding for the 1890 \nland grant colleges, including the Tuskegee Institute--now Tuskegee \nUniversity--and Alabama A in my home State of Alabama. Even though \nthese land grant colleges date to the 19th century, they had been \nlargely ignored until the late 1970's. I consider that this fact \nrepresents a great waste; certainly these institutions deserve equal \ntreatment, and I believe they are, properly funded, a valuable asset to \nthe Nation in the field of agricultural research.\n  First, I would like to give a brief history of the African-American, \n1890 land-grant colleges. In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the first \nMorrill Act, which established the basis for land-grant colleges. These \nwould be established by the States to educate their citizens in \nagriculture, home economics, and other practical subjects.\n  However, the Southern States did not provide funding for black \ncolleges under this law, so the Congress passed a second Morrill Act in \n1890 specifically to support the African-American institutions. From \nthis history comes the term ``1890 Land-Grant Institutions,'' \nspecifically applied to these historically African-American colleges. \nHowever, the agriculture department did not begin earnestly to fund the \n1890 land-grant colleges until 1966. That year, Assistant Secretary Dr. \nGeorge Mehren asked the National Academy of Sciences to suggest an \nallocation of $283,000 for research at these colleges--under Public Law \n89-106.\n  In 1866, Lincoln University in Missouri became the first such \nhistorically black land-grant college.'' By 1976, there were 16 such \nuniversities. Of these 16, there are 2 in Alabama, the Tuskegee \nUniversity and Alabama A University.\n  The Alabama State Legislature created the Tuskegee Institute in 1881; \nit was then called The Tuskegee State Normal School for the Training of \nNegro Teachers. Booker T. Washington became Tuskegee's first President \nand served until he died in 1915.\n  During these first years, the State legislature appropriated $3,000 \nfor the institution and authorized it a single teacher. The school \nremained public until the State legislature granted its board the power \nof governance in 1893, but Tuskegee Institute continued to receive \nState funds even though they obtained private status.\n  In 1897, the legislature also established ``The Tuskegee State \nExperiment Station.'' George Washington Carver became its director and \nserved until his death in 1943.\n  In 1899, the U.S. Congress granted the school 25,000 acres, and in \n1906, it established the formal extension program. In 1933, Tuskegee \nbecame a regionally accredited 4-year college, and in 1943 it opened \nits graduate schools. Accredited graduate programs now include \narchitecture, chemistry, dietetics, engineering, nursing, and \nveterinary science. Tuskegee's funding from grants remained nominal \nuntil 1972.\n  Alabama A University was founded in 1875 by an ex-slave named \nWilliam Hooper Councill. Originally, the Huntsville Normal School was \non West Clinton Street in Huntsville, the school moved to Normal in \n1890. After a decrease in enrollment, the institution was renamed in \n1919 the State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes and \nreduced to junior-level training.\n  During the subsequent years, the school lost its financial support \nand nearly fell apart, but in 1927 Dr. J.F. Drake became its new \npresident and oversaw expansion of the grounds and the return to 4-year \nstatus. It was not until 1962, during the tenure of President Dr. \nRichard D. Morrison, that the school became a university, with its own \ngraduate school.\n  With this history of great difficulty as well as great leadership in \nmind, I hold myself honored to have worked with these institutions. I \nam particularly proud of efforts to create the Chappie James Preventive \nHealth Center at the Tuskegee Institute, and to pass perhaps the first \nserious funding authorization for the 1890 black land grant colleges.\n\n  During the first summer I was a Senator, I introduced a resolution to \nauthorize the construction of the General Daniel ``Chappie'' James \nMemorial Center for Preventive Health at the Tuskegee Institute. When I \nintroduced the bill on the Senate floor, I noted that it was the first \npreventative health center in the south, maybe the country. I also \nstated, proudly, that it would become a museum of the general's \nmemorabilia.\n  Furthermore, I argued that the dedication was especially fitting \nbecause General James, the first African-American to rise to a four-\nstar rank in the U.S. Air Force, had been a beneficiary of Tuskegee's \nprograms years before. Tuskegee established the first training program \nfor black pilots, and it was here that General James learned the skills \nwhich furthered his career.\n  Ultimately, we succeeded in passing the Chappie James Center bill as \na rider to the 1980 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of \n1965. My amendment authorized $6 million for the center, and required \nthat it be constructed at the Tuskegee Institute.\n  In May 1981, I introduced a bill to help all of the 1890 land grant \ncolleges. Its language specified that the 1890 land grant colleges \nreceive money for the purchase of equipment and land, and the planning, \nconstruction, alteration, or renovation of buildings to strengthen \ntheir capacity for research in the sciences of food and agriculture. \nThat year, the House passed an identical companion bill unanimously.\n  As I have said many times, the 1890 schools had not, to that point, \nhad the authorization to receive the benefit of the equipment and \nfacilities they needed to be competitive. They had nothing from \nCongress to rely on, even though the Congress gave these historically \nblack institutions the same mission as the 1862 schools mandated under \nthe Morrill Act. Therefore, we owed them the means to fulfill that \nmission, research and development in the field of agriculture for the \nbenefit of the whole country.\n  As with the Chappie James measure, this authorization passed as a \nrider, this time to the 1981 farm bill, Public Law 97-98). This \namendment authorized $10 million annually to each of the historically \nblack land-grant colleges through 1986--a total of $50 million for \neach.\n\n\n                 Black Alabamians Become Federal Judges\n\n  In the spring of 1979, then-Senator Donald Stewart and I set out to \nfind five U.S. district judges to fill vacancies in the State of \nAlabama. In order to do this, we formed two committees\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\nand clarified our intentions in charters for each. We called the first \nthe Federal Judicial Nominating Commission of Alabama, and we called \nthe second the Alabama Women and Minority Group Search Committee.\n  First, we intended to seek out the most qualified individuals in the \nState. This was the charge of the first committee. But we also sought \nto find qualified minorities to fill the slots. This task was the \ncharge of the second panel, which would advise the first.\n  Through these efforts, two blacks were selected, and President Carter \nformally nominated them both. These men were U.W. Clemon, for Alabama's \nnorthern Federal district, headquartered in Birmingham, and Fred Gray, \nfor the State's middle Federal district, headquartered in Montgomery. \nU.W. Clemon had become a prominent Alabama State senator, and Fred Gray \nwas a prominent lawyer who had served in many posts. He was perhaps \nmost widely known as Rosa Parks' lawyer.\n  Although the hearings were not easy, the Senate confirmed U.W. Clemon \nthe next year, and he became the first African-American Federal judge \nin Alabama. Fred Gray's nomination, however, did not survive the \nconfirmation process. In his place, I recommended Myron Thompson, \nanother black, who was confirmed.\n  As I said many times during this process, I believe that it is \nabsolutely essential for blacks to serve in Federal courts. In the \ncommittee hearings on our recommended nominees, and on the floor after \ntheir confirmation, I stated that I believe we must make up for years \nof injustice in this country. For many long years, blacks were excluded \nfrom the Federal judicial nominating process. True equality under the \nlaw cannot be achieved under such a system. All Americans must feel \nthey will be treated fairly by the Federal courts, but if certain \ncitizens are precluded from serving on the bench, the courts cannot \ngive the perception of fairness.\n\n\n                   Civil Rights Commission Extension\n\n  In 1983, authorization of the Commission on Civil Rights expired, and \nthe Congress set about passing a reauthorization. However, President \nReagan intruded, and he tried to restructure the commission for his own \npurposes.\n  In late May, Reagan announced he would replace three commissioners on \nthe panel--Mary Frances Berry, Bladina Cardenas Ramirez, and Rabbi \nMurray Saltzman. According to Congressional Quarterly, the President \nsought to remove these commissioners because they had criticized his \nadministration's policies. To replace them, the President announced \nthat he would appoint Morris Abram, John Bunzel, and Robert Destro. \nSome alleged that Reagan selected these replacements because they \nopposed affirmative action and busing.\n  President Reagan had clearly challenged the independence of the \ncommission. And the Senate Judiciary Committee responded by putting off \nthe votes on his new nominees. Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, deserves much credit for \nlobbying against Reagan's position.\n  In response, Reagan summarily fired the three commissioners he sought \nto replace. CQ wrote that a White House lobbyist admitted that Reagan \nfired these individuals because he could not get the votes for his own \nnominees. Both Houses of the Congress responded with concurrent \nresolutions declaring their intent to create a new commission whose \nmembers would be appointed by the Senate as well as the President. Dr. \nBerry and Ms. Ramierez went on to win a suit in the D.C. District Court \nwhich granted an injunction against Reagan's firings.\n  For my own part, I worked to save Mary Berry's seat through a \ncompromise which restructured the commission. During final action, the \nSenate accepted this compromise amendment, offered by Senator Specter, \nPublic Law 98-183. Under this compromise, Reagan would have four \nappointees, and the Congress would have four, two for each house. The \nCommission would therefore have two additional members. The compromise, \namong other things, also established that the President had to show \ncause for firings, and authorized funding for the Commission. In \nresponse to this last, the House restored funds it had cut from the \nappropriations bill.\n  But in the end, civil rights groups were angry to learn that Reagan \nhad backed off on an informal part of the compromise. He had promised, \nthey said, to reappoint two commissioners he had previously opposed, \nLouise Smith and Jill Ruckelshaus. Reagan, House Majority Leader \nMichel, and Senate Majority Leader Baker, ultimately refused to put \nthese commissioners on the panel.\n  Much to my own pleasure, though, the Congress saved Mary Berry's \nseat. She is now the chairman of the Commission.\n\n\n         Opposition to Various Nominees Affecting Civil Rights\n\n  As I stated before, I feel that the Senate's opposition to a number \nof nominees was as important as any of its other accomplishments. In \nthe South, some changes for the good occurred, and the Senate's work \nhelped achieve successes in the area of civil rights. It voted down \nsome individuals because of reasonable doubts concerning their \nimpartiality in carrying out the duties of the office for which they \nwere being nominated. These men included William Bradford Reynolds, \nJudge Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, Kenneth L. Ryskamp, William C. \nLucas, and Jefferson Sessions.\n\n  With regard to these nominations, my opposition was based on doubts--\ndoubts about qualifications and about their impartiality as to racial \nand civil rights matters. However, I always tried to maintain my sense \nof objectivity. I always tried to keep an open mind until the end of \nhearings, because I believe hearings are meaningless if Senators do not \nexamine the facts impartially, if they enter into the proceedings with \nprejudice. In fact, I have consistently articulated this view in my \nopening statements: We, as Senators, need to act as judges in the \nconfirmation process. I was often criticized as being indecisive \nbecause I withheld my decision until the end of committee \nconsideration. But, if I was to be fair to the nominee, then I had to \nassume a judge's role.\n\n\n                 William Bradford Reynolds' Nomination\n\n  In 1985, President Reagan nominated William Bradford Reynolds to \nbecome Associate Attorney General. This position, No. 3 in the Justice \nDepartment's hierarchy, carried with it the responsibility for all \nFederal civil matters.\n  Previously, Reynolds had been the Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division, and his record there earned him opponents among \nthe civil rights community. In fact, I based my own decision to oppose \nReynolds on what I knew of his record.\n  Examples of Reynolds' opponents included Benjamin Hooks, executive \ndirector of the NAACP; W. Gordon Graham, of the Birmingham city \ngovernment, who spoke for himself and Mayor Richard Arrington; William \nL. Taylor, director of the National Center for Policy Review; Judy \nGoldsmith, president of the National Organization for Women; and Marie \nFoster from Selma, who was involved in the civil rights movement in \nthat city during the 1960's. These individuals all testified very \ncritically on Reynolds' record, and they all told the committee that he \nhad worked to set back civil rights.\n  On June 27, 1985, we voted the nomination down in the judiciary \ncommittee, and it did not go to the floor. My vote decided the outcome.\n  On June 30, the Huntsville Times reported that this final meeting and \nthese votes involved ``plenty of gavel-banging and shouting as red-\nfaced senators fought bitterly over President Reagan's nomination for a \ntop Justice Department post.'' I waited until that time to cast my \nvote, but when I did, I said that I wasn't even certain I felt \ncomfortable with Reynolds in the position in which he was serving at \nthe time. I also said I would find out if the Senate could remove him. \nIn my view, he was deceptive, lacking in forthrightness, evasive, and \nmisleading during his testimony.\n\n\n                        Robert Bork's Nomination\n\n  Another individual I ultimately decided to vote against was Judge \nRobert Bork, nominated to become an Associate Justice on the Supreme \nCourt. I was somewhat disconcerted by comments he had made, \nparticularly with regard to rights guaranteed by the constitution--\nrights he said he did not see, but which had been seen by the courts \nand Congress on numerous occasions. Most important, though, in the end, \nI did not feel confident I knew what\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\nJudge Bork would do on the Supreme Court. Since the nomination was for \nlife, I just could not vote for Judge Bork.\n  President Reagan nominated Judge Bork, who was, at the time, serving \non the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1987. Bork's advocates argued \nthat he was a conservative judge who tended to defer to legislatures on \npolitical matters. But his opponents said that he was an activist, \nseeking to implement his own agenda. From this dispute, and others, the \nSenate entered into one of the most contentious confirmation debates of \nmy tenure.\n\n  Controversy developed because Bork had, in earlier statements and \nwritings, criticized the constitutionality of a number of Supreme Court \ndecisions affecting individual rights. He had argued for a restrictive \ninterpretation of the 14th amendment with regard to sex. Bork had also \ncriticized decisions which struck down laws because they impinged on \nindividual privacy, a right Bork had argued was neither explicitly nor \nimplicitly provided by the Constitution. The decisions he had cited \nincluded the striking of a Connecticut law which banned contraceptives, \nas well as the Roe versus Wade decision. Regardless of whether or not I \nagree with Roe versus Wade, I do believe in the right to privacy, and \nunlike Judge Bork, I do see it in the Constitution.\n  Notably, Bork had also written that the first amendment applied only \nto political speech in a 1971 law review article. He followed this with \na television statement in 1987 in which he said ``other kinds of \nspeech, speech about moral issues, speech about moral values, religion \nand so forth--all of those things feed into the way we govern \nourselves.''\n  During his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, we questioned \nBork on his earlier statements and decisions. Several of us argued that \nBork was trying to relax his image during these hearings. In fact, \nSenator Leahy called Bork's seemingly changing beliefs ``confirmation \nconversion.'' Uncertain of Bork's actual position, I cited Bork's \n``confirmation protestations'' when I stated my final decision.\n  I voted against the nominee in the Judiciary Committee, and I also \nvoted against him in the full Senate. I gave statements before that \ncommittee and on the floor reciting many of the reasons for my \nopposition to his confirmation. The bottom line was that I just did not \nknown how Bork would treat essential, fundamental rights in his \nrulings.\n  The debate over Judge Bork, I might note, was a particularly \nunpleasant one. The media became so involved and the attempts to \npoliticize the debate from both sides became so acidic, that I felt a \nparticular need to speak on the floor about the potentially damaging \neffects on the judiciary. But, of course, this type of public intensity \nhas surrounded other nominations since.\n  A number of mailing and telephone campaigns increased this political \nnature of the debate. I was even told that my own voice, or an \nimitation, was used in a telephone solicitation I certainly did not \nauthorize. The spill-over from the Bork nomination lingers to this day, \nand has affected other nominations since.\n\n\n                      Clarence Thomas' Nomination\n\n  In October 1991, I voted against confirmation of Supreme Court \nJustice Clarence Thomas' nomination. Although I reserved my judgment, \nas always, until the nominee had been given a chance to be heard, I \ncame out against Clarence Thomas well before I knew of Anita Hill's \nallegations. I just did not feel that Clarence Thomas was qualified, at \nthat time, to assume a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.\n  I do support a moderately conservative court. But I oppose a right-\nwing court which would embrace a regressive philosophy, which would \nattempt to rewrite or strike laws written to overcome years of racism \nin America. I strongly feared that Clarence Thomas would advocate such \nright-wing positions.\n  I also had reservations based on the contradictory nature of Thomas' \nstatements on his fundamental view of the law. He had made a number of \nstatements and written a number of articles before the hearings which \nthe committee called on him to explain. His answers, however, did not \nsatisfy me; they showed a man who had seemingly changed his essential \nperspective.\n  At the time, I did not know what the real Clarence Thomas was like or \nwhat role he would play on the Supreme Court, if confirmed. In fact, I \nwas very much concerned that Thomas' inconsistencies suggested either \nintentional deception or a lack of scholarly, considered thought.\n\n  One example of my specific reservations was the nominee's apparent \nshift in his view of natural law. Thomas had criticized the ``nihilism \nof [Oliver Wendell] Holmes,'' who rejected natural law. However, before \nthe committee, he rejected these earlier statements. He said he made \nthem ``in the context of political theory,'' and described himself as a \n``part-time political theorist.''\n  Thomas had also criticized the Brown versus Board of Education of \nTopeka, KS, decision. And when questioned, Thomas said that he had \nnever even discussed Roe versus Wade. I would not have opposed the \nnominee based on his position on this single case, whatever it may have \nbeen, but I found it extremely unlikely that Thomas had never discussed \nRoe versus Wade, a defining point in the laws of this country. In fact, \nI was not certain that he was being completely forthcoming, especially \nconsidering the polarizing nature of this particular case in Supreme \nCourt confirmations.\n  I was also deeply concerned about Thomas' advocacy for an activist \nSupreme Court which would strike down laws because they restrict \nproperty rights. Thomas advocated this position in a 1987 speech before \nthe Pacific Research Institute, citing the libertarian Stephen Macedo. \nI believe, though, that modern constitutional jurisprudence has moved \nbeyond the Lochner era which relied on natural law, and that individual \nrights are just as important as property rights, perhaps even more so. \nThe Supreme Court has long recognized congressional authority to \nregulate commerce. As I stated, according to the libertarian view, we \nwould have no laws to guarantee occupational safety and health, to \npreserve the environment, to protect consumers from unsafe food, to \nrequire airline safety, or to establish a minimum wage.\n  All of these concerns led me to doubts. I simply could not justify \nvoting for a nominee whose positions remained so enigmatic, \nparticularly when he had been nominated to the Supreme Court for life.\n  The peculiarities surrounding the nomination only increased after \nthat time. In early October, the public became aware that Anita Hill, a \nformer Thomas employee, had alleged that the nominee had made unwanted \nsexual advances and comments toward her over a number of years. I did \nnot know if Thomas, or Hill, were telling the truth, or if neither was \ntelling the complete truth.\n  I had not known about these allegations until after I made my initial \nstatement opposing Thomas. The afternoon after my speech, Chairman \nBiden informed me of the an FBI file which included the charges. I did \nvote against the committee motion to report the nomination favorably to \nthe floor, which failed in a tie, although I supported sending it to \nthe full Senate without a recommendation. But I had no reason, \nwhatsoever, to change my position; Thomas' record, testimony, and lack \nof qualifications were reason enough to oppose his confirmation.\n\n\n                     Jefferson Sessions' Nomination\n\n  On June 5, 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected President \nReagan's nomination of Jefferson Sessions to become a Federal district \njudge in Alabama. There were ten Republicans and eight Democrats on the \ncommittee. The vote for disapproval of his nomination was 10 to 8, with \ntwo Republicans voting against him.\n  Sessions was, at the time, a U.S. attorney in Alabama. Certain of my \ncolleagues on the committee criticized comments Sessions allegedly made \nagainst various civil rights organizations as well as favorable \ncomments made about the Ku Klux Klan. These comments, they argued, \nshowed a ``gross insensitivity'' to racial matters.\n  My decision to oppose Sessions was very difficult. Of course, he was \nfrom my home State of Alabama. Frankly, I just did not know whether he \nwould be a fair and impartial judge. My statement before the committee \nrecited that since this was a lifetime appointment, we should be very \ncautious about his fairness and impartiality.\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\n                      William C. Lucas' Nomination\n\n  In 1989, I voted against William C. Lucas' nomination to become the \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. Mr. \nLucas happened to be an African-American, and I do not believe I can \nstate strongly enough my belief in the substantive and symbolic \nimportance of nominating blacks to these positions. However, when I \nweighed the evidence, I found that Mr. Lucas simply was not qualified \nto head the Civil Rights Division.\n  Lucas had worked in the Civil Rights Division in 1963, had been in \nthe FBI, and he had been the Wayne County, MI--which includes Detroit--\nsheriff and county executive before President Bush nominated him to \nthis post. But he had only just begun to practice law, and he had never \nrepresented a client in court.\n  Lucas' lack of legal experience showed during the hearings. Lucas \ndownplayed the importance of recent Supreme Court decisions on civil \nrights laws, commenting ``I'm new to the law.'' And when the Chairman \nasked Lucas about his view on the recent trend in the Supreme Courts \ndecisions on civil rights laws he said, ``I have to answer as a \npolitician because I have not thought about the answer.'' Further, \nduring the hearings, a number of civil rights activists testified or \nsubmitted statements to the effect that Lucas was not qualified to fill \nthe position.\n  While he emphasized that he did not object to Lucas' views, Ralph G. \nNeas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \nopposed Lucas on his ``lack of civil rights and legal experience.'' \nElaine Jones, deputy director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, testified that, although her group initially wished to \nsupport Lucas, it found that he did ``not have the training and the \nbackground to litigate and understand the litigation process.'' Citing \nthe need for experience in Federal litigation, Drew Days, a professor \nat Yale Law School and a former holder of the position Lucas would \nfill, said Lucas' confirmation would ``be a frustration of the mission \nthat Congress envisioned when it created that office in 1957.'' William \nL. Taylor of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights testified for his \ngroup, noting his personal belief that Lucas did not meet the standards \nset by his organization. Arthur L. Johnson, president of the Detroit \nbranch of the NAACP said, ``We do not believe that he [Lucas] is \nsuitable for this highly specialized and important assignment where the \npublic interest is so sharply focused, and where the trust of black \nAmericans, and civil rights advocates in particular, should be sought \nand even enhanced.'' John H. Buchanan, Jr., of the People for the \nAmerican Way also argued that Lucas was ``inadequately qualified.''\n  On the other hand, some civil rights leaders supported Lucas. Dr. Joe \nReed of the Alabama Democratic Conference was one; Reed urged \nconfirmation because, at the time, there had been only one African-\nAmerican in the post. Another supporter was Alvin Holmes, the senior \nblack member of the Alabama House of Representatives. These men both \nnoted their belief that Lucas' opponents had based their views solely \non qualifications. A final example of Lucas' supporters was Father \nWilliam Cunningham, director of Focus HOPE of Detroit.\n  Congressional Quarterly reported on certain questions surrounded \nLucas' record, including brutality in the Wayne County sheriff's \ndepartment, a customs dispute, and exaggerations on his resume.\n  After hearing all of this information, I finally decided to vote \nagainst Mr. Lucas. I based my decision in large part on the importance \nof the position. The head of the Civil Rights Division perhaps has more \nresponsibility than any other single individual for ensuring the \nsecurity of our civil rights. The individual who assumes this role \nshould be well qualified to deal with the intricacies of the law.\n\n  Mr. Lucas, I believed, did not possess sufficient legal experience to \nundertake the task, and I cast the deciding vote against him. I argued \nthat, although his supporters and Mr. Lucas himself cited his \naccomplishments in Wayne County, the controversy surrounding them, \nincluding brutality in the sheriff's department, indicated to me that \nhis managerial abilities were also questionable. After the committee \nvote, Ralph Neas who had testified against Lucas, announced a success \nfor civil rights.\n\n\n                    Kenneth L. Ryskamp's Nomination\n\n  I cast the deciding vote against Kenneth L. Ryskamp of Florida, whom \nPresident Bush had nominated to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. This \ncircuit covers Florida, Georgia, and my home State of Alabama. \nPresident Bush actually nominated Ryskamp twice. The first time was in \n1990, and the Judiciary Committee tabled the nomination that year.\n  Ryskamp had been criticized by People for the American Way, a civil \nliberties group which found that he had ruled against more civil rights \nplaintiffs than any other judge nationwide. He had also belonged to a \ncountry club which had an implicit policy of discrimination against \nAfrican-Americans and Jews.\n  Also haunting Ryskamp was a specific case in which a number of \nAfrican-Americans in West Palm Beach, including those who had not been \nfound guilty of any crime, filed a complaint because they had been \nattacked by city police dogs. Although the jury had found the city, \nindividual police participants, and the former police chief guilty of \ncivil rights violations, Ryskamp threw out the conviction against the \ncity and the police chief. He said: ``It might not be inappropriate to \ncarry around a few scars to remind you of your wrongdoing in the past, \nassuming the person has done wrong.''\n  Nine Latin American members of the Florida State Legislature wrote a \nletter to express their belief that Ryskamp had ``* * * demonstrated \ninsufficient sensitivity to ethnic minorities and other groups who have \ntraditionally been the objects of discrimination.'' In my opposition to \nRyskamp, I weighed this information, and I concluded that, if the \nrepresentatives of such a large population felt they would not receive \njustice, Ryskamp could not dispense it. With regard to this last point, \nI believe it is important to note that these lawmakers were \nRepublicans, and they had no partisan motivation.\n\n\n                      Creation of the 11th Circuit\n\n  As a past chairman and now ranking member of the Judiciary \nsubcommittee which oversees court reform and judicial administration, \none of my great interests as a Senator has been that of improving and \nstreamlining judicial procedure and process. In June of 1980, I \nintroduced a bill to divide the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals into two \ncourts. On October 1, the Congress passed, by voice vote in both \nchambers, the House version of the bill to divide the circuit. This \nbill became Public Law 96-452.\n  At the time, this circuit included Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nGeorgia, Florida, and Alabama; this legislation broke off Georgia, \nFlorida and Alabama to create the new 11th Circuit, and the others \nremained as the new fifth circuit.\n  The split had been considered several times before, but that year, I \nintroduced the legislation in response to a request made by the court's \njudges. This request came to me as a formal petition, signed by all \ntwenty-four judges sitting on the court. Among these were Frank \nJohnson, Joseph Hatchett, the first African-American on the court, and \nBob Vance. Judge Johnson became the court's spokesman for the split \nduring hearings on the matter in the House of Representatives.\n  The main purpose of the bill would be to promote judicial efficiency. \nIndividual judges in the circuit were burdened by an excessively large \ncaseload. Further, the entire court had accrued the largest ``en banc'' \ncaseload in U.S. judicial history.\n\n  In the past, civil rights groups had opposed the split because, given \nthe location of the circuit, it heard the most important civil rights \ncases in the country. Therefore, these groups did not want to see a \nmore conservative court created.\n  In fact, during the House subcommittee hearings, Judge Johnson \ntestified that he had been opposed to earlier incarnations of the \nproposal. He said, ``* * * the basis for my opposition was a firm \nbelief that the proposal would have a substantial adverse effect on the \ndisposition of cases in the fifth circuit that involved civil and \nconstitutional rights.'' After a careful evaluation of the judges who \nwould go to the different circuits, Judge Johnson changed\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\nhis position to become the spokesman for the split.\n  According to the circuit judges' proposal, this split was to be \ndissimilar to the earlier suggestions in two ways. It would not reduce \nthe cases filed, nor would it create courts whose views differed from \nthe present court's. With respect to these modifications, the petition \nread that the division could be accomplished ``* * * without any \nsignificant philosophical consequences within either of the proposed \ncircuits.''\n  As a Congressman from Mississippi, Jon Hinson, pointed out during the \nhearings, the new courts would reflect a balance in their philosophy, \nat least as measured by the President who appointed the judges. Nine of \nthe 14 judges on the fifth circuit were to be Carter's appointees, as \nwere 7 of 12 on the 11th circuit.\n  Other former opponents, including Judge Hatchett and U.W. Clemon, \nsubmitted letters to the subcommittee explaining why they had changed \ntheir views. Judge Hatchett noted that the new Fifth Circuit Court \nwould have no African-American judges, a matter which had caused many \nobjections. However, he wrote that this matter could be addressed \nlater. ``While I understand the apprehension caused some persons by two \n`new courts,' I do not believe their fears are well founded,'' he \nwrote. ``The two courts that will emerge from this division will \nprobably be no different from the existing fifth circuit.'' Judge U.W. \nClemon wrote that, although he had opposed the 4 to 2 split, this new \nproposal ``will not adversely impact on civil rights.'' Clemon added \nthat it would, in fact, speed the 2-year lag time in the filing of \ncivil rights cases.\n\n\n                      The Frank Johnson Courthouse\n\n  During my first year as a Senator, I strongly supported the \nnomination of Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., to become a U.S. circuit \njudge in what was then the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge \nJohnson stands out as one of the most outstanding jurists of our times.\n  I believe that Judge Johnson has done more in the field of civil \nrights than almost any other single judge. He wrote or took part in \nnumerous historical decisions including those in matters of \ndesegregation, voter registration, and reapportionment. He was also \nvariously involved in cases which established new standards in mental \nhealth programs and prisoners' rights. Notably, in 1978, Johnson became \nthe first Federal district judge to find that an African-American \neducational institution discriminated against whites in its hiring \npractices.\n  At the time, I predicted that the Senate would not have the pleasure \nof confirming a better candidate for circuit judge in many years. To \nJudge Johnson's credit, I believe that my prediction has come true.\n  To further honor this man, whose fairness and judicial temperament I \ndeeply respect, at the suggestion of Dr. Joe Reed, I introduced a bill \nin the summer of 1991 to name the Federal courthouse in Montgomery the \nFrank M. Johnson U.S. Courthouse. This bill became Public Law 102-261.\n  I felt that it was most appropriate to name this particular \ncourthouse after Judge Johnson because it was there he began his career \nas a Federal judge. Judge Johnson's courtroom truly reflected the terms \nrule of law and equal protection of the law. And despite threats on his \nlife, Judge Johnson at all times courageously upheld equal justice \nunder the law.\n  I can only hope that this courthouse will continue to symbolize Judge \nJohnson's work, and to be a temple of justice.\n\n\n                       The Hugo Black Courthouse\n\n  In 1983, I introduced a resolution to designate February 27, 1986, \nHugo LaFayette Black Day. This day marked the 100th anniversary of the \nlate Supreme Court Justice's birth. The resolution became public law \n98-69.\n  Justice Black was born in Clay County, Alabama, and he was graduated \nwith honors from the University of AL Law School. He was a practicing \nlawyer, a prosecuting attorney, and a police court judge in Birmingham, \nand he distinguished himself in all of these positions. He went on to \nbecome a Senator from Alabama, where, among other things, he sponsored \nthe first minimum wage bill. In 1937, Hugo Black became Franklin D. \nRoosevelt's first nominee to the Supreme Court. Justice Black served \nthere through six Presidents and five Chief Justices.\n  I know that Justice Black was a great champion of civil rights who \nsaw the law as a tool to improve everyone's condition. He had a strong \nwork ethic and a delightful sense of humor, and he had a great sympathy \nfor victims of injustice. Chief Justice Burger once said, ``He loved \nthis Court as an institution, and contributed mightily to its work, to \nits strength, and to its future. He revered the Constitution: * * * But \nabove all he believed in the people.''\n  In 1987, I also worked to pass a bill to name the new Federal \ncourthouse in Birmingham for Hugo Black. This bill became Public Law \n100-160. Former Congressman Ben Erdreich from my State of Alabama \nsponsored the bill in the House.\n\n\n                        The Bob Vance Courthouse\n\n  In January 1990, I was deeply saddened by the murder of my very close \nfriend, Bob Vance, who served on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \nJudge Vance was murdered by a mail bomb which also seriously injured \nhis wife, Helen Rainey Vance.\n  I spoke on the floor to honor his memory, and his great \naccomplishments in civil rights; sadly, it seemed clear that his \nefforts to further the rights of all citizens motivated his murderer. I \nwanted, as best I could, to state, unequivocally, that he did not die \nin vain, that his work to ensure racial equality did not die with him.\n  I wanted, very much, for everyone to know that Bob Vance was \nresponsible, as much as any individual, for stopping racially motivated \nbombings like the one which killed him. We need more men like Judge \nVance--men who have the courage to follow the moral imperatives of \ntheir conscience.\n  A few months later, I worked to pass a bill which renamed the \ncourthouse at 1800 5th Avenue in Birmingham the ``Robert S. Vance \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse''--Public Law 101-304. I \nhope that this stands as a testament to this great man's work to fight \nracism, and as a symbol of the work we have done as well as what we \nhave yet to do.\n\n\n       The Daughters of the American Confederacy Insignia Patent\n\n  Earlier, I alluded to the United Daughters of the Confederacy \ninsignia debate. Although I firmly believe that it was the right thing \nto do, I made one of my most difficult and unpopular decisions as a \nSenator in 1993 when I voted against the special treatment extension of \nthe design patent for this group. My personal family history is \nprofoundly connected to the Confederacy. My maternal grandfather was a \nsigner of the Ordinance of Secession by which Alabama seceded from the \nUnion, and my paternal grandfather was a surgeon in the Confederate \nArmy. I also had several close relatives who were killed while serving \nin the Confederate Army. All of these family members were convinced \nthat their cause was right. Honor was their chief motivation at the \ntime, and these men believed that their honorable course was to defend \ntheir cause and homeland. I felt a tremendous amount of conflict as I \nthought about the issue.\n\n  Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, our only black Senator, eloquently \nargued against extending the patent. Her words made me consider, \ncarefully, whether we in the Congress truly needed to extend a special \nrecognition for this symbol of the past. After some considerable \nthought, I decided that honor is still a chief motivation. However, \nalthough I revered my ancestors, honor had taken a different meaning \nafter one hundred and twenty-eight years, and I believe I did the right \nthing just as they did.\n  In May 1993, Senator Moseley-Braun had convinced the Judiciary \nCommittee to delete provisions of a bill which extended the design \npatent concerning the Daughters of the American Confederacy. She argued \nthat she did not oppose the group's freedom to use whatever symbol it \nshould chose, but instead she questioned the need for the Congress to \nendorse a Confederate symbol with the special protection when an \nextension could be obtained through the Office of Patents and \nTrademarks in the normal routine manner.\n  However, the matter came before the full Senate two months later as a \nHelms amendment to a bill we were considering at the time.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun again opposed the amendment, and she made some \ncompelling arguments on the\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\nfloor. She objected to a special Congressional honor since it would, \nshe said, conversely dishonor her own ancestors. She explained:\n\n       * * * the United Daughters of the Confederacy have every \n     right to honor their ancestors and to choose the Confederate \n     flag as their symbol if they like. However, those of us whose \n     ancestors fought on a different side in the Civil War, or who \n     were held, frankly, as human chattel under the Confederate \n     flag, are duty bound to honor our ancestors as well by asking \n     whether such recognition by the U.S. Senate is appropriate.\n\n  I listened to this argument and considered it carefully. With a \ndivided mind, I ultimately agreed with Senator Moseley-Braun. In its \nlater report, Congressional Quarterly called my decision ``Perhaps the \nturning point in the debate,'' which, until that time, had gone against \nSenator Moseley-Braun.\n  Our colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley referred to my \ndecision in his engaging memoir ``Time Present, Time Past''. He wrote, \n``Heflin, who through his actions as a lawyer and judge had long \nchampioned racial justice, rose and said, `I have many connections \nthrough my family to the Daughters of the Confederacy organization and \nthe Children of the Confederacy, but the Senator from Illinois * * * is \na descendant of those that suffered the ills of slavery.' I have a \nlegislative director whose great-great grandfather was a slave. I said \nto my legislative director, `Well if I vote with Senator Moseley-Braun, \nmy mother, grandmother, and other ancestors will turn over in their \ngraves.' He said, `Well, likewise, my ancestors will turn over in their \ngraves [if you vote against it].' ''\n  I do not believe, nor did I believe then, that the Daughters of the \nAmerican Confederacy is inherently racist nor that it takes part in \nracist activities. But I do believe that the U.S. Congress should not \nprovide a special honor, as Senator Moseley-Braun argued, for a symbol \nthat offends a large part of its constituency. In America, we have a \nlong history of racial inequality to correct, and I believe much \nremains to be done. I also believe that, for substantive efforts to \nsucceed, we must work symbolically as well.\n\n  On July 23, the Huntsville News, the Selma Times-Journal, the Dothan \nEagle, the Mobile Register, the Birmingham Post-Herald, the Opelika-\nAuburn News, the Montgomery Advertiser, and the Gadsden Times wrote \nthat I had ``turned [my] back on [my] Confederate forefathers.''\n  On July 24, the Gadsden Times, the Dothan Eagle, the Decatur Daily, \nthe Talladega Daily Home, and the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported \nthat ``Southern preservationalists portrayed Sen. Howell Heflin as a \nYankee-sympathizing turncoat Friday for his dramatic floor speech and \nvote against an insignia bearing a Confederate flag.'' The Tuscaloosa \nNews also reported these objections, and it wrote that Frances Logan, \npresident of the Tuscaloosa UDC, called Richard Shelby a traitor \nbecause he also joined Senator Moseley-Braun. The Montgomery Advertiser \nalso reported objections from members of the UDC and the Sons of \nConfederate Veterans.\n  The UDC in my own home town of Tuscumbia was notably upset with the \nSenate. The President of this chapter expressed her disappointment with \nme for not stating that the war, and the symbol, were not over slavery. \nA former president of the Alabama United Sons of the Confederacy, said: \n``What is going to be interesting is when (Heflin) tries to run for re-\nelection''. * * * ``He's got about as much chance as the proverbial \nsnowball when he's got these women mad at him.''\n  On July 24, the Mobile Register editorialized that Senator Shelby and \nI were ``swept into political correctness along with * * * other \ncolleagues * * * to reject a patent for an insignia of the United \nDaughters of the Confederacy.'' The editorial further asserted that \nrejection of the patent extension would do nothing to prevent racism.\n  But some articles and editorials were more favorable. On July 23, the \nMobile Press printed an article in which it chose to quote a number of \nmy colleagues who supported my decision, and the Anniston Star printed \nan editorial supporting my decision. This editorial denied that I did \nmy ancestors a dishonor; in fact, the editorial was so complimentary as \nto call my decision courageous. On the 24th, the Andalusia Star-News \ngave me the same compliment.\n  The same day, the Birmingham News/Post Herald editorialized that the \npatent issue would be resolved only ``To the satisfaction of neither \nside.'' The editorial noted that Senator Shelby's and my votes ``didn't \nhelp them with the average white voter.'' But it added a great \ncompliment to us both by suggesting that integrity played a part.\n\n\n                    The Civil Rights Restoration Act\n\n  In 1990, the Congress passed a bill to restore interpretations of \nemployment civil rights laws recently limited by the Supreme Court. But \nPresident Bush vetoed the bill in the fall, and we failed to override \nthe veto in the Senate.\n  This bill was generally called a civil rights restoration bill \nbecause its sponsors sought to overturn a number of Supreme Court \ndecisions issued in the late 1980's. Congress felt the Court had become \ntoo conservative, depending too heavily on the exact wording of the law \nand sacrificing some of its meaning. With respect to the civil rights \ncases, particularly, I think the bill's authors felt that the Court had \nrestricted the laws too much, and I agreed with them.\n  A filibuster met this bill when it came to the floor in July. At this \ntime, a number of Senators offered amendments to the bill. I co-\nsponsored one offered by Senator Ford to apply the provisions of the \nbill to the Senate. The Senate passed this rider, and it voted down \nanother to allow for special procedures for itself. Among all of the \namendments, however, I think the most important was Senator Kennedy's \namendment to eliminate the requirement of quotas as a remedy in the \nbill.\n\n  However, despite the Kennedy amendment, President Bush vetoed the \nbill based on an objection to quotas. ``It is neither fair nor sensible \nto give the employers of our country a difficult choice between using \nquotas and seeking a clarification of the law through costly and very \nrisky litigation,'' he argued in his veto message.\n  I was disappointed by the veto and puzzled by the President's \nreasoning. The bill, I said, included language explicitly stating that \n``nothing in the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to \nrequire or encourage an employer to adopt hiring or promotion quotas on \nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.'' I judged \nthat the bill would only have restored employment practices to the \nstandard before the Supreme Court restrictions.\n  The next year, the Congress and President Bush compromised on a new \nversion of the bill, which the President declared free of quotas. This \nbill became Public Law 102-166.\n  Congressional Quarterly suggested that Bush moved, in large part, \nbecause his civil rights record had earned him enemies in the African-\nAmerican community. This publication also wrote that the President had \nother political reasons to support the bill. Not least among these were \nthe Thomas hearings and the GOP candidacy of former Klansman David Duke \nfor Governor of Louisiana. But to suppose that he was motivated only by \nhis own gain strikes me as cynical; I believe that the President \ndeserves credit for supporting and signing this Act.\n  Ultimately, we worked out a compromise which passed as the Senate \nbill. It modified title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to establish \nspecific compensatory and punitive damages capped according to the size \nof the business in cases of intentional bias, and it allowed for \ncomplainants to seek jury trials under this section. The compromise \nalso rewrote statutes to overturn, effectively, nine Supreme Court \nrulings. In answer to Wards Cove, the new law returned the burden of \nproof in discrimination cases to the employer, although it left the \ndefinition of business necessity to the courts. It prohibited racial \nharassment after hiring, contrary to Patterson versus McLean Credit \nUnion. It overturned Martin versus Wilks by setting specific statutory \nguidelines for third party challenges to consent decrees in affirmative \naction cases. Against Price Waterhouse versus Hopkins, it specifically \ndisallowed consideration of race, color, religion, sex or national \norigin no matter what circumstances otherwise surrounded the\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\nhiring. The new law also allowed a period of time to pass after \nseniority systems are implemented in order to examine their effects \nbefore discrimination suits need to be filed. This statute was a \nresponse to Lorance v. AT It further amended Title VII to allow for \nthose winning suits against the U.S. government to recover interest on \ndelays, contrary to Library of Congress v. Shaw. In order to reverse \nCrawford Fitting Company versus J.T. Gibbons Inc. and West Virginia \nUniversity Hospitals v. Casey, it also modified this section to allow \nfor recovery of the costs in hiring experts. Last, it allowed American \nworkers abroad to sue U.S. companies for discrimination, against the \nSupreme Court's EEOC versus Arabian American Oil Co decision.\n  Congressional Quarterly wrote that the language to reverse the Wards \nCove decision--with reference to indirect discrimination, called \ndisparate impact--was vague, and left much undecided. This vagueness \nwas a function of the compromise we reached with President Bush.\n  I was disappointed with the law's failure to apply the same statutes \nto Senate employment as in the private sector. The bill, however, did \ninclude measures to prevent employment discrimination which held \nSenators personally liable.\n  This measure represented a key step in the elimination of \ndiscrimination, an end I believe the people of America and Alabama \nwere--and are--working very hard to attain.\n\n\n                     The Legal Services Corporation\n\n  During the 1980's, Congress saved the Legal Services Corporation, \nwhich provided legal assistance to the poor in civil litigation. This \naction followed a series of attacks leveled by President Reagan; each \nyear he tried to abolish the corporation, and during that time, he also \ntried to restrict its activities and reconstitute its board. Since the \nSenate would not support his nominations, he made many of them in \nrecess. Ultimately, after the Congress pushed funding through each \nyear, Reagan gave in and requested money for the LSC in his last budget \nrequest.\n  I fought very hard to continue the Legals Services Corporation \nbecause I believe it is essential to true equality of justice. Given \nincreasing fees and costs, the American system of justice continues to \nbecome more difficult for the poor to access. And this unfortunate \nreality has had a disproportionate impact on minorities. Its \ncontinuation represented a great victory for the Congress and the \npeople.\n\n\n                              Church Arson\n\n  In June 1996, I strongly supported S. 1890, a bill to increase \nFederal protection against arson and other destruction of places of \nreligious worship. For the past couple of years, black churches had \nbeen burned under suspicious circumstances and with alarming frequency, \nand a national response was strongly needed.\n  To those of us who remember the violence and fires of the early civil \nrights movement and who applaud the progress which has been made in \nterms of race relations, these latest images in the early hours before \ndawn were profoundly disturbing.\n  I supported this bill and other efforts to stop these kinds of hate \ncrimes, bring their perpetrators to justice, and encourage compliance \nwith the law. I also saw this as an opportunity to ask ourselves if we \ncan do more to advance the causes of equal rights and racial harmony. I \nalso called for the authorization of a transfer of funds to be used to \nimplement the provisions of this act at the State and local levels of \ngovernment.\n\n\nDesignation of the Route of the Freedom March from Selma to Montgomery \n                          as a National Trail\n\n  In 1990, I worked with Senator Kerry to introduce a bill to require a \nstudy to include the Route of Freedom, from Selma to Montgomery, in the \nnational trails system. I introduced another in 1995 to officially \ninclude the Route of Freedom in the system.\n  Although a conference report is still pending, the provisions to \ndesignate the Route of Freedom a national trail passed the Congress in \nthe House's Presidio bill, a larger parks bill.\n\n\n                     Sanctions Against South Africa\n\n  Beginning in the summer of 1985, I voted for the imposition of \nsanctions on South Africa, and I supported them until the end of \napartheid. Although these sanctions remained somewhat unpopular in my \nhome State, I believed that they were the right thing to do. Events \nsince then have shown that sanctions did help bring about an end to \napartheid and create a more stable society.\n\n\n                     African-American Staff Members\n\n  Over the years, I have had many black staff members. In fact, I \nbelieve that I have had more African-Americans working for me than \nother Senators. My legislative director, office manager, mobile field \ncoordinator, and others are black.\n  As I have said, I believe that inclusion of blacks in government \nhelps overcome symbolic and substantive obstacles to equality. However, \nit just happened that these staffers applied, and they were best \nqualified to do the job. This is the way it should be in all cases.\n\n\n                  Black Federal Marshals in Birmingham\n\n  In 1993, I worked with black political leaders in Alabama to \nrecommend two African-American U.S. Marshals in my home State. These \nmen, Robert Moore and Bill Edwards, were very well qualified for the \npositions--perhaps even overqualified when compared with the usual \ncandidates for this position.\n  Robert Moore had recently retired from the Secret Service, where he \nhad served as a special agent for 8 years--the last four in senior \nstatus.\n  On July 15, 1993, Senator Shelby and I recommended Bill Edwards for \nthe northern district of Alabama. Mr. Edwards had been with the U.S. \nMarshal's office in Birmingham since 1970, and at the time of our \nletter, he was a senior criminal investigator. He was also in his last \nyear of law school at the Birmingham School of Law.\n  That year, Senator Shelby and I also recommended Florence Mangum \nCauthen to the middle district on August 6, and she became the first \nfemale U.S. Marshal in Alabama. Among her other accomplishments, Ms. \nCauthen had taught law at Jones Law School.\n\n\n                 Title III of the Higher Education Act\n\n  I sought to have a number of Alabama colleges funded through title \nIII of the Higher Education Act. I supported a proposal to separate the \ngeneral college at Tuskegee University from its renowned School of \nVeterinary Medicine so that both institutions could receive the benefit \nof title III. Normally, schools such as Tuskegee, which are considered \ndeveloping institutions, receive only one grant under this law.\n  Additionally, I saw that junior colleges were included in the title \nIII developing institutions programs. Over the years, I have worked \nclosely with the Department of Education to see that junior colleges \nand historically black institutions receive title III funds. These \nresources have been extremely beneficial.\n  In the early 1980's Alabama Christian College--now Faulkner \nUniversity--was turned down for a title III Developing Institutions \nGrant by the Education Department. Fortunately, we were able to prevail \nupon the Department and the White House. On a late Sunday afternoon, \nofficials of the department reassembled outside readers and determined \nthat Alabama Christian College's title III application should be \ngranted. A few years later, this school received a challenge grant in \nthe amount of $1,000,000 to assist in its development efforts.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  As I reflect upon my Senate activities in connection with civil \nrights, a number of thoughts come to mind, including those surrounding \nmy decision to run for the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator John Sparkman was in his late seventies, and many of his \nfriends did not think he would be a candidate for reelection in 1978. \nThen-Governor George Wallace had announced his intention to run for the \nSenate and was already conducting a tough campaign against Senator \nSparkman. I had always been a strong supporter of Senator Sparkman. I \nwas told by friends of his to look at the possibility of running in the \nevent that Senator Sparkman decided to retire.\n  I had polls conducted pitting my candidacy against that of George \nWallace. The initial polls showed that if I were to run, Wallace would \nbe far ahead of me. As I recall, the numbers first polled showed that \nWallace would get about 45 percent and that I would get only about 17 \npercent. But my pollster, Peter Hart, indicated that there was a large \namount of negative feeling in the\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\nState toward Wallace at that time and expressed his opinion that \nI could win such a race. One of the motivating reasons that caused me \nto give serious consideration to the race was that I felt that Alabama \nshould be represented by a senator who believed in the improvement of \nrace relations and progress in the area of civil rights.\n\n  I met with Senator Sparkman in Washington, and he told me about how \nhe had entered his first race for Congress. Archie Carmichael was then \nthe Congressman from Senator Sparkman's district, and Sparkman had been \nhis campaign manager when he was elected. Congressman Carmichael did \nnot enjoy being a Congressman, only serving two terms. He called John \nSparkman to Washington and told him that he ought to get ready to run \nfor his congressional seat; that he had not made up his mind yet, but \nthat there was a strong possibility that he would not offer himself for \nreelection and that Mr. Sparkman should get ready to run in the event \nhe did not seek his congressional seat again. He said to me, ``I am \ntelling you that story because I think you ought to get ready to run \nfor the Senate against Wallace.'' I thanked him and told him I would \nfollow his advice. I also relayed to him that Congressman Archie \nCarmichael was my wife's grandfather. Sparkman said he knew that and \nthat was one of the reasons he wanted to tell me the story.\n  A few weeks later, Senator Sparkman announced that he would not be a \ncandidate for reelection, and I announced the next day that I would be \na candidate for John Sparkman's seat in the U.S. Senate.\n  My race against George Wallace was heated for several months. And \nthen, while speaking to the Alabama League of Municipalities Convention \nin Mobile, he announced his withdrawal from the Senate race, giving no \nreason for his decision. In advance of his announcement, I was told of \nseveral polls that showed I had pulled ahead of Wallace, including a \npoll conducted by the Wallace campaign itself.\n  I attracted other opponents, but won in a run-off race against \nCongressman Walter Flowers by a 2-to-1 margin.\n  As I think back over the reasons I entered the race for the U.S. \nSenate, certainly the issue of racial progress in Alabama was a \nmotivating factor, and I was fearful that if George Wallace was in the \nSenate, it could deter needed changes in the civil rights laws.\n  In 1982, he ran again successfully for Governor. His last \nadministration was one in which race relations were far more harmonious \nthan they had been in his previous terms in office, with Wallace \nappointing a number of blacks to key positions in his administration. \nHe publicly stated that his segregation stand had been wrong. At a \nrecent meeting of southern black Democratic leaders in Atlanta, Dr. Joe \nReed, head of the Alabama Democratic Conference, said I was the first \nU.S. Senator from Alabama who believed in civil rights and who took \npositive steps to advance the individual rights of all persons.\n  Mr. President, despite all the progress in race relations and civil \nrights over the years, there is still much to be done. Our work remains \nunfinished, as the church burnings illustrate. When I reflect on these \nhorrifying arsons and the death of Judge Bob Vance just a few years \nago, I am again reminded of just how much remains to be done.\n  Perhaps it is unrealistic to believe that we can ever have a truly \ncolor-blind society. As long as fear, ignorance, and emotion guide some \npeoples' thinking, there will be prejudice and bigotry. But we can look \nat the great progress we have made--just in the 18 years since I came \nto the Senate--and say that we are doing better.\n  Members might differ on their approaches to civil rights issues. \nThese approaches will take on different forms based on the region of \nthe country we come from, our personal philosophical beliefs, and our \npolitical parties. My approach has been to do as much as possible in \nthe public arena to advance opportunity and justice. At times, this has \nmeant working behind the scenes to secure progressive judicial \nnominations, to craft compromise legislation that could pass and be \nsigned into law, and working with both sides of an issue to cool \npassions and promote harmony. At other times, it has meant taking \nstrong symbolic stands aimed at education and putting the past behind \nus, such as the case with the United Daughters of the Confederacy \nissue.\n  Regardless of what approach we take as leaders, it is our duty to \nwork in every way we possibly can to see that each and every American \ncitizen enjoys the same liberty, freedom, and equality of opportunity \nas all others. The fulfillment of the promise of the Constitution \ndemands that we always remain diligent in fulfilling this \nresponsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12080-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT, H.R. 1833\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I supported passage of the bill to ban \npartial birth abortions when it was approved by the Senate on December \n7 and I voted last week to override the President's veto of this \nmeasure.\n  My position on abortion issues is clear. I have consistently stated \nthat I would not support overturning the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe versus Wade. I support a woman's right to have an abortion. I do \nnot think we should turn back the clock 25 years and make abortion \nillegal, but we should work in every way to reduce the number of \nabortions that are performed. I have also cast votes here in Congress \nto oppose using Federal funds to pay for abortions except in cases of \nlife endangerment, rape, or incest.\n  The Senate's vote last week was on whether to override the \nPresident's veto of legislation which would prohibit a physician from \nperforming a partial-birth abortion, a procedure in which a fetus is \ndelivered into the birth canal before its skull is collapsed and \ndelivery is completed. This legislation contains a provision which \nwould make an exception for partial-birth abortions that are necessary \nto save the life of the mother in cases in which no other medical \nprocedure would suffice.\n  I simply cannot justify the use of this procedure to terminate \npregnancies in which the mother's life is not at stake. For this \nreason, I voted to override the President's veto and to support the ban \non partial-birth abortions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12090-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12090-S12091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday I was one of a handful of \nMembers of the Senate to vote against the FY97 omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  This was a difficult vote and I have mixed feeling about passage of \nthis bill.\n  While I am pleased a Government shutdown was avoided, I am \ndisappointed in the way the process was handled.\n  Various measures that warranted separate consideration, ranging from \nthe immigration bill, to amendments to the age discrimination law to \nbanking legislation, were wrapped into this massive bill. The measure \nwas hundreds of pages long, and few Members of either body were fully \naware of the wide range of items shoved into this must-pass bill at the \n11 hour. It has been pointed out by a Member of the other body that you \ncould get a double hernia just trying to lift this omnibus spending \nbill.\n  I predict that over the course of the next several weeks, there will \nbe many surprises discovered in the package. Some of the special \ninterest pork provisions are buried deep within the various titles, as \nwell as policy changes that should have been debated in public and \nvoted on without the pressure to keep the government running.\n  Moreover, although we succeeded in avoiding a massive new tax cut \nthat would have set us backward on the road to deficit reduction, this \nomnibus spending bill represents a missed opportunity to cut Government \nwaste and stop the unnecessary spending. The fact that this bill was \nloaded up with special spending provisions for individual Members \nindicates that it is business as usual in Congress when it comes to \nspending Federal dollars. While we have made significant progress in \nreducing the Federal deficit, much of that work was done in the last \nCongress and we missed the opportunity in the 104th Congress to finish \nthe job and truly get the Federal budget into balance.\n  This bill adds a whopping $9 billion in deficit spending for defense \nsystems above what Department of Defense requested. When all of the \nfiscal year 1997\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\nappropriations bills are lined up together, excessive spending on \nthings like sending Russian monkeys into space and massive out-dated \nwater projects out West continues to drain the Treasury. I voted \nagainst this bill because I think we could have done a much better job \nat curbing unnecessary spending, government waste, and reducing the \nFederal deficit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12090-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, nothing is typical about Bill Bradley, \nbut some things are characteristic. As, for example, his article on the \nfront page of the Washington Post's Outlook section this past Sunday. \nJust before the scheduled adjournment of the 104th Congress, bringing \nto an end for now his brilliant 18-year career as a U.S. Senator. The \narticle is characteristically bipartisan: ``It's Government by Tax \nBreak Again: Clinton and Dole Should Be Talking About Fairness and \nLoopholes, Not Cuts and Credits.'' It is our pleasant custom to ask \nthat such articles be reprinted in the Record, and I make that request, \nwith the text to be placed at the conclusion of my remarks. But the \nSenate will take the meaning from the title. Bill Bradley harkens back \nto the great 1986 tax reform bill, of which he, above all his \ncolleagues, conceived, inspired, and helped to enactment. The \nprinciples were simple. First of all, above all, simplify. Two low \nrates. In that sense, cutting taxes. But paying for the lower rates by \nclosing loopholes in the existing code which had acreted like a coral \nreef as Congress after Congress responded to the tiny this and the tiny \nthat special interest, until a vast barrier separated the privileged \nfrom the people. I happened to be one of the core group that put \ntogether this legislation. We would meet early each morning in the \noffice of Senator Bob Packwood, who was then chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. My informal task was to provide a brief inspirational \nreading as the meeting commenced. It was then a simple task. I would \nsimply glance through the previous day's Wall Street Journal looking \nfor the best advertisement.\n  Typically, it would have a headline: ``Guaranteed Losses'' In finer \nprint one would learn that a sheep ranch in Idaho, an alligator ranch \nin Florida, an ostrich ranch in Kansas would assure investors immediate \nlosses that could be offset against other income, which losses would be \nrecouped at some future date. And that was where entrepreneurial energy \nwas flowing. To guaranteed losses that the Internal Revenue Code would \nturn into profits. Bill Bradley changed that. But the work is never \ndone, and so he leaves us still talking the responsibilities of \ncitizenship and legislation.\n  I will miss him as perhaps few others. We have served 18 years \ntogether on the Finance Committee. He has taught me; I have learned \nfrom him and followed him. And will continue to do so. Just last week, \nthe Finance Committee convened for its last meeting of this Congress. \nBill was asked to say a few words; which was all he ever will do. He \nrecalled that in 1978 I came down to Princeton, NJ to campaign with him \nin that first campaign for the Senate. In the course of our stumping \nabout, I urged him to try to get onto the Finance Committee, where so \nvery much of the critical issues of American life are decided. He did \nand he showed why. I then recalled a passage from Woodrow Wilson at the \ntime he was president of Princeton University. A student of the \nPresidency, Wilson was watching the growing intensity of presidential \ncampaigns. Candidates did not, of course, did not then go to the \nconventions that nominated them, but after nomination were getting into \nthe business of making speeches from the rear of railroad trains and \nall manner of stressful campaigning. Wilson wrote that if this should \ncontinue, we would be reduced to choosing our Chief Executives from \n``among wise and prudent athletes: a small class.'' I thought that \nthen; I think it now, as we say farewell to Bill Bradley--for now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12091-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO DIANE BALAMOTI AND TERESA BRELAND\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on several occasions over the past few \ndays, I have taken the floor to express my appreciation to my fine \nstaff for their loyal service to me and the committee over the years. \nToday, I want to say thank you to two staff members of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Diane Balamoti has been with the committee since 1987. During this \nperiod she has served as the staff assistant to the Park and Public \nLands Subcommittee. As many of my colleagues know, this subcommittee \nhas always been one of the most active and prolific subcommittees in \nthe Senate. During her 10 years with the committee, Diane has staffed \ncountless hearings and business meetings and assisted in the \npreparation of bills, statements, and the drafting of committee \nreports. She has kept the subcommittee's voluminous bills files and \ntracked the work of the subcommittee through the Senate and House. \nDiane possesses truly outstanding clerical skills which are often \ntested, especially at the end of a Congress when the pace of the \ncommittee's business always quickens. Ms. Balamoti has been a \ndependable, productive, and important member of our committee staff for \nmany years and I want her to know how much I appreciate her service to \nme and the country.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I want to thank Teresa Breland, the \nnewest full time staff member on the Energy Committee minority staff. \nTerri, who has been with us slightly over a year, has served as our \nreceptionist in the minority office and has more recently been the \nassistant to our staff director for the minority, Ben Cooper. Mr. \nPresident, Terri is one of those dedicated public servants who puts in \na full day's work on the Hill and then goes to school at night. She is \njust about to finish her master's degree in psychology and I commend \nher for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12091-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BIF/SAIF\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

We share the Senator's concern. In response, let me say \nthat it is not our intent that the regulators implement the deposit \nshifting provision in a way that would raise constitutional free speech \nissues.

I want to assure my colleagues that we are continuing \nto have discussions with the administration relative to the disposition \nof the parks omnibus bill, and I hope that those bear some meaningful \nresolve before the day is out. Those discussions are going on now, and, \nI might say, Mr. President, I am somewhat encouraged, but I have been \nat that stage before, as well.\n  I know there is a lot of interest in it, and I want to at least \nadvise my colleagues of the current status. It has been somewhat like \nhow I would envision a Chinese torture chamber might be, had I ever \nbeen exposed to one--and perhaps I have been exposed to one and just do \nnot know it.\n  In any event, the ultimate outcome of this still depends on the \nadministration recognizing that we need some assurance on timber supply \nto supply our three existing operating sawmills in our State, and \nhopefully provide enough for the fourth one that has been shut down for \n2 years. That is where we are on the issue of resolving our \ndifferences.\n  There are other differences. In fact, the State of Colorado, \nparticularly, and the State of Virginia, we appear to be working some \nof those issues out, as well. Of course, it would require a process of \namending the House bill which is\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\npending but subject to an objection under a unanimous-consent \nrequest. But that would be the vehicle. Then we would send it back to \nthe House, and the House would either accept or reject it.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Senate bill 2183 introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislation clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2183) to make technical corrections to the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                     Welfare Amendment Description\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill would clarify congressional \nintent and allow all States, regardless of when the State opts to start \nthe new block grant program, access to contingency funds if they \nqualify. The welfare bill limits funds available to a State in 1997 to \nthe State's block grant amount, but requires a State of have an \napproved welfare reform plan before being eligible for a contingency \nfund payment.\n  Prior to opting into the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n[TANF] Program, the State must operate under the current law Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children [AFDC] entitlement program. There are \na handful of States that have rising caseloads and rising unemployment \nthat normally would be eligible for the contingency fund. The \nauthorizing committees, in a letter to HHS Secretary Shalala, indicated \nthat congressional intent was that all States should be eligible for \nthe contingency fund regardless of when they opt into the new TANF \nprogram. HHS has stated that legally they cannot give payments out of \nthe contingency fund without a legislative change.\n  Many States will not be able to opt into the block grant until the \nlegislation's effective date of July 1, 1997. For example, New Mexico's \nState Legislature will not convene until January 1997 and the \nlegislative process will take time to develop a welfare reform plan.\n  Since CBO had assumed States would receive payments from the fund, \nthe welfare bill was scored with costs (outlays from the fund.) Since \nthis legislation clarifies intent, CBO scored no cost.\n  CBO identified a number of States that may have a problem because of \nrising unemployment or rising caseloads. These States include Nevada, \nNew Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, and Minnesota. So far it is unclear \nwhich States will actually have a problem.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5424\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there is an amendment at the desk by \nSenator Daschle. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOWSKI], for Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5424.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . EXTENSION OF NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS RURAL DEVELOPMENT \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       Section 11 of the Northern Great Plains Rural Development \n     Act (Public Law 103-318; 7 U.S.C. 2661 note) is amended by \n     striking ``the earlier'' and all that follows through the \n     period at the end and inserting ``September 30, 1997.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. The \namendment clarifies congressional intent and allows all States, \nregardless of when they opt into the block grant, access to the \ncontingency fund.\n  The welfare bill restricts States funds in fiscal year 1997 to the \nblock grant amount, even though the effective date for the new program \nis July 1, 1997. States may operate under current AFDC rules until \nthen.\n  Congress never intended that States have financial difficulties prior \nto starting the new program.\n  In fact, most States make money under the block grant because \ncaseloads have dropped, so the funding limitation never comes into \nquestion.\n  There are handful of States, including my home State, that have had \ncaseload increases since the establishment of the block grant. These \nStates could experience a funding shortfall during the transition \nperiod--a situation not foreseen in the original legislation.\n  Congress created the contingency fund for just this problem.\n  However, the contingency fund is available only to eligible States \nand HHS' interpretation is that an ``eligible State'' is a State that \nhas opted into the block grant.\n  Most States do not have full-time legislatures that can convene and \ndevelop a new welfare plan. For example, New Mexico's Legislature does \nnot convene until January 1997. Therefore, it will take time for New \nMexico's welfare plan to be implemented.\n  Both the Finance Committee and Ways and Means wrote a letter to HHS \nadvising the agency of congressional intent, but HHS responded by \nsaying there must be a legislative change.\n  This amendment has no cost attached to it. CBO assumed that all \nStates could have access to the funds and as such scored outlays in the \nwelfare bill.\n  This amendment does not change the way States qualify for the fund--\nit is not limited to any particular State--any State that qualifies can \naccess the funds as well.\n  This amendment has the support of the authorizing committees and the \nadministration.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be advanced to third reading and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout further action, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5424) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2183), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As testament to that support, we \nwere able to introduce the bill, mark it up in committee, and pass it \nthrough the Senate within 2 months.\n  Through hard work on both sides of the Capitol, the House and Senate \nconference on H.R. 3005 produced a sound bill that thoughtfully and \ncarefully tightens the securities laws. I thank my distinguished \ncolleagues and conferees whose tenacity and dedication have made it \npossible to produce this legislation. I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Securities Subcommittee, Senators Gramm and Dodd, along \nwith the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Sarbanes. I also \nthank my esteemed colleague, Senator Bennett, who has been very helpful \nto the committee on securities legislation this Congress. I thank the \nstaffs: Howard Mennell, Steve Harris, Laura Unger, Wayne Abernathy, \nMitchell Feuer, Andrew Lowenthal, and Robert Cresanti, as well as the \nlegislative counsel, Laura Ayud, who literally made this bill possible.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to act expeditiously on this \nconference report so that we may then forward it to the White House for \nthe President's signature.\n  The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 is a \nsignificant piece of legislation that will ensure that the U.S. \nsecurities market remains the pre-eminent securities market in the \nworld. The U.S. securities market has the most capital and the most \ninvestors. Over 50 million Americans own stocks, not counting more than \n10,000 institutional investors. Last year, the U.S. stock market had \n$7.98 trillion in capital--close to half the amount of capital in the \nentire world market.\n  This legislation will make it easier to raise capital in the \nsecurities market. The bill will create a new category of unregistered \nprivate investment companies that will help venture capitalists tap the \ncapital markets to fund business endeavors. It will also bring more \nfunding and investment to small business by making it easier for \neconomic, business, and industrial development companies to raise money \nwithout having to register with the SEC and by providing liquidity and \ninvestment opportunities to business development companies.\n  The bill will promote capital formation by eliminating many \noverlapping State and Federal requirements for registering securities. \nIt eases the restrictions on borrowing that currently restricts U.S. \nbroker-dealers' sources of funding their business. The bill will make \nU.S. broker-dealers more competitive in the global markets. It will \nalso allow U.S. firms to pass on substantial savings to their \ncustomers.\n  This bill will make the securities laws reflect the reality of \ntoday's marketplace. It will simplify procedures for paying fees and \nmaking disclosures. It will give the Securities and Exchange Commission \nflexibility to adapt to the changing financial market by letting the \nSEC say the securities laws don't apply where they don't make sense.\n  This legislation will tighten up regulation by giving the States and \nthe SEC distinctly separate regulatory roles. It will divide between \nthe SEC and the States regulation of the 22,000 registered investment \nadvisers who are entrusted with $10.6 trillion in customer funds--much \nof which represents savings and retirement money. As a result, \ninvestment advisers will be better regulated and consumers and \ninvestors better protected.\n  The bill will make the mutual fund market a national market, that \nwill be comprehensively regulated by the SEC. Mutual funds have become \na household commodity in the last several years with almost one-third \nof U.S. households--that's 30 million households--owning a total of \n$2.7 trillion in mutual funds. This bill recognizes that the growth in \nthe mutual fund industry means that it is no longer practicable for all \n50 States to have a hand in what goes into a mutual fund prospectus.\n  This legislation also makes sure investors and consumers are not \nconfused about what's in a mutual fund by giving the SEC authority to \nset standards on mutual fund names.\n  This is not a controversial bill, it enjoys support on both sides of \nthe aisle. It thoughtfully and carefully tightens the laws governing \nthe securities market. I commend my colleagues and their staff for \ntheir excellent work in drafting this legislation and urge my\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\ncolleagues to support passage of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the passage of the conference report on H.R. 3005, the \nNational Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. Allow me to begin \nby offering my heartfelt congratulations to my fellow conferees: \nSenators D'Amato, Sarbanes, Gramm, and Bennett, with whom I worked very \nclosely in first creating and now passing this thoughtful and strongly \nbipartisan bill. I believe that the high quality of this legislation is \ndemonstrable proof of what can be accomplished when we set aside our \npartisan differences to work for the good of the Nation.\n  As I've said many times, the U.S. capital markets are vitally \nimportant for the good economic health not only of virtually every \nAmerican company but for millions and millions of individual investors \nwho have placed some of their assets either directly in securities or, \nas has become more and more common, into mutual funds.\n  Sustained economic growth is heavily dependent upon the continuing \nability of our capital markets and financial services industry to \nfunction efficiently and with integrity. If companies find impediments \nto obtaining capital, they will not grow. If individuals find \nimpediments to their access to securities and other investments, they \nwill not save.\n  Taking steps to enhance the access of both corporations and \nindividuals to the securities markets is a prudent means by which \nCongress can help sustain or even increase the Nation's rate of \neconomic growth.\n  Furthermore, the American capital markets are the envy of the world. \nNo other Nation enjoys the international reputation of our capital \nmarkets and it is necessary for Congress periodically to review and \nmodernize, where necessary, the laws that make our markets and our \nfinancial services industry the world's leader.\n  I will acknowledge that it took us a little longer to get to this \npoint than I had anticipated when the Senate passed S. 1815 at the end \nof June. Despite the other body's initially leisurely attitude toward \nconference negotiations, we have collectively achieved an excellent \nproduct.\n  This conference report, which I hope that the Senate will adopt \ntoday, is the culmination of a lengthy bipartisan effort to reform \nthose aspects of the securities laws that are an outdated impediment to \nthe efficient functioning of the securities industry.\n  The legislation will also provide clearer statutory directives to \nboth State and Federal regulators so that the integrity of--and \nconfidence in--our capital markets and financial services industry is \nenhanced.\n  Without going into excruciating detail, let me just highlight the \nmain areas that this legislation covers: it improves the regulation of \ninvestment advisors by clarifying the proper roles of the SEC and the \nState regulators; it modernizes and streamlines the regulation of \nmutual funds on the one hand, and provides badly needed modernization \nof the statutes covering hedge funds and venture capital funds on the \nother hand; it provides for clarification on a host of technical \nmatters ranging from treatment of church pension plans to the access by \nU.S. journalists to foreign issuer press conferences. And, \nsignificantly, the bill creates the mechanism for increased regulatory \nflexibility so that the SEC will have the ability to keep pace with \nneeded regulatory changes as the needs and demands both of investors \nand the financial industry develop over time.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the legislation will allow the creation of a \nnew kind of private investment company that is exempt from the \nrestrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because this is a \nnew mechanism for fund managers to use, we provide safeguards for \nparticipants in existing private investment companies. Any fund manager \nseeking to convert their existing fund to a new fund--called 3(c)[7] \nfunds in the bill--must offer all their participants the option to \nfirst ``cash out.'' It is further the intent of the conferees that \nthese dissenter's rights not be evaded by fund managers who might seek \nto either invest their existing fund solely in the new fund or to \nsimply have the old fund exactly mirror the investment decisions of the \nnew fund. The conferees expect the commission to be particularly \nvigilant in this matter. It is also the expectation of the conferees \nthat the commission act swiftly to define the term ``Beneficial \nowners.'' It is the intent of the conferees that when such notices are \ngiven to institutional investors, the notice be given only to the \ncontrolling entity of that institution, not directly to all of the \ninvesting institution's underlying investors or participants.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report will require the \nCommission to study the impact of recent judicial and regulatory \nrulings that have limited the ability of shareholders to offer \nproposals at shareholder meetings regarding a company's employment \npractices. The abilities of shareholders to offer such kinds of \nresolutions such as the ``Sullivan principles'' for South Africa and \nthe ``MacBride principles'' for Northern Ireland have had a direct \nimpact on ensuring that U.S. corporations do not participate in the \nloathsome discriminatory practices that occurred--or still occur--in \nthose Nations. I look forward to the results of the Commission's study \nin a year's time.\n  I would also note a few important provisions from the House bill that \nwere included in this conference report. First, the conference report \ncontains a 10-year authorization for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that will reduce registration fees that were a drag on \ncapital formation and will provide a level playing field for \ntransaction fees on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock \nExchange, and the NASDAQ stock market. This provision is a huge \nimprovement over the House's original plan, since the plan first \nadopted by the House would have caused a negative impact upon programs \nin the Commerce Department, Justice Department and the State \nDepartment.\n  The Senate played a critical role in forcing the other body to reach \nagreement with the administration and Senate appropriators so that the \ngoal of fee reduction could be achieved without harming other important \nFederal programs.\n  The conference report also contains a requirement for the \nestablishment of uniform State laws on books and records for broker-\ndealers. While this uniformity has long been sought by State \nregulators, the SEC and industry, I remain concerned that some States \nwill have to adjust their laws regarding books and records kept at \nbranch offices. It is the intent of the conferees that the SEC work \nclosely with the States to determine what records should be maintained \nat branch offices and to establish a mechanism so that States could \nrequire such records be kept in the branch office, rather than at a \nback office halfway across the Nation.\n  At this time, it is also appropriate to thank the Senate staffers who \nhave worked so hard on turning ideas and goals into concrete \nlegislation. I extend my congratulations and appreciation to Andrew \nLowenthal from my staff; Laura Unger, the majority counsel; Mitchell \nFeuer, the minority counsel; and, Wayne Abernathy, the majority staff \ndirector of the Securities Subcommittee. I would also like to extend my \nthanks to someone who frequently, though unjustly, goes unmentioned \nwhen accolades are given on the floor--Laura Syoud of the Senate \nlegislative counsel's office whose expertise was invaluable in solving \nsome of the most difficult problems we confronted in drafting not only \nthis conference report, but in the original Senate legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is a carefully balanced bill that, upon enactment \nby President Clinton, will improve our Nation's securities laws to \nallow the markets to function more efficiently, while balancing those \nreforms by maintaining, and in some cases enhancing, The full strength \nof investor protections that have made our markets the best in the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Congress has today \nenacted H.R. 3005, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of \n1996. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \nlegislation intended to promote efficiency in the regulation of mutual \nfunds, better allocation of responsibility between Federal and State\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\nsecurities regulators, and elimination of outdated provisions. While \nthe two bills had much in common, they also differed in certain \nrespects. I commend Senator D'Amato for his leadership of the \nConference Committee, which has successfully bridged the differences \nbetween the two bills. Credit also goes to Senator Gramm, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Bennett, and the House Conferees. The final product is a \nreasonable bill that deserves support.\n  This bill has two major themes: first, improvement of mutual fund \nregulation, and second, reallocation of responsibility between Federal \nand State securities regulators. It is appropriate to review the \nregulation of mutual funds, given the tremendous growth in this segment \nof the financial services industry. Mutual fund assets now equal \ninsured bank deposits in size. The legislation contains a number of \nprovisions supported by the SEC that are intended to allow mutual funds \nto operate more flexibly. These provisions include allowing the SEC to \nrequire mutual funds to provide shareholders with more current \ninformation and to maintain additional records that will be available \nto the SEC. Given the importance that mutual funds now have as an \ninvestment vehicle for millions of American households, it is crucial \nthat information be available for mutual fund shareholders, and these \nprovisions address that need. Both the Senate and House bills contained \nprovisions creating a new exemption for funds open solely to \nsophisticated investors know as qualified purchasers. In the conference \nreport, the House and Senate reached a compromise on the definition of \nqualified purchaser.\n  With respect to the role of the States in securities regulation, let \nme say that State securities regulators play a crucial role in policing \nour markets. Still, dual regulation need not mean duplicative \nregulation. The State regulators themselves have convened a task force \nto recommend how securities regulation can be made more efficient and \neffective by dividing authority between the Federal and State level. \nThis conference report retains the provision of the Senate bill, that \nthe SEC may preempt State laws only with respect to securities traded \non the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the \nNASDAQ, or other exchanges with substantially similar listing \nstandards. The provision in the House bill would have preempted State \nlaw for securities not traded on an exchange. The conference report \ndoes contain preemption provisions from the House bill that were not \npresent in the Senate bill, addressing secondary trading and regulation \nof brokerage firms.\n  The House and Senate compromised on the investment adviser provisions \nof the Senate bill. These would have removed investment advisory firms \nwith $25 million or more under management from State regulation. The \nconference report provides that investment adviser representatives of \nsuch firms will continue to be licensed by the States in which they \nhave places of business. The bill does not prohibit a State from \nrequiring that investment adviser representatives doing business in \nthat State designate a place of business in the State, such as an \naddress for service of process, for purposes of maintaining State \nlicensing authority over such individuals.\n  This is a moderate bill, and appropriately so, for the Federal and \nState laws governing our securities markets and the participants in \nthose markets are not in need of wholesale changes. All the evidence \nsuggests that the U.S. securities markets are functioning well. \nCompanies continue to raise capital in the U.S. markets in record \namounts. In addition to established businesses, new companies have been \nraising capital in record amounts. Individual investor confidence in \nthe securities markets, measured by direct investment in securities and \ninvestment through mutual funds and pension plans, remains high. The \nU.S. securities markets retain their preeminent position in the world.\n  As passed by the conference, this bill strikes a reasonable balance. \nIt should improve efficiency in the regulation of our securities \nmarkets without unduly limiting the authority of the State regulators, \nthereby exposing investors to sharp practices. The bill received \nsupport from Democratic and Republican House and Senate conferees, and \nwas passed by the House unanimously 2 days ago. I am pleased that the \nHouse and Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, were able to reach \nconsensus on this legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be considered as adopted, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and statements relating to the report appear at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 3 \nhours of debate on the conference report equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I designate myself as being in charge of \nthe time for this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  We have decided and the reality is that we will pass this bill. Under \nthe unanimous-consent agreement we entered into yesterday, we will have \na cloture vote on Thursday, it is obvious that there are well in excess \nof 60 votes for passage of this conference report. Unfortunately, for \nreasons that are not clear to me, the other side has chosen to delay \nuntil Thursday that cloture vote. Then, of course, there is the \npossibility of utilizing time after that.\n  Meanwhile, funding for much-needed projects is being held up. Funding \nfor projects that are vital, in the view of many States throughout the \ncountry, which I will be describing at a later time, is being held up. \nI do not know why it is being held up. I do not know if it is at the \nbehest of the Teamsters Union. I do not know if it is at the behest of \nsome other labor unions. I do not know why. This provision was inserted \nby the Senator of South Carolina in conference and voted and carried \nnearly unanimously. It was the correction of a technical error. Now, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has tied up the Senate, going through \nthe arcane obstruction and delay such as having the bill read for \nnearly 5 hours last evening. All but two pages of it were required to \nbe read last night. I do not know why that happened, but the fact is we \nshould be taking up this conference report and passing it right now. \nThere are plenty of Senators who are still in town. We could do it now.\n  Why the Senator from Massachusetts insists on delaying these programs \nand projects--do you know what these programs and projects are? These \nare jobs. These are real jobs for working men and women around America \nwho want to move forward to take their jobs and are now precluded from \ndoing so until this conference report is signed.\n  The fiscal year ended last night at midnight. We are now a little \nmore than 14 hours into the new fiscal year and thousands, literally \nthousands of men and women who are not working on these critically \nneeded airport projects. We are now 14 hours into the new fiscal year \nwhere much needed improvements having to do with aviation safety and \nairport security are not being accomplished. We will go into Thursday \nat minimum, which is 2 more days away. Then the conference report is \nsigned. Then it has to go to the President's desk for signature. We \ncould be talking about several days, all because the Senator from \nMassachusetts objects to us moving ahead and voting on the conference \nreport which has the overwhelming support of the Members of the Senate. \nLet me be clear, the provision in question was proposed on his side of \nthe aisle in the conference, which was a technical correction to a \ndrafting error and we all\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nknow it was a technical correction--that is all.\n  I say to the men and women who want to go to work, who want to help \nbuild their communities, who want to improve aviation safety and \nairport security, who want to do the things that this Congress and the \nAmerican people want them to do, I am sorry; I am sorry this bill is \nbeing held up for no good reason. People can draw their own conclusions \nas to why this legislation is being held up.\n  There is no excuse for it. There is no reason for it. I know that \npeople who are members of airport authorities, people who are involved \nin small businesses around the airports that supply the equipment and \nall the materials that go into the various airport construction and \nmodernization projects around this country are asking the same \nquestion.\n  Now, perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts does not care about these \nsmall business people. Most of them are not union people. They do not \ngive $35 million to defeat incumbent Republican Congressmen and \nSenators. No, they do not. They are just small business men and women \naround America who are trying to do their job and have been told these \nconstruction projects would move forward at the beginning of the fiscal \nyear.\n  Now they are not. Now they are not. They are being held up.\n  It is interesting that we should have the deep concern and abiding \nconcern about raising the minimum wage to help men and women around \nAmerica. I wonder how many months at the current minimum wage increase \nthese people are going to have to work in order to make up for the days \nand possibly weeks that are involved in the delay that is being \norchestrated by the Senator from Massachusetts and a handful of other \nSenators on the other side of the aisle. I am going to try to get those \ncalculations done between now and Thursday.\n  I think it is unconscionable. I think it is outrageous. I strongly \nrecommend that the Senator from Massachusetts, for the sake of his own \nState, for the sake of the programs in his own State, would want to \nmove forward so these people can go to work, so these airports can be \nimproved, so we can get these much needed airport projects done.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you what is in Massachusetts. General \nEdward Lawrence Logan Airport in Boston, MA, $3,691,173; Nantucket \nMemorial Airport, Nantucket, MA, $949,962; the Barnstable Municipal \nAirport in Hyannis, $797,690; Martha's Vineyard Airport, $500,000; \nWorcester Municipal Airport, $500,000; New Bedford Regional Airport, \n$500,000; Provincetown Municipal Airport, $500,000--a total of \n$7,438,826 in Federal dollar entitlements, matched by $3,539,692 in \nFederal dollar State apportionments--a total of $10,978,518 the people \nof Massachusetts right now are being deprived of.\n  I do not understand it. I do not understand it, especially since this \nfight is over. This fight is over because we all know what is going to \nhappen on Thursday.\n  ``General Edward Lawrence Logan Airport, Federal Aviation Grants, $2 \nmillion, Noise Grant Program, Funding Crisis Alert.''\n  This is from the mayor, Mayor Thomas M. Menino, City of Boston.\n\n       General Edward Lawrence Logan Airport, Federal Aviation \n     Grants, $2 million, Noise Grant Program, Funding Crisis \n     Alert.\n       A crisis exists which threatens future grants for airports.\n       Excise taxes, including the airline ticket tax, which funds \n     federal airport grant programs, have expired.\n       Congress must pass a short-term extension of these taxes in \n     order to make the aviation trust fund solvent again.\n       Please urge Boston's representatives in Congress to save \n     the airport program.\n\n  Save the airport program? Mr. President, I want to tell the mayor of \nBoston I will do everything I can, but I suggest that he contact \nSenator Kennedy.\n  This is harsh language. These are harsh things I am saying in the \nSenate Chamber. I realize that. It is late in the season. We are in a \npolitical campaign. But I want to repeat, there is no rationale or \nexcuse. I see the Senator from Massachusetts on the floor, so I \ndirectly ask the Senator from Massachusetts--I directly beg him to let \nus move forward and have a vote immediately, an immediate vote on the \nconference report. He has already lost. Let us have a vote on the \nconference report now and let us get this over with, get the bill to \nthe President of the United States and have him sign it so we can move \nforward with these critical airport projects and let the working men \nand women all over America who want to begin work on $9 billion worth \nof projects, let them get to work. Let these airport related \nimprovements be made. Let the aviation safety and airport security \nprograms be implemented.\n  I will read in just a minute the safety and security provisions that \nare in this bill which are being held up because of the Senator from \nMassachusetts' reluctance to allow us to move forward. Mr. President, \nthere are various airport security and aviation safety projects which \nare in this bill, which I will not read at this time, but I can tell \nyou that there are at least 100 or more all over the United States.\n  Let me tell you about some of the aviation safety and airport \nsecurity provisions. This bill requires the FAA to study and report to \nCongress on whether some security responsibilities should be \ntransferred from airlines to airports and/or the Federal Government. \nThe FAA is directed to certify companies providing airport security \nscreening. This legislation, as soon as the President signs it, \nbolsters weapons and explosive detecting technology by encouraging \nresearch and development. It requires that background and criminal \nhistory records checks be conducted on airport security screeners and \ntheir supervisors. It requires the FAA to facilitate the interim \ndeployment of currently available explosive detection equipment. It \nrequires the FAA to audit effectiveness of criminal history records \nchecks. It encourages the FAA to assist in the development of passenger \nprofiling systems. It permits the Airport Improvement Program and \nPassenger Facility Charge funds to be used for safety and security \nprojects at airports.\n  Mr. President, the Airport Improvement Program funds cannot be used \nfor such safety and security projects at airports unless the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts lets us move forward with this bill.\n  The FAA and FBI must develop a security liaison agreement. We cannot \nbegin on that. The FAA and FBI must carry out joint threat assessments \nof high-risk airports. We cannot begin on that.\n  It requires the periodic assessments of all passenger and air carrier \nsecurity systems. It requires a report to Congress on recommendations \nto enhance and supplement screening of air cargo.\n  Mr. President, on aviation safety, it eliminates the dual mandate and \nreiterates safety be the highest priority for the FAA. It facilitates \nthe flow of the FAA operational and safety information. The FAA may \nwithhold voluntarily submitted information.\n  It authorizes the FAA to establish standards for the certification of \nsmall airports to improve safety of such airports. It directs the NTSB \nand FAA should work together to improve safety data classification so \nas to make it more accessible and consumer friendly and then publishes \nit.\n  It requires the sharing of pilot's employment records between former \nand prospective employers to ensure marginally qualified pilots are not \nhired. It discourages attempts by child pilots to set records or \nperform other aeronautical feats.\n  It also requires the FAA and NTSB to work together to develop a \nsystem so that the notification of the next of kin can be done in the \nmost humane and compassionate fashion.\n  I do not know why the Senator from Massachusetts will not let us move \nforward. I ask at this time unanimous consent that we move immediately \nto the conference report and vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection it heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go \nimmediately to the bill on the calendar on the FAA authorization that \nis without the labor provisions.\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from \nMassachusetts knows full well the House of Representatives, the other \nbody, is out and is not coming back. The Senator from Massachusetts \nalso knows----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order, Mr. President. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was stating my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the House of Representatives is subject \nto the call of the Chair by the Speaker. As time-honored practice and \nprocedures, they have followed that on countless occasions. I am glad \nwe were able to clear the air of some of the comments that were made \nearlier by the Senator from Arizona.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish very much that we had been able to have passage \nof the FAA conference report. My friends and colleagues have talked \nabout the urgency of these various programs. I do not know what delayed \nthe members of the committee itself, or the conference, from bringing \nit to the Senate in these last hours. With all the points that were \nraised by the Senator from Arizona, I would have thought we would have \nhad an opportunity to have this matter earlier in the consideration of \nthe Senate Calendar. I do not know what happened during the course of \nthose discussions or debate, but clearly the Republicans chaired those \nconferences and they bear a direct responsibility as to when those \nconferences are going to report back.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona saying that, now that we have this \nin these final moments of the Congress, now we have to act. We ask: \nWhere was this conference earlier in the course of this session? Why \ndid we not act on it at an earlier period of time? Why is it one of the \nlast pieces of legislation that we have before the Senate?\n  Clearly, it is because those who support this provision, which is the \nsubject of our debate and discussion here this afternoon, felt they \ncould jam the Senate in terms of this particular provision.\n  That is an old technique. The Senator from Arizona is familiar with \nit, as I am familiar with it. We ought to put it in some kind of a \ncontext.\n  The fact remains, Mr. President, when we had the continuing \nresolution before us yesterday, I was prepared to offer the FAA \nconference report without this special provision that benefits only one \ncompany and that will give it particular advantages, which it does not \nhave at the present time, over the ability of their workers to organize \ninto a union. But that was objected to by the Republicans.\n  Now they are saying, ``Well, why didn't we pass this?'' And they try \nto put the blame on the Senator from Massachusetts. We could have \npassed this overwhelmingly. I don't think there would have been a vote \nagainst it, if we had done it yesterday with a 10-minute time \nconsideration. But, no, there was objection to that.\n  Now we say, ``All right, let's get into why now our Republican \nfriends and some Democrats want to have this longer, drawn-out process \nand procedure.''\n  Mr. President, I want to address a few issues here this afternoon. We \nhave other colleagues who will come to the floor who I hope will enter \ninto this.\n  First of all, I want to point out that I wish that those who are \nsaying that somehow we are delaying this and somehow there are safety \nconsiderations, I wish they had acted on those concerns yesterday. We \ncould have done this. We could have passed it. Effectively, they said, \n``No, we're not going to do that, we're not going to pass the FAA \nconference report without that special interest provision. We refuse to \ndo it, even though the conference report has all those safety \nmechanisms.''\n  And now after they refuse to do it, they come over here on the floor \nand say, ``We should pass it right away. I ask consent we pass it right \naway because of these safety provisions.''\n  I think it is important to understand, and I know there are members \nof the committee who have a great deal more knowledge and experience \nabout what is in this bill, but as I understand it, the operation \naccount, which funds air traffic controllers, safety inspectors, \nsecurity personnel, airport noise personnel, maintenance personnel, as \nwell as everything and everyone that runs air traffic in the United \nStates, not one of those operations is affected by the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  Also, security personnel who operate the metal detectors to screen \nbaggage are employees of the airlines who use the terminal, and, \ntherefore, are unaffected by this legislation.\n  Second, the facilities and equipment account pays for the display \nterminals, air traffic controllers, look-out radar equipment and other \nequipment used in the aviation industry. None of this is affected by \nthe FAA reauthorization bill.\n  Third, the research account funds all sorts of aviation research. For \nexample, FAA has funded research on the best x-ray machines for \nchecking bags. All of this research is totally unaffected by the \npending FAA authorization bill.\n  The Airport Improvement Program is the only FAA program that is \naffected by the pending FAA reauthorization bill, as I understand. AIP \nawards grants for airway improvements, and the contract authority for \nthese programs depends upon the passing of the FAA reauthorization \nbill. While the AIP programs may be highly desirable, they do not \naffect the safety of the aviation industry, and those are the facts.\n  I think when we are taking a look at these scare comments, we ought \nto try and put this into some kind of perspective. We are going to have \nan opportunity to vote on this measure in 2 days, in any event, but \nsafety is simply not affected by this bill. We know this is true \nbecause in 1994, the FAA reauthorization bill was not passed for almost \n11 months. There was no question at that time with regard to safety. As \nI say, if there was such the urgency at the time, I suspect the \nRepublicans who bore the responsibility of moving that process would \nhave brought it forward at the time.\n  Mr. President, what is really at issue here, and why are we at this \njuncture? I refer, if I can, to some of the House debate. The House \ndebated this issue. As a matter of fact, with all due respect for those \nwho talk about a technical amendment, this was outside of the \nconference. We have a rule that is generally not enforced, \nhistorically, in this body, but the House does recognize that when \nmatters are outside of the conference, that they have to get a special \nrule. That happened with regard to this particular measure. When all of \nthose people say, ``Well, this was just a technical matter,'' the fact \nis, they needed a separate vote in the House of Representatives.\n  I quote the chairman, the Republican chairman, of the Aviation \nCommittee over in the House of Representatives, Mr. Shuster, when he \nwas questioned about why this new provision was added to the FAA \nreauthorization. Mr. Shuster, in response to Mr. Moakley says:\n\n       I would be happy to respond. Absolutely.\n       It is outrageous, it is outrageous that we even have to \n     deal with this issue this way, because it is nothing more \n     than a technical correction. We think it is fundamentally \n     wrong. . . because this is nothing more than a technical fix.\n\n  That is Mr. Shuster. But even the Parliamentarian understood that was \nnot the case, because they did require separate debate and a separate \nvote.\n  I found reading the House debate very instructive, especially remarks \nby those who have the special responsibility, the members, of the \nAviation Committee.\n  Mr. Lipinski--and I think this really points out quite well in a \nbrief way what this issue is all about when Mr. Lipinski was \nrecognized. He said:\n\n       Let us focus on what this debate is really about. This \n     provision for FedEx is another assault on the American middle \n     class. The American middle class has been attacked for over \n     15 years by our Nation's terrible trade policies, technology, \n     profit driven downsizing, profit-driven deregulation and \n     systematic sinister weakening of unions. How, you ask? Let me \n     explain.\n       During the debate on the rule, I outlined the history of \n     this dubious Federal Express provision. Let us take a closer \n     look at what my colleagues are calling a technical \n     correction.\n\n  During the debate, the House Members were talking about the different \nattempts, the five or six different attempts by Federal Express to have \nthis provision included in other legislation.\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\n  House Republicans tried to attach it to the 1996 omnibus \nappropriations bill, and it failed. House Republicans tried to attach \nit to the NTSB reauthorization, and it failed. House Republicans tried \nto attach it to the Railroad Unemployment Act Amendments, and it \nfailed. Senate Republicans supported to attaching it to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill in committee, and that failed.\n  So the rider was not on the FAA reauthorization bill when it passed \nthe House, it was not on the reauthorization bill that passed the \nSenate, but it was added in the conference.\n  So this is not, Mr. President, just a little technical change. This \nis a long-committed, dedicated effort to, in a very significant and \nimportant way, at the outset, override the litigation which is \ncurrently taking place on this very issue.\n  That is interesting, isn't it? A legislative fix for something that \nis effectively in litigation at the present time in the NLRB. Federal \nExpress wasn't taking a chance that the NLRB might rule in one \nparticular way, and they wanted a legislative fix. They tried and tried \nand tried and tried again.\n  This is not a technical fix, Mr. President. This is a very \npurposeful, directed, well-organized effort to change the rules of the \ngame right in the middle of the game. Change the rules. Why do I say \n``change the rules in the middle''? Because it is, at the present time, \nin litigation. And what one side, Federal Express, is trying to do, is \nchange the rules in the middle of that litigation.\n\n  Let me just continue with what Mr. Lipinski said:\n\n       During the debate on the rule, I outlined the history of \n     this dubious Federal Express provision. Let us take a closer \n     look at what my colleagues are calling a technical \n     correction.\n       The last express carrier, as defined by the ICC, went out \n     of existence 20 years ago, so at the ICC's suggestion the \n     classification was removed from the statute because it was \n     obsolete.\n       But suddenly, after the ICC bill is signed into law, one \n     company and its countless consultants decided that it might \n     want to be an express carrier some day and started knocking \n     on doors up here.\n       I have already outlined the five other times FedEx has \n     tried to get this provision into law. Judging by the \n     consistent effort and expense they have gone to, it must \n     really be important for them to remove this dead \n     classification.\n       But why? Federal Express would not go through all this \n     trouble if they were not going to get something out of it. \n     The fact is that it is much more difficult for a union to \n     organize under the Railway Labor Act than under the National \n     Labor Relations Act.\n\n  Mr. President, I explained that earlier. Under the Railway Labor Act, \nyou have to have a national bargaining unit. Under the NLRB, you have \nlocal bargaining units. And each law applies to those relevant \nbargaining units.\n  What the purpose of this legislation is is to short-circuit the \nNLRB's making a judgment to put the trucking aspects of Federal Express \nunder the Railway Labor Act, which will make it much more difficult for \nthem to ever obtain union representation.\n  I continue:\n\n       Under the RLA a unit of the company would have to be \n     organized company-wide, while under the NLRA it can be done \n     facility by facility.\n       Why is this relevant for a company like Federal Express, \n     which is currently classified as an air carrier and already \n     subject to the RLA? Federal Express' operations have changed. \n     No longer does every package get on a plane. Often it just \n     goes on a truck to its destination.\n       I understand that Federal Express' long-term plan is to \n     truck in packages less than 400 miles away from their hubs \n     around the country. Why would an airline like Federal Express \n     rely so much upon trucks? Because it is cheaper. To their \n     credit, Federal Express is planning for the future to remain \n     competitive. It sure seems to be working.\n\n  They know where they are going, Federal Express. They are going into \nthe trucks to deal with these issues. And they are trying to be \ncharacterized as an air carrier so that they will have different rules \nfor the road in order to be able to halt the ability of the organizers \nto be able to go forward.\n  Mr. President, that position was stated just as accurately--and I \nwould refer my colleagues and friends to Mr. Oberstar's statement which \neffectively says the same; and Mr. Nadler from New York, who \neffectively says the same. These are members of the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. These are not just Members \nof the U.S. House of Representatives, these are members of the \ncommittee of knowledge.\n  What they refer to, Mr. President, about this change is the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995 and the conference report. And if you look in \nthe conference report, the general jurisdiction issues--first of all, \nif you look at page 154, you will see the Railway Labor Act amendments. \nIn the first paragraph, the amendment strikes the term ``express \ncompany''--that is the term of art.\n  Then under the amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act's general \njurisdiction provisions, it states, ``outdated references to express \nand sleeping car carriers which no longer exist, would be removed.''\n  And then you go on to the back and look and see who signed it. You \nfind out that the signatories were all the members of the conference \ncommittee, Republican and Democratic alike. They all signed it. This \nidea that this suddenly slipped in the drafting of the measure, that \nsomehow people did not quite understand, that it really is technical, \nit runs completely to the contrary.\n  It runs contrary to what the Congressional Research Service has \nfound. It runs contrary to the explicit words in the legislation. It \nruns contrary to the conference report, which bears the signatories of \nthe Democratic and Republican members of this conference committee here \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  That happens to be the bottom line, Mr. President. We understand that \nwhat FedEx has tried to do over a long period of time was rejected. And \nit was rejected because it was such an outrageous grab for preferential \nconsideration by one company, and the history of it that demonstrates \nquite clearly that the effect of this particular change would \ndramatically alter and change the current litigation in which Federal \nExpress is very much involved.\n  Mr. President, I come back now to what really this issue is all \nabout, as far as I am concerned. It is not just so much all of these \nkinds of references, which I am sure during the course of the debate in \nthe afternoon we will come back to, but I want to just get back to how \nFederal Express treats its employees. That is what we are basically \ntalking about, how these changes are going to affect the welfare and \nthe well-being of these various employees.\n  In 1991, Federal Express employees had gone 7 years without a pay \nincrease. Today, we celebrated the increase in the minimum wage. We \nwent 5 years without an increase in the minimum wage. In 1980, the \nminimum wage provided a livable wage for a family of three. Now, this \nyear, prior to this day, a family of three would be $3,000 below the \npoverty wage.\n  We had a commitment in this country, Republicans and Democrats, to \nsay that we are for men and women who are going to work for a living, \nthat they be provided a living wage so they honor work. That is a fair \nand just position. We had difficulty in getting that measure even voted \non here in the U.S. Senate. Republican leaders in the House and Senate \nrefused to even be willing to give us a vote on it. Then, when we got \nan agreement to vote on it, they wanted to reduce it; and then after we \npassed it, they wanted to delay its implementation.\n  But today it went into effect for 4.6 million Americans--4.6 million, \nand $1,000 a year, $20 a week. And that went into effect.\n  But here, Mr. President, we have the Federal Express employees for 7 \nyears without a pay increase. And the company planned to reduce the \ndrivers' work hours and substitute temporary employees. That is what \nignited the initial organizing drive in 1991. Federal Express responded \nby giving the workers a pay increase in 1992 and 1993.\n  But during the last 3 years, despite the booming business, Federal \nExpress employees have not received any raise, and the company recently \nannounced there would be no further across-the-board increases.\n  So the Federal Express employees are in the process of organizing a \nunion. They want a better deal. And what are the kind of grievances \nthey have?\n  Well, there is Al Ferrier. He has been a tractor-trailer driver for \nFederal Express for 17 years. He wants a better deal. He has had three \nknee surgeries, a shoulder surgery, following on-the-job injury. Mr. \nFerrier was recently diagnosed with cancer. Federal Express responded \nto Mr. Ferrier's misfortune by giving him 90 days to find a new job.\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\n  Joe Coleman wants a better deal, too. He was Federal Express's \nlongest service employee when the company fired him. With no union, \nthere was no grievance procedure to protect him or to even give him a \nchance to prove that his dismissal was unjust.\n  I could take literally hours to go through this. I do not know \nwhether Al Ferrier or Joe Coleman are going to have the support of \ntheir colleagues to be able to say that ``we want to be organized to \npursue those,'' or not. I do not know that. We do not know in this \nparticular forum whether they do or they do not. But they ought to at \nleast be given a chance. We should not have the rug pulled out from \nunder them. We should not change the rules of the road at a time when \nthat issue is before the NLRB, and that is what this language does.\n\n  It is saying to the Al Ferriers and the Joe Colemans, and the \ncountless other workers who feel they have not been treated fairly, we \nare going to take your opportunities away because we are going to \nchange the rules of the game and put you under the Railway Labor Act, \nwhich means you are not going to try and just convince all of these in \nyour local community or in your town; you are going to have to \neffectively convince everyone in this country because of the outreach \nof Federal Express.\n  These are real grievances. These are real families. These are real \nworking men and women that are trying to do this. And all we are just \nsaying is that we are not going to just stand by, by the sleight of the \nhand, and take away the legitimate interests of these working \nfamilies. That is the issue.\n\n  We will hear later on about what we were really intending to do, and \nthat this is really not going to change things. That is what the issue \nis: Whether these men and women have a right under the existing laws, \nexisting laws here in the United States, to be able to make a judgment \nand a determination by convincing some, ``Come with us and let us form \na union;'' or maybe they will be defeated.\n  We are not making a judgment on that. All we are saying to those who \nsupport our position is let them play by the rules that exist today--\nnot in this legislation, not in this legislation that is being enacted \nhere that was changed, which was never in the bill that passed the \nHouse or in the bill that passed the Senate and was basically discarded \non a half a dozen different occasions and needed a special rule in the \nHouse of Representatives, even with people saying this is just a \ntechnical change, a technical change.\n  Well, the House Republican Parliamentarian understood this is \ncertainly more than a technical change when he studied it and ruled on \nit. He understood it was more than a technical change. That is the only \nprovision, the only provision of the conference report they had an \nindependent vote on, because it was outside the scope and added at the \nfinal hour.\n  Mr. President, that is what we are looking at. Now we can say, well, \nis this really an isolated kind of circumstance in regard to Federal \nExpress? I was absolutely startled reading through their pamphlets on \nthe questions of what they were going to do about workers and how they \nwould consider those that might want to get into a union. It is clear \nin reading through that book--and I see other colleagues that want to \nspeak, so I will just touch on this point briefly. There is no question \nthat the Federal Express is antiworker and the Federal Express Co. is \nnot shy about its antiunion attitude. They distribute to managers a \nlabor law book with specific instructions on how to prevent \nunionization efforts. On page 2 of the handbook Federal Express tells \nthe managers, ``Our corporate goal is to remain union-free. We all have \nthe responsibility of making unions unnecessary at Federal Express.'' \nFederal Express devotes a whole chapter to what are indications of \nunion activity, and in one chapter they advise supervisors to be on the \nlookout for these signs and report problems by calling your local \npersonnel representative, the Employee Relations Department in Memphis. \nWhat are these sinister signs? Employees begin leaving the premises for \nlunch in unusual numbers; employees show unusual interest in \ncompensation, personnel, and other company policies.\n  Mr. President, maybe they are in the union, maybe they are not. I am \nnot saying one way or the other, but we ought not to say we are going \nto change the rules of the road. If Federal Express has that attitude, \nso be it. But we ought to understand it and it makes it much clearer in \nunderstanding what this proposal is about, what this proposal is about \nand what their intention is about.\n  It is just a measure we wanted to make sure conformed with the \nprevious legislation. You put this evidence together about what the \nactivities of Federal Express have been, the efforts they have gone to \nchange this, what their own corporate attitude is, what their \nconditions are in terms of their employees, and you find out and see \nvery clearly what has been happening with regard to Federal Express \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, there are others here that want to address the Senate \nbut I will conclude with these brief remarks. There is no question that \nthis provision was put in here purposely to affect Federal Express' \nclear interests. That has been demonstrated during the course of the \ndebate not just in the U.S. Senate, but the House of Representatives \nand the actions by Federal Express. They are entitled, as a company, to \npursue whatever interests they might have--I recognize that-- but not \nto change the rules in the middle of the game. That is what they are \ndoing--changing the ground rules.\n  Americans understood fair play. They see it every day. They saw it \nlast night in the Dallas-Philadelphia game. They understand fair play. \nThey understand you have a set of rules, you play by them. Not Federal \nExpress. They want the rules changed, and not changed just for the \nfuture--in order to be able to carry forward their company policy to \nmaintain themselves really free from pursuit of grievances by workers, \nand by undermining litigation that is currently in place.\n  We do not do that around here very often. We do not take legislative \naction to pull the ground out from families and workers in our country \nthat are playing by the rules and thought they would play by this set \nof rules, and then to be in litigation and find out the Congress in the \nlast hour is playing by a different set of rules. We do not act around \nhere just to benefit one company. We take action clearly in a general \nway. There will be particular companies that are going to, for one \nreason or another, be adversely affected and impacted in an unfair and \nunjust way. We address those. We try to. We never do it as effectively \nas I think the public thinks we should. That is always complicated and \ndifficult.\n  That is not what this is about. That is not what this is about. That \nis not this circumstance. This is a clear power grab by Federal Express \nto carry forward its antiworker philosophy, and it is changing the \nrules in the middle of the game. It is basically unworthy for the \nSenate to favor that particular position. All we are trying to do is to \nget that provision removed. We could have tried yesterday but we were \nprevented from doing that by the Republican leadership--to say OK, we \nwill pass the FAA without this provision, send it over to the House, \nand as all of us know, everyone in this body knows, the House of \nRepresentatives is subject to the call of the Chair. This would fly \nthrough the House of Representatives. We heard the same arguments when \nwe had the minimum wage that we could not pass, just before the August \nrecess, because the House was going to be out. We had it on Lodine. If \nMembers will remember, there was a special tax provision for one \nparticular company that was added to an agricultural appropriation in \nthe last hours and here on the floor of the Senate there was such a row \nby Members--Republican and Democrat alike--that this was a special \nprovision for a special company. We heard at that time, ``We cannot do \nthat now because the House of Representatives is not there.'' We know \nthe House of Representatives at the call of the Chair passes those \nmeasures.\n  Given the vote in the House of Representatives, given the vote in the \nHouse of Representatives which was so incredibly close, a 20-vote \ndifference, with 30 Republicans in the House of Representatives voting \nwith the Democrats. Mr. President, 30 Republicans voted with the \nDemocrats because they felt this kind of procedure was unworthy, 30 \nRepublicans, and 15 Democrats went the other way. It was decided in the \nHouse by 20 votes.\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\n  Mr. President, they had the full debate. They understand this is a \ngreat deal more than just a technical amendment. It is a substance \namendment. We ought to free this legislation from it and pass this \nlegislation and get on with the rest of the country's business.\n  Could I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 58 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nI will be very brief because the Senator from South Carolina is waiting \nto speak.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts keeps alleging that \nsomehow we could pass this bill by removing this legislative provision \nand then getting it passed. And clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts \nis entitled to that opinion.\n  Unfortunately, it is not shared by the Democratic leader, Mr. \nDaschle, who had a press briefing this morning which I will quote from:\n\n       Question. Isn't the bottom line on this FedEx business, \n     that if you don't pass the bill, and you do pass some sort of \n     a continuing funding resolution or mechanism, that FedEx does \n     not get its way and that the Teamsters do?\n       Daschle. Well, it's more complicated than that. At this \n     point, we can't send a bill back to the House because I don't \n     anticipate that they'll come back.\n       And because they won't come back, and there's no desire to. \n     Any change we'd have to make would require unanimous consent. \n     We're told any change to this bill would not acquire the \n     necessary unanimous consent agreement there.\n       And as a result, we are really left with the conference \n     agreement that has now been written. So our options are very, \n     very limited. So it's not even a question of who wins or who \n     loses with regard to that specific provision, the question \n     is, are we going to pass a conference report that really \n     needed to be passed yesterday?\n       Question. You've passed it, you've got a funding problem.\n       Daschle. Exactly.\n       Question. And you can't resolve that either.\n       Daschle. We can't resolve that. I mean, we have--short of \n     bringing the House of Representatives back into session, we \n     can't find another way, another vehicle, another funding \n     mechanism.\n       And as I indicated, that the leadership in the House have \n     already made it known that they don't plan to come back.\n       Question: So you've got to pass this bill?\n       Daschle. We've got to pass this bill.\n\n  I am sorry that the Senator from Massachusetts does not agree with \nhis elected leader here in his party, who clearly says we have to pass \nthis bill, which he also says we should have passed yesterday.\n  Why should we have passed it yesterday, Mr. President? Because there \nare thousands of men and women who are workers who are not working, who \nwould be working if the Senator from Massachusetts had allowed this \nbill to pass, rather than have the bill read last night for 5 hours, as \nhe did, and keeping this body tied up.\n  Mr. President, let me also point out that everybody is entitled to \ntheir opinion, but not everybody is entitled to their facts. The facts \nare that the Senator from Massachusetts stated that only Airport \nImprovement Program moneys, aviation improvement fund moneys, would be \naffected by the lack of passage of this bill. Mr. President, that is \nnot correct. The aviation trust fund is unique. The Finance Committee \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation have studied this issue, and their \nstaff state that the language in the code regarding ``meeting \nobligations of the United States,'' which, I repeat, is unique to this \none section of the code, effectively means that all spending out of the \ntrust funds bill will be stopped.\n  This means countless aviation safety programs, jobs, and airport \nconstruction programs will be affected, and are affected as we speak, \nbut will be more affected as we wait until Thursday and will be more \naffected between the time the bill is passed and goes to the \nPresident's desk. Furthermore, if this bill is not passed, we cannot \nhave criminal history background checks and the FAA will not be able to \ndeploy $175 million for explosive detection technologies--many which \nare made in Massachusetts. I repeat, this information comes from the \nFinance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation both.\n  So the Senator from Massachusetts does not have his facts correct on \nwhat is stopping being funded. Let me give a brief comment on some of \nthe projects that we have already heard from--some of the programs that \nare stopped: Providence, RI, debt service for a new terminal, letter of \nintent; Philadelphia, PA, site preparation for new commuter runway; \nIthaca, NY, entitlement for runway project, phase 2; Albany County, NY, \nnew terminal project; Parkersburg, WV, mud slide; Parkersburg, WV, \nfinish a new airport; Buckhannon, WV, site preparation for runway \nextension; Buffalo, NY, terminal project, letter of intent; Portland, \nOR, runway reconstruction; Denver, CO, debt service for new airport, \nletter of intent; Seattle, WA, ongoing noise program; Memphis, TN, \ncash-flow problem.\n  The list goes on and on, Mr. President. We are already hearing from \nthe airport managers who are not able to move forward on these critical \nairport projects. They are not able to move forward.\n  Mr. President, look, I am not familiar with FedEx. I certainly have \nknown many of their employees. There are 125,000 of them. Allegation: \nJoe Coleman was fired and received no grievance. Joe Coleman was fired \nand received no grievance procedure. Truth: FedEx has an internal \ngrievance procedure, and Mr. Coleman appealed his discharge and was \nreinstated in 1991. He subsequently quit. Allegation: Al Ferrier \nreceived injuries and was told to find a new job in 90 days. Truth: Mr. \nFerrier was offered a full-time job, which he turned down, a month ago.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know the facts of these cases. These are other \nresponses to them. What the Senator from Massachusetts says may be \ntrue, but I have different information.\n  But what cannot be disputed here, Mr. President, is that thousands of \nworkers are not working today or tomorrow or Thursday because the \nSenator from Massachusetts refuses to allow this bill to move forward \nand the conference report to be voted on, and that includes aviation \nsafety and airport security.\n  Mr. President, let me finally say that this legislation does not \nprevent Federal Express from being subject to union organization. \nFederal Express will be treated as every other major corporation in \nAmerica, which I hope the Senator from South Carolina will elaborate \non, and will be subject to all of the laws that apply to all companies \nand corporations in the United States. If the workers of Federal \nExpress want to become unionized, they will be allowed to do so under \nexisting law.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina such time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts has just spewed out such a \nbunch of nonsense that it is hard to know where to begin. One is with \nrespect to Federal Express. Like the Senator from Arizona, I am \nlearning about Federal Express. I refer, Mr. President, to ``The 100 \nBest Companies to Work for in America,'' by Robert Levrig and Milton \nMoskowitz, of last year. On page 121:\n\n       The Federal Express invented overnight parcel delivery. \n     U.S. employees: 77,700.\n\n  It is now over 105,000 domestic, and a total of 125,000, growing at \n15 percent per year. But this particular edition has the top-top rating \nof five stars, and really about the highest rating is four stars. \nThumbing through this when I was given it, I could not find any other \ncompany with the five stars. Let me show you immediately under that \nparticular provision. On pay and benefits, Federal Express is rated \nfour stars; under opportunities, four stars; under job security, five \nstars; in pride in work and company, four stars; openness and fairness, \nfive stars; camaraderie and friendliness, four stars. The biggest plus, \n``you probably won't get zapped.'' Biggest minus, ``you may not be an \novernight success.''\n  Now, since the distinguished Senator has raised the point that the \nSenator from South Carolina is zapping the employees, I thought I would \nhave to read that. At least Federal Express hasn't raised that point, \nor zapped anyone, according to that best-of-the-best edition. So I more \nor less have to clear the record to defend my record, because we are \nnot about zapping employees. We are not about end-running. We are not \nabout changing the rules in the middle of the game.\n  The truth is, Mr. President, that if we had known last December 22 \nthat the little phrase ``express company'' was being dropped from the \nICC Termination Act, and they would have said,\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\n ``Senator, we are going to have to drop this provision,'' I would have \nsaid, ``Wait a minute,'' if I would have known it, and I would have \nmade that exact charge: You can't change the rules in the middle of the \ngame.\n  Why do I say that? Because those same employees he talks about over \nin Philadelphia have had 5 years with their lawyer, and unlike what the \nSenator from Massachusetts has said about the board--I will read his \nstatement from the Congressional Record. I refer to yesterday's Record \nat page S11854:\n\n       Federal Express challenged the petition, arguing that the \n     entire company, including its truck drivers, is covered by \n     the Railway Labor Act, not the National Labor Relations Act, \n     and that therefore the bargaining unit for its truck drivers \n     must be nationwide. The board has not yet decided the issue.\n\n  Absolutely false.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts of the \ndecision of the board.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Mediation Board,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 1995.\n     Jeffrey D. Wedekind,\n     Acting Solicitor, National Labor Relations Board, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Re NMB File No. CJ-6463 (NLRB Case 41-RC-17698).\n\n       Dear Mr. Wedekind: This responds to your request dated July \n     17, 1995, for the National Mediation Board's (Board's) \n     opinion as to whether Federal Express Corporation (Federal \n     Express or FedEx) and certain of its employees is subject to \n     the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. Sec. 151, et \n     seq. The Board's opinion, based upon the materials provided \n     by your office and the Board's investigation is that Federal \n     Express and all of its employees are subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   i.\n\n       This case arose as the result of a representation petition \n     filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by the \n     International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). The UAW \n     initially sought to represent a unit of Federal Express's \n     employees including ``all regular full and part-time hourly \n     ground service employees in the Liberty District.'' On \n     December 9, 1991, the UAW amended its petition to exclude \n     ``ramp agents, ramp agent/feeders, handlers, senior handlers, \n     heavyweight handlers, senior heavy weight handlers, checker \n     sorters, senior checker/sorters, shuttle drivers, shuttle \n     driver/handlers, office clerical employees, engineers, guards \n     and supervisors as defined in the Act [NLRB].'' The titles \n     remaining in the UAW's petition include: service agents, \n     senior service agents, international document agents, \n     couriers, courier/handlers, tractor-trailer drivers, \n     dispatchers, courier/non-drivers and operations agents.\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express' Liberty District are employees subject to \n     the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The UAW acknowledges \n     that pilots and aircraft mechanics employed by Federal \n     Express are subject to the Railway Labor Act. However, the \n     UAW contends that the two-part test traditionally employed by \n     the Board to determine whether an entity is a carrier should \n     be applied to the unit of employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express' Liberty District. According to the UAW, the \n     employees it seeks to represent in the Liberty District do \n     not perform airline work and are not ``integral to Federal \n     Express' air transportation functions.''\n       Federal Express asserts that it is a carrier subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act and, as a carrier, all of its employees are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express notes that \n     the Board and the courts have repeatedly found it to be a \n     carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. According to \n     Federal Express, the job classifications remaining in the \n     petition are integrally related to Federal Express' air \n     transportation activities. Federal Express contends that it \n     is a ``unified operation with fully integrated air and ground \n     services.'' According to Federal Express, allowing some \n     employees to be covered by the National Labor Relations Act \n     and others to be subject to the Railway Labor Act would \n     result in employees being covered by different labor \n     relations statutes as they are promoted up the career ladder.\n       Federal Express contends that the two-part test suggested \n     by the UAW is not appropriate in this case. According to \n     Federal Express, the Board uses the two-part test to \n     determine whether a company is a carrier, not to determine \n     whether specific employees of a carrier perform duties that \n     are covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express \n     cautions that adoption of the test suggested by the UAW \n     ``would drastically alter labor relations at every airline in \n     the country.'' According to Federal Express, under the UAW's \n     test, most categories of employees except pilots, flight \n     attendants and aircraft mechanics would be subject to the \n     NLRA.\n       The Board repeatedly has exercised jurisdiction over \n     Federal Express. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 (1995); \n     Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal Express \n     Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1993); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 126 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express \n     Corp., 19 NMB 297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 \n     (1989); Federal Express/Flying Tiger, 16 NMB 433 (1989); \n     Federal Express, 6 NMB 442 (1978). There is no dispute that \n     Federal Express is a carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act \n     with respect to certain Federal Express employees (i.e. \n     Pilots; Flight Attendants, Global Operations Control \n     Specialists; and Mechanics and Related Employees; Stock \n     Clerks; and Fleet Service Employees). However, the Board has \n     not addressed the issue raised by the UAW: whether or not \n     certain Federal Express employees are subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n       The NLRB initially requested the NMB's opinion as to \n     whether FedEx is subject to the RLA on July 1, 1992. However, \n     on that date, the NLRB granted the UAW's request to reopen \n     the record and the file was returned to the NLRB. The NLRB \n     renewed its request on July 17, 1995 and the NMB received the \n     record on July 31, 1995. The NMB received additional evidence \n     and argument from FedEx and the UAW on August 17, 1995 and \n     September 5, 1995.\n\n\n                                  ii.\n\n       Federal Express, a Delaware corporation, is an air express \n     delivery service which provides worldwide express package \n     delivery. According to Chairman of the Board and Chief \n     Executive Officer Frederick Smith, Federal Express flies the \n     sixth largest jet aircraft fleet in the world.\n       Federal Express' jet aircraft fleet currently includes \n     Boeing 727-100's, Boeing 727-200's, Boeing 737's, Boeing 747-\n     100's, Boeing 747-200's, DC 10-10's, DC-10-30's and \n     McDonnell-Douglass MD-11's. Federal Express also operates \n     approximately 250 feeder aircraft, including Cessna 208's and \n     Fokker 27's. It has over 50 jet aircraft on order.\n       Federal Express currently serves the United States and \n     several countries in the Middle East, Europe, South America \n     and Asia, including Japan, Saudi Arabia and Russia. According \n     to Managing Director of Operations Research Joseph Hinson, \n     Federal Express does not transport freight that moves \n     exclusively by ground to or from the United States.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                            iii. discussion\n\n       The National Mediation Board has exercised jurisdiction \n     over Federal Express as a common carrier by air in numerous \n     published determinations. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 \n     (1995); Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal \n     Express Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 666 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 (1993); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1993); Federal Express \n     Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 126 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 19 NMB \n     297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 (1989); Federal \n     Express/Flying Tiger, 16 NMB 433 (1989); Federal Express, 6 \n     NMB 442 (1978). In eight of those determinations, the Board \n     exercised jurisdiction over ground service employees of \n     Federal Express, 6 NMB 442 (1978). In eight of those \n     determinations, the Board exercised jurisdiction over ground \n     service employees of Federal Express. The substantial record \n     developed in this proceeding provides no clear and convincing \n     evidence to support a different result.\n\n\n                                   a.\n\n       Section 181, which extended the Railway Labor Act's \n     coverage to air carriers, provides:\n       ``All of the provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter \n     except section 153 of this title are extended to and shall \n     cover every common carrier by air engaged in interstate or \n     foreign commerce, and every carrier by air transporting mail \n     for or under contract with the United States Government, and \n     every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an \n     employee or subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, \n     subject to its or their continuing authority to supervise and \n     direct the manner of rendition of his service. 45 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 181. (Emphasis added).\n       Federal Express is an air express delivery service which \n     holds itself out for hire to transport packages, both \n     domestically and internationally. Federal Express and the UAW \n     agree that Federal Express and its air operations employees, \n     such as pilots and aircraft mechanics, are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The disagreement arises over whether \n     Federal Express' remaining employees are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The UAW argues that the employees it seeks \n     to represent do not perform airline work and are not \n     ``integral to Federal Express' air transportation \n     functions.'' Federal Express asserts that all of the \n     employees sought by the UAW are integrally relate to its air \n     express delivery service and are subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act.\n       Since there is no dispute over whether Federal Express is a \n     common carrier by air, the Board focuses on whether the \n     employees sought by the UAW's petition before the NLRB are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. The Act's definition of an \n     employee of an air carrier includes, ``every air pilot or \n     other person who performs any work as an employee or \n     subordinate official of such carrier\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\n     or carriers, subject to its or their continuing authority to \n     supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his \n     service''. The Railway Labor Act does not limit its coverage \n     to air carrier employees who fly or maintain aircraft. \n     Rather, its coverage extends to virtually all employees \n     engaged in performing a service for the carrier so that the \n     carrier may transport passengers or freight.\n       In REA Express, Inc., 4 NMB 253, 269 (1965), the Board \n     found ``over-the-road'' drivers employed by REA subject to \n     the Act stating:\n       ``It has been the Board's consistent position that the fact \n     of employment by a ``carrier'' under the Act is determinative \n     of the status of all that carrier's employees as subject to \n     the Act. The effort to carve out or to separate the so-called \n     over-the-road drivers would be contrary to and do violence to \n     a long line of decisions by this Board which would embrace \n     the policy of refraining from setting up a multiplicity of \n     crafts or classes. As stated above, there is no question that \n     this particular group are employees of the carrier.'' \n     (Emphasis in original).\n       The limit on Section 181's coverage is that the carrier \n     must have ``continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition of . . . [an employee's] service. The \n     couriers, tractor-trailer drivers, operations agents and \n     other employees sought by the UAW are employed by Federal \n     Express directly. As the record amply demonstrates, these \n     employees, as part of Federal Express' air express delivery \n     system, are supervised by Federal Express employees. The \n     Board need not look further to find that all of Federal \n     Express' employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   B.\n\n       In the Board's judgment, the analysis of the jurisdictional \n     question could end here. However, Federal Express and the UAW \n     have directed substantial portions of their arguments the \n     ``integrally related'' test. Specifically, the participants \n     discuss whether the employees the UAW seeks to represent are \n     ``integrally related'' to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions. The Board does not find consideration of the \n     ``integrally related'' test necessary to resolve the \n     jurisdictional issue, however, review of the relevance of \n     this test is appropriate.\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent are \n     not integrally related to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions and therefore are not subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act. Federal Express asserts that the NLRB and federal courts \n     have found its trucking operations integrally related to its \n     air operations.\n       However, the Board does not apply the ``integrally \n     related'' test to the Federal Express employees sought by the \n     UAW. Where, as here, the company at issued is a common \n     carrier by air, the Act's jurisdiction does not depend upon \n     whether there is an integral relationship between its air \n     carrier activities and the functions performed by the \n     carrier's employees in question. The Board need not consider \n     the relationship between the work performed by employees of a \n     common carrier and the air carrier's mission, because section \n     181 encompasses ``every pilot or other person who performs \n     any work as the employee or subordinate official of such \n     carrier or carriers. . . . ''\n       Even if the Board were to assume arguendo that the \n     ``integrally related'' test applies to the facts in this \n     case, the Board would hold in concurrence with the recent \n     decision in Federal Express Corp. v. California PUC, supra, \n     at note 10, that the ``trucking operations of Federal Express \n     are integral to its operations as an air carrier.'' 936 F.2d \n     at 1078. Employees working in the other positions sought by \n     the UAW perform functions equally crucial to Federal Express' \n     mission as an integrated air express delivery service. As the \n     record demonstrates, without the functions performed by the \n     employees at issue, Federal Express could not provide the on-\n     time express delivery required of an air express delivery \n     service.\n       The Board has employed the ``integrally related'' test when \n     it has examined whether to apply the trucking exemption under \n     Sec. 151 of the Act. 0/0 Truck Sales, 21 NMB at 269; Florida \n     Express Carrier, Inc., 16 NMB 407 (1989). Specifically, the \n     board has applied the ``integrally related'' test when it has \n     considered trucking operations conducted by a subsidiary of a \n     carrier or a company in the same corporate family with a \n     carrier. In Florida Express, supra, the Board found Florida \n     Express, a trucking company which is a wholly-owned \n     subsidiary of Florida East Coast Railroad, to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In O/O Truck Sales, \n     supra, the Board found O/O Truck Sales, a trucking and \n     fueling company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSXI \n     (which is commonly owned with CSXT), to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In contrast, Federal \n     Express directly employs truck drivers, couriers and all \n     other employees sought by the UAW's petition.\n\n\n                                   c.\n\n       The UAW argues that the Board should apply the two-part \n     test used by the Board in other factual settings for \n     determining whether an employer and its employees are subject \n     to the Railway Labor Act. See, for example, Miami Aircraft \n     Support, 21 NMB 78 (1993); AMR Services, Corp., 18 NMB 348 \n     (1991). The Board does not apply the two-part test where the \n     company at issue is engaged in common carriage by air or \n     rail. The Board applies the two-part test where the company \n     in question is a separate corporate entity such as subsidiary \n     or a derivative carrier which provides a service for another \n     carrier. In those situations where the Board applies the two-\n     part test, it determines: (1) whether the company at issue is \n     directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a common \n     carrier or carriers; and (2) whether the functions it \n     performs are traditionally performed by employees of air or \n     rail carriers. Under this test, both elements must be \n     satisfied for a company to be subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act. Federal Express is an admitted carrier and the employees \n     at issue are employed directly by Federal Express. \n     Accordingly, the two-part test does not apply to this \n     proceeding.\n       Even if the two-part test were applicable, the employees at \n     issue here would be covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal \n     Express, as a common carrier, has direct control over the \n     positions sought by the UAW. In addition, the Board has found \n     that virtually all of the work performed by employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition is work traditionally performed by \n     employees in the airline industry. For example: couriers, Air \n     Cargo Transport, Inc., 15 NMB 202 (1988); Crew Transit, Inc., \n     10 NMB 64 (1982); truck drivers; Florida Express, Inc., 16 \n     NMB 407 (1989); customer service agents; Trans World \n     International Airlines, Inc., 6 NMB 703 (1979).\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Based upon the entire record in this case and for all of \n     the reasons stated above, the Board is of the opinion that \n     Federal Express Corporation and all of its employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition are subject to the Railway Labor Act. \n     This finding may be cited as Federal Express Corporation, 23 \n     NMB 32 (1995). The documents forwarded with your letter will \n     be returned separately.\n       By direction of the National Mediation Board.\n                                                Stephen E. Crable,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This decision is dated November 22, 1995. You don't \nhave to read the entire decision. It is a very interesting thing, \nbecause back in 1991:\n\n       . . . UAW amended its petition to exclude ``ramp agents, \n     ramp agent/feeders, handlers, senior handlers, heavyweight \n     handlers, senior heavyweight handlers, checker sorters, \n     senior checker/sorters, shuttle drivers, shuttle driver/\n     handlers, office clerical employees, engineers, guards and \n     supervisors as defined under the act.\n\n  So it was not any question about who all was to be covered because \nthey had a chance to amend it. This is 5 years ago when this started. \nBut let me read a couple of other points.\n  This is the National Mediation Board talking. It was a unanimous \ndecision, never appealed and at the NLRB since last November. And in 50 \nyears with 100 cases under the Railway Labor Act, the NLRB has yet to \nreverse it. And if he can show me--I was asking for the Senator or a \nHouse Member--that actually said, let's knock this express company \nreference out, I would jump off the Capitol dome. He can't find it.\n  It was an innocent mistake. It was after this finding of November 22, \n1995, done in December 1995. So it was after the rules of the road that \nare now trying to be changed, and that is why we are trying to correct. \nThat has been the most difficult thing. The Members really have not \nkept up with this at all.\n  But the NLRB requested the National Mediation Board's opinion. This \nis the customary process. I am learning a little bit of labor law. The \nNLRB initially requested the National Mediation Board's opinion as to \nwhether FedEx is subject to the RLA on July 1, 1992. They held it up. \nHowever, on that date, the NLRB granted the UAW's request to reopen the \nrecord and to file with the NLRB.\n  While we hear that the poor workers have been trying to get their day \nin court, their lawyer is up there saying, ``Wait a minute. Hold it up. \nReturn it to the NLRB.'' The NLRB renewed its request on July 17, \n1995--3 years. I said, ``How in the world do you hold things up over \nthere in 3 years?'' They said, ``I will tell you what happened, \nSenator. They have a wild one over there in this fellow Gould who is \nthe chairman.'' And he was trying his dead level best to change the \nprocess of taking those under the Railway Labor Act to be determined by \nthe National Mediation Board and have it determined by the National \nLabor Relations Board itself. He finally got outvoted. He tried for 3 \nyears. He tried for whatever time he was there.\n  But that was the issue. I couldn't understand why they would hold it \nup, and why we have the Senator from Massachusetts crying about the \npoor workers are not having any of their rights, and they are trying to \nplay by the rules. Come on.\n  Here you go. Let me read it to you. The NLRB renewed its request on \nJuly\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\n17, 1995. The National Mediation Board received the record on July 31, \n1995. The National Mediation Board received additional evidence and \nargument from FedEx and the UAW on August 17, 1995, and September 5, \n1995.\n  This is the full unanimous decision of the National Mediation Board--\nNovember 22, 1995, for those who are over there struggling to get their \nday in court. Come on. They had 5 years to go after it. They can start \nagain. I think it ought to be made clear because I want to read some of \nthis to make sure that they all understand that we are not coming in \nhere pulling the rug out from under employees. The Senator from \nMassachusetts says we are ``pulling the rug out''--after 5 years with \ntheir lawyer and everything else of that kind.\n  Everyone should understand that labor is very, very virile and strong \nunder the Railway Labor Act. In fact, 65 percent to 70 percent of \nemployees under the Railway Labor Act are organized, whereas in the \nprivate sector under the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, and \nthe National Labor Relations Act, only 11 percent.\n  So this isn't trying to get a protective situation. We are not \n``pulling the legislative rug out''.\n  Let me just read a couple of parts in the conclusion part because it \nsays:\n\n       The limit on section 181's coverage is that the carriers \n     must have continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition and employees' service, the carriers' \n     tractor-trailer drivers, operations agents, and other \n     employees sought by the UAW employed by Federal Express \n     directly. As the record amply demonstrates, these employees, \n     as part of the Federal Express delivery system, are \n     supervised by Federal Express employees. The Board need not \n     look further to find that all of Federal Express employees \n     are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n  The contention of the Senator from Massachusetts is that we have to \nget the language out of this bill because we in conference tried to \nchange the rules of the road; that we tried to pull the rug out so that \nthey wouldn't be covered by the Railway Labor Act. The truth of the \nmatter is, the very case he refers to in Philadelphia after 5 years and \na unanimous opinion found just what I have read. We are trying to clear \nup the inconsistency of the dropping of the designation, which is \nappropriate and should be done. They know it. Let me read further.\n\n       In the Board's judgment, the analysis of the jurisdictional \n     question should end here.\n\n  However, I want to read a further paragraph.\n\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent are \n     not integrally related to Federal Express's air carrier \n     functions and, therefore, are not subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n\n  Going further, answering that argument on the next page:\n\n       Even if the Board were to assume arguendo that the \n     integrally related test applies to the facts in this case, \n     the Board would hold in concurrence with the recent decision \n     in Federal Express Corporation v. California PUC . . . the \n     trucking operations of Federal Express are integral to its \n     operations as an air carrier. Employees working in the other \n     positions sought by the UAW perform functions equally crucial \n     to Federal Express's mission as an integrated air express \n     delivery service.\n\n  Finally.\n\n       . . . the Board is of the opinion that Federal Express \n     Corporation and all of its employees sought by UAW's petition \n     are subject to the Railway Labor Act. This finding may be \n     cited as Federal Express Corporation, 23 NMB 32 (1995). The \n     documents forwarded with your letter will be returned \n     separately.\n       By direction of the National Mediation Board, Stephen E. \n     Crable, Chief of Staff; Rush O'Keefe, Esq.; Paul Jones, Esq.; \n     William Josem, Esq.; Arthur Luby, Esq.\n\n  I have been asking for a Senator or a House Member who said that we \nshouldn't make this change, the mistake that was made. They can't find \none. I will ask. Give me that UAW lawyer that has made the motion in \nthe last 11 months before the National Labor Relations Board. The \ngentleman says here, ``This is a matter that is currently in \nlitigation.'' False--threw it back over there to the NLRB, and they are \nsitting on it like they sat on it for 3 years after UAW brought it. \nThere is nothing you can do about it. You have the fellow Gould over \nthere. He will squat. I can't get him up off his ``whatever.'' But I \ncan tell you now. It is not in any litigation at all. It is unanimously \ndetermined on the merits, after 5 years and 11 months later, with no \nmotion, no appearance, no nothing--just sitting on it over there.\n  This is a matter that is currently in litigation even while we are \nhere today. It is like Edward R. Morrow down in the South Pacific or \nsomething in World War II. The Senator from Massachusetts says: We \nought to let the litigation move forward, but the action that is taken \non the FAA bill has preempted effectively the litigation which is under \nconsideration even as we meet here today. Come on. Come on. Wait a \nminute.\n  There ought to be some test of the truth in the facts here. When the \npeople who wrote the provision, trying to do the honest thing, get \naccused of pulling rugs out and jamming, I will take that test. I will \nask the colleagues to study these facts and to see whether the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is jamming it or the Senator from South Carolina is \njamming it and then let them make their vote.\n  It is crystal clear what is going on here. It is crystal clear. \nEverybody wanted to correct it. But labor told us, they said, ``You are \nnot going to do it. We are going to filibuster. We are going to veto it \nat the White House.'' I did remember that the Vice President was from \nTennessee. I said, ``I don't think that that is going to happen. No.'' \nAnd I said, ``I don't think that they are going to filibuster.'' I \nthink we can get 60 votes for the truth and facts.\n  Now we hear about the NLRB, referring to all of these cases like you \ncannot get a case up there. Hundreds and hundreds of cases here have \nbeen covered by the Railway Labor Act, and the technical correction \ndoes not change that status. It changes future proceedings, not the one \nthe Senator is talking about that they can make another argument. They \ncan make these arguments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this reference to all \nthese cases.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Federal Express is Covered by the Railway Labor Act. The Technical \n                Correction Does Not Change That Status.\n\n       Since commencing operations 23 years ago, Federal Express \n     and its employees consistently have been determined by the \n     federal courts, the National Mediation Board and the National \n     Labor Relations Board to be subject to the RLA. See e.g., \n     Chicago Truck Driver, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union v. \n     National Mediation Board, 670 F.2d 665 (7th Cir. 1982), \n     Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union v. \n     National Labor Relations Board, 599 F.2d 816 (7th Cir. 1979); \n     Adams v.

Case No. 13-RC-\n     14490 (1977); Federal Express, N.L.R.B. Case No. 13-CA-30194 \n     (1991). The charges filed with Region 13 in Chicago, Case No. \n     13-CA-3019 and Region 1 in Boston, Case No. 1-CA-22,585 were \n     withdrawn after we presented the above evidence of our \n     jurisdictional status.\n       The National Mediation Board (NMET) recently ruled on \n     Federal Express RLA status by stating unequivocally that \n     ``Federal Express and all of its employees are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act.'' Federal Express Corporation, 23 N.M.B. \n     32 (1995).\n       The term ``employer'' under the National Labor Relations \n     Act excludes ``...any person subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act:'' 29 U.S.C. Sec. 152 (2). Excluded from the definition \n     of ``employee'' under the National Labor Relations Act \n     is''...any individual employed by an employer subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act...'' 29 U.S.C.Sec. 152 (3). The Railway \n     Labor Act defines ``carrier'' as ``... (including) every \n     common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign \n     commerce...''45 U.S.C. Sec. 151, First and Sec. 181. Federal \n     Express is a common carrier by air engaged in interstate and \n     foreign commerce, and is certificated pursuant to Section 401 \n     of the Federal Aviation Act.\n       That interpretation of the statute consistently has been \n     applied by the NMB. Section 201 of the RLA, 45 U.S.C. Section \n     181, provides that the Act ``shall cover every common carrier \n     by air engaged in interstate and foreign commerce . . . and \n     every air pilot of other person who performs any work as an \n     employee or subordinated official of such carrier or \n     carriers, subject to its or their continuing authority to \n     supervise and direct the manner of\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\n     rendition of his service.'' (Emphasis added). In accordance \n     with that legislative directive, anyone employed by an air \n     carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce is covered \n     by the RLA. As was explained in REA Express, Inc., 4 N.M.B. \n     253, 269 (1965):\n       ``It has been the Board's consistent position that the fact \n     of employment by a ``carrier'' is determinative of the status \n     of all that carrier's employees as subject to the Act. The \n     effort to carve out or separate the so-called over-the-road \n     drivers would be contrary to and do violence to a long line \n     of decisions by this Board which embrace the policy of \n     refraining from setting up a multiplicity of crafts or \n     classes. As stated above, there is no question that this \n     particular group are employees of the carrier.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit noted in regard to the NMB's Federal Express \n     case that ``the NLRB had `never' asserted jurisdiction over'' \n     (Federal Express'.'' United Parcel Service, Inc., v. National \n     Labor Relations Board. 92 F.3d 1221 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Federal \n     Express has participated in five union representation \n     elections conducted under the auspices of the National \n     Mediation Board, the most recent in 1995, and presently is \n     participating in a sixth RLA election.\n       The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Federal Express Corp. \n     v. California Public Utilities Commission, 936 F.2d 1075, \n     1978 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, ______ U.S. ______, 119 \n     LEd.2d 578 (1992) found:\n       ``The trucking operations of Federal Express are integral \n     to its operation as an air carrier. The trucking operations \n     are not sonic separate business venture; they are part and \n     parcel of the air delivery system. Every truck carries \n     packages that are in interstate commerce by air. The use of \n     the trucks depends on the conditions of air delivery. The \n     timing of the trucks is meshed with the schedules of the \n     planes. Federal Express owes some of its success to its \n     effective use of trucking as part of its air carrier \n     service.''\n       That court also stated:\n       ``Federal Express is exactly the kind of an expedited all-\n     cargo service that Congress specified and the kind of \n     integrated transportation system that was federally desired. \n     Because it is an integrated system, it is a hybrid, an air \n     carrier employing trucks. Those trucks do not destroy its \n     status as an air carrier. They are an essential part of the \n     all-cargo air service that Federal Express innovatively \n     developed to meet the demands of an increasingly interlinked \n     nation.''\n       It clearly has been established that Federal Express is a \n     carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. Its employees are \n     likewise subject to the Railway Labor Act. No court or agency \n     has ever determined that Federal Express or any of its \n     employees are subject to the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, there was reference made to the CRS. I am just \namazed. I thought they always had a pretty good record. They ought to \ngive the fellow who works over there for the Congressional Research \nService weekend leave. And the reason I say that, they have a guy named \nVince Treacy, legislative attorney, and he was asked on September 27, \njust a few days ago, to give an opinion with respect to the coverage, \nthe Railway Labor Act coverage of Federal Express as an express \ncompany. And he comes up totally in contradiction to all the laws and \nall the decisions, but more particularly he knows the request is made \nbecause we were trying to determine the intent of Congress: Was it as \ndescribed by the Senator from Massachusetts, or an innocent mistake by \nmy description?\n  Everybody agreed that there was a mistake made. We did not even know \nit was in there. And please, my gracious, instead of coming with the \nlanguage itself in the act, he runs all around his elbow and refuses to \nput this in his three-page decision.\n  I read from the conference report of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 \nby Mr. Shuster on December 15, 1995. ``The enactment of the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage of \nthe employees and employers by the Railway Labor Act.''\n  The distinguished chairman on the House side, Mr. Shuster, stated in \nthe Chamber when this was debated a couple of days ago, that that was \nput in at the request of labor. We will show it to you in the Record. \n``The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand \nnor contract coverage of employees and employers by the Railway Labor \nAct.''\n  Now we see who comes in in the middle of the game trying to change \nthe rules of the road. We see now who is trying to pull rugs out from \nunder people. And they are using every gimmick in the book. This fellow \nwill be looking for a job if I have anything to do with it, I can tell \nyou that, because I have an analysis here going down each one of the \npoints in the document.\n  I did not want to take the time of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, but, for example, Mr. Treacy says: ``If, at some future date, \nthe NMB ruled that some Federal Express employees were employed in \nactivities that were not integrally related to its operation as an air \ncarrier, then those employees would count under the coverage of the \nNLRA as a matter of law.''\n  False. False. They raised precisely that point in the case we are \ntalking about, and we have the National Mediation Board and its \ndecision. Heavens above. We could not be more on target. They never \ncalled us or asked us about the history of this particular thing.\n  From Treacy's legal opinion they are running around now to give some \nkind of color, or credibility to their position: `Moreover, it appears \nunlikely that Federal Express would constitute an express company \nsubject to title 49, as that term is used in the proposed amendment.''\n  Where did you get that? He says later on here it could go either way. \nNo one, including the author of this memo, disputes the fact that the \nREA was an express company. No one disputes that Federal Express was \nacquired and operated under certificates from REA. As the Interstate \nCommerce Commission stated in its decision transferring the \ncertificates, and I quote, ``The evidence establishes a public demand \nor need for the proposed continuation of express service as previously \nauthorized under the acquired REA certificates.'' That is the ICC \ndecision No. 66562.\n  Then he states in here: ``The deletion of the term `express company' \nfrom section 1 of the RLA does not appear to have been inadvertent or \nmistaken.''\n  That is an astonishing conclusion, Mr. President, because it ignores \nthe ICC Termination Act itself, the very sentence I read. The change to \nthe RLA was through a conforming amendment to the ICC Termination Act \nwhich included the provision, and I quote, ``The enactment of the ICC \nTermination Act shall neither expand nor contract coverage of employees \nand employers under the Railway Labor Act.''\n  I could read on and on. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that \nthis review of the CRS paper that was gotten up quickly and certainly \nvery, very, at best, carelessly, if not intentionally, just 4 or 5 days \nago for this case, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Response to the Memo by the Congressional Research Service\n\n       The September 27, 1996 memo by the Congressional Research \n     Service [CRS] contains several inaccuracies which call into \n     question the conclusions reached in the memo. For example:\n       Inaccurate statement: ``If, at some future date, the NNB \n     ruled(sic) that some Federal Express employees were employed \n     in activities that were not integrally related to its \n     operations as an air carrier, then those employees would come \n     under the coverage of the NLRA as a matter of law.''\n       Facts: The UAW raised precisely the same argument in the \n     jurisdictional case involving Federal Express that recently \n     was litigated. In response to that argument, the NMB held: \n     ``. . . the Board does not apply the `integrally related' \n     test to that Federal Express employees sought by the UAW. \n     Where, as here, the company at issue is a common carrier by \n     air, the Act's [RLA's] jurisdiction does not depend upon \n     whether there is an integral relationship between its air \n     carrier activities and the functions performed by the \n     carrier's employees in question''. Federal Express \n     Corporation, 23 N.M.B. 32, 73-74 (Nov. 22, 1995).\n       Inaccurate statement: ``Moreover, it appears unlikely that \n     Federal Express would constitute an express company subject \n     to Title 49, as that term is used in the proposed \n     amendment.''\n       Facts: No one, including the author of the CRS memo, \n     disputes the fact that Railway Express Agency (REA) was an \n     express company. Likewise, no one disputes that Federal \n     Express acquired and has operated under the certificates \n     acquired from REA. As the Interstate Commerce Commission \n     stated in the decision transferring the certificates, ``The \n     evidence establishes a public demand or need for the proposed \n     continuation of express service as previously authorized \n     under the acquired REA certificates.'' Interstate Commerce \n     Commission Decision. No. MC-66562 (Sub-No. 2347), June 13, \n     1983.\n       Incorrect statement: ``* * * it appears logical and \n     necessary to eliminate [coverage for express companies] from \n     the RLA to preclude the ostensible coverage of nonexistent \n     express companies''.\n       Facts: To state that express companies are nonexistent \n     under the RLA, or that it is unlikely that Federal Express \n     constitutes an express company, simply ignores the facts. In \n     a case addressing the jurisdictional status of REA employees, \n     the National Mediation\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\n     Board defined an express company as: ``The express business \n     has always been one of pick-up and consolidation of traffic, \n     turning it over to common carriers by rail or air for \n     transport, and delivery by the express company to consignee \n     at destination. In more recent times, this has been \n     supplemented by over-the-road handling of their own business \n     without an intermediate form of transportation''. Railway \n     Express Agency, 4 N.M.B. 253, 269 (1965). The NMB defined an \n     express company by describing precisely the service Federal \n     Express provides.\n       Inaccurate statement: ``The deletion of the term `express \n     company' from [S]ection 1 of the RLA does not appear to have \n     been inadvertent or mistaken''.\n       Facts: This rather astonishing conclusion ignores the ICC \n     Termination Act itself. The change to the RLA was through a \n     conforming amendment to the ICC Termination Act, which \n     included the following provision: ``The enactment of the ICC \n     Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract the \n     coverage of employees and employers by the Railway Labor Act \n     . . .''. Public Law 104-88 (H.R. 2539), Sec. 10501(B).\n       Inaccurate statement: The memo suggests, consistent with \n     organized labor's lobbying position, that it is more \n     difficult for employees covered by the Railway Labor Act to \n     organize. The memo states: ``This [amendment] would require \n     those [express company] employees to organize under the \n     limited craft bargaining units permitted by the RLA, rather \n     that under the wide range of appropriate units afforded by \n     the NLRA.\n       Facts: About 11% of the private sector workforce covered by \n     the NLRA is represented by labor unions for purposes of \n     collective bargaining. Some 65-70% of employees covered by \n     the RLA are represented by labor unions. Which law is more \n     conducive to union organizing? As with most of the \n     unsupported conclusions in the memo, the memo again ignores \n     the facts.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, Mr. President, let me take the full responsibility \nbecause there is no trickery in this whatever. It was openly discussed. \nMy colleagues on the House side as well on this side, all agree that it \nwas an innocent mistake. I do not think you could have Members \nsupporting our position against the powerful Senator from Massachusetts \nand the powerful labor movement which has made this issue if it were \nnot the case.\n  That is why we included it at my behest, because I wanted to make \nsure just exactly, in the expression of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nwe were not going to change the rules of the road in the middle of the \ngame. I think that game in Philadelphia is over. But if he thinks it is \ncontinuing, then it is in the middle of the game, because this was done \nin the ICC Termination Act of December 15 after the rule of the road on \nNovember 22, 1995.\n  I am glad the distinguished Senator from Arizona referred to these \nemployees. That saves me time. It saves the Members some time. We could \ngo through the history of this particular company and labor relations \nand various talking points, and you could be more than persuaded now as \nI have been because I did not think we were going to have this great \nrhubarb come up.\n  But ever since they were organized, back in 1983, I guess it was--no, \n1973, because here is a 1979 decision--Federal Express has been an \nexpress carrier, first under the decision back in 1979. In 1936 the \nRailway Labor Act was amended to include air carriers, which very few \npeople realize had included air carriers, including the one who \nsuggested that we drop the language about ``express.''\n  Without reading that decision, we move to the 1993 decision of the \nNational Mediation Board and on down the list of the various decisions \nfrom time to time. We find out there has been a total consistency for a \ncompany that is extremely well operated, is extremely patriotic, it \ntakes care of its employees.\n  I have been through its facilities. When I went up to Alaska many \nyears ago, we got there early and somebody said you ought to go over \nhere and watch that operation they have over at Anchorage while we wait \nfor our ride, which I did. I never realized the technological advance \nthat had been made by this old Marine--or young Marine, as I look upon \nhim, Fred Smith.\n  Before they take off in Japan, they have already computerized \ninformation and forwarded it to Anchorage. At Anchorage they have \nvarious ways for the State Department, Interior Department, Wildlife \nService, textiles--Customs, and they have all those things. They know \nthe packages. They know where new shipments are coming through, where \nthere may be some textile fraud, where there may be some drugs; issues \ninvolving the Justice Department, the DEA.\n  As everything is unloaded in a matter of a couple of hours there, \nthis mammoth plane, it goes into all those sockets, runs down these \nwheels, all those people are at their stations and this is down into \nthe inner part of America.\n  All I could say to myself, understanding this particular point being \nraised, that, if you had me running around the countryside trying to \nargue a different union here and another union over here, with certain \nlittle organizers here--I want to emphasize this--that experience, \nbecause the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts says they are \nprimarily the little towns. This crowd, UAW, is well represented. They \nknow how to organize folks.\n  They spent 5 years on this Philadelphia case that has long since been \ndecided unanimously against them. Now comes, the Senator from \nMassachusetts depicting: It is an ongoing litigation matter, they have \nnot had their chance, they are playing by the rules and Hollings is \npulling the rug out from under them.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I would not engage in such \nconduct. I take offense even having me referred to in that way. I do \nnot have to get into some company over there in Tennessee. But I \ncertainly do not have to stand by and, just because they have a \npowerful Senator and a powerful labor movement, see a good crowd get \nrolled.\n  I am not going to be rolled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment or two and then \nyield to my friend and colleague. The fact is, Mr. President, the \nSenator from South Carolina is still--still cannot show where the \nFederal Express is an express company under the Railway Labor Act. He \ncannot show it. It is not there. No court award has ever held Federal \nExpress is an express company. The Federal Express has argued that time \nand time and time again.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, on the case he talks about, the National \nLabor Relations Board is still out there, it is still current. It is \ncase 4RC17698--still current. He can say it is not current. It is \ncurrent.\n  He can find fault with Mr. Gould. We have had the hearings on Mr. \nGould that would show the way the National Labor Relations Board has \nacted since he has been up as being more expeditious, faster in terms \nof the considerations of various cases, and speeded up consideration in \nvarious regions more than any National Labor Relations Board of recent \ntimes. It has also seen a significant reduction in those terms.\n  I will just conclude at this point and say we can obfuscate this \nsituation in any way that we might try. But the fact of the matter is, \nthe part of Federal Express that flies is an airline. The part that is \na truck, is a truck. What they want to do is take the trucking and put \nit in the airlines to make it more difficult for workers to be able to \ncome together.\n  The fact of the matter is, UPS has airline designation under the \nRailroad Act, and has trucking designation under the National Labor \nRelations Act. The issue that is before the NLRA is exactly the same.\n  Sure, mediation has found Federal Express is an airline. The question \nis, whether the trucking should be considered under the National Labor \nRelations Act. They have found this division on UPS. They are their \nprincipal competitors. It does not take a lot of time to have people \nunderstand that is what the issue is. What is being attempted here is \nto say: Oh, no, we are not even going to let the National Labor \nRelations Board--we are going to effectively close that door down, cut \noff that case--which is active--and put them under the Railroad Act, \nwhich will make it much more difficult for them to be able to express \ntheir grievances.\n  That is common sense. People ought to understand. You have the post \noffice, now, that is competing with air and trucking; you have UPS, air \nand trucking; and you have Federal Express, air and trucking. And you \nhave the efforts, now, in terms of Federal Express, to vastly expand \nthe trucking division. What their attempt is, now, is to get in with \nthis special provision to\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\neffectively exclude themselves from what their other competitors are \ninvolved in. Then they will be much more successful in terms of the \nbottom line. That is what we are talking about and that is what is at \nissue.\n  I think it is a commonsense fact because that is what the real world \nis all about. That is the issue which this legislation is attempting to \nundermine, that decision by the National Labor Relations Act on that \nparticular issue in question and why it continues to be so insidious.\n  I yield time as the Senator from Illinois would want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleagues from \nArizona and my colleague from South Carolina. Senator Hollings in many \nways has contributed significantly. He has talked more candidly about \nthe revenue situation that the Federal Government faces than any other \nMember of this body and I am grateful to him for that.\n  He also is the one who educated me on the whole question of gross \ninterest versus net interest. One of the little games that \nadministrations of both parties play is they list net interest rather \nthan gross interest so interest does not look so bad. Fritz Hollings is \nthe person who educated me on that.\n\n  But I think on this issue he is wrong. I think there are three \nquestions that we have to ask ourselves. When you ask those questions, \nthen you have to come to the conclusion that we are making a mistake.\n  First of all, who benefits? The answer is--no one has questioned \nthis--one corporation, Federal Express, benefits. No one else benefits \nby this.\n  Second, there is the question of litigation that is pending. My \ncolleague, the Presiding Officer, sits on the Judiciary Committee. He \nhas not been there too long yet, but he will become, over time, one of \nthe most valued members of the Judiciary Committee and of this body. I \nhave said that, not just in his presence, but to others. I can tell you \nthat, almost always, it is wrong to pass legislation that interferes in \nlitigation. It is just bad policy.\n  And third, the process is wrong. We are going through this and there \nis no question it is a major change, without any hearings. When the \nCongressional Research Service says, ``The deletion of `express \ncompany' from section 1 of the RLA does not appear to have been \ninadvertent or mistaken,'' my friend from South Carolina says they are \nwrong. I do not know who is right. But I would think the committee of \njurisdiction ought to hold a hearing on this.\n  I also have great questions of whether we should interfere in a \ncompetitive situation.\n  Senator Kennedy is correct when he says UPS is designated in two \ndifferent ways, and Federal Express wants to be designated in only one \nway. Federal Express, as I understand it, has about 1,000 planes and \n35,000 trucks. What they want to do is to be designated as an airline, \nincluding the 35,000 trucks.\n  Maybe that is what we should do. I doubt it, but maybe that is what \nwe should do. I think we ought to at least hold a hearing on it.\n  I am also concerned, and I say this to my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, who has been a leader, I think we have to \nhonestly ask ourselves, why is Federal Express being given preferential \ntreatment in this body now?\n  I think the honest answer is Federal Express has been very generous \nin their campaign contributions. I have to say, they have been good to \nPaul Simon. My guess is, if you check this out, you will see they have \nbeen good to every Member of this body. I am grateful to people who \ncontribute, but I don't think they ought to set public policy because \nof those contributions. I think that is what is happening here.\n  We need to change the way we finance campaigns, and I commend my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, for being a leader in this \narea. The system distorts what happens here, and I think this is an \nexample of that distortion.\n  They have good people, like George Tagg, who I think most of us know, \njust a very, very fine person. I think most of us frequently use \nFederal Express. I am not knocking the company. I say to the company \nleaders who, I am sure, are monitoring what is going on here right now, \nI think they are well on the way to winning a pyrrhic victory. I think \nthey may well, as the Senator from South Carolina has suggested, get \nthe 60 votes, but I think you will see that journalists, academicians \nand others are going to use this as an example of a special interest \nprevailing and the public interest not prevailing. Not to have a \nhearing on this fundamental question is simply wrong.\n  I hope that somehow a compromise might be worked out where a hearing \nwould be agreed to and it would be agreed that the committee would act, \nnot necessarily favorably, but the committee would act on it shortly \nafter the first of the year.\n  This process is wrong. There is no question the underlying bill \nshould pass, but I think we are doing a disservice to the Senate and to \nthe Nation as we move ahead in this way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nLet me, again, repeat my respect and affection for the Senator from \nIllinois, but in all due respect to the Senator from Illinois, if we \nare talking about campaign contributions here, I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, organized labor, the ones that are behind trying to kill \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, has given a thousand times more--a \nthousand times more--in campaign contributions.\n  I would be glad to examine the campaign contribution reports to the \nFederal Election Commission as to who has been getting what money and \nhow much has been given and compare this corporation, with what \norganized labor is doing.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, right now today, there is an \nunprecedented--without precedent--infusion of funds by organized labor \nunions into the congressional campaigns and the Senate campaigns, the \nlikes of which I haven't seen in the 14 years I have been a Member of \nthe Senate. I strongly suggest, before the Senator from Illinois \nsuspects--suspects, as he said --that campaign contributions play a \nrole here, that he look very carefully at the contributions by \norganized labor unions and the significant contributions that have been \nmade by the individuals who are trying to knock out this legislative \nprovision in the bill.\n  The Senator from Illinois makes a very serious charge about \nsuspecting--about suspecting--campaign contributions. I will tell the \nSenator from Illinois, it is clear as to who has been making the \ncampaign contributions. It's been organized labor, it's been an \nintensive effort.\n\n  The other Senator from Arizona and I know of over a million dollars--\nover a million dollars--that has been poured in by organized labor \nagainst one Congressman in the State of Arizona, a rural district, \nsomething like we have never seen before. We have never seen it in the \nhistory of our State.\n  So, look, I appreciate the efforts by the Senator from Illinois for \ncampaign finance reform. I look forward to joining him and Senator \nBoren and others who have left the Senate who we need very badly in \nthat effort, but to somehow think that Federal Express' campaign \ncontributions have something to do with this legislation, when it pales \nin comparison with that of the campaign contributions and the phone \nbanks and the organized labor leaders who show up and demonstrate in \nfront of our colleague's every campaign appearance, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, he has his priority skewed very badly.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield just for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. What you say underscores the point, that the way we \nfinance campaigns today taints the whole process, there is just no \nquestion about it. We can exchange charges, but we need to improve the \nsystem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I repeat my great appreciation, my \nrespect, and my affection for the Senator from Illinois. Nothing that I \nsaid should be construed as anything but a difference of view as to \nwhat role campaign finances and contributions may have played in this \nlegislation, because there is no reason whatsoever for there to be any \nfriction between myself and the Senator from Illinois, as he enters\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\nthe last few days of a distinguished career of service to the people of \nIllinois and this body. I hope the Senator took my response in that \nvein as he leaves the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me just correct one thing. A drafting error in the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 created an \nambiguity regarding the express companies status under the Railway \nLabor Act. That is acknowledged by the people who drafted the \nlegislation and the Senator from South Carolina who was involved at the \ntime in the drafting of that legislation. That is what we are doing \nhere, we are correcting a technical error.\n  One provision states the intent of Congress:\n\n       The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall \n     neither expand nor contract the coverage of employees and \n     employers by the Railway Labor Act.\n\n  However, a second provision drops express carriers under the Railway \nLabor Act. This was clearly inadvertent and a contradiction to the \nstated intent of Congress.\n  Those are just facts. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. President, I am not a member of the Commerce Committee. If we \ncould choose our committees without the restrictions of reality, I \nwould like to be a member of the Commerce Committee. I join in this \ndebate, nonetheless, because of the history with the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I don't know how far back some of the current Members go, but I was a \nvery, from my present standpoint, young lobbyist for the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation in the first 2 years of the Nixon \nadministration. We didn't call ourselves lobbyists. They don't call \nthem lobbyists today. They call themselves ``congressional liaison \npeople'' or, in my case, I was in charge of congressional relations.\n  But we were lobbyists, and in the spirit of full and fair disclosure, \nI will use that term. My assignment from then Secretary John Volpe, who \nhad been Governor of the State of Massachusetts, was to convince the \nCongress to pass the Airport Airways Act and create the Airport Airways \nTrust Fund.\n  My predecessors at the Department, who had been Democrats under the \nPresidency of Lyndon Johnson, had tried to do the same thing and had \nbeen unsuccessful, for a variety of reasons. There were some in the \nadministration who said we would be unsuccessful as well. Representing \na Republican President to a Democratic Congress, it was not supposed to \nbe the most harmonious kind of circumstance.\n  So I came up here in the Senate, obviously not on the floor, but up \nin the gallery, and in Senators' offices and, with my staff, worked \nwith the then-chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Magnuson, and \nultimately succeeded in getting strong bipartisan support for the \nAirport-Airways Act and the creation of the aviation trust fund.\n  We thought, naively it turns out, that by creating the trust fund we \nwould produce stability in funding for the FAA and airport-airways so \nthat there would never be any doubt of the flow of funds for people \ninvolved in keeping our national airways safe.\n  So it comes as a moment of nostalgia to me to come to the Senate now, \nsome 25 years later, and find that the flow of funds out of the \naviation trust fund that I had a small hand in creating have been \ninterrupted, cut off, jeopardized by an attempt to filibuster in this \nbody the bill that would provide those funds, and that the intent of \nCongress, in which I participated to see to it that there would never \nbe any challenge to that funding, has been frustrated here.\n  I understand the Senator from Massachusetts has every right to do \nwhat he is doing. I have participated in filibusters myself when I felt \nthe cause was just and the point was well worth making. But I find this \nmore an attempt to play to the gallery, if I may, than to address the \nissue, because it has been virtually conceded on both sides that it is \nsimply a matter of time before the process plays itself out. The bill \nwill pass. The money will be available to keep the airport and airways \ntrust fund funding going to the FAA. The arguments have all been \nrepeated again and again and again.\n  I find that a little sad from that past history. I was hoping to be \nable to look back on my career and say that the one thing I did while I \nwas at the Department of Transportation was help remove the airport-\nairways thing from this kind of disruption. Now I see that that is not \npossible.\n  I sit here, not as a member of the committee, and hear the debate \ngoing back and forth. ``It was an innocent mistake.'' And, ``It is a \ntechnical correction.'' ``Oh, no. This is a major policy issue.'' Back \nand forth, back and forth, with voices being raised on both sides.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I am reminded of an experience in my even \nyounger days, before I served in the Nixon administration, all the way \nback to my teenage years, the first experience I ever had listening to \na debate in the Supreme Court.\n  This was a debate over the sentences that were given to the \nRosenbergs back in the days when President Eisenhower was President. \nYou say, what does that have to do with this? Absolutely nothing, \nexcept this one phrase sticks in my head.\n  In the course of that debate, one of the Supreme Court Justices asked \none of the lawyers, ``Who are you?'' The lawyer was taken aback by this \nquestion, and gave his name. The Justice said, ``No. I know what your \nname is. What is your standing? Who are you with respect to this \ncase?'' The man then said, ``Well, I represent somebody who is next \nfriend of the Rosenbergs, a man named Edelman. I am the lawyer for Mr. \nEdelman.''\n\n  The Justice called for a law book. The debate went on for a bit, and \nthe Justice interrupted the lawyer again and said, ``Is that the same \nEdelman as in the case of California v. Edelman?'' The lawyer was \nstunned that the Supreme Court Justice would have this in his mind, and \nhe stumbled around and he said, ``Yes, it is.'' At which point the \nJustice closed the law book with a look of some disgust and said, ``A \nvagrancy case.'' ``Oh, no,'' said the lawyer. ``That was not a vagrancy \ncase. That was a free speech case.''\n  It was the wrong thing to say to a Supreme Court Justice, who \nreopened the book and said, reading, ``California v. Edelman, a \nvagrancy case,'' at which point the lawyer compounded his mistake by \nsaying, ``Well, it may say that on the heading, but if you'll read the \ncase, you'll see that it was a free speech case.'' Whereupon, the \nJustice leaned forward and said, ``Let's ask Mr. Justice Clark. He \nwrote the opinion.'' And Mr. Justice Clark said, ``It was a vagrancy \ncase.''\n  I remember that very clearly as a young teenager in my first \nexperience with the Supreme Court. The reason I bring it up now is, I \nsit here as a Member of the Senate, not a member of the Commerce \nCommittee, and hear this argument. ``It is a technical fix.'' ``No. \nIt's not. It's a major policy question.'' And like the Justice, I would \nsay, let us ask the man who wrote the opinion what it is.\n  The man who wrote the opinion, as I understand, in this case is the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, who says it is a technical \nfix. I heard him say so on the floor here. He says it is a technical \ncorrection. He is the ranking member of the committee from the minority \nparty. The chairman agrees with him, the chairman from the majority \nparty. I find that convincing, having heard the people who wrote the \nlegislative words we are arguing about saying this is what it is.\n  I do not want to be in the position of that lawyer before the Supreme \nCourt trying to say, ``The man who wrote the opinion doesn't know what \nthe opinion really says.'' ``The man who wrote the provision doesn't \nreally know what the provision really is.''\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can move forward quickly. I hope, having \nmade the statements, having discharged our political responsibilities \nto the various people on both sides who have urged us to do this, we \ncan move quickly. I hope we can move this afternoon to say, all right, \nwe have made our position clear. We have said what it is we have to \nsay. We have satisfied the constituents that come to us and plead for \nsupport here.\n  Now we have at stake the safety, the continuance, the future of the \nNation's\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nair system. Let us get on with it. Let us see to it that there is no \nchallenge to the airport and airways safety and progress in this \ntremendously important area.\n  In my home State, we are trying to get ready for the Olympics in \n2002. When the world comes to Utah in 2002, they are not going to come \nby ox cart the way they came the first time in the 1840's. They are \ngoing to come by air. When they come, the facilities have to be in \nplace. The opportunity to get those facilities in place is being held \nup by our failure to provide this funding. I think that is a shame. I \nthink we ought to move ahead.\n  Finally, I keep hearing all these things about how terrible Federal \nExpress is. The most--I ask unanimous consent that I might be allowed \nthe proceed for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I hear how terrible Federal Express is. The only \nconcrete statement really that I have heard is that Federal Express \nemployees have gone for years without a pay increase. I realize that is \na terrible thing. I have gone for years without a pay increase. Indeed, \nthe whole time I have been in the Senate I have been denied a pay \nincrease. I wish I had the salary I had before I came to the Senate \nwhen I took at least a 50 percent pay cut in basic pay, and more than \nthat in bonus pay, in order to become a Senator.\n  I do not think that is a demonstration of prima facie that this \ncompany is antiworker, because if we accept that, then the Senate is \nclearly antiworker and we probably ought to do something about that, \ntoo.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we could proceed with this and we could \nrecognize that the positions have been staked out. The votes are where \nthey are. I hope we will get on with it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments. Mr. \nPresident, I am really somewhat startled by the fact that those of us \nin this body making about $130,000 a year are comparing ourselves with \nmen and women making $30,000 a year and who have not gotten a pay raise \nfor the last 7 years. We can make light of that fact, but it is not \nmade light of for hard-working families that are trying to make ends \nmeet and provide for their children and to meet responsibilities and \npay a mortgage. I do not see how that kind of comparison really \nadvances the argument. I do not believe it does.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a fair question and the Senator from \nUtah has raised it about this language. Is it, as I have suggested, \nSenator Simon, Senator Feingold, Senator Harkin, Senator Wellstone, and \nothers stated, that this was a carefully-crafted project in order to \neffectively diminish in a significant way the legitimate rights of men \nand women that are in this particular company, as Senator Simon has \npointed out; or was the Federal Express Co. deletion a matter that was \ndecided by the conference committee--and the conference committee \nreport actually bears the name of my friend and colleague from South \nCarolina.\n  I listened with interest to the Senator from Utah talking about going \nto the individuals that are the most familiar with this particular \nlegislation. I have Jim Oberstar, the ranking Democrat on the House \nTransportation Infrastructure Committee and Bill Lipinski, the ranking \nDemocrat on the House of Representatives Aviation Committee. This is \nwhat Mr. Oberstar says:\n\n       The ICR staff itself recommended the elimination of the \n     express carrier status. It was not an oversight. It is not \n     something that someone forgot to do. It is not something that \n     was neglected and drafted. It was not a drafting error, but \n     it was done for good reason. The last express carrier went \n     out of business in the mid-1970's. Federal Express purchased \n     that carrier's operating certificates. The Surface \n     Transportation Board, successor to the ICC, advises in \n     writing Federal Express apparently never engaged in the \n     operations authorized by these certificates. Subsequently, \n     Federal Express obtained and operated new certificates.\n\n  Mr. President, here is Mr. Oberstar, who knows something about it. \nThen he continues along page 11463, September 27, 1996:\n\n       We should not on the thin thread of a nonexistent operation \n     of a dormant authority purchased and never used, lock this \n     carrier into a statutorily established position within the \n     meaning of the Railway Labor Act forever and ever. This is \n     simply wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Oberstar knows, as the ranking member, what he is \ntalking about. This was not an oversight. This is the ranking member. \nOur friends say, ``Look at what people who understood, the men of the \ncommittee who spent the time.'' That is fine, that is a fair enough \ntest. That is Mr. Oberstar.\n  We have other Members in the House. Mr. DeFazio points out:\n\n       Unfortunately, what we have here, done at the very last \n     moment, is to put an extraneous matter voted on by neither \n     committees of jurisdiction, voted on neither by the House nor \n     the Senate, to benefit one very large multinational \n     corporation who has generously filled many campaign coffers \n     of Members in this House and the other body. This is not a \n     technical correction.\n\n  He says it is not a technical correction.\n\n       Do trucks run on rails? No. Well, we are going to classify \n     Federal Express, for the purpose of this bill, as a rail \n     carrier.\n\n  Mr. President, we could go through the members of the relevant \ncommittees. Both Mr. Nadler and Mr. DeFazio in the House are members of \nthe Transportation Infrastructure Committee, these are members of the \ncommittee saying this, not just myself and Senator Simon.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, it is not just us who \nare saying this. We are also looking at the Congressional Research \nService. I know their report is demeaned out here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate but the Congressional Research Service is to guide the \nMembers of the Congress, the American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  We asked them, is this just an oversight or was it purposely intended \nto be done--so that the Members would understand whether they should \naccept the fact that this is just an oversight, we never would have \npermitted it, and therefore we are remedying a situation that happened; \nor whether it was recognition that that language should have been \ndropped for the reasons that we mentioned earlier and that now suddenly \nputting this language back in has an entirely different meaning. I \nthink hopefully we understand that now, as the Senator from Illinois \nand others have pointed out.\n  This is the CRS report, ``The deletion of `express' company''--those \nare the words--``does not appear to have been inadvertent or mistaken. \nTo the contrary, the deletion appeared to be consistent with the \nstatutory structure and the intent of Congress. Since the Railway Labor \nAct coverage has been triggered by Federal regulation of express \ncompanies, it appears logical and necessary to eliminate the cross-\nreference to title 49. Elimination of `express' from the RLA appears to \nbe a necessary step in harmonizing the Railway Labor Act with the title \n49 of the code.''\n  This is an independent judgment. You can say I do not like that \nparticular lawyer, I do not like that individual. You can threaten \nthose individuals, I suppose, and say we will hope that that person \ndoes not continue to work at CRS. But the fact of the matter is, that \nis the independent judgment and decision, one in which I agree.\n  Now, taking what the conclusion would be from the CRS. If the \namendment were enacted ``court decisions since that time have upheld \nNMB discretion in resolving representative disputes. On balance, the \nproposed amendment would appear to confuse, rather than clarify the \nquestion of Railway Labor Act coverage.''\n  On the one hand it can be argued the amendment would have no effect, \nand it is very interesting for those that are supporting this \nlegislation to say, ``Look, it is not really going to have an effect,'' \nbecause they say it will not expand or contract the rights of the \nworkers. Well, it is interesting that they are arguing that at this \ntime. It also points on the other hand, it could be argued since \nneither Federal Express nor anyone was certified an express company \nsubject to the title, it would follow that no employer would come under \nthe coverage. Nonetheless, courts usually strive to give meaning to all \nenactments.\n  That is right. They are understanding and everyone is understanding\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nwhat this is about. This is Federal Express, their understanding, to be \nable to read the legislative history and understand. There is one \ncompany that will benefit, and proponents have argued the amendment \nwould simply put the term back in the Railway Labor Act and would in no \nway affect, and proponents argue that the amendment merely corrects an \nerror in order to preserve the proponents saying it will expand the \ncoverage to ground-based employees of a carrier whose jobs are not \nintegral to air freight operations.\n  There it is, Mr. President, exactly. UPS, the flight aspects are \nconsidered to be under the carrier provisions. Those that drive the \ntrucks are considered under UPS under the National Labor Relations Act. \nFederal Express flies, they ought to be under the Railway Labor Act. \nThe truckers ought to be--a judgment ought to be made. All we are \nsaying by the National Labor Relations Board, all we are saying, let \nthem make the judgment, not preclude them, not preclude them from \nmaking a judgment. That decision is before the National Labor Relations \nBoard. And it will certainly be argued, if this becomes law, that this \nis exactly what is intended, to expand for ground transportation. That \nis the way the Federal Express is moving and expanding dramatically. It \nwill give them extraordinary advantage. Put this back in and we don't \nknow what the results will be. We do know, I think, what will happen. \nFederal Express will have another weapon to turn its back on the \nlegitimate rights of workers and workers' rights.\n\n  Finally, that is what this is all about--whether these workers and \nworkers' rights are sufficiently legitimate that they are going to \nappeal to those that are working in a particular community, to be able \nto make a decision and say, look, we feel that we can protect our \nrights better by becoming a union, or whether they say we don't want to \nchoose a union. All we are saying is let them make the local choice, \nlet them make the decision. UPS drivers have made that decision. That \nissue is before the National Labor Relations Board. Why take it away \nfrom the National Labor Relations Board and undermine those rights and \nput it under the Railway Act, which virtually says to all of those \nworkers, we know you had the rights under the National Labor Relations \nAct, like they did in UPS, to go ahead and see if you can try and form \na union. Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But we are letting you make \nthat local choice and decision. But under this legislation, we are \neffectively saying, no way, not for you in this Federal Express Co. You \nare not going to be able to do it. That is, in effect, what this is all \nabout.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I mentioned before that we are all for the \nextension of the Aviation Act. I don't know whether our colleagues were \nhere earlier. I would have offered the FAA conference report without \nthis provision on the CR and had a 10-minute discussion. We would have \nvoted on that and the House would have accepted it. We would be off on \nour way to be able to do that. But the decision was made not to do \nthat. So we are at least in the position now where we have to follow \nthis procedure. But we are strongly committed to support that \nparticular provision. We think that it is important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and withhold the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Arizona. I will not consume much \ntime. The Senator from Massachusetts appropriately corrected me on any \nsuggestion that there is a similarity between the salary of a Senator \nand the salary of some of these workers, and I accept that correction \non his part. I meant not to make that comparison. I didn't think I had \nmade that comparison. But if he felt that was made, it was appropriate \nfor him to raise the issue.\n  I would like to revisit the issue of the pay increase, because I have \nnow been given some additional information that I did not have when I \nspoke before. The charge has been made that Federal Express has not \ngiven a pay raise to its employees in 7 years. I am now told that the \ntruth is somewhat different, and that all kinds of programs relating to \npay have been initiated within the last 3 years. There is now an \nopportunity for an employee to get professional pay. There is an \nincentive pay plan. There are programs for merit increases. And there \nis a program for best-practice pay. So the company has put in place \nthis series of 4 opportunities, making all employees eligible for a pay \nincrease that could be as high as 10 percent annually.\n  I think it is important, in the spirit of full disclosure, as we go \nabout this debate, that we not leave on the record unanswered the \ncharge that Federal Express has not made any pay increases available to \nany of its employees for 7 years, and the implication, therefore, it is \nthe duty of the U.S. Senate to somehow punish them for this kind of \nactivity on their part, when in fact they have put in place programs \nthat make pay increases available to their employees up to the level of \n10 percent annually.\n  If I may, again, without suggesting in any way any comparability \nbetween the salary of a Senator and the salary of some of the employees \nwe are talking about here, I do wish that Members of the Senate could \nlook forward to any kind of cost-of-living increase and not have had \ntheir pay frozen for the entire time I have been here. Maybe my coming \ncaused that. If that is the case, I suppose there are plenty that hope \nI leave. I would like to think that was coincidental.\n\n  Mr. President, I repeat again what I said before. I think everybody \nhas said whatever they want to say on this issue. It is clear that one \nside wants to take the opportunity to attack Federal Express and, \nthereby, perhaps tilt things in one direction or another in a time of a \nunion election, to pay off whatever political debts to the unions that \nare urging them to attack Federal Express. The other side has made it \nclear that we want to get on with the legislative process of providing \nfunds for the FAA.\n  I see no reason to repeat all of these arguments. I see no reason to \nwait until next Thursday to get this resolved. Everybody knows how it \ncomes out, as the Senator from Illinois indicated when he spoke. I hope \nthat people who are in leadership positions, who can deal with these \nthings and deal with the Senator from Massachusetts, can sit down and \nget this thing resolved so that we can have a vote on it, let the \nSenate work its will, having heard all of the arguments, and get the \nmoney that is so desperately needed into the hands of the people who \nare so importantly in charge of something as significant as our \nNation's airlines and safety.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I will be brief.\n  Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues again, in the words of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, as he stated this just this morning:\n\n       Question. So you've got to pass this bill?\n       Daschle. We've got to pass this bill.\n\n  That is as simple as it is. I don't know exactly why the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to drag out this procedure. But I do know this, Mr. \nPresident: We are now hearing from airport managers and workers, and \neven union members all over this country, who are asking why can't we \nmove forward with our airport projects, why can't we begin the much \nneeded repairs. We are even hearing from bureaucrats, who are saying, \n``We want to work, we want to move forward on aviation safety and \nsecurity measures that are necessary to safeguard the flying public.''\n  Why is it that we have to wait until Thursday for the bill to be \ncompleted and then sent over to the White House for signature? Why do \nwe have to do that? I think that is a legitimate question, Mr. \nPresident.\n  On the subject of Federal Express, I don't know much about Federal \nExpress, except that I see them everywhere. Members of my family, \nespecially my wife, use that service quite a lot, along with a number \nof other organizations that deliver packages.\n  But I am not here to argue whether Federal Express is a good or bad \ncorporation. In fact, I think that is a straw man, Mr. President. In \nfact, I think it is an evasion of what this debate is really all about. \nWhat this debate is about is whether there was a mistake or drafting \nerror for which there needed to be made a technical correction in \nlegislation that was passed in 1995, or whether there was not.\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\n  Now, the Senator from Massachusetts believes that had no relevance, \nthat was not correct. He is entitled to that opinion, and I respect \nthat opinion. I am not sure I see the point here in attacking a company \nand accusing them, and having a big poster board up there that says \n``anti-worker.'' What does that have to do with anything that we are \nreally debating here?\n  What it really has to do with is a union agenda to attack a \ncorporation. Again, they are free to do that, and the rules of the \nSenate, I am sure, certainly allow the Senator from Massachusetts to do \nthat. But that is not really what the debate is about. The debate is \nabout whether an error that was made in drafting and enacting \nlegislation should be corrected or not. It is that simple. Whether \nFederal Express is the best corporation or company in the world, or the \nworst, has no bearing on it.\n  So, again, I am sure that the Senator from Massachusetts seems to be \nenjoying relating anecdotes about the anti-employee behavior of Federal \nExpress; although, in my experience, most corporations that mistreat \ntheir employees are not successful. But maybe this is an exception to \nmy general experience in that area.\n  I don't claim to be an expert. But I am not sure how we really gain \nanything by continuing to try to discover whether Federal Express is a \ngood or bad corporation. The question here is: Are we going to allow \nthe airport projects and aviation safety programs--the aviation safety \nand airport security programs--to move forward, which will happen on \nThursday anyway now, or are we going to continue to delay? We have \nalready passed our deadline for completing this matter by some 17 \nhours.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts professes and I accept his sincere \ncommitment to the working men and women of America. I do not question \nthat at all. But I do question why he wants to delay the inevitable \nuntil Thursday, or Friday, or next week costing these working men and \nwomen I don't know how much other income because I don't know what \ntheir salary is, but at least a week's worth, if not 10 days worth. In \nsome families, that means a lot. That really does mean a lot. There are \nonly 52 weeks in the year when you can work and we are now costing \nthese families income by not passing this critical legislation.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts is going to deprive those working \nmen and women. I have no idea how many tens of thousands of them would \nbe working on $9 billion worth of airport projects. I don't know how \nmany there are. But I know they are going to be out there suffering as \nwill their families.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts continues to sort of blame this side \nthat we didn't pass the bill. We passed the bill and finished \nconference on September 23, in plenty of time, Mr. President. The \nconference report could have been passed and sent to the White House \ndays ago before October 1, and this critical funding would have \ncontinued.\n  Now we are getting emergency phone calls from all over America. They \nare calling saying, ``What is the matter with you guys? What is the \nmatter with you? You are hung up on some technical point here,'' and we \nare being deprived the ability to provide the critical aviation \nservices to our citizens that they deserve. Frankly, I do not \nunderstand it.\n  I again urge the Senator from Massachusetts to allow us to move \nforward. We could have a vote on the conference this afternoon and pass \nit with 60 votes, or 51 if he would just let us have an up-or-down vote \non the conference report. And we could be done with this. Instead the \nSenator from Massachusetts is choosing to drag this out for 3 more \nhours of debate tomorrow. And, very frankly, it is not clear to me what \nthere is to debate more except to keep going over again and plowing \nover ground that has already been plowed, which by the way would not be \na unique activity for this body. But at the same time there is a lot \nmore at stake here than in the normal course of debate.\n  So again I want to urge the Senator from Massachusetts, take down \nyour antiworker poster and let us talk about whether indeed this was a \ntechnical correction to a drafting error that needed to be made or not \nor whether the argument of the Senator from Massachusetts is correct \nthat this is really a subject for the National Labor Relations Board. \nIt may be. Let us try to convince our colleagues on the basis of \nwhether that is, indeed, the case, or not.\n  I am willing and eager to engage the Senator from Massachusetts in \nopen and honest debate on that issue. I am not eager to try to find out \nwhether Federal Express is a good or a bad corporation because I do not \nthink that is relevant to the issue and the question here. But I am \nafraid that is not going to be the case.\n  Finally, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, again this is an \nissue that must be resolved. It is going to be resolved. And we are not \ndoing anything except penalizing working men and women all over \nAmerica. We are jeopardizing the aviation safety of the American flying \npublic. And we are not proceeding with the much needed modernization \nfor our air traffic control system, and we are not moving forward in a \nmyriad of ways that we critically must move forward with immediately.\n  Mr. President, I say with some self-serving comments that this has a \nhuge bearing, and is an encompassing extremely important piece of \nlegislation; the result of 2 years of work with the Secretary of \nTransportation, with the Administrator of the FAA, and with the Deputy \nAdministrator of the FAA, Linda Daschle, who did such an outstanding \njob on this--an incredible job. Hundreds of hours were spent with \nSenator Pressler, the chairman of the full committee, Senator Hollings \nthe ranking member, Senator Ford, and me. I mean we have worked for \nliterally 2 years on this very important legislation. And we had a \ncouple of false starts I might remind my colleague from South Carolina. \nBut we finally came up with legislation which really is important to \nthe future of America.\n  Instead now we are hung up on what is fundamentally a difference of \nopinion as to whether a mistake was made in the drafting of \nlegislation--and by the way, in view of those who were drafting the \nlegislation, or whether Senator Kennedy is correct, that this is a \nsubject for the National Labor Relations Board.\n  It seems to me that we could pretty well ventilate that difference of \nopinion today and we could move forward with a vote on the bill today.\n  I again urge my colleague from Massachusetts to do that for the \nbenefit of, if not the Members of the Senate who want to go home and \ncampaign, the working men and women in America, tens of thousands of \nwhom--if this debate drags out, I will have more specific statistics as \nto the incredible impact that this is having economically on America, \nnot to mention the critical aviation safety and airport security \nreasons.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just speak briefly at this time.\n  I listened to my friend from Arizona talking about workers that are \naffected. I am asking what about those workers that are working for \nFederal Express that are playing by the rules who tried to get together \nand have their own set of grievances? What about those workers who have \ntheir case before in adjudication at the present time? What about those \nworkers? What about their families? They have been waiting for months \nand months for a decision to see if their rights are going to be \nprotected, and with the passage of this legislation effectively we are \nundermining those. I don't hear from the Senator from Arizona any \nconcern about those workers. I would have thought that he would have \nbeen concerned with them.\n  Mr. President, we have debated about whether this was a mistake or \nnot. I will not get back into the fact that we have had now the number \nof Members--Mr. Lipinski, ranking member of House Aviation, Mr. \nOberstar, ranking member of the House Transportation, Mr. DeFazio on \nthe Transportation Committee, and others in the House, and the members \nof the committee, plus CRS, all indicated that it was not just a \npassing factor, but that it was to give very clearly one company an \nadvantage over others and being a serious disadvantage to workers.\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona reminds me of that young \nperson who shot his parents and then came before the judge, and said, \n``I plead, give me mercy. I am an orphan.'' We said the other day on \nthe continuing resolution that we would pass the conference report \nwithout the antiworker provisions, and he said, no, no. Where was all \nof his concern about the workers then? Where was all of his concern \nabout what is going to happen out in these various airports then? Where \nwas all of his concern about the importance of passing out legislation \nthen?\n  Well, after that legislation was safely passed, it only took a little \nbit of time. And then he comes out here and says ``Oh, we have to pass \nthis legislation now.''\n  Mr. President, we are quite prepared, if it is agreeable to Senator \nMcCain, to ask that we go to consideration of S. 2161, which is the FAA \nbill that is on the calendar now without the anti-worker special \ninterest Federal Express rider, and we are prepared to move ahead on \nthat.\n\n  I get back time and time again from the Senator from Arizona: ``We \ncan't do that because we are going to go out. We are going to go out.'' \nThe fact of the matter is the House adjourned in 1994, and it came back \nand passed GATT. There are other examples that I will put in the Record \nof where the House came back in, the most recent with the GATT. They \ncame back in and passed virtually immediately on the action that was \ntaken by the Senate. It is done, and it has been done and historically \ndone.\n  We could do that this afternoon. But no, no, no, no, no. He refused \nto do that because they want to stick it to these workers; stick it to \nthe workers, pass this provision in there to stick it to the workers. \nThey are the interest. This is my interest in terms of--\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for a ruling from the Chair----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have the floor, Mr. President. I ask for regular \norder.\n  Their interest is my interest. That is basically what this issue is \nabout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under the rules of the Senate, I do not believe the words \nof the Senator from Massachusetts, saying I want to stick it to the \nworkers, is appropriate language for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The ruling of the Chair is that the language of the Senator from \nMassachusetts is not in violation of rule 19.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the issue of those workers--this is about Federal \nExpress. They have rights. They have their interests. If they are \nagainst the workers and workers' rights, so be it. This is a free \ncountry. They can go within the context of the law. What we are \nbasically talking about is the grievances that those workers have, who \nare trying to carry them forward, and we have legislation that would \neffectively undermine them.\n  I know the Senator from Utah is not on the floor. I hoped to just be \nable to clarify this position. As I understand, from 1984 to 1991, \nwhich is a period of 7 years, there was no pay increase; that in 1991, \nworkers began to organize, and Federal Express gave workers a pay \nincrease, and then another in 1993. In 1996, the company announced that \nthere would be no further wage increases. That is my information. If \nthat helps clarify the Senator's understanding of what I was trying to \nportray, that is fine.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue. It is so easy to always \nfind an excuse not to look out after working people. We heard from the \nRepublicans month after month after month where they would not even \npermit the Senate of the United States to vote on an increase in the \nminimum wage. Month after month after month they said no. ``Over my \ndead body,'' was what they said in the House of Representatives. ``I \nwill fight it with every sinew in my body''--an increase in the minimum \nwage to permit those Americans on the lowest rung of the economic \nladder the ability to work and be out of poverty. No, they said. No, we \nhave got other measures to consider in this Chamber. We are not going \nto permit that.\n  Then, finally, because of the American people's sense of fairness and \ndecency, they had to relent in the Senate of the United States and the \nHouse of Representatives. Then they tried to cut it back. Then they \ntried to delay it in the conference. That is the record of the anti-\nworker leadership over the period of this last Congress.\n  The first thing they did was attack the Davis-Bacon Act. The average \nconstruction worker makes $27,500 a year, and that is too much for some \non the other side; we are going to emasculate that. Second, we have got \nto cut back on the earned-income tax credit. Who benefits from that? \nWorkers who make up to $28,000, $29,000 and their children. That is too \nmuch. We are going to cut back on those individuals.\n  The next thing we are going to do is make all of you pay more for \nyour parents because we are going to cut back on the Medicare and give \n$245 billion of tax relief to the wealthiest individuals. We know what \nthe record is of the Republican leadership over there.\n  I am not surprised at what the Senator from Arizona is saying now. \nAll you have do is look at the record of this last Congress, and it has \nbeen anti-worker, anti-worker on a minimum wage, anti-worker on the \nearned-income tax credit, anti-worker on workers who are trying to get \nthe Davis-Bacon provision so that those who have the skills ought to be \nable to get decent work, and cutbacks in education where the workers' \nchildren are going to school. Cut back on those programs. Cut back on \nthe scholarship programs for those children who are going to college. \nTo do what? Cut back on the Medicare, cut back on the Medicaid to give \nthe tax breaks to the wealthy.\n  That has been the record. You do not have to listen to this Senator \nin October to make that out. The record is complete with the battles. \nSo it is not a surprise to me when the Senator says we are concerned \nabout workers, we are concerned about workers over here, and does not \neven mention those individuals who have very legitimate grievances and \nare being shortchanged by legislative action--shortchanged--and others \nwho are going to be given some advantage, significant advantage, by \nstatutory language.\n  This is not a question of oversight. All you have to do is read the \nrecord, read the unbiased analysis of those who observed the history of \nthis particular provision. We know that. This is special legislation \nfor a special company that has done what it could to frustrate workers \nfrom being able to proceed to pursue their legitimate grievances. That \nis what this is about.\n\n  That is what this is about. It is an issue we are fighting for, and \nit is an issue we are staying here another day for. For some, workers' \nrights are important. For some, the grievances of workers are important \nin this country, maybe not to others. Maybe not to others. But to some \nSenators, they are. They are worth fighting for. We will have that \nopportunity for the Senate to make a judgment on this on Thursday next \nat 10 a.m. We will then follow the rules of the Senate and abide by \nthat decision. But until then, we are going to continue with everything \nthat we can to make our case for justice and fairness for working \nfamilies.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I enjoy spirited debate in this Chamber. I enjoy an exchange of \nphilosophy and ideas, and I learn from debate, especially with some of \nthe more learned colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But I have \nto say, with all due respect to the President, I just grow weary, I \ngrow weary when someone on the other side of the aisle says I want to \nstick it to workers, that I want to abandon old people.\n  That really has nothing to do with debate. That just has to do--even \nthough the ruling of the Chair just was not in my favor, it is \nunnecessary, it is unwanted and, very frankly, I say to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, I am sorry that he has to lower the level of debate \nto impugning my character and motives for a position that I happen to \ntake on this bill. I do not impugn the integrity, the motives of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I believe that he has strongly held views. \nI believe that what is happening now is bad for workers of America, but \nI certainly do not\n\n[[Page S12112]]\n\nblame the Senator from Massachusetts and, very frankly, I do not look \nforward to further debate with the Senator from Massachusetts because \nit is obvious that it cannot be debated on a level that I think is in \nkeeping with the tradition of this distinguished body.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reserve 8 minutes for Senator \nHutchison when she arrives in the Chamber. In the meantime, I would \nlike to yield time, what time there is between then and 8 minutes left \nfor Senator Hutchison, to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President. I do not know where to come in. I know \nwe finally have beaten them when they start debating the minimum wage \nbill, no pay increase, anti-worker, Davis-Bacon, scholarships for \nstudents. It reminds me during the war boarding ships in the Navy, they \nsaid, ``When in danger, when in doubt, run in circles, scream and \nshout.'' And so we now have to come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nabout everything else but what is really at hand.\n  My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts thinks when he repeats \nsomething or says something, somehow that makes it true. He continually \ncomes again and again and he says, well, the Senator from South \nCarolina cannot show that Federal Express is an express company under \nthe Railway Labor Act. We filled the record. We will have go back to it \nagain and again and again.\n  Since commencing operations 23 years ago, Federal Express and its \nemployees consistently have been determined by the Federal courts, the \nNational Mediation Board, and the National Labor Relations Board to be \nsubject to the RLA. See Chicago Truck Driver, Helpers, Warehouse \nWorkers Union v. National Mediation Board, 1982; Chicago Truck Drivers, \nHelpers and Warehouse workers v. NLRB in 1979; Adams v. Federal Express \nCorporation back in 1977; Federal Express Corporation, 22 N.M.B. 57 \n(1995); Federal Express Corporation, 22 N.M.B. 157, 1995; Federal \nExpress Corporation, 20 N.M.B. 666 in 1993; Federal Express \nCorporation, 20 N.M.B. 486; Federal Express, 20 N.M.B. 404; Federal \nExpress, 20 N.M.B. 394 in 1993; Federal Express, 20 N.M.B. 360 in 1993; \nFederal Express, 20 N.M.B. 7, 1992; Federal Express, 20 N.M.B. 91, \n1992; Federal Express Corporation, 17 N.M.B. 24, 1989; Federal Express, \n17 N.M.B. 5, 1989; Federal Express Corporation and Flying Tiger Line, \n16 N.M.B. 433 in 1989; Federal Express Corporation, 6 N.M.B. 442, in \n1978; Federal Express, Case No. 22-RC in 1974; Federal Express, NLRB \ncase in 1985; Federal Express, NLRB case No. 1-CA 25084 in 1987; \nFederal Express, NLRB case in 1982; Federal Express NLRB case in 1982; \nanother one, again, in 1977; 1991.\n\n  The National Mediation Board recently ruled--and this is a 1995 \ncase--on Federal Express' Railway Labor Act status by stating \nunequivocally that ``Federal Express and all of its employees are \nsubject to the Railway Labor Act.'' Federal Express Corporation, 23 \nN.M.B. 32 (1995).\n  I do not know how you make it more clear than that. You have that \ndecision that said, in 1993, and I read, ``Federal Express Corporation \nhas been found to be a common carrier as defined by 45 U.S.C. 151.''\n  Then I look at 45 U.S.C. 151, 1st, ``The term `carrier' includes any \nexpress company.''\n  You read it to them; they don't want to listen. They just act like \nthere is nobody else, they are here looking out for the workers, trying \nto make it an emotional thing, who is for the workers. I was around \nhere for the workers when some of these were voting for NAFTA. We lost \n400,000 jobs; the Mexicans lost 1 million jobs. We went from a $5 \nbillion balance in trade, a surplus, to over an $18 billion deficit. I \nlost 10,000. I don't know how many this year. I know more than 10,000 \nby the middle of the summer. I lost 10,000 jobs down there.\n  GATT--I voted against GATT. I had to hold up the Senate and \neverything else of that kind, trying to make sense so we would not \nrepeal 301. They kept on saying it was not repealed. Now they \nunderstand. The Japanese laugh at them. They say, ``Let's go to the \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO.'' Find out what you get out of that \ngroup.\n  So, do not run around saying, ``I am looking out for workers and \nhelping workers, and you are antiworker.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from South Carolina \nhas expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non S. 1994, to reauthorize the programs of the FAA. For the safety and \nsecurity of every Oregonian who flies and for our smaller airports this \nlegislation is critical.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the committee, the chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, and especially the distinguished ranking member \nof the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Ford, for their hard work. The \nconference report includes several provisions I have worked on. In \nparticular, I take pride in those that make safety paramount at the \nFAA, that require making airline safety information available to the \npublic and that strengthen security at our airports.\n  I also want to thank the managers for their cooperation in \nincorporating my amendment on train whistles. This provision will stop \nthe Government from imposing a one-size-fits-all approach on \ncommunities with railroad grade crossings. Without this provision, \ntowns across this country, like Pendleton, OR, would have had train \nwhistles blowing night and day. My amendment will assure that the \nFederal Railroad Administration works with the people in Pendleton and \nelsewhere to develop appropriate safety measures for their grade \ncrossings.\n  When we began the process, this was a relatively modest \nreauthorization bill. No safety or security measures to speak of. Now, \nthese concerns are at the forefront, where they belong.\n  With this bill, we go beyond all the talk about safety. With this \nbill, we take the first step ever toward making information on airline \nsafety available to the public. Finally, the traveling public will be \nable to get basic safety information in plain English.\n  Everyone who flies should be able to make informed choices about the \nairlines they fly and the airports they use. This legislation will help \nconsumers do that.\n  Today, travelers can get plenty of information from the airlines \nabout whether their bags will get crushed or their flights will arrive \non time. With this bill, travelers will no longer have to go through \nthe legalistic torture of the Freedom of Information Act to get basic \nsafety information. They'll be able to get it online, from the National \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  No one thought this would be easy. I have talked to people in all \nparts of the aviation community--the FAA, NTSB, airlines, labor, \nmanufacturers, pilots, and consumer groups--about the best way to do \nthis. While there are certainly differences over how to do it, everyone \nagrees that it should be done. And I agree with those in the industry \nwho say that anything involving safety should not be part of \ncompetition. But by having uniform definitions, standards, and public \naccess to this information, I believe we will move safety out of the \nshadows and into the sunshine.\n  Also of special interest are the provisions seeking to improve \naviation security.\n  This conference report will require more comprehensive employment \ninvestigations, including criminal history records checks, for \nindividuals who will screen airline passengers, baggage, and property. \nWe remove the legislative straitjacket that has hamstrung the FAA's \nefforts to deploy security equipment in airports.\n\n  When we talk about a security system that will cost as much as one B-\n2 bomber, we can't expect the airlines to shoulder that burden alone.\n  The conference report puts the administration on top of airport \nsafety and security functions. Right now, this task is undertaken \nalmost exclusively by the air carriers. From now on, the FAA will be \nfirmly in charge.\n  Another problem is the lax attitude we have toward some of the most \ncritical players: Those who monitor the x-ray machines. What is the \npoint of having $1 million machines if these workers are being paid \nminimum wage and lack any basic training? Americans should not expect a \nsecond-class attitude will produce first-class security.\n  The amendment will toughen up the attention paid to these critical \nworkers.\n  There remains, however, one glaringly weak link in the security \nchain.\n\n[[Page S12113]]\n\n It is that we don't even have an evaluation of the current status of \nsecurity at our Nation's airports. We need a basic security baseline in \norder to establish goals and priorities. We need regular reports on \nwhether the goals are being met. This is not rocket science. It is \nsecurity 101. Although this is not included in the bill, I intend to \nwork with the FAA on this in the coming months.\n  Finally, I want to note another very important provision for Oregon: \nFunding protection for smaller airports. These airports, such as Bandon \nand John Day and Klamath Falls, serve citizens in the more rural parts \nof my State. Without the funding formula in this bill, these smaller \nairports would suffer disproportionate cuts in grant funds when \nappropriations are tight. Unless I've missed something, there doesn't \nappear to be any extra airport improvement grant funding lying around.\n  Mr. President, there are many other important elements in this \nlegislation. I want to conclude by again thanking the leaders of the \nCommerce Committee for their excellent work on a good aviation safety \nand security bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When does the time terminate? Right just before 5?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom Arizona. He yielded those 8 minutes to the junior Senator from \nTexas, and 24 minutes remain to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, acting in his capacity as the \nSenator from Washington, suggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas has 8 minutes yielded by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is hard to imagine that we are \nreally still here, talking about whether we are going to vote on an \naviation security bill. We know that we must have this. We are trying \nto respond in a responsible way to the potential for terrorism in our \nairports. We are trying to make sure that the FAA has the tools that it \nneeds for safety. Yet, we are being held up on a really technical \npoint, not to mention taking people away from what they need to be \ndoing right now with regard to the rest of this session. I do not \nunderstand it.\n  What we are talking about today is the most bipartisan solution to a \nreal problem that we have in this Government, and that is the \nreauthorization of the FAA, which thousands of the traveling public \ndepend on for the safety of our airline passengers, as well as the \nsafety of our visitors to this country. We have the reauthorization \nbefore us, and it is October 1 and we are not able to move forward.\n  I would like to talk about a few of the things that are in this bill \nwhich we cannot do today because we are in the middle of some kind of \nfilibuster, which really is meaningless because we are going to vote on \nthis bill sometime before the end of this week. But here is what we are \nnot able to do today because this bill has not been passed.\n  We are trying to get explosive detection devices certified by the \nFAA. There is $400 million in the continuing resolution that we passed \nlast night, and it is for the technologies which are now available that \nwe are not using in this country but that they are using in foreign \ncountries for the detection of explosive devices that might be taken on \nan airplane.\n  These devices that could be certified, right now, today, if we could \npass this bill, cannot be deployed without this provision. So we are \nlosing valuable time in getting the best of the technology.\n  You may ask, ``Gosh, we put our bags through screens right now at \nairports.'' That is true, we do. But those screens were made to stop \nhijackers. Those screens were made to detect guns and knives, but not \nexplosive devices, and particularly not the high-level, sophisticated \nexplosive devices that we know are now on the market. But detection \ndevices are available for those devices. We can detect those explosives \nif we can deploy the equipment and get it certified by the FAA, which \nwe cannot do right now because this bill is being debated on a \ntechnicality that was decided by Congresses in the past and which has \nbeen decided by this Congress, and it is just a matter of time before \nwe get to what will be an overwhelmingly positive vote that will show \nthat this Congress has decided this issue.\n\n  We would require background checks for baggage and passenger \nscreeners. We believe it is prudent to have background checks on the \ncontracted-out employees who are doing this screening. That is in this \nbill. The FAA would be able to audit the criminal records checks for \ntarmac-access employees. That is provided in this bill, if we can pass \nit.\n  We are going to have a study that will determine if we can have \nbaggage-match reports on domestic flights. One of the things that is \ndone on overseas flights is matching baggage that is checked with the \npassengers. I believe this is going to be feasible on our domestic \nflights, because I think the technology is there that will keep us from \nhaving the delays that the airlines have been concerned about. So we \nwant to be able to assess that, and that is provided for in this bill. \nBut it is being held up now with this debate over a nonissue so that we \nare not going to be able to immediately go forward to implement tests \non baggage match, which may be one of the most important ways to make \nour airlines and our airports more safe.\n  We are also going to ask the FAA in this bill, when it is passed, to \nlook at how we can improve security for mail, for cargo. It is \nimportant that the sense of the Senate in this bill which says we \nbelieve that cargo security can be enhanced be passed, because if we \ncan enhance cargo security, that is one area that really is pervasive \nin our aviation system, and it is really the underbelly, to use a pun, \nof aviation security.\n  We would require, in this bill, an aviation security/FBI liaison in \ncities with high-risk airports to coordinate with the FAA. This bill \nsays that we think there needs to be a person in every FBI office where \nthere is a high-risk airport--any airport that has international \nservice--that in every FBI office, there should be a liaison with the \nFAA and with the airport to make sure that there is coordination, where \ninformation is exchanged, where the FBI can look at what the FAA is \ndoing or what the airlines are doing for security, to give their \nopinion about whether it is sufficient or whether it could be improved.\n  In fact, we would have a joint threat assessment by the FAA and the \nFBI, and they want that authorization. Both entities want to work \ntogether, and they want the authorization to do that. It makes sense.\n  So why aren't they doing that? Because we are discussing a labor \nissue that was decided years ago. The people of America probably don't \nunderstand that, and many of us on this floor don't understand that \neither.\n  We are talking about taking away the dual mandate of the FAA, which \nis promotion of the airlines and safety. That has always been a kind of \na conflict that has had to be resolved from time to time, and we are \ntaking promotion out, because the airlines do a good job of that.\n  When the FAA was created back in the old days, airlines were just \nbeginning, and people had to be convinced that airlines were going to \nbe safe. But now we see the safety record of airlines, and it is \nterrific. You are safer on an airplane than driving to the airport, and \nthat is a fact. So now we are going to make safety the mandate of the \nFAA, and that is proper, because passengers want to make sure that they \nare safe.\n\n  I think of the families of the passengers on TWA Flight 800 who went \nto France this week. They are trying to put their lives back together. \nI think of what those families are thinking about, what their loved \nones felt when they were thousands of feet above the ground and, \nthrough no fault of their own, their lives were taken from them, and \nthey were helpless.\n  We want to make it as safe as possible for every traveling American, \nand this bill will do it. Mr. President, there is no reason to be \nholding this bill up on matters that have been decided by this \nCongress. There is no reason to hold this bill up over a technical \nlabor\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\nissue that has been decided by this Congress. We have so many important \nsafety issues in this bill that are being addressed. We should be \nresponsible and get this bill out today so that we do not delay for 1 \nmore day the deployment of the explosive detection devices that are \nready to go on line and into our airports to provide the level of \nsafety that our passengers require, expect, and are entitled to.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that those who are holding up this bill, \nknowing that they will not succeed, but, nevertheless, imposing on \ntheir fellow colleagues to make some sort of point that is not being \nvery well made and putting in jeopardy the safety of the flying public \nand people who go into airports by the hundreds of thousands in this \ncountry every day--we could be doing more, and we could be doing it \nright now. The FAA is waiting for this authorization. It is at hand. \nWhy would we be delaying for the next 2 days when we could start the \ndeployment today, this minute, of the explosive detection devices which \nare provided for in the continuing resolution that has already been \nsigned by the President and all we need is the authorization to do it?\n  It is not responsible, and I call on my colleagues who are holding \nthis bill up and ask them to be responsible and help us address these \nissues for the safety of Americans and our families and our loved ones.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the conference on H.R. \n3539, the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of l996, I rise in support \nof this critically important aviation safety and security legislation. \nDespite some unwarranted, partisan exchanges in the past few days--\nunwarranted because this is in no way a partisan issue--this is \nbipartisan legislation which enjoys strong support on both sides of the \naisle. When we vote on final passage later this week, I believe this \nlegislation quite deservedly will enjoy overwhelming support.\n  There are many Senators from both parties who had a hand in crafting \nthis legislation. Today, I wish to express my personal thanks to some \nof my colleagues.\n  My good friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, has been a driving force \nbehind this legislation. As chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, \nSenator McCain set the lofty goal of meaningful reform of the FAA. \nThrough Senator McCain's tireless efforts, this legislation puts in \nplace a mechanism to ensure the FAA is on firm footing to meet our \naviation needs well into the new century. Senator McCain's great vision \nin aviation policy can be seen throughout this conference report.\n  I also want to commend my good friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, \nwho is really the unsung hero of this legislation. When we reached an \nimpasse as to how best to address the question of long-term FAA \nfinancing reform, it was Senator Stevens' thoughtful suggestion of an \nindependent task force study that broke the deadlock. Those who have \nwatched the debate on this conference report over the past week have \nseen firsthand Senator Stevens' passion for aviation safety and \nimproving the treatment of families of aviation disaster victims.\n  Let me also commend and thank my good friend from South Carolina, the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, who \nprovided important leadership on this conference report. Also, let me \nacknowledge the leadership of Senator Ford, the ranking member of the \nAviation Subcommittee.\n  H.R. 3539 is a bipartisan, omnibus aviation safety and security bill. \nIt reauthorizes the airport improvement program [AIP] and thereby \nensures airports across the Nation will continue to receive Federal \nfunding for safety-related repairs and other improvements. It reforms \nthe FAA in a way which hopefully will reduce bureaucracy, increase \nresponsiveness, and enhance the efficiency of that agency. The \nconference report also contains numerous provisions which will improve \naviation safety, enhance aviation security and provide long overdue \nassistance to the families of victims of aviation disasters.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have said repeatedly in this body over the past \nfew days, we have a responsibility to the American traveling public to \npass this legislation before we adjourn. For instance, this legislation \nprovides statutory authority to deploy explosive detection devices at \nour Nation's airports as recommended by the White House Commission on \nAviation Safety and Security on which I serve. Even though yesterday \nthe Congress approved funding to purchase these explosive detection \ndevices, without passage of this conference report the Federal \nGovernment will not have statutory authority to deploy them. Such a \nscenario is completely unacceptable. The American public expects the \nlevel of security at our airports to be improved immediately. We must \nrespond before the Senate adjourns.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about what this \nlegislation means to my home State of South Dakota. In South Dakota, \nair service is critical to economic development. For example, the \ndecision whether to open a new factory in a small city or where to \nlocate a new business often turns on the availability of good air \nservice. That was never more evident to me than when a company recently \nvisited Rapid City, SD to consider relocating there. This move would \ncreate more than 100 new jobs. One of the very first questions they \nasked my staff concerned air service between Rapid City and a major hub \nairport. In South Dakota, air service and economic development go hand \nin hand.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a great air service victory for \nSouth Dakota.\n  First, the legislation doubles the size of the Essential Air Service \n[EAS] program to $50 million. What does that mean? It means the cities \nof Brookings, Mitchell, and Yankton in my State will be ensured of a \ncontinued air service link to our national air service network. In \naddition to helping to protect existing EAS service in Brookings, \nMitchell, and Yankton, I am hopeful that a $50 million EAS program will \nresult in increased air service for these cities. A $50 million EAS \nProgram is great news for the economy of South Dakota.\n\n  Second, the legislation ensures small airports such as those in South \nDakota finally receive their full and fair share of AIP entitlement \nfunds. Adequately maintained airports are critical to air service. They \nalso are critical to air safety. Under the new AIP formula I helped \ndevelop in this conference report, South Dakota airports are big \nwinners. For instance, AIP entitlement funds will increase at least \n$225,000 annually for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport, $170,000 for \nthe Rapid City Airport, and $100,000 each for the Aberdeen, Regional \nAirport and the Pierre Regional Airport. Hopefully, improved airport \nfacilities resulting from this formula adjustment will help stimulate \nincreased air service in Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Aberdeen and Pierre. \nAgain, such a result would be great news for economic development in \nthose cities and our State. The new formula ensures they receive their \nfair share of Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, this conference report should have passed the Senate \nlast week. Regrettably, a few Senators have been using procedural \nmaneuvers to hold up this vitally important aviation safety and \nsecurity legislation over one provision they find objectionable. During \ndebate, I have listened to those Senators mischaracterize this \nprovision as some type of conspiracy by the Republican leadership. That \nbaseless assertion could not be further from the truth. As the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings forcefully pointed out during yesterday's debate, the \nprovision in dispute is a provision that Senator Hollings, a senior \nDemocratic Member of this body, offered. Moreover, there is nothing \npartisan about the Hollings amendment. In fact, it was supported by all \nfive Senate conferees including Senator Hollings and Senator Ford, two \nof the most respected Democratic Members of this body.\n  Yesterday during debate on the Hollings amendment, I heard several \nMembers of the group blocking this legislation make blanket statements \nthat the Hollings amendment is not truly a technical correction. With \nall due respect to those Members, I authored the ICC Termination Act. I \nknow what we intended to do in that legislation. Therefore, I can \nunequivocally say they are dead wrong. In the ICC legislation, the \nSenate never intended to strip Federal Express or any person of rights \nwithout the benefit of a hearing, debate or even discussion. That point \nis\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nmade crystal clear by section 10501 which reads ``the enactment of the \nICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage \nof the employees and employers by the Railway Labor Act.''\n  Mr. President, fairness dictates we correct that inadvertent error. \nThat is precisely what the Hollings amendment does. It is exactly why I \nsupported it in conference. It is why I continue to support it \nstrongly.\n  This historic piece of aviation legislation reflects the outstanding \nwork Congress does when it proceeds on a bipartisan basis. We should \nmeet our responsibility to the American traveling public by passing it \nas soon as possible. Lets get the job done for the American public. I \nurge that the Senate immediately pass the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3539.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time yielded to the Senator from Arizona has \nexpired. The clerk will call the roll and charge the time against the \ntime remaining.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes or less as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WRIGHT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak here this evening to express my \nsadness and deep regret at the death last Saturday of a friend and \ncivic activist in the city of Seattle, Howard S. Wright. Mr. Wright can \nappropriately be called one of the great builders of modern Seattle. He \nwas the head of a major construction firm for many years. His company \nwas responsible for the building of the tallest of our structures, \namong many others, a set of buildings with the vision behind which led \nto much more beautiful development in downtown Seattle.\n  After leaving the construction business, he went into the allied \nprofession, development, and there also was not only successful, but \nsuccessful in a way that will leave a long-term and positive impact on \nthe city he so loved.\n  While Howard Wright was magnificently successful as a businessman, he \nalso gave at least as much as he received back to his community in the \nform of his activities in charitable foundations, such as the Seattle \nFoundation; to the arts, through the Seattle Opera Association and the \nArts Commission; through sports, as one of the original owners of the \nSeattle Seahawks; and in the field of horse racing; to his schools, \nLakeside and the University of Washington; and to other enterprises too \nnumerous to mention.\n  Another great Seattle citizen, a friend of both Howard Wright's and \nof mine, Herman Sarkowsky, was quoted recently as saying that Howard \nWright had ``an insatiable appetite to learn everything about his \ncity,'' to learn, Mr. President, and to do.\n  But, in addition to these objective statements about Howard Wright, I \nmust add his own personal friendship to me and to all of my \nundertakings, his constant counsel and advice, and a sunny disposition, \nwhich never admitted that there was a task too great to be \naccomplished, that never admitted that there was not another friend to \nbe made, another goal to be achieved.\n  Mr. Wright will be missed by his family, by his community, by all of \nthe organizations to which he so unstintingly gave his time and his \nmoney, and by this U.S. Senator as a friend.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I seek the floor today just to make the \nrecord complete before the year ends with reference to what happened to \nthe allocation of the highway trust fund or what is about to happen to \nit.\n  First, I want to put in the Record all of the States of the Union and \nthe 1996 actual allocation, the percent and the dollar loss or gain \nfrom the 1996 allocation to the 1997 allocation. The minimum amount \nthat States lost because of this new allocation is found in the last \ncolumn of this chart. I ask unanimous consent that this chart be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what I understand and what I think \nhappened is that the administration, principally through the Secretary \nof the Treasury's office, made a major error in calculating the flow of \nmoney into the Highway Transportation Trust Fund, and that means that \nthe Federal money for projects in States like mine of New Mexico will \ndrop $20 million--I should say at least $20 million--from last year's \n$169 million that we received.\n  Actually, the reason I say ``at least'' is because we did increase \nthe obligational authority. So actually a State like mine and a State \nlike the one of the Senator presiding here in the Senate should \nprobably have received more in the 1997 allocation than they did in \n1996. So this chart is just saying, if we would have received the same \noverall obligational authority --that is the big pot of money to be \ndistributed--our respective States should have gotten at least what \nthey got in 1996. Instead, they are getting less.\n\n  Now, the first point, Congress in that year did not change the \nformula. The formula was a multiyear operational formula that told the \nadministration, between the Secretary of the Treasury which reports the \nreceipts of the gasoline tax, and the Secretary of Transportation, to \nallocate pursuant to that multiyear formula.\n  Now, something happened because, as a matter of fact, more money was \ntaken in, the formula was not changed, and we get less money--\nsubstantially less money. Now, it is very interesting.\n  On the other hand, it is almost incomprehensible to the Senator from \nNew Mexico because some States got huge amounts of new money. For \ninstance, New York gets $111 million less than this minimum I have been \ndescribing that they probably should have received. I have told the \nSenate about New Mexico. Then, if we look down and say, well, what \nhappened to California? Well, California gets $122 million more than \nthey would have received if we would have had a 1996 allocation of the \nsame amount of money in 1996, even though we got more going into this \nformula now. And, interestingly enough, the State of Texas--I do not \nknow how this all happened, it is almost some kind of phenomenal \nevent--apparently for no real reason, the State of Texas got a $182 \nmillion increase. The State of Massachusetts, a $73 million decrease.\n  Now, frankly, I believe this error should have been corrected by this \nadministration. In fact, ten Senators sent a letter to the Secretary of \nTransportation well before any drop-dead date with reference to sending \nthe money out, urging that the Secretary of Transportation correct the \nerror. We sent that letter on September 20th.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing regarding the Department \n     of Transportation's decision to use data from the Treasury \n     Department that includes a $1.6 billion accounting error in \n     the calculation of highway apportionments for fiscal years \n     1996 and 1997.\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\n       The Department of Transportation's decision to use the data \n     without first correcting the error unfairly disadvantages our \n     states. Therefore, we are requesting an explanation as to why \n     the Department of Transportation has used this error in its \n     apportionment formulas. At this point in time, it is still \n     not clear why your Department has not been able to address \n     this issue administratively.\n       Attached to this letter is a short list of questions which \n     we hope will improve our understanding. The answers to these \n     questions will be necessary to respond to inquires from our \n     respective states. We also expect that the answers to these \n     questions will help us to determine how a similar situation \n     could be avoided in the future.\n       The states affected by this error will receive their \n     apportionments on October 1, 1996. We, therefore, request a \n     response to this letter by Wednesday, September 25. Thank you \n     for your prompt attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         John H. Chafee, Pete V. Domenici, Max Baucus, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Larry Pressler, Joe Biden, Tom Daschle, \n           Alfonse D'Amato, Daniel P. Moynihan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We attached to it the fundamental questions to the \nSecretary of Transportation regarding this incorrect allocation, this \nlowering of some States and increasing of some States, without any \nchange in the national formula, which is the law, and with an increase \nin the total amount we had to spend.\n  The error in the distribution of the 1997 funds to all States came \nabout through an error of the Treasury Department in calculating the \nhighway trust fund. Then we proceeded to ask several questions.\n  I also ask unanimous consent the questions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Questions Regarding DOT Decision To Implement Highway Formulas With \n                     $1.6 Billion Accounting Error\n\n       (1) Given the significant implications of the accounting \n     error, did the Department request an ``official'' correction \n     that could be used in the apportionment formulas?\n       (2) To help gain an understanding of why the error could \n     not be addressed administratively, please provide a copy of \n     decision memos, legal opinions and other supporting materials \n     and tables that led to the Department's decision to apportion \n     funds based on incorrect data.\n       (3) Did the Department consult with the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB) in making this decision? Did the \n     1997 budget baseline for the Department of Transportation \n     assume that the error was corrected? Please describe any OMB \n     policy guidance in this area.\n       (4) Does the Department have any recommendations to avoid a \n     similar situation in the future?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Interestingly enough, we have not heard from the \nSecretary of Transportation. This is an urgent request. They are in the \nmiddle of making final decisions which will cost my State a very big \npercentage of its highway trust fund, which will cost New York $111 \nmillion, which will cost States like New Jersey a very large amount of \nmoney.\n  Now, I am here because all I want is fairness. I cannot understand \nnor comprehend how the same old formula that is mandatory that they \nhave to use, how it could turn out 1 year later to totally change what \neach State gets, when it has been applied for 4 consecutive years, and \nwe could look at those averages, and nothing like this has happened.\n  Now, I have come to the Senate because I urge that the Secretary of \nTransportation fix this. I do not have any hopes that he will. In fact, \nI do not believe politically that they can. That does not make it \nright.\n  Can you imagine the Secretary of Transportation taking this money \nthat I just described away from California, after they told them that \nis what they will get--even though it is wrong? Can you imagine the \nPresident saying, essentially, through his Transportation Secretary, to \nTexas that they should get what is the right number, instead of what is \nthe wrong number--when they have already been telling them how much \nmore they get? I could go on State by State.\n  I believe it should be fixed. I do not think the States which have \nbeen adversely effected by this should take this sitting down. We \ncannot fix this. That is the prerogative of the House of \nRepresentatives. They did not want to fix it. That does not mean it is \nright, nor does that add any strength to the fact that they are wrong. \nThat does not make their numbers right because Congress did not take \naction in the waning days. That is obvious, as a matter of law that \nthat is not the case.\n  Frankly, I hope the States that have been denied their fair \nproportion under errors in calculations by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, that were then forwarded to Transportation and apparently are \nabout to be acted upon, that does not make those right. I believe \nStates should take a look at it. They ought to look and see what their \nrights of action are.\n  This is a very, very, big mistake. For some States, it will never be \ncorrected. I cannot tell New Mexico--we are a small State; $20 million \nis a small amount of money, big percentage, one of the highest \npercentage of reductions. The State of Rhode Island got a small amount \nbut a big reduction. The State of Montana, small amount of money, but a \nbig reduction--I cannot tell them come January, February, March, ``We \nwill fix this and give you the money you lost by the error.''\n  I do not think I can promise that, for probably by then it will \nrequire we put a whole bunch of new money in the trust fund or that we \nallocate some extra money because, what about the States that think \nthey can rely upon what the Federal Government has told them they will \nget. I submit they ought not be relying on it. I hope they have people \nkeeping tab up here because I do not think they can rely on that money \nbecause I do not think it is theirs. I think it was erroneously \nallocated through a misapplication of a formula that is clear and \nprecise and applied either the wrong numbers, wrong receipts--and they \nhad plenty of time to fix it in the executive branch of Government.\n  Mr. President, while we are closing down tonight, I hope the \nSecretary of the Treasury's people that are watching, as they probably \ndo from time to time, understand this may not be over with. I am urging \nStates to do something about it themselves. I think they might look at \nwhether they have a cause of action against the Federal Government. I \nam urging they take a look as to whether they can even get an \ninjunction against the U.S. Government for misallocating this money and \nask it be held up long enough for them to seek justice within the court \nsystem. That is just my thought. That is nobody else's. I do not hold \nanybody to it.\n  I tell you, this error is over $1 billion. That means, erroneously, \nStates have been denied over $1 billion, and it has been funneled to \nother States, of the formula that they should have applied, was voted \non up or down, and prevailed with a handsome majority when that formula \nwas put in. I happen to know about that. I was not on the committee but \nI think I know how the formula came about. In fact, I know how the \nformula came about 5 years before that. It is very similar.\n  The point of it is, the formula has not been changed, the dollars to \nbe distributed are higher, and 28 States get less. Now, that just does \nnot jibe. It just does not make for good sense. Something is awry, \namiss, gone wrong, and I hope it gets fixed. I hope the Secretary of \nTransportation takes a look. It has taken them about 10 days to answer \nthe letter. That is pretty unusual. It has taken 5 days to answer a \nphone call where I asked him about this, and he will get back to me.\n  We will see tomorrow, 1 day before we go out, if we get something \nfrom them.\n\nTECHNICAL

Mr. President, although I am thoroughly disappointed in \nthe process we endured to reach agreement on the fiscal year 1997 \nomnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 4278--I am pleased with the content \nof the bill. It is a huge package, so I am sure we will not know its \nfull impact until weeks--possibly months--into this fiscal year. It \nwould be difficult to put a package like this together without there \nbeing some disappointment in the final product. However, as a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I worked hard to see that many programs \nthat are important to Nebraskans and this Nation were addressed.\n  Let me highlight some of these programs.\n\n\n                         Commerce-Justice-State\n\n  I have long supported the National Telecommunication Administration's \nTelecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program. \nLast year I led the effort on the floor to include $21.5 million for \nTIIAP and I'm pleased to see that amount in fiscal year 1997 funding. \nThis is especially important when considering the Senate Commerce-\nJustice-State Subcommittee began the process with zero funding for this \nimportant program. People sometimes ask why we need this program when \nthere is so much going on in the telecommunications industry. We need \nit to help our rural areas share fully in the promise of networking and \ntelecommunications. We need it to help our nonprofit sector \nparticipate. We need it to encourage the imaginative and sometime high-\nrisk demonstrations of what can be done with the technology.\n  We have included $174.5 million for the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Program and $560 million for the Byrne Memorial \nGrant Program which is important and insightful. If we can stop \njuveniles from turning to crime, I believe we have a chance at \ndecreasing the need for courthouses, incarceration, and prison \nconstruction. The potential benefit is well worth the investment.\n\n\n                                Interior\n\n  I am pleased to see that the bill includes funding for one of my top \npriorities, Back to the River. This project is a collaborative effort \nto create a recreational, ecological, and cultural corridor along the \nMissouri River in the Omaha/Council Bluffs region. The project \nencompasses 64 river miles and has been ongoing for the last 2 years. \nIt has the support of several public and private agencies. The Back to \nthe River project will benefit Nebraska and the Nation by providing \nhabitat restoration, floodplain management, recreation and river \naccess, economic benefits, cultural resources and environmental \neducation. The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service have \nboth been involved in this project.\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\n  The omnibus bill funds the National Endowment for the Humanities at \nthe current level, which is higher than either the House or Senate \nnumber in the original Interior appropriations bill. NEH programs \nprovide vital support to scholarship, education, and public programs in \nhistory, literature, and other aspects of the humanities. Support for \nour State humanities councils is particularly important because it is \nthese generally small offices in each State that expand access to the \nhumanities and that allows for a focus on local history, local \nliterature, and local culture. They serve the very important function \nof helping us understand who and what we are.\n\n  The bill also funds the National Endowment for the Arts at its \ncurrent level. NEA programs support our many performing arts' companies \nthroughout the United States and our museums and also help fund the \nState arts councils.\n  In both instances I wish we had been able to provide additional \nfunding but there will be an opportunity to revisit these programs next \nyear.\n\n\n                               Labor-HHS\n\n  I am pleased about the increase in funding over the House and Senate \nlevels for educational technology. I share some of the conferees' \nconcerns over the educational technology program and believe that \nincreased efforts must be undertaken to insure that technology advances \nlearning and curriculum goals and that we understand how technology \ncontributes to improved student performance. Over the years, we have \ncome to understand that students' learning patterns may vary widely; \ntechnology offers us the opportunity to consider and to respond to the \nvarious ways in which an individual learns.\n  Of vital importance to Nebraska is the Impact Aid Program. Our \ncommitment to militarily impacted and Native American districts is a \nFederal obligation; in fact, by shirking our responsibility to these \ndistricts, we create yet another unfunded Federal mandate. For fiscal \nyear 1997, we were able to increase funding by $37 million over fiscal \nyear 1996 to $730 million for Impact Aid districts, including \nadditional funding for our heavily impacted, section F districts, such \nas Bellevue.\n  Equally important, this year's appropriations bill includes increased \nfunding for the title I and Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs, both \nof which have proven to be successful programs here in Nebraska for the \nbenefit of our students. Title I for disadvantaged students receives a \n$470 million increase over fiscal year 1996 which brings the total for \nfiscal year 1997 to $7.7 billion. This will enable us to serve nearly a \nhalf million more children. Safe and Drug Free Schools--a program for \nwhich I have heard many accolades from Nebraska educators and \nadministrators--receives an additional $90 million over 1996 funding, \nfor a total of $556 million.\n  Increasingly, concern exists among both students and their parents \nregarding escalating college costs. We are providing increased funding \nwhich will allow 3.8 million students to receive aid while also \nincreasing the maximum award level to $2,700, a $230 increase. For \nfiscal year 1997, a total of $7.6 billion will be available for student \nfinancial assistance--$1.3 billion above the previous year's \nappropriations.\n  Job training efforts will also benefit from increased funding levels. \nI am especially pleased to see Summer Youth Employment and Training \nfunded at $871 million. This program provides vital funding for youth \nsummer jobs.\n  I am also pleased to see that the Health Careers Opportunity Program \nwas funded at $26.8 million--an increase of nearly $3 million over \nfiscal year 1996. This award goes to medical schools and other medical \nprofessional training programs that recruit and train minority and \ndisadvantaged students.\n\n\n                            Treasury-Postal\n\n  We were able to include funding, which the House had rescinded, for \nthe National Archives for an on-line, interactive data base available \nvia the World Wide Web. It provides unprecedented access to the \nNational Archives' vast holdings. The National Archives holds a rich \nand priceless resource that, until now, has had limited access for a \nrelatively small number of people. I feel strongly that information \nheld by government at all levels should become more accessible and \nusable by the average American citizen. The treasures maintained by the \nNational Archives should be accessible to all Americans--not just \nresearchers who reside near College Park, MD, or those individuals who \ncan afford a trip to Washington, DC or those who are fortunate to have \na Federal archives facility located in their State.\n  The increase of methamphetamine use in the Midwest is a serious \nproblem. I am pleased to see that this bill includes $8 million to \ndesignate the Midwest States of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, \nand Kansas as a high-intensity drug trafficking area [HIDTA]. This \ndesignation will provide added law enforcement resources to these \nMidwest States and will allow law enforcement officials in these states \nto conduct a coordinated tracking and enforcement effort.\n  Mr. President, let me restate my disappointment in the process that \naccompanied this spending bill. I firmly believe that every program and \nproject that is funded with taxpayer dollars deserves the full scrutiny \nof all Americans, and should not be conducted in back-room \nnegotiations. Two of the bills included in this package--those funding \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education and \nthe Departments of Commerce, Justice and State--were never considered \non the Senate floor. Further, funding legislation for the Department of \nthe Treasury and the Postal Service as well as the Department of \nInterior were partially considered, but never finished.\n  Indeed, Members of this body--from both sides of the aisle--were \ndenied the opportunity to offer pertinent, important amendments to \nthese funding bills or to be heard simply because the process of debate \nand discussion was brought to an abrupt end and replaced with back-room \nnegotiations. Mr. President, this is not the way policy should be made.\n  Last year we needed to pass several continuing resolutions--temporary \nfunding measures--before we finally came to an agreement on spending \nlevels for fiscal year 1996. We did not finish our appropriations work \nuntil April of this year. And that came after having to shut the \nGovernment down three times, which resulted in the additional \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars.\n  When faced with explaining why the Government spends hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars on any program or project, I believe that it must be \nable to pass the coffee shop test. That is to say, it must be \ndefendable in a coffee shop in Fremont, North Platte, or O'Neill, NE, \nor any small town in the United States. After all it is their money we \nare spending. So at the very least, we as elected officials owe it to \nthe people we represent to openly debate the merits of Government \nspending on the Senate floor.\n  I thought the Republican leadership had learned the lesson last year \nthat getting our work done as legislators and representatives was the \nmost important matter--not individual or political glory. And while \nthis year we are not in the same situation of having a temporary \nfunding measure--and a Government shutdown has been avoided--things are \nnot that much different. I truly believe the American people have been \nshortchanged again.\n  Yes, I am glad the task is complete. And I am pleased, for the most \npart, with what I know is included in this funding legislation. But, \nMr. President, I am concerned that the process--and perhaps this \ninstitution--has been slightly diminished. Diminished because the \nappearance and the reality is that our duty as legislators--and the \ninterests of the American people--took a backseat to the interests of \ncampaigning for reelection. During a time when we face an increasingly \nskeptical electorate, we can ill afford to continue this trend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12117-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12118-S12119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to explain my \nvote in opposition to the omnibus consolidated appropriations bill. To \nme, the title of this bill goes a long way in explaining why I am \nskeptical about its content. When Congress delivers an omnibus spending \nbill, taxpayers should grab for their wallet. I wish to commend the \ntremendous effort of\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\nChairman Hatfield to bring together a bill that would satisfy the \npriorities of all of those involved. Indeed the chairman has been \nextremely generous to my State of Kansas. But I must protest a process \nand a final product that abdicates Congress' responsibilities to \nunselected officials who have no constitutional role in the power of \nthe purse; a role relegated by Constitution solely to the Congress. I \nam speaking of President Clinton's Chief of Staff who sat in, with veto \npower over the deliberations of the house and Senate conferees.\n  I am at a loss to explain why those who maintain such an abiding \ncommitment to reforming Congress and to cutting wasteful spending have \ncast their vote in support for this bill. If nothing else this bill \nrepresents business as usual. It is 16 pounds, 2,000 pages, and has no \naccompanying report, making it impossible to determine exactly where \nthe money is going. Eight billion to jump start the war on drugs is \njust one example. What does that mean? To what programs will that large \nsum be directed? It sounds like a positive move, but it has no \naccountability. We shouldn't be making political statements of that \nmagnitude with the taxpayers' money. As I have noted, this bill \nrepresents a total abdication of our constitutional responsibility. In \nshort, it is a cop-out in our responsibility to the taxpayer.\n  I do not favor another Government shutdown. As Lieutenant Governor \nand secretary of administration with responsibility for the State \nemployees of my State of Kansas, we were forced to furlough workers \nfrom their jobs, through no fault of their own because the President \nwanted to make political hay. Sadly, it was the Congress that received \nthe blame. It seems that in Washington, if you lose the battle of the \nspin control, good policy and good Government don't matter. So cowed by \nthe specter of another Government shutdown are Members of Congress that \nthe political courage to get our job done, to make the tough calls and \nto provide a responsible spending package evaporated with the hint of \nmisdirected public ire. Spin has once again won over responsible \npolicy.\n  Senator after Senator has come to this Chamber to express their \nconcern over the process that cobbled this bill together. The pork and \nlargess included have been decried. But I don't see much willingness to \nconfront the problem and fix it. That is what troubles me. This is not \na good bill and Members know it. They have said so. I am saying so.\n  When I came to the U.S. Senate I pledged to the people of Kansas that \nI was prepared to make the tough calls. From my first vote, a vote to \nbalance the budget and get the country's financial house in order, I \nhave been committed to that pledge. So it is in keeping with my pledge \nthat I cast my vote against this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12118-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have had the honor and privilege of \nserving with Senator Kassebaum on both the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources and, I must \nsay, that service together has always been, for me, a pleasure.\n  Senator Kassebaum has served on the Labor Committee from the 101st \nthrough the 104th Congress. In the 101st and the 102d she served as the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities. \nDuring that period, we worked most closely and successfully together on \nmatters such as the reauthorization of the Carl Perkins Vocational \nEducation Act in 1990, Library Services and Construction in 1990, and \nthe Higher Education Act in 1992. We worked in the strong bipartisan \nfashion that has traditionally been the hallmark of the subcommittee.\n  In the 103d Congress Senator Kassebaum became the ranking member of \nthe full Labor Committee, and we continued to work closely together on \nsuch important matters as Goals 2000 and the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994.\n  Most recently, I have been proud to work with her in her present \ncapacity as chairman of the Labor Committee in this, the 104th \nCongress. Her Workforce Development Act provided a much-needed overhaul \nand consolidation of our job training programs, and it also contained a \nseries of very strong and positive vocational and adult education \nprovisions. I supported the legislation both in committee and on the \nSenate floor, and regret very much that the Senate bill did not \nprevail.\n  Similarly, Mr. President, we served together since the 97th Congress \non the Committee on Foreign Relations. There, to my enormous regret, \nthe tradition of bipartisanship is not quite as well entrenched, but \npartisan conflicts were never caused by Senator Kassebaum. She always \nconducted herself in the most rational, informed and moderate fashion.\n  I would add that, in her years on the committee, she developed a \nremarkable expertise regarding the continent and the countries of \nAfrica and an accompanying--and admirable--dedication to the often \nneglected peoples of that continent. During those years she traveled \noften to Africa, came to know its geography, and developed \nrelationships with its political and business leaders. I think it is \nfair to say that she was unrivaled as the Senate's expert on Africa and \nAfrican issues.\n  In the years we have worked together on both committees, I can say \nwithout question that Nancy Kassebaum has always been thoughtful, \nconsiderate, and gracious. I can also say that she is tenacious and \ndetermined. But most of all, she brings all of those traits together in \nthe most marvelous way. I know that I am not alone in this assessment. \nEveryone in this Chamber knows that is the way it is with this \ngentlewoman from Kansas.\n  While I also will not be here next year, I know for sure that this \nbody will not be the same without her principled and sensible approach \nto public policy. She will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12119-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PRYOR\n\n  Mr. PELL.

His special qualities of modesty and quiet \naccomplishment are all too rare. I have always greatly appreciated his \ndecency and courtesy and his true sense of compassion.

I wish all the best for \nDavid and Barbara Pryor in the years ahead, and want them to know that \nthey will always have my warmest friendship and admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12119-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12119-S12120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, we who have the privilege of serving in this \nbody soon find that we may not always be in agreement with friends and \ncolleagues for whom we have high regard.\n  The senior Senator from Georgia (Mr. Nunn) is such a colleague. I \nhave always found him to be a man of singular ability, rectitude and \ndecency. He came here as a youthful successor to a legendary \npredecessor, Senator Richard B. Russell, and quickly established \nhimself as a serious and studious Member who could and did thoroughly \nmaster the intricacies of national defense policy.\n  Senator Nunn's term of service coincided with the last two decades of \nthe cold war, and he leaves his mark as one of the architects of U.S. \ndefense policy during that trying epoch. I sometimes found myself in \ndisagreement with his emphasis on large defense budgets, since I was \nprimarily committed to the cause of arms control and restraint in the \nnuclear arms race. History seems to have demonstrated that it took a \nbalance of the two views we represented to assure our national \nsurvival.\n  Senator Nunn and I not only shared a common preoccupation with the \nmajor international issues of the time, but we brought to the task one \nvery basic common thread of experience which may have colored our \nresponses, and that was the fact that we were among the few members of \nthe Senate who had served in the U.S. Coast Guard. I served as an \nenlisted man on convoy duty in the North Atlantic in World\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\nWar II and Sam Nunn enlisted as a seaman some 20 years later when the \nworld faced other stresses.\n  Sam Nunn leaves the Senate at a relatively early age with a solid \nrecord of accomplishment. I wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12119-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as my own time in the Senate draws to a \nclose, I find myself reflecting on those people and events that I will \nremember always.\n  A man who holds a unique place in my regard and that of many others \nin the Senate is the senior Senator from Oregon (Mr. Hatfield). He came \nto the Senate in 1967, 6 years after I did, and he has become a Senator \nknown for his intelligence, acuity, grace, and for love of his State \nand country.\n  The State of Oregon has a fine heritage. Mr. Hatfield has a number of \ndistinguished predecessors. A fellow Oregonian, Senator Wayne Morse, \nvoted in 1964 against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that provided the \ncongressional blessing for what later became the Vietnam War.\n  Mark Hatfield was not in the Senate at that time. He was then \nGovernor of Oregon. But in 1965 Mark Hatfield cast the only vote at the \nNational Governor's Conference in opposition to a resolution supporting \nPresident Johnson's Vietnam war policy.\n  He has taken other principled and unpopular positions over time. In \n1981 he joined with my friend, the senior senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy) in spearheading the Senate campaign for a nuclear freeze.\n  He has been a constant advocate of restraint in the nuclear arms \nrace, limits on defense spending, an end to nuclear testing and a code \nof conduct in international arms transfers.\n  Some of Senator Hatfield's efforts such as the Nuclear Freeze in the \n1980's or the effort in the last several years to enact the code of \nconduct on arms transfers have not come to fruition. Other endeavors, \nsuch as his effort to bring about a comprehensive test ban have been \nsmashing successes. It was Senator Hatfield's own initiative in 1992 as \nranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations that led to \nthe U.S. moratorium on nuclear testing and led to the eventual ending \nof testing by all the nuclear powers and the completion this summer of \na Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Like John the Baptist, Mark Hatfield has often been a voice crying in \nthe wilderness. It is not however a role in life he has regretted. He \nhas felt obligated to speak his convictions and to let his judgments be \nknown throughout his Senate career.\n  Mr. President, as a naval lieutenant (j.g.) in the Navy, Mark \nHatfield commanded landing craft in some of the bloodiest battles World \nWar II in the Pacific. He was one of the first military officers to \nenter Hiroshima after the atomic blast destroyed that city in 1945. I \nwas in the North Atlantic in Coast Guard escort duty during World War \nII, and I know some of the emotions Mark Hatfield's experiences must \nhave stirred in him and the feelings that remain after. I can tell you \nthat, if you have seen combat, it is quite possible for you to become \nzealous in your desire to find solutions other than war and other than \nmilitary buildups to the problems you face. Among other things, having \nseen combat, you do not want to capriciously subject your children or \nanyone else's children or loved ones, to the horrors of war.\n\n  The needless and pointless sacrifices of some conflicts, such as \nVietnam, weighs heavily if you are in the position of participating in \nimportant national decisions, as Mark Hatfield has been.\n  Senator Hatfield has spoken to us all on the floor with great \neloquence over time about the value of arms control and of the \nimportance of peace to all Americans. In 1990, he told the Senate:\n\n       Peace is not the town in Pennsylvania which last year was \n     forced to cancel its high school graduation because officials \n     believed that a group of students planned to commit suicide \n     at the ceremony. And peace is not here in Washington--where \n     after leading the Nation in murders last year, children are \n     beginning to show the same psychological trauma as children \n     in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n       Can we really believe that the decisions we have made--and \n     are making--do not have a direct relationship to the violence \n     which plagues our Nation?\n       I suggest that we consider changing the motto on our coins. \n     Mr. President, It now reads: In God We Trust--but by blindly \n     pursuing the nuclear arms race, by putting the destruction of \n     life over the preservation of life, we have foresaken our \n     trust in God. We have shaken our fist at God--as E.B. White \n     once put it, we have stolen God's stuff. Our motto ought to \n     be: In Bombs We Trust. That is our national ethic--that is \n     the example we are setting--here, on this floor.\n\n  In a time when too many opinions are formed on the basis of the \nlatest polling results, it is good to have among us a Senator like Mark \nHatfield who moves unswervingly ahead toward what he perceives on the \nbasis of his intelligence and experience to be the best course for the \nNation and to continue the avid pursuit of what he sees as truly best \nfor all of the people of America.\n  In his 30 years in the Senate Mark Hatfield has tried time and again \nto do what is right. He has been willing to live with defeat, but he \nhas been steadfast in his willingness to try and try again, so long as \na chance at victory is in sight.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that the voters of Oregon, of Rhode Island, \nand of other States will do their best to make good choices in the next \nelection. We will be replaced by people with different skills and \ncapabilities, and many of them will have distinguished careers here in \nthe Senate. There will not be another Mark Hatfield, however. The \nnation should be thankful that it has been blessed with Senator \nHatfield's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12120-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12120-S12121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SIMON\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I first met the senior Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] some 40 years ago in Moscow when we found ourselves sitting \nnext to each other at the Bolshoi Ballet. Little did we ever think that \nour paths would intertwine so closely in the years that were to follow.\n  After Paul came to the House of Representatives in 1974, we found \nourselves in close collaboration in advancing the cause of education. \nWe worked together on a myriad of education issues when he was chairman \nof the House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. When he came to \nthe Senate more than a decade ago, he joined me on the Education \nSubcommittee and we have worked even more closely together on education \nissues since.\n  There is no Member of either House whose opinion on education issues \nI respect more. Paul Simon is the person we turn to for guidance on the \nsubjects of literacy and adult education. His is the counsel I have \nvalued most in higher education, on issues such as TRIO, institutional \naid, international education, graduate education, foreign language \ninstruction, and student aid. Even when we disagreed, as we did on \ndirect loans, I listened to what Paul Simon said, and I have had a deep \nand abiding respect for his advocacy of that cause. While I have \nnormally deferred to Paul on library issues, I must candidly admit that \nthe opinion of Jean, Paul's wonderfully talented wife, carried equal \nweight on those matters.\n\n  During Paul's first term in the Senate, our paths were to become \nfurther intertwined when he became a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. During his 8 years as a member of the committee he brought \nto its work the energy, creativity, and intellectual capacity which are \nhis hallmarks. Much of that time he was chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAfrica and he was tireless and eloquent in urging the committee's \nattention to the plight of that often neglected continent.\n  Paul Simon is very much an internationalist and he made important \ncontributions in such areas as human rights, arms control, and foreign \nassistance. I deeply appreciate having him as an ally in the efforts to \nreinvigorate the Arms Control and Disarmament Administration and to \nrestrain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. He was a \ntrue stalwart.\n  Finally, Mr. President, he brought his passion for the teaching of \nforeign languages to the field of foreign policy. He consistently \npressed the State Department to broaden its foreign language \ncapabilities and every State Department nominee knew that, during a \nnomination hearing, Senator Simon\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\nwas likely to grill him or her on how fluent they were in the language \nof the country to which they had been assigned. Alas, too often Senator \nSimon learned that the fluency was minimal, but he never ceased to \npress the Department to improve.\n  Throughout the period we have worked together, I have never failed to \nbe impressed by the depth of Paul's knowledge, the quiet deliberation \nwith which he pursued his goals, the strength of his convictions, and \nperhaps most important, the wisdom of his counsel. I can think of no \nmore decent and dedicated public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12120-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, yesterday, I was 1 of only 15 Senators \nto vote against the omnibus spending bill.\n  Mr. President, I deplore the process by which this bill was created.\n  Mr. President, when the Republicans took over the Congress--the \nDemocrats were spending about $503 billion on domestic programs. Last \nyear, after holding firm on principle we cut that to $488 billion. Now \nthat number is back up to $503 billion.\n  Because we already have a $5 trillion debt, the billions in new \nspending represent a new 30-year obligation for our citizens. This is \nan obligation that we cannot afford.\n  Next year, we will have to cut $10 billion to get back on track and \nkeep our commitments under the 1997 budget resolution. The budget \nresolution was the blueprint by which we would achieve a balanced \nbudget in 7 years by the year 2002. We have already changed the plan \nand this is just year one.\n  There were supposed to be offsets to this new spending. But they were \nphony offsets.\n  The so-called refinancing of the savings insurance fund for the S \nproblems is really coming from the banking industry. That money is to \nbe used in a separate fund in case of future S failures. But the \nCongress has decided that we should use it to offset more spending.\n  We cut the defense budget further. Yet, the defense budget, in real \ndollars, has been cut in half since 1984.\n  While the President says on the campaign trail that he is not a \nliberal his aides were back here in Washington forcing us to spend more \nmoney on more liberal programs, cutting defense, and using accounting \ngimmicks to justify all of this.\n  This kind of game has gone on for too long, and it has to stop.\n  If we care so much for the children, why don't we leave them a \ncountry that is less in debt, not more in debt.\n  The wasteful spending that is littered throughout this bill is truly \nastounding. More foreign aid spending. Over $200 million for the United \nNations, a bloated, wasteful bureaucracy. Over $200 million for the \nAdvance Technology Program in the Commerce Department--this program has \nprincipally been known as the prince of corporate pork--serving Fortune \n500 companies.\n  This is $40 million more for D.C. schools, even though they spend \n$9,000 per student, more than any other city in the United States.\n  And, $196 million for Howard University in the District of Columbia, \n$4 billion more for the Department of Education, $82 million for the \nNational Endowment of the Arts, $1.6 million for the Kennedy Center, \nmoney for a new defense program called Security at International \nSporting Events, $9 million for 100 percent guaranteed international \nhousing loans, $1.9 million for supervision of the Teamsters election, \n$27 million for debt restructuring with Latin America countries, $19 \nmillion for the International Fund for Ireland, $5 million for the \nvictims of Chernobyl, and the creation of a new Middle East Development \nBank in which we authorize over $1 billion to be spent.\n  Mr. President, can we really afford this kind of spending. If we \ncan't stop it where is it going to stop. This is the reason why I voted \nagainst this bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am grateful for the funding for Hurricane Fran \nin my State. This money will be helpful to that State, but my concern \nwas that in order to vote for that funding--so much waste was attached \nto the bill--that on balance North Carolinians would be worse off for \nit.\n  Mr. President, finally, I am disappointed with the results of the \nillegal immigration bill.\n  Once again, the President campaigns like a moderate, but those are \nnot the policies he advocates in Washington.\n  How can we stop illegal immigration if we continue to provide \nbenefits to those that come here illegally.\n  The President has essentially forced ever school district in this \ncountry to educate, at taxpayers expense, children of parents who are \nin this country illegally. What kind of respect for the law does this \ndemonstrate.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has made great progress on many issues. \nWe fell just one vote short of getting a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. We made great strides in cutting spending. But in \nthe wee hours of the morning this weekend, we had to give the President \nwhat he wanted or else he, not us, would have shut the Government down.\n  This is a shame, but next year the process will start again, and we \nhave to be dedicated to reducing this debt on the American people by \nreducing the kinds of waste that we approved yesterday.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12121-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12121-S12123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAREWELL TO RETIRING COLLEAGUES\n\n\n                                JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it has been a real pleasure serving with \nJim Exon in the Senate. I have always admired his independence, \ndedication to his fellow Nebraskans, and his sense of humor.\n  As a small businessman, he brought an important perspective to our \nconsideration of legislation; and as a former Governor, he never forgot \nabout the important role of State governments.\n  On matters ranging from the budget to agriculture, in the minority or \nin the majority, he demonstrated amazing technical expertise as well as \nskillful and fair handling of debate.\n  I will miss Senator Exon and wish him the best in all his future \nplans.\n\n\n                            NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  I want to congratulate our colleague from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, \nfor her adroit and amicable leadership of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee.\n  As one who has ``been there, done that,'' I can say with authority \nthat she has led the committee expertly and fairly; and she surely \ndeserves our commendation for delivering landmark health insurance \nreform legislation as well as so many other important measures in \npublic health and education. And, no matter what side of a contentious \nlabor issue one happens to be on, every Senator should admire the \ncourage with which Senator Kassebaum tackled issues in labor and \nemployment policy.\n  I know that Nancy is devoted to her family, and I can well appreciate \nthat her future occupation is reported to be that of grandmother. It \nmay be the only calling higher than leading public policy in some of \nthe key and most pressing domestic and foreign policy issues. But, \nperhaps she will be training the next generation of Landons to follow \nher example of distinguished public service.\n\n\n                             CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  The Senate will indeed be a very different place as we say goodbye to \nour third most senior Member, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, \nClaiborne Pell. Senator Pell has served the State of Rhode Island and \nour country extraordinarily well for over 35 years.\n  While Senator Pell has put his indelible mark on foreign policy as a \nlong-time chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, it was through our common membership on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee that I know him best.\n  Senator Pell will long be remembered for helping millions of young \npeople achieve success by making a college education more accessible \nthrough the grant program which bears his name. He has helped more \npeople gain access to the arts and cultural enrichment programs by \nsponsoring the law establishing the National Endowments for the Arts \nand Humanities.\n  It is hard to name a single education initiative that he has not been \ninstrumental in enacting.\n  And, I might add, Mr. President, that Senator Pell's unfailing sense \nof civility and decorum, his insistence on fair\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\ndebate, and his staunch adherence to agreements honorably entered into \nwere without a doubt a major reason that so many education initiatives \nwere not only enacted into law, but were enacted with strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing all best wishes to Senator Pell \nand his family.\n\n\n                             MARK HATFIELD\n\n  The Senator from Oregon has brought a level of service and integrity \nto the Senate, this country, and his State that can be compared to few.\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, he \nhas at once one of the most powerful positions in Congress and one of \nthe most thankless. On the one hand, he has used his prerogatives to \nadvance public policy, not personal gain; on the other hand, he has \ntirelessly struggled to fairly and effectively reduce Federal spending. \nSenator Hatfield has always been able to rise above the pull and tug of \ncompeting interests to craft bipartisan and fair appropriations bills.\n  I will remember Senator Hatfield for many things--his intelligence, \nhis spirit, his character, his willingness to put aside partisan \npolitics to achieve essential goals, and, of course, his friendship.\n  Despite our common objectives on a number of important issues, such \nas balancing the budget, abortion, and balanced land use policy, we \nhave not agreed on every matter. But, what I will remember is the deep \npersonal conviction that Senator Hatfield brought to all that he did.\n  It is a sad day for us to lose his experience, knowledge, and \ncharacter in this body. He will be sorely missed by me, the Senate, the \nState of Oregon, and, I believe, the country as a whole.\n\n\n                               PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. President, it was my pleasure to participate in the ``bow tie'' \ntribute to the retiring senior senator from Illinois, Paul Simon. I \nwant to thank him for his 12 years of contributions to the Labor \nCommittee, which overlapped with my tenure as chairman and ranking \nmember, as well as his decade of service on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senator Simon was, among other things, a champion of literacy \nprograms to assist individuals and families achieve their full \npotential. Paul Simon knew that learning and personal fulfillment comes \nfrom walking through open doors--doors that exist in the written word. \nWithout the key to unlock the door, people can become prisoners not \njust to welfare, but also to an extremely small universe of \npossibilities. I, for one, will remember Senator Simon's tireless \nadvocacy of literacy efforts--a passion he held in common with our \nformer First Lady, Barbara Bush.\n  But, I will also remember the political courage and dedication Paul \nSimon demonstrated in our fight to pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. As a believer in a strong central government, it \nwould have been easy for Senator Simon to ignore the problem of growing \nnational debt. But he did not. I have rarely seen a Senator work harder \non a piece of legislation.\n  Senator Simon is going to pursue one of his first loves--teaching--at \nSouthern Illinois University. His students' gain is the Senate's loss.\n\n\n                               HANK BROWN\n\n  The election of Hank Brown in 1990 was a great day for Colorado and \nfor the Senate. The West had in Hank Brown an energetic and diligent \nvoice for balance and common sense.\n  No Senator was ever able to put anything past him--he was always \nprepared. He was always an articulate and forceful advocate for his \nposition and always amicable in his approach.\n\n\n                             HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. President, it is hard to imagine the Judiciary Committee \nconvening in the 105th Congress without the Judge. The discerning \nchairman and ranking member of the Courts Subcommittee, Senator Heflin \nhas been a vigilant defender of the third branch of our Government.\n  As a former jurist, he has approached the committee's work with \ntemperance and a strong respect for the Constitution. His deliberative \nnature is demonstrated by the fact that often no one on either side of \nan issue knew how Senator Heflin would vote.\n  Once again, I want to extend my appreciation to him for his hard work \ntoward passage of the flag protection amendment. We could not have come \nas close as we did without his enthusiastic support.\n\n\n                               BILL COHEN\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor the service of one of this body's most \nrespected members, the senior Senator from Maine, Senator William \nCohen. I regret that our youthful colleague has decided not to run \nagain. He has served the people of Maine well, and I believe they were \nprepared to reelect him for his fourth term in November. Our colleague \nhas chosen, instead, to engage his substantial talents in other \npursuits, pursuits I am sure will serve his home State and this \ncountry.\n  Those who study the careers of the Members of the Senate will know \nthat Senator Cohen has demonstrated an analytical mind, a determination \nto the search for solutions, an intolerance for negativity, a \ncommitment to civility in government, and an appreciation for public \nservice in its best sense.\n  I had the pleasure of working with the senior Senator from Maine on a \nnumber of committees, including the Judiciary Committee. As chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, it was always very clear that he took his \nresponsibilities extremely seriously. He was a master of detail; and, \nfor his work, the intelligence community owes him a great debt.\n  We know the Senator has spoken in the past several months about the \ndifficulties of the current political climate, and the challenges of \nseemingly intractable budget issues. What is admirable about Senator \nCohen is that he never became a naysayer of government: Senator Cohen \nbelieves that members are elected to government to find solutions, not \nto denounce the institutions they serve. Senator Cohen believes in good \ngovernment, because Senator Cohen practiced good government.\n  This is the type of attitude that serves not only the best interests \nof government, but presents the most positive aspect of government to \nan increasingly disillusioned public. Senator Cohen embodies this \ncharacter, and by doing so upheld the dignity of the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Cohen has a long professional life before him. I know he will \ncontinue to serve the people of Maine while promoting free trade with \nthat great State and the nations of Asia. By doing so, he will continue \nto promote the positive-sum solutions that he will be known for finding \nwhile serving this body. And, perhaps if we are lucky, there will also \nbe another book or two from the Senate's most celebrated author.\n\n\n                            BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend from \nLouisiana, J. Bennett Johnston, who will retire once the curtain is \ndrawn on the 104th Congress.\n  Senator Johnston has proven to be a stabilizing and reasonable voice \non the many critical issues that have come before the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, where he has served for 24 years, 16 of \nthem in a leadership capacity as either chairman or ranking member. \nEvery piece of legislation or proposal that has been considered by that \ncommittee during this time has reflected his knowledge on energy \nmatters and represented his fine and exemplary legislative skills.\n  For example, he was a primary factor in the dismantling of the price \ncontrol structure of petroleum during the 1980's. This case alone shows \nthe commonsense approach he has undertaken over the years to address \nour Nation's energy policies. In addition, he has shown very \nprogressive leadership and insight on regulatory matters involving the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  We Utahns owe Senator Johnston a debt of gratitude for his \nunderstanding and attention to energy and natural resource issues \ncritical to our State, including the Central Utah Project, grazing and \nmining reforms, Payments-In-Lieu-of-Taxes, and our school trust lands. \nWhile Bennett may not have hailed from the West, we have appreciated \nhis sensitivity to Federal initiatives that particularly affect the \nWest.\n  Throughout his tenure on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nhe has always said that if a State's two Senators supported a specific \nproposal that affected their State, he would not stand in the way to \nits becoming law.\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\nDespite his possible differences with these proposals, he has remained \ntrue to this principle. This was most apparent during our recent debate \non a Utah BLM wilderness proposal, during which he helped craft release \nlanguage that was more acceptable to many of our colleagues. In the \nend, he supported our bill when it came to the Senate floor. One of the \nbest things that can be said about a departing Senator is that he was \ntrue to his word, and Bennett Johnston always was.\n  Mr. President, Bennett Johnston has been reasonable and diligent; he \nhas been a servant of the environment and a protector of our natural \nresources. There is no doubt that he will be missed.\n\n\n                              ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. President, what can I say about Al Simpson, my good friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming? He is a genuine original.\n  Not only have we worked together over the years on issues pertaining \nto the West, but we have served together on the Judiciary and Finance \nCommittees. I am pleased that, literally in Al's final hours as a \nMember of the Senate, the illegal immigration bill was finally passed. \nAl Simpson has many achievements to his credit, but I believe he will \nbe most remembered for his strong commitment to preserving the \nintegrity of America's borders. He worked tirelessly on this \nlegislation, and we are going to miss his expertise on these issues.\n  On a personal level, we are all going to miss Al's sense of humor. I \nhave often wished I could be as fast with a quip as Al Simpson. Since \nAl is also headed off to academia, I can only imagine the waiting list \nto get into his classes.\n\n\n                              DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not stand before the Senate \nto say a few words of tribute to my good friend and colleague from \nArkansas, David Pryor.\n  This body has been fortunate to have had the capable wisdom of David \nPryor, and I have had the pleasant experience of working closely with \nhim, particularly since my joining the Finance Committee during the \n102d Congress.\n  As is the usual order of business around here, Senator Pryor and I \nsat on different sides of many difficult issues. But, on many other \noccasions we saw eye to eye and worked together to find the right \nsolutions.\n  Just this year, it was my privilege to join David in sponsoring three \nimportant pieces of tax legislation that I know he is proud of--the \nPension Simplification Act of 1995, the S Corporation Act of 1995, and \nthe Taxpayer Bill of Rights II. Through the tireless efforts of David \nPryor, these important measures were finally enacted into law.\n  In every instance he was a gentleman. In the majority or in the \nminority, David Pryor has earned the admiration of every Senator in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, David Pryor will be missed. His gentle southern \nkindness and his honesty have earned him the respect of every member of \nthis body. As he moves on to other pursuits, I wish him and his wife \nBarbara the very best.\n\n\n                              BILL BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. President, as the 104th Congress draws to a close, I would like \nto express my best wishes to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.\n  There are few people who can be all-stars in two professions. Bill \nBradley is one of them. After an illustrious career in the National \nBasketball Association, he has spent three terms in the Senate. In both \noccupations, Bill Bradley has touched millions of lives through his \ngreat example of leadership, hard work, intelligence, team work, and \nintegrity.\n  Senator Bradley has made an impact on each of the committees on which \nhe served over the past 18 years--but none more so than on the Finance \nCommittee, where we have served together for the past 5 years. Although \nwe have not always agreed on issues of national tax, trade, and health \ncare policy, Bill Bradley has earned my respect for his dedication to \ntaxpayer fairness, a better and simpler tax code, and his tireless \nefforts to reduce the budget deficit.\n  As Bill Bradley moves on to the next phase of his already diversified \npublic life, I wish him all the best.\n\n\n                                SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. President, all Americans who value a strong national defense will \nsorely miss the Senator from Georgia. His encyclopedic knowledge of \ndefense issues has contributed not only to a much more efficient use of \ndefense resources, but also greater accountability among defense \ncontractors.\n  I also believe that Senator Nunn has the distinction, along with \nSenator Thurmond, of being the best friend our uniformed men and women \never had. Sam Nunn knows that our Armed Forces are the backbone of our \ndefense. Without them, our technology and armaments are useless.\n  Sam Nunn has been instrumental in defining U.S. defense policy for \nthe post-cold-war era. He leaves us with a blueprint on which we can \nbuild our national security strategy for the next decade and beyond. It \nis a well-conceived theory with a strong practical dimension. His \nthinking has the power of reasonable prediction of what lies ahead as \nwell as of a clear grasp of the lessons of history.\n  Senator Nunn has been a thoughtful, hard-working legislator--a great \nexample of what a Senator should be.\n  I wish him well in whatever his future plans may include.\n\n\n                              SHEILA FRAHM\n\n  Mr. President, we have not had a chance to know well the new junior \nSenator from Kansas, but I would be remiss if I did not say to my \ncolleagues how much I admire the way in which Senator Frahm has jumped \ninto the whirl of the Senate. She took over the seat of one of the \ngiants of the Senate. She has had to become conversant on myriad topics \nthat were already well in play before she got here. She has had to make \nsome tough voting choices. Yet, she did not shrink from any of this.\n  I want to wish her well and hope she will continue serving her fellow \nKansans in other ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12121-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12123-S12124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, for the past 2 years, our critics have \naccused Republicans of rolling back environmental standards. Just \nsuggest that an environmental law can be improved, and the critics \nquickly label you as ``anti-environment.'' When we look back on this \nCongress, though, I believe that the newly enacted safe drinking water \nlaw stands as the true testament to what we're all about. It's not just \nempty rhetoric; it's real reform that improves the environment, \nprotects public health and reduces unnecessary costs so that all \nAmericans can enjoy clean, safe, and affordable drinking water.\n  To our critics, I would like to offer three comments.\n  First, Republicans are committed to protecting and improving our \nenvironment. We demonstrated this commitment throughout the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. We directed the Environmental Protection Agency to \ntarget those contaminants that are actually present in drinking water \nand are found to present a real health risk to humans. We authorized, \nfor the first time, $1 billion annually for a State revolving loan fund \nso that local communities can construct and upgrade their treatment \nsystems. We provided, also for the first time, tens of millions of \ndollars for important research on the health effects of contaminants, \nlike cryptosporidium; and we created a new voluntary source water \npartnership program to encourage communities and landowners to work \ntogether to prevent contamination of drinking water before it occurs.\n\n  Second, Republicans are committed to making our environmental laws \nwork better. Certainly, our current framework of environmental laws has \ngone a long way toward addressing the major environmental problems of \nthe 1970's and 1980's, but the problems have evolved and our laws need \nto evolve with them. Our laws must be more flexible to address the \nmultitude of situations that States and communities face every day. We \nmust work with our partners in State and local governments, not against \nthem. And we must provide more incentives to achieve environmental \nexcellence--more carrots and fewer sticks.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act proves that these principles can indeed \nmake our laws better for the environment\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\nand reduce unnecessary costs. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed \nour legislation and confirmed that it ``would change the Federal \ndrinking water program in ways that would lower the costs to public \nwater systems of complying with existing and future requirements. On \nbalance, CBO estimates that the bill would likely result in significant \nnet savings to State and local governments.''\n\n  In signing the Safe Drinking Water Act, President Clinton called the \nnew law, ``a model for responsible reinvention of regulations,'' that \n``will provide the American people with much greater protection for the \ndrinking water on which we all rely every day of our lives.'' He's \nright; and it was a Republican initiative.\n  And, finally, I would like to emphasize that Republicans are \ncommitted to working with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \non the responsible reform of our environmental laws. The environment is \nnot a partisan issue. Our environment is our lifeline and, if we are to \npreserve it for our children and their children, we must work together. \nThe Safe Drinking Water Act was written with the advice of many public \nhealth experts, State and local government officials, and water \nproviders. Republicans and Democrats alike were instrumental in the \ncrafting of all of its provisions. And ultimately, it had the support \nof every Member of the Senate, virtually every Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, the administration, the regulated community and the \npublic. To my mind, that's the model for future environmental \nlegislation.\n  As this Session and this Congress winds to a close over the next few \ndays, we should pause to look back. We have much to be proud of. Among \nother things, we reauthorized and significantly improved a major \nenvironmental law, the Safe Drinking Water Act. But, looking forward, \nwe have much work yet to do.\n\n  Many of you know that I have been working hard this past year on \nlegislation to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act. I had hoped to \ncomplete our work on that legislation this year as well, but political \nand practical obstacles got in the way. So, while we were able to make \nsignificant progress this year in resolving many of the problems \nunderlying the Endangered Species Act, final resolution will have to \nwait until next year and the new Congress. I believe, though, that our \nefforts this year will pave the way for a bill next year.\n  There is no single environmental law that is in greater need of \nfundamental reform now than the Endangered Species Act. More than any \nother law, the Endangered Species Act truly pits humans against their \nenvironment. Loggers in the Pacific Northwest fear that they will lose \ntheir jobs--and many have--because of the spotted owl; farmers in Idaho \nfear that they won't be able to water their crops because of the \nsalmon; and communities in Texas fear that they will lose their sole \ndrinking water supply because of a salamander.\n  And all to no end. Since it was first passed, the Endangered Species \nAct has failed to recover a single species to the point that it could \nbe removed from the list of threatened or endangered species. The fact \nis, we're spending millions of dollars now, putting communities at risk \nall in the name of protecting endangered species, but we have no clear \npolicy, priorities, game plan, or even ability to measure results. We \nneed to do better--both for the species and for our fellow Americans.\n  So, when we come back next January, I will pick up where we left off \nand introduce comprehensive legislation to significantly improve the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  It's time that the Endangered Species Act actually saved species from \nextinction. It's time that the Endangered Species Act treated property \nowners fairly and with consideration. It's time that the Endangered \nSpecies Act minimized the social and economic impacts on the lives of \ncitizens. And it's time that the Endangered Species Act provided \nincentives to conserve rare and unique species. I believe that we can \ndraft legislation that accomplishes those goals.\n  Over the next few months, I plan to continue negotiations with my \ncolleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators \nChafee, Baucus, and Reid, other Senators, and the administration. I \nwill work with them, officials of State and local governments, the \nregulated community, and others to achieve meaningful Endangered \nSpecies Act reform. But, let me emphasize that it must be real reform.\n\n  We must ensure that decisions made under the Endangered Species Act \nare based on good science. All too frequently, species are listed and \nrestrictions imposed on landowners as a result of junk science or no \nscience. That must change.\n  We must streamline the consultation process under section 7. In just \none case in Idaho, for example, a simple bridge was held up for over a \nyear while the National Marine Fisheries Service reviewed a proposed \nconstruction plan that had already been approved by four State and \nFederal agencies. The bridge ended up costing over four times as much \nas the original approved design because of the National Marine and \nFisheries Service. That must change.\n  We must strengthen the recovery planning process so that the emphasis \nis not just on listing a species, but also on bringing it back from the \nbrink of extinction. We all agree that recovering species is the \nprimary purpose of the Endangered Species Act, but the Fish and \nWildlife Service has only developed recovery plans for about half of \nthe species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and many of those \nplans are inadequate or have never been implemented. We must establish \nrigorous standards for recovery plans and require that they be \nimplemented.\n\n  We must provide incentives for private landowners to help conserve \nendangered and rare species. Authorizing low effect conservation plans \nand multiple species conservation plans is just one way that we can \nencourage small and large landowners to voluntarily preserve habitat \nand take other measures to protect species.\n  And finally, we must be willing to commit more public resources to \nthe cause of protecting endangered species and be creative in our \nsearch for funding sources. The Endangered Species Act benefits us all; \nits costs must not be borne only by a few.\n  Our job over the next few months and next year won't be easy. These \nare difficult and emotional issues. But the stakes are too high--the \nsurvival of our native wildlife--for us not to succeed.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto making the Endangered Species Act really work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12123-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12124-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE OPERATION OF THE CARIBBEAN BASIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 175\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby submit the Second Report to the Congress on the Operation of \nthe Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.

A bill to require the Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration to issue regulations limiting the advertising of \ncigarettes and smokeless tobacco over the Internet, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            THE TOBACCO-FREE CHILDREN'S INTERNET ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Tobacco-Free \nChildren's Internet Act of 1996, a bill to protect children from the \nhealth hazards of tobacco by extending to the Internet existing \nlimitations on tobacco advertisements.\n  Mr. President, countless studies have demonstrated the persuasive \neffect that tobacco advertising has on minors. This advertising \nencourages young people to smoke, which in turn leads to more lung \ncancer, more heart disease, and more death. As a result, the Food and \nDrug Administration has now decided to limit tobacco advertising in \npublications with a significant readership under age 18 to black-and-\nwhite text only. This is a significant, positive step, and should \nsubstantially reduce the effectiveness of such advertising in appealing \nto children.\n  Mr. President, the Internet provides unprecedented access to \ninformation to persons of all ages. I believe that the widespread use \nof the Internet should be encouraged. However, certain material, such \nas tobacco advertising, is not appropriate for children. In addition to \nthe eye-catching images common in tobacco print advertisements and \nbillboards, cigarette and smokeless tobacco ads on the Internet have \none feature exclusive to this medium--they can be interactive.\n  The indiscriminate bombardment of advertisements on the Internet is \nalso troubling if tobacco ads on this medium are not subject to FDA \nregulations. To view certain ads, a child need only sign onto an \nInternet provider. If an online provider decides to use a tobacco \nadvertisement for one of its so-called banner ads, there is no doubt \nthat children will see it. Similarly, a child browsing the World Wide \nWeb for a research project on camels could end up viewing over 300 web \npages about or mentioning Joe Camel merely by typing camel on an \nInternet search program.\n  I therefore believe restrictions on tobacco advertising should be \nextended to the Internet. Minors comprise a large percentage of \nInternet users in our country and this number is increasing. Although \nthis is a welcome indication that our youth has access to information \nthat may not be available at their local library or at their school, I \nam concerned that minors may be especially affected by interactive \ntobacco ads.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the FDA was reluctant to extend \ntheir advertising restrictions to the Internet in their last rulemaking \nbecause they believed tobacco companies had not yet exploited this \nmedium. It is true that the majority of tobacco ads currently on the \nInternet are posted by foreigners; however, I am confident that this \nsituation will not last. The Internet is a veritable wild West to the \ntobacco industry seeking to hook children.\n  It is my hope that, in addition to applying applicable tobacco \nregulations to the Internet, the FDA, perhaps in conjunction with the \nFederal Trade Commission, will develop an effective means of \nimplementing the Surgeon General's warning to Internet advertisements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco-Free Children's \n     Internet Act of 1966''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Child.--The term ``child'' means an individual who has \n     not attained the age of 18.\n       (2) Cigarette.--The term ``cigarette'' means any roll of \n     tobacco wrapped in--\n       (A) paper or any substance not containing tobacco; or\n       (B) tobacco if, because of its appearance, type, packaging, \n     or labeling, the roll wrapped in tobacco is likely to be \n     offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette.\n       (3) Commissioner.--The term ``Commissioner'' means the \n     Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (4) Internet; interactive computer service.--The terms \n     ``Internet'' and ``interactive computer service'' have the \n     meaning given those terms in section 230(e) of the \n     communications Act of 1934.\n       (5) Smokeless tobacco.--The term ``smokeless tobacco'' \n     means any cut, ground, powdered, or leaf tobacco that, \n     because of its appearance, type, packaging, or labeling is \n     likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a \n     tobacco product to be placed in the oral or nasal cavity.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATIONS.\n\n       As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Commissioner shall issue regulations limiting the \n     advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco over the \n     Internet or other interactive computer service within the \n     United States in a manner consistent with the regulations \n     issued by the Commissioner on August 28, 1996, at 61 Fed. \n     Reg. 44396 et seq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2185. A bill to improve Federal environmental policy by providing \nincentives for State and local growth management and land use programs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n               THE LOCAL GROWTH MANAGEMENT INCENTIVES ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there has been considerable \ndiscussion in this Congress about assaults on our environment. But up \nuntil now, a serious, stealth assault that threatens our environment, \nour citizens' health, and quality of life has been essentially ignored.\n  The threat I am referring to arises not from action that this \nCongress has taken. Rather, it comes from decades of Federal inaction \nin the face of haphazard development activities that are slowly \ndegrading the landscape of our states and our communities.\n  Mr. President, what I am referring to is the wholesale strip malling \nof America.\n  If this trend continues unchecked, it will imperil our Nation's \nproductive lands and natural resources, while turning the landscape \ninto an unbroken expanse of suburban sprawl.\n  This pattern of sprawling, uncontrolled development is in many \ninstances promoted by the Federal Government. Despite the major impacts \nmany Federal programs have on growth and land use, the Federal \nGovernment has largely turned a blind eye to the visual blight these \nprograms spawn, let alone the environmental, health and economic \nimpacts of unmanaged growth and development.\n  Besides turning our landscapes into eyesores, unmanaged growth \ncontributes to traffic congestion that snarls our highways, creating \nboth additional stresses for commuters and additional exhaust emissions \nthat degrade the quality of our air.\n  Uncontrolled development not only hurts our citizens where they live \nand breathe, it also hits them in their wallets. Several studies have \ncome out that show the costs of sprawling growth are significantly \nhigher than\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\nmore compact, managed growth patterns. These studies show that \ntaxpayers can save billions of dollars in public facility capital \nconstruction and operation and maintenance costs by opting for growth \nmanagement.\n  Time and time again, I'm asked at town meetings what I can do at the \nFederal level to help manage growth in my home State of Oregon, so our \nState doesn't get overrun by suburban sprawl.\n  The answer, Mr. President, is not to create a new Federal program \nthat will embroil the Federal Government in land use decisions that \nhave historically been State and local issues. Rather, what we should \ndo is create incentives to encourage and build on the State and local \ngrowth management efforts already underway.\n  For example, Oregon's pioneering Land Use Act builds environmental \nand resource protections into the State's growth management and \ndevelopment strategies. But our State gets no credit for this \ninnovative program from the Federal Government.\n  As a result, Federal development projects in Oregon have to undergo \nFederal reviews that in many cases duplicate the process under State \nlaw. That's bureaucratic overkill.\n  Oregon and other States that have similar programs should be \nrecognized by the Federal Government both when new Federal development \nprojects are undertaken in these States and when new Federal \nrequirements are imposed.\n  Today, I am introducing the Local Growth Management Incentives Act. \nThis legislation will give Oregon and other States and localities with \ngood growth management programs the credit they deserve.\n  Under this legislation, States that have good growth management \nprograms will get several incentives.\n  First, the legislation directs Federal agencies to take steps to \neliminate duplication of studies, environmental assessments, planning \nand other activities to the extent these actions have already been \nundertaken under a State or local growth management plan.\n  Because the State of Oregon and many cities in our State have \nenvironmentally protective growth management programs, development \nprojects in our State frequently have to go through layers of \nduplicative environmental reviews--first at the local level, and then \nat the State level, and then again at the Federal level. In some cases, \nvirtually identical environmental analyses are required by the \ndifferent levels of government, each according to different sets of \nregulations.\n  Let me cite several examples affecting the Port of Portland in \nPortland, OR:\n  The Port of Portland's proposed development of additional marine \nterminals at Hayden Island in the Columbia River has already undergone \nextensive reviews and analysis by the city of Portland and by our State \nagencies. But in order for this project to proceed to the actual \ndevelopment stage, it still must undergo still another round of reviews \nby two Federal agencies--the Army Corps of Engineers and the National \nMarine Fisheries Service. The port estimates that if it could just \neliminate the duplicative requirements, two or more years of \nunnecessary delay could be avoided for this project .\n  The port's efforts to identify better ways of handling materials \ndredged from around its docks and piers and from the Willamette River \nnavigation channel is subject to two virtually identical, essentially \nindependent environmental analyses, one by the State of Oregon and \nanother by the Corps of Engineers. Avoiding duplication by allowing \nthe Corps of Engineers to rely upon the State analysis could save \nconsiderable money for both the port and the Corps and expedite this \nproject.\n\n  The port is currently planning further development and expansion at \nthe Portland International Airport, the port's marine terminals, and \nseveral port-owned general aviation airports, all of which contain \nwetland areas. These activities could be facilitated, without \ndiminishing environmental protections, if the State of Oregon's \nextensive process for addressing the environmental impacts associated \nwith wetlands could be relied upon by the appropriate Federal agencies.\n  Under my legislation, Federal agencies would have to incorporate, as \npart of the reviews they require, any relevant reviews and analyses \nalready conducted under State and local programs. This would save the \nproject sponsors considerable time and expense compared to starting the \nFederal reviews essentially from scratch.\n  The net effect of this provision is that Federal development projects \nreviewed and approved under good State and local programs can avoid \nredundant Federal reviews that increase costs and cause delays with no \nenvironmental benefits. If environmental safeguards are already in \nplace under State law, these protections should be recognized when it \ncomes time to develop federally supported projects in the State.\n  Second, States and localities with good growth management programs \nwill be eligible for extensions of up to 1 year to comply with new \nFederal requirements, when this additional time is needed to integrate \na new Federal requirement with the State or local growth management \nprogram. However, additional time would not be provided if an extension \nof time would adversely affect public health or the environment.\n  This incentive recognizes that good growth management programs offer \na more comprehensive and more long-term approach to protecting our \nenvironment than many of the specific requirements imposed by Federal \nenvironmental programs. At the same time, coordinating Federal \nrequirements with State and local programs is hard work, as two leading \ngrowth management experts point out in their recent book ``Land Use in \nAmerica.'' For this reason, we should give those States and localities \nthat are undertaking this difficult, but ultimately rewarding effort \nthe extra time they need to do it right.\n  The same amount of additional time granted to the State or locality \nwould also be provided to any private party in that jurisdiction who is \nsubject to a compliance deadline under the new Federal requirement, \nunless this would adversely affect public health or the environment. \nWhile States and localities are working to meld their programs with \nFederal requirements, private parties should not be subject to double \njeopardy by having to comply first with a Federal requirement and then \nsubsequently with a different requirement after the State or locality \nmodifies its program to meet the new Federal mandate.\n  Third, Federal agencies conducting development projects and other \nactivities affecting growth must ensure that their activities are \nconsistent with States' and localities' growth management programs. \nThis provision, which is modeled on a similar consistency requirement \nin the Coastal Zone Management Act, empowers States and localities by \ngiving them the ability to affect Federal activities that could \nundermine State and local efforts to manage growth locally.\n\n  Fourth, my legislation amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA] to give priority for discretionary spending \nunder ISTEA to any State or locality that has a growth management \nprogram that meets the eligibility criteria set out in the bill. Giving \nStates and localities with good growth management programs priority for \nISTEA funding will not only provide a financial incentive to establish \nthese programs, it will also help reduce Federal, State, and local \ntransportation costs and even help reduce air pollution from motor \nvehicles.\n  The legislation I am introducing is the beginning and not the end of \na process. It is my hope that the Local Growth Management Incentives \nAct will begin a discussion on what the Federal Government should be \ndoing to address the impacts Federal actions have on growth and land \nuse. In the next Congress, I will be looking for additional incentives \nto offer States and localities so they will develop their own programs \nto manage growth.\n  In summary, I think there is an appropriate role for the Federal \nGovernment to help States and localities to manage growth so we have \nsmart growth, instead of either uncontrolled sprawl or NIMBY [Not In My \nBack Yard] efforts to block any kind of growth. I am introducing my \nlegislation today in an effort to jumpstart a dialog on how the Federal \nGovernment can promote well-managed, sustainable growth that will best \nserve our environment, our citizens' health and, our\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\nNation's economic well-being in the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2186. A bill to provide access to health care insurance coverage \nfor children; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n      the healthy children family assistance health insurance act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation today, \njoined by my friend, colleague, and esteemed senior Senator, Ted \nKennedy, to help ensure that the 10 million uninsured children in this \ncountry get the health care they need and their parents get the peace \nof mind they deserve.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that most of these 10 million uninsured \nchildren have parents who work--90 percent of these uninsured children \nhave parents who work, according to the General Accounting Office \n[GAO]. And three out of five of these children have parents who work \nfulltime during the entire year.\n  Unfortunately, the problem of uninsured children is getting worse, \nnot better--each year, more than 1 million additional children lose \nprivate insurance. No parent should have to choose between medicine for \na sick child and food for the family. The thought of a mother and \nfather, working hard to make ends meet, waking up in the middle of the \nnight with a child in pain, and waiting to see if the pain passes \nbecause they cannot afford to go to the hospital, is a stark image of a \nnational tragedy. Mr. President, American children without health care \nare alone in the world--we are the only Western industrialized nation \nthat does not provide health care for every child.\n  I am proposing today with Senator Kennedy a voluntary subsidy program \nto help working families to purchase private health insurance for their \nchildren. Only families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid \nwould be eligible to receive these vouchers. Participation in the \nvoucher program would be voluntary. The premium subsidy would be \nprovided on a sliding scale with families earning 185 percent or less \nof the poverty line receiving the full subsidy; the subsidy would phase \ndown so that families earning more than 300 percent of the poverty line \nwould not receive a subsidy. Cost-sharing would be limited but everyone \nwould pay something. The proposal includes a comprehensive benefits \npackage with a full range of the essential services needed by children. \nThe total cost of the plan is $24 billion over 5 years and is paid for \nby a combination of cuts in corporate welfare and a tobacco tax \nincrease. Although it is apparent there is no chance the plan will be \nenacted this year, with Congress now in its final hour before \nadjourning prior to the election, we are introducing it as a bill today \nbecause we want to place this issue prominently on the national agenda \nduring the next few months preceding convening of the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss 2 of the 10 million compelling \nreasons to provide basic health insurance to children who are not \ncovered now.\n  One of the first reasons is a 13-year-old student in Lynn, MA, named \nCosta Billias. He played football at Breed Junior High and loved the \ngame, but said, ``For the past 2 years I gave my best to football, but \nmy mom explained that we were not insured and if I got hurt we would \nlose our house and everything we own to pay the hospital.'' He quit the \nteam, but he cannot quit life. If he gets hurt doing something else, \nhis family still stands to lose everything. In addition, I think it is \nwrong that Costa Billias is being denied the opportunity to play \nfootball again.\n\n  One more of the 10 million reasons we must pass this bill is the \nPierce family. Jim and Sylvia Pierce were married in 1980 and live in \nEverett, MA. Jim was a plumber and they had three children, Leonard, \nBrianna, and Alyssa. In October 1993, Sylvia was pregnant with her \nfourth child when Jim was tragically killed on his way home from the \nstore. In that one horrible minute her life changed forever. She not \nonly lost her husband, but, pregnant and alone, she lost her health \ninsurance as well. Her survivor's benefits made her income too high to \nqualify for long-term Medicaid, and too low to pay the $400 a month it \nwould take to extend her husband's health plan. Sylvia said, ``I've \nalways taken good care of my children. I feed them well; I take them to \nthe doctors immediately when they need it. All of a sudden I couldn't \ndo that anymore.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the moral imperative, the scientific \nevidence is overwhelming that lack of health coverage is bad for \nchildren, delaying medical care or making it impossible to get. A \nrecent study in JAMA [the Journal of the American Medical Association] \nfound that children with health coverage gaps were more likely to lack \na continuing and regular source of health care--even when factors such \nas family income, chronic illness, and family mobility were factored \nout. Numerous studies by university researchers and by government \nagencies show that the uninsured are less likely to receive preventive \ncare (such as immunizations for children), more likely to go to \nemergency rooms for their care, more likely to be hospitalized for \nconditions that could have been avoided with proper preventive care, \nand more likely to have longer hospital stays than individuals with \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, every hour we wait to take this step, another 114 \nchildren lose private health insurance. Every 30 seconds we wait, \nanother child loses private health insurance. America's children cannot \nwait any longer. Families without insurance are forced to pay the full \ncost of medical services--an impossible burden for struggling families, \none that often takes a back seat to putting food on the table and a \nroof over the children's heads.\n  Mr. President, this plan is an important, incremental step toward \nguaranteeing health coverage for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join Senator John Kerry \nin introducing this visionary and practical program. Senator Kerry has \nbeen a consistent leader in the Senate in fighting for children, for \nhealth care, and for working families. This initiative sets a benchmark \nfor the next Congress and the American people. It is a proposal that is \na reflection of true family values.\n  Every American child deserves a healthy start in life, but too many \ndon't receive it. Seventeen industrialized countries do better at \npreventing infant mortality than we do. A quarter of American children \ndo not receive basic childhood vaccines. Every day, 636 babies are born \nto mothers who receive inadequate prenatal care, 56 babies die before \nthey are a month old, and 110 babies die before they are a year old.\n  Access to affordable health care is one of the greatest problems \nchildren face. Ten-and-a-half million children under the age of 19 have \nno health insurance--one in every seven American children. If it were \nnot for the expansions of Medicaid over the past 5 years, the number \nwould be seven million higher. Under Republican proposals to cut \nMedicaid, four million children would lose their coverage. Employer-\nbased insurance coverage is eroding. Too many pregnant women--more than \n400,000 a year--are uninsured, and lack access to critical prenatal \ncare.\n  Almost all uninsured children are members of working families. Their \nparents work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. But all their hard \nwork does not buy their children the protection they deserve. Every \nfamily should have the right to health security for their children. No \nparents should fear that the loss of a job or their employer's failure \nto provide coverage will put their children out of reach of the health \ncare they need.\n  Health insurance coverage for every child is a needed step in the \nfight to guarantee health care for every family. The cost is \naffordable. The benefits are great. The opportunities for \nbipartisanship are substantial.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a simple, practical \nproposal. It imposes no new government mandates on the States or the \nprivate sector. It does not substitute for family responsibility. It \nfosters it, instead, by assuring that every family has the help it \nneeds to purchase affordable health insurance for their children.\n  Our plan will establish no massive new Federal bureaucracy. Basic \nguidelines and financing would come from the Federal Government, but \nthe plan\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\nwould be implemented and administered by States.\n  The program will make a major difference in the lives of millions of \nfamilies, but its basic principles are not novel or untested. Fourteen \nStates already have similar programs in place and running. Earlier \ntheir year, for example, Massachusetts enacted a program very similar \nto our proposal.\n  Under our plan, the Federal Government will assist all families with \nincomes under 300 percent of poverty to purchase health insurance for \ntheir children, if they do not already receive coverage under an \nexisting public program. Families with incomes under 185 percent of \npoverty will receive a full subsidy. Families with incomes between 185 \npercent of and 300 percent of poverty will receive assistance on a \nsliding scale. Between 80 and 90 percent of all uninsured children live \nin families with incomes below 300 percent of poverty. Even uninsured \nfamilies with higher incomes might buy coverage for their children if \npolicies designed for children were available. Families with income \nunder 150 percent of poverty will also receive assistance with the cost \nof copayments and deductibles. Similar assistance will be provided to \nuninsured pregnant women.\n  The program will be administered by States under Federal guidelines. \nIn general, States will contract with private insurance companies to \noffer children's coverage to any family that wants it. Lower income \nfamilies will receive assistance with the cost of coverage, but \ncoverage will be available to all families at all income levels. Basic \nrules will guarantee that coverage is adequate and tailored to the \nspecial needs of children, especially the need for comprehensive \npreventive care.\n  This plan does not guarantee that every child will have insurance \ncoverage, but it gives the opportunity to every family to cover their \nchildren at a cost the family can probably afford. It will be a giant \nstep toward the day when every member of every American family has true \nhealth security.\n  The cost of a similar program has been estimated at $24 billion over \n5 years. We propose to finance our plan by a combination of tobacco tax \nincreases and closing corporate tax loopholes. The Nation currently \nspends close to $1 trillion per year on health care. The additional \ncost of this proposal is substantial, but it is a needed step toward \nhealthier lives for millions of American children and peace of mind for \ntheir parents.\n  In this Congress, we made substantial progress toward improving the \nhealth care system. We turned back extreme proposals to slash Medicare \nand Medicaid. Working together in a bipartisan way, we were able to \npass the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act, take a \nsignificant first step toward mental health parity, and protect mothers \nand infants from premature discharge from the hospital. Every \nDemocratic and Republican health plan in the previous Congress endorsed \nthe idea of subsidizing private insurance coverage for children. This \nproposal should be a bipartisan health priority for the next Congress. \nI believe it is an idea whose time has finally come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12126-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1178\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Frahm] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1178, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of colorectal \nscreening under part B of the Medicare Program.\n\n\n                                S. 1385\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Frahm] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1385, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of periodic \ncolorectal screening services under part B of the Medicare Program.\n\n\n                                S. 2030\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2030, a bill to establish \nnationally uniform requirements regarding the titling and registration \nof salvage, nonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 73\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], the Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nAbraham], the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Graham], and the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] were added \nas cosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 73, a concurrent \nresolution concerning the return of or compensation for wrongly \nconfiscated foreign properties in formerly Communist countries and by \ncertain foreign financial institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12129-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 307--ELECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I thank the leadership for \nsubmitting this statement for the Record on my behalf during my absence \nfrom the Senate due to an accident. Were I able to be on the Senate \nfloor today, I would make a few brief comments about the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Colorado, my colleague and friend, Senator Hank \nBrown. As he departs this Chamber after the adjournment of the 104th \nCongress, his service and contributions to this body, both as a person \nand a legislator, will leave an indelible impression upon us all.\n  I believe that anyone who knows Senator Hank Brown shares my belief \nthat he possesses a great passion for public service and has committed \na good part of his professional career to providing the people of \nColorado with distinguished and honorable service.\n  As we reflect on his career, it is apparent that Hank Brown's' \nleadership abilities were evident at a very early age, and he has built \non each successive milestone to achieve great acclaim for himself and \nfor the people of Colorado.\n  Hank was born in Denver, CO, on February 12, 1940. He received his \nbachelors degree and law degree from the University of Colorado in 1960 \nand 1969, respectively. His leadership skills were exemplified as he \nserved as student body president while completing his undergraduate \nstudies. Adding to his collegiate achievements was his ability to also \ncompete and earn a letter as a member of the University of Colorado \nwrestling team.\n  Hank served our country as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during the \nVietnam war. His leadership abilities earned him several decorations--\nan Air Medal with two gold stars, a Vietnam Service medal, a National \ndefense medal, and a Naval Unit Citation. He also served in the \nColorado State Senate from 1972 to 1976, where he was the assistant \nmajority leader for 2 years. In 1973, he was named ``Outstanding Young \nMan of Colorado.''\n  Hank came to Washington in 1980 where he served five terms in the \nHouse of Representatives. Following his achievements while representing \nthe people of Colorado's Fourth Congressional District, Hank Brown was \nelected to the U.S. Senate in 1990.\n\n  His service in the Congress has had many memorable highlights--from \ncreating a wild and scenic designation for the Cache LaPoudre River and \nworking to expand the Rocky Mountain National Park, to playing a \npivotal role in pushing through a monumental Colorado wilderness bill. \nIn addition, he has been a vocal advocate in the private property \nrights movement and has been instrumental in efforts to find innovative \nlegislative solutions while working to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Hank has also been an outstanding leader on military, foreign policy \nand trade issues. His efforts to resolve the dispute with Pakistan over \ncertain weapons transfers is certainly a notable highlight. His efforts \nto forge a compromise between Congress and the administration will \ngreatly serve our national interests as well as those of India and \nPakistan.\n  As the 104th Congress adjourns for the year, we will remember the \ncontribution and leadership that Hank has exhibited throughout his \ncareer. I believe each of my colleagues shares my sentiments that we \nwill miss Hank.\n  As the junior Senator from Colorado, I believe Hank has been a true \nfriend to the people of Colorado and an outstanding legislator who \nconsistently strived to do what was best for our Nation. My friendship \nwith Hank has always transcended political affiliation. He and I were \nfriends when I was a member of the Democratic Party, and that \nfriendship has grown since I've been a Republican. Such an enduring \nfriendship is a rare gift, one I value deeply. Hank and I also have \nshared many experiences. Both of our wives are teachers. We both raised \nfamilies in Colorado while serving in Congress.\n  Let me offer one example of the depth of my friendship with Hank \nBrown. He and his wife Nan, once let me keep my horse in their yard at \ntheir home in Colorado while I was attending the Greeley Independence \nStampede celebration.\n  Mr. President, I won't give you the graphic details, but suffice it \nto say, there were a few less flowers and a more fertile environment in \nthat back yard the following morning.\n  Anybody who has seen the Senators' vehicles parked outside of the \nCapitol can see that Hank has remained fiscally conservative. Hank's \nold red pickup is just as famous or should I say infamous, among the \nColorado delegation. On days that I'm forced to drive four wheels, both \nHank's and my staff debate who drives the worst vehicle between Hank \nand his old red pickup and me and my old white coupe. With all due \nrespect to my departing colleague, I think you win that contest hands \ndown Hank.\n  Mr. President, let me close on a serious note. Hank Brown's presence \nand wisdom will be sorely missed in this body when the next Congress \nconvenes early next year. I join my colleagues in congratulating and \ncommending him for his public service and wish him and his family well \nas he moves on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12130-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12130-S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUCCESS OF THE 1996 OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the success of the 1996 Centennial Olympic games and the \nParalympic games which were held this summer in Atlanta.\n  The statement made by many that the Centennial games in Atlanta were \nthe greatest ever was right on the mark. The athletes and the \nspectators who attended the events understand better than anyone the \nextraordinary success of the 1996 Olympics. In the face of pressures \nthat defy imagination, ACOG staff and volunteers staged an Olympics of \nbreathtaking grandeur and dignity. Our law enforcement and military \npersonnel put together a security force that was unprecedented in its \ncommitment, performance, and cooperation.\n  I have talked to countless people who attended both the Centennial \ngames and the Paralympic games, and I have talked to numerous \nindividual members of the International Olympic Committee. There was \nuniversal praise of the extraordinary job that was done in Atlanta and \nelsewhere in dealing with events that were unprecedented in their size \nand scope.\n  All in all, more than 10,000 athletes and 2 million spectators from \naround the world participated in the Olympics. In comparison, the \nAtlanta Olympic games were twice the size of the 1984 Los Angeles \nOlympics in terms of the number of participants and spectators, and \nlarger than the Los Angeles and Barcelona games combined. More \nspectators attended women's events at the Centennial games than \nattended all events in Los Angeles. In addition, Atlanta hosted \nathletes from 197 countries around the globe. That is an additional 57 \ncountries above the 140 who participated in the 1984 Games. To give my \ncolleagues a point of reference, particularly for the football fans \namong them, the Atlanta Olympic games were the equivalent of one city \nhosting six Super Bowl games each day for 17 days straight. So it was a \nSuper Bowl times six, each day for 17 days. That was quite an \nundertaking.\n  While much praise should be given to the many workers who contributed \nto the success of these Games, I would be remiss if I failed to mention \nsome of the athletes who gave it their all in these Games. Who can \nforget the South African marathon runner, Josiah Thugwane, the first \nblack South African to win a Gold Medal for the unified\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\nteam of South Africa? Or Naim Suleymanoglu, endeared to all as ``Pocket \nHercules,'' who stunned the world by lifting over his head nearly \ntriple his weight?\n  I will always remember watching Michael Johnson sprint across the \nfinish line. Among America's special heroes was young Kerri Strug, who \nas you may recall, injured herself on the vault but continued valiantly \nto make a second leap to help ensure a team gold medal for the U.S. \nwomen's gymnastics team. I could spend all day recounting the many \nheroic and inspirational accomplishments from the Olympic games, but \nthe story from Atlanta did not end there.\n\n  Just 12 days after the conclusion of the 1996 summer Olympics, \nanother sporting event of great magnitude occurred in Atlanta. The \nParalympic games hosted more than 3,500 athletes from 119 nations, \ncompeting in 19 different sports. While not as large as the Centennial \ngames, this was the largest gathering of people with disabilities ever \nassembled anywhere in the world. Certainly it was every bit as large as \nthe Centennial games in terms of the spirit, heart, and courage of \nthose who competed.\n  I have been honored to work for a number of years in assisting the \nAtlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee in preparation for the \nParalympics. I consider the opportunity I had to support these games to \nbe one of the highlights of my Senate career. I also had the pleasure \nof being a spectator at many of the Paralympic events, and I know that \nthe level of skill and achievement shown by these athletes was truly \noutstanding by any standard.\n  The opening ceremonies offered a glimpse of what was to come, as a \nsold-out crowd of over 64,000 spectators watched 36 year old American \nmountain-climber Mark Wellman light the Paralympic Torch by pulling \nhimself hand over hand up the 98-foot tower carrying the torch between \nhis legs. Mark was paralyzed from the waist down after a 50-foot fall \nwhile mountain climbing 14 years ago. He was soon followed by Hou Bin \nof China who set a world record in the high jump on the first day of \nthe track and field competition by clearing 1.92 meters, approximately \n6 feet, 3 inches. For those of you unfamiliar with Hou Bin, he has only \none leg, but that did not stop him from winning the hearts of \nspectators from around the world as he went on in an attempt to break \nhis own record. While he was ultimately unsuccessful, you would not \nhave known that from the roar of the crowd.\n  Yet another stunning performance was that of Troy Sachs who led the \nAustralian men's wheelchair basketball team to victory by scoring a \nParalympic record-breaking 42 points. I rank it among the finest \nbasketball performances I have ever seen. Leading the American \nParalympic team was Tony Volpentest who set a new world record in the \n100 meter dash, running a time of 11.36 seconds--that is 1.52 seconds \nshy of Donovan Bailey's record in the Olympics.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this time to recognize and honor \nall of the many people who dedicated their time and efforts. This \neffort brought together literally hundreds of Federal, State, local, \nand civic leaders, as well as thousands of volunteers. The Atlanta \nvolunteers were certainly the best in history. They were simply \namazing, and the games could not have been held without them. \nUnfortunately, time prohibits me from mentioning all of the people who \nwere truly instrumental in putting on the games, but I would like to \nrecognize a few of them.\n\n\n                Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games\n\n  When Billy Payne originally submitted his proposal to bring the \nOlympic games to Atlanta, many people did not take him seriously; but \njust ask them now. He is perhaps the best example of what Atlanta has \nto offer in terms of leadership and vision. His partner, former Atlanta \nmayor, Congressman, and Ambassador Andy Young, provided the key element \nof diplomacy needed to convince the International Olympic Committee to \nchoose Atlanta. I should also thank A.D. Frazier, who did an \noutstanding job, as well as the entire team at ACOG.\n\n\n                Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee\n\n  My special thanks go to the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee, \nled by its president, Andy Fleming. Andy had perhaps the most difficult \nchallenge of all in leading the effort to stage the Paralympic games. \nFaced with the disadvantage of lesser name recognition and financial \nresources, the Paralympic Organizing Committee put on a world class \nevent which truly met the high standards set by the Olympic games. Andy \nwas assisted by the able leadership, service, and great dedication of \nHarald Hansen, chairman of First Union National Bank of Georgia, and \nDavid Simmons, chief operating officer for the Paralympic games.\n\n\n                              DoD Support\n\n  The 1996 Centennial Olympic and the Paralympic games were successful \nin large part due to the tremendous support of the Department of \nDefense. Without the assistance of the Department of Defense, working \nin concert with State and local public safety officials, the Olympics \nand Paralympics could not have been held. Not surprisingly, these \nevents were too big for any single municipal or State government to \nensure safety and security without appropriate help from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Those who won the selection of Atlanta as the Olympic venue \nunderstood at the beginning that they would be responsible for \nproviding the cost of putting on the Games, and they raised about $1.5 \nbillion to do so. They could not, however, guarantee the security of \nall the athletes and the millions of visitors from all over the world. \nIn the era of modern terrorism, safety for an event of this type simply \ncannot be guaranteed without help from the Federal Government. I hope \nthe Congress will keep this in mind as our friends in Utah prepare for \nthe 2002 winter Olympic games.\n  Billy Payne expressed his appreciation for the Department of Defense \nsupport this way:\n\n       Thanks to the support of the Department of Defense and the \n     soldiers, sailors, and airmen who served in Atlanta during \n     the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the safety of the public and \n     the athletes was assured. DoD and its military forces \n     provided the safety net and back-up law enforcement needed \n     when confronted with securing the largest peacetime event in \n     history.\n       From the explosive ordnance teams to the military police \n     units to communications specialists, DoD personnel performed \n     critical missions. Working in conjunction with law \n     enforcement, DoD personnel helped secure the village where \n     the athletes of 197 nations were housed. On the night of the \n     tragic bombing in Centennial Olympic Park, DoD personnel in \n     the downtown area remained calm and at their posts, \n     reinforcing the public's perception that security authorities \n     were fully prepared to deal with the situation. The ability \n     of military personnel to increase their shifts and \n     immediately provide more manpower to the streets was a clear \n     signal to the Olympic family and spectators that America was \n     prepared for all contingencies.\n       All who came to the Games in Atlanta are indebted to the \n     Department of Defense for the professional and dedicated \n     effort of the troops who were part of the Summer Olympics. \n     These men and women showed the world, once again, that the \n     soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the United States military \n     are the finest in the world.\n\n  In 1992, Congress first appropriated funds to the Department of \nDefense for security and logistical support for the 1996 Olympic and \nParalympic games. Since that time, a multitude of DoD personnel have \naggressively worked to ensure the success and security of this \nsignificant public event. The impact of DOD support to the 1996 summer \nOlympics is difficult to summarize in a short time. More than 13,000 \nactive duty, Reserve, and National Guard personnel were committed in \nsupport of the Games in Atlanta and in the other competition cities. \nThese military members came from 45 states and territories and provided \nsupport to security operations at 44 Olympic sites.\n  Of the men and women who came to Atlanta, over 9,000 National Guard \npersonnel provided support in the form of roving and fixed perimeter \nsecurity, command post support, route security, and vehicular \ninspection. More than 1,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nMarines were entrusted with the important responsibility of \ntransporting athletes and law enforcement personnel to the secured \nvillages and venues. These drivers successfully negotiated the crowded \nstreets of Atlanta more than 650 times each day. DOD provided 33 \nhelicopters, and military aviators flew 300 missions in support of the \nlaw enforcement security operations. DOD provided critical equipment to \nmore than 60 Federal, State,\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\nand local law enforcement agencies and organizing committees. DOD bomb \ndisposal experts responded to 450 calls on suspect items; and DOD, the \nFBI, and our health officials prepared for any kind of chemical or \nbiological attack. A force of more than 1,300 personnel, from all \nservices, was required to provide base camp support for the DOD \npersonnel supporting the Olympic games.\n\n  When the tragic explosion in Centennial Park occurred, National Guard \nand uniformed military personnel were on the scene immediately, and \ntheir calmness and discipline were absolutely indispensable in the \nfirst few critical moments. Within 24 hours, military personnel were \nable to double their security forces at select critical locations. DOD \nalso provided critical transportation support for almost 500 additional \nState personnel who were activated in response to the bombing to \nsupplement state law enforcement resources. The Federal law enforcement \ntraining center depended on DOD for transportation, housing, meals, and \nother support for more than 900 personnel they committed to the post-\nbombing security operations when no other source was available.\n  Let me pause here for a moment to again express my sympathy for the \nfamily of Mrs. Alice Hawthorne, who died during this tragic event. Her \ndeath has sent a powerful message throughout our Nation and the world \nabout the horror of acts of senseless violence and terrorism. However, \nwe must never forget that this tragedy in the context of the Olympics \npales beside the unspeakable personal loss and grief that have befallen \nher family.\n  In addition to supporting the Olympic games, DOD extended assistance \nto the 1996 Paralympic games. Over 990 active duty and National Guard \npersonnel supplied transportation, medical, linguistic, logistical, and \ncommunications support to 17 venues in the Atlanta area. Our soldiers \ntook great pride in participating in a project that assisted athletes \nof such astounding and great courage. Members of our military sadly are \nno strangers to the impact of injury or illness that some define as \nincapacitating. But the Paralympic athletes proved by their own \nperformance and their tremendous courage that the definition of \nincapacitated needs reexamination by our society.\n  I want to thank in particular Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, \nSecretary of the Army Togo West, Assistant Secretary Mike Walker, \nGeneral John Tilleli, and his assistant General Bob Hicks for their \noutstanding leadership and support in assisting the Olympics and \nParalympics. In addition to DOD personnel, I would like to thank the \nAttorney General Janet Reno, the Deputy Attorney General Jamie \nGorelick, FBI Director Louis Freeh, Atlanta Director of the FBI Woody \nJohnson, and Gil Childers for all their hard work. Let me also \nrecognize all the administration staff from the DOD and the Federal law \nenforcement agencies whom I have not named here for all of their hard \nwork.\n\n  Finally let me thank President Clinton and Vice President Gore, \nparticularly Vice President Gore, whose direct personal involvement \nfrom the beginning was vital in keeping the Federal involvement in the \ngames focused and effective. All of us in Georgia are grateful for \ntheir support.\n\n\n                       State and Local Officials\n\n  It goes without saying that State and local support was crucial in \nputting on these games. The State of Georgia spent more than $72 \nmillion on Olympic security alone, including the salaries of law \nofficers who were assigned to full-time Olympic security duties. Not \ncounting State prison guards, some 73 percent of all State of Georgia \nemployees who have law enforcement credentials were assigned to the \nOlympics. These figures obviously do not include fire and emergency \nmedical personnel.\n  Governor Zell Miller led the effort to ensure that the State of \nGeorgia contributed the appropriate resources to help construct the \nvarious venues, roads, and buildings necessary for the games. Gary \nMcConnell, chief of staff of the State Olympic Law Enforcement Command, \nGeorgia Adjutant General William Bland, Director Buddy Nix of the GBI, \nColonel Sid Miles of the Georgia State Patrol and Department of Public \nSafety, and Atlanta chief of police Beverly Harvard led the State and \nlocal security effort. Our National Guard units from Georgia and other \nStates under the leadership of General Bland were superb. Special \nthanks should also go to Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, members of the \nAtlanta city council, and the Fulton County Commissioners whose \nleadership was instrumental in preparing Atlanta to host the games.\n  In addition, I want to thank all the Georgia health officials who \nwere involved in preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics and \ninsuring the well being of the spectators and participants. They are \noften overlooked, but their contributions are every bit as critical.\n  I would also like to thank my fellow colleagues in the Congress who \nhelped with the Olympics and Paralympics, especially my fellow \ncolleagues from the Georgia delegation. Most noteworthy, of course, \nwere Congressman Lewis, Speaker Gingrich, and Senator Coverdell. \nFinally, I would like to thank my staff on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and my personal staff for their assistance to me in working \non these games.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could personally thank everyone who was \ninvolved in preparing for these great games. This was literally a \nhistoric event. I am proud to have been a part of these games, and I am \nthankful for the opportunity. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12130-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12132-S12133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE CHORUS GETS LARGER AND LOUDER ON THE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last Wednesday, September 25, I \nintroduced S. 2131, a bill to establish a bipartisan National \nCommission on the Year 2000 Computer Problem. In a statement as ominous \nas the problem itself, I summarized the fears of the computer and \ninformation technology experts on this problem. Their voices, as yet \nlargely unheard by Congress and the administration, are multiplying. On \nMonday, September 16, 1996, in the publication New Technology Week, \nMark Crawford wrote about the lack of preventive action with regard to \nthe Year 2000 Computer Problem and about new factors concerning the \ntimeliness and costliness of this critical issue.\n  Previously, I informed my Senate colleagues that the cost of this \nproblem had been estimated in the tens of billions. This article cites \na recent industry report that tabulated the cost in the hundreds of \nbillions. Crawford writes: ``The magnitude of the problem is reflected \nin estimates of the repair bill: $300 billion for the United States and \n$300 billion for the rest of the world.''\n  Until now, I had informed my fellow Senators that we had until \nDecember 1999 to address this problem. Mr. Crawford writes that we have \neven less time. He quotes Mr. Larry Olson, deputy secretary for \ninformation technology for the State of Pennsylvania, who argues that \nbusinesses and governments will have to fix their computer codes by the \nend of 1998--not 1999: ``Pennsylvania's Olson figures that States, \nFederal agencies, and companies must fix their problems by the end of \n1998 in order to have adequate time to run systems and identify any \ncatastrophic glitches.'' So, not only are the cost estimates rising, \nbut the date by which we must address this problem has moved up as \nwell.\n  We must act expeditiously.\n  I ask that the article which appeared in New Technology Week on \nSeptember 16, 1996, entitled ``The Year 2000 Software Fix Unlikely To \nBeat Clock'' by Mark Crawford, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the New Technology Week, Sept. 16, 1996]\n\n             Year 2000 Software Fix Unlikely To Beat Clock\n\n                           (By Mark Crawford)\n\n       The challenge that business, state and local government, \n     and federal agencies face in changing millions of lines of \n     code by the year 2000--so that computer record systems \n     continue to function accurately in the new millennium--is \n     getting bigger by the day.\n       According to experts testifying September 10 before a joint \n     hearing held by subcommittees of the House's Science \n     Committee and Government Reform & Oversight Committee, \n     neither industry nor government agencies will be able to make \n     all the required fixes before the clock strikes midnight on \n     December 31, 1999. The magnitude of the problem is reflected \n     in estimates of the repair bill: $300\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\n     billion for the United States and $300 billion for rest of \n     the world (NTW, Dec. 12, 1995, p. 1).\n       At risk is the integrity of many services and functions \n     that are taken for granted--the management of payroll \n     services, retirement programs, medical and health insurance, \n     traffic systems, information databases. The fix: Expand from \n     two digits to four digits the date fields used in computer \n     programs to designate the year. Without this modification, \n     many computer programs, especially older software, will \n     register ``00'' when 2000 arrives.\n       Left unchecked, the consequences will range from minor \n     inconvenience to devastation for some record systems and \n     management programs, according to industry and government \n     analysts. The problem is equally daunting for companies, many \n     of which are only now beginning to understand it, according \n     to Larry Olson, deputy secretary for Information Technology \n     for the state of Pennsylvania.\n       Olson's state has started an aggressive outreach program \n     aimed at prodding companies located there to attack the \n     problem. And large national companies also are moving \n     expeditiously on the matter, particularly in the securities \n     industry, where it's essential to maintain date-critical \n     information on stock trades, retirement accounts, and other \n     financial transactions.\n       Despite the potential for havoc, industry and government \n     agencies have been moving slowly to address the problem. And \n     now both legislators and computer industry officials fear \n     there could be serious--not to mention costly--problems \n     created.\n       Why? Daniel Houlihan, first vice president of the National \n     Association of State Information Resource Executives \n     (NASIRE), noted that there has been little direction from \n     Washington on the matter. ``There is no leadership on a \n     uniform solution across the states,'' said Houlihan.\n       That criticism is not hard for Rep. Stephen Horn (R-\n     Calif.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Government \n     Management, Information, and Technology, to accept. In July \n     he disclosed results of a survey conducted by his panel that \n     showed few federal agencies to be moving aggressively on the \n     issue (see chart, bottom).\n       Most of the government's large agencies were graded D or F \n     on their level of preparation to address the Year 2000 \n     problem. The Department of Defense got a C and the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Agency a B, while the Social Security \n     Administration was one of four agencies out of a total of 24 \n     surveyed to get an A. Said Horn of the state of readiness in \n     the federal government: ``There were very few As, Bs, and Cs. \n     There were a lot of Ds and Fs.''\n       It's not likely that federal agencies, state governments, \n     or businesses will be able to make all the computer program \n     changes needed by 2000, said Houlihan. Government agencies \n     and companies alike, he stressed, should focus on \n     ``identifying critical programs that will be affected and get \n     those changes done first.''\n       Indeed, Pennsylvania's Olson figures that states, federal \n     agencies, and companies must fix their problems by the end of \n     1998 in order to have adequate time to run systems and \n     identify any catastrophic glitches.\n       Only in the last year or so have industry and government \n     begun to attack the problem with any intensity to understand \n     the full scope of the records that must be modified. ``I am \n     afraid that some of the folks don't recognize that they have \n     a problem,'' said Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.).\n       Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology \n     Association of America (ITAA), said his organization is doing \n     all it can to make industry aware of the Year 2000 problem \n     and to get top management moving on it. But, Miller noted, \n     some executives have been slow to recognize the scope of the \n     problem and make it a top priority in their organization. \n     Said Miller: ``They need to wake up, look in the mirror, go \n     to the office, and start asking some questions.''\n       At the state government level, said NASIRE's Houlihan, who \n     also is director of the data processing oversight commission \n     for Indiana, there is now a high level of recognition of the \n     problem. But states are moving at different speeds to address \n     it, he said.\n       Survey data, he said, show that 75 percent of the states \n     are still in the planning stage, with just 25 percent \n     actually moving to implement system changes. At this point, \n     Houlihan said, state projections for finishing software \n     program modifications range from 1997 to December 1999. The \n     size of the problem varies from state to state--ranging from \n     300,000 lines of code to 97 million lines.\n       What states that are moving aggressively to tackle the Year \n     2000 program, such as Pennsylvania, fear is that the federal \n     government at this late juncture may step in with rules and \n     standards that could slow their efforts--or, worse yet, cause \n     them to modify program changes that have already been made.\n       NASIRE's Houlihan said that what states do want is a quick \n     determination by federal agencies on the level of funding \n     that might be provided to assist state governments and \n     localities in fixing information systems that support or \n     interact with federal programs.\n       The costs of modifying date fields in computer programs is \n     daunting at a macro level. The estimate of $600 billion \n     worldwide is based on an estimate of $1 for each line of code \n     that must be changed. Most of that dollar is used not in \n     making the change, but in conducting subsequent tests to make \n     sure that affected programs continue to function properly.\n       Just what it will cost companies and governments to bring \n     their software programs into compliance is expected to vary \n     widely, depending on how old the programs are and whether all \n     the underlying source code is available. Pennsylvania \n     estimates that repairing the date fields in its payroll \n     system will involve changing 10,000 lines of code at a cost \n     of $7,500.\n       While getting a fix on the accuracy of cost estimates is \n     hard at this time, ITAA's Miller warned that there is certain \n     to be upward pressure on costs--because of a shortage of \n     qualified programmers. Miller said that ITAA, in fact, is \n     concerned that industry and government demand will be so \n     great that fly-by-night companies could spring up and create \n     nightmares for unsuspecting firms.\n       To ward off this problem, ITAA is launching a certification \n     program that will help companies and government agencies \n     select firms that have the required capabilities to make \n     software modifications.\n\n                      YEAR 2000 AGENCY PREPAREDNESS                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Grades \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInternational Aid.............................................

Mr. President, I rise to announce my intention \nto introduce in the 105th Congress a companion bill to the provisions \nof H.R. 4173 which was introduced last week by Congressman Lane Evans, \nwho is an exceptionally dedicated and effective advocate for all \nveterans, including atomic veterans. This important legislation would \ngrant atomic veterans the presumption of service-connection for eight \nadditional illnesses: Bone cancer; colon cancer; nonmalignant thyroid \nnodular disease; parathyroid cancer; ovarian cancer; brain and central \nnervous system tumors; unexplained bone marrow failure; and meningioma. \nWere this bill to be enacted, it would ensure that atomic veterans \nreceive compensation for six diseases for which Marshall Islanders now \nautomatically receive compensation under the Marshall Islands Nuclear \nClaims Tribunal Act and two diseases the VA accepts as radiogenic but \ndoes deem to be presumptively service-connected.\n  I am convinced that enactment of the provisions of H.R. 4173 would \nhelp to rectify an injustice or, to put it more accurately, a series of \ninjustices inflicted by our Government over the past 50 years on atomic \nveterans who served our country bravely, unquestioningly, and with \ngreat dedication.\n  If there's any doubt about the need to expand the list of presumptive \ndiseases, it should have been dispelled by the final report of the \nPresident's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments which was \nissued almost a year ago. The report's recommendations echoed many of \nthe complaints that atomic veterans have had for years about the almost \ninsuperable obstacles they face when seeking approval of their claims \nfor VA compensation. The report urged an interagency working group to \nwork ``in conjunction with Congress''--I repeat in conjunction with \nCongress--to promptly address the concerns expressed by atomic \nveterans. Among these concerns cited by the committee are several that \nI've long believed need to be urgently addressed, including:\n  The list of presumptive diseases for which atomic veterans \nautomatically receive VA compensation is incomplete and inadequate.\n  The standard of proof for atomic veterans without a presumptive \ndisease can't be met and are inappropriate given the incompleteness of \nexposure records retained by the Government.\n  Time and money spent on contractors and consultants in administering \nthe claims program, particularly the\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\ndose reconstructions required for most atomic vets filing claims with \nthe VA, would be better spent on directly aiding veterans.\n  With regard to the last two concerns, it is important to note that \nthe Advisory Committee found that the Government didn't create or \nmaintain adequate records regarding the exposure, identity, and test \nlocale of all participants. This finding casts serious doubt on the \nability of the Government to come up with accurate dose reconstructions \non which the approval of claims for VA compensation of many atomic \nveterans depend.\n  In sum, there's no doubt that the report of the President's Advisory \nCommittee strongly buttresses the case for expanding the list of \nradiogenic diseases for which atomic veterans must receive the \npresumption of service-connection and, therefore, for enacting the \nprovision of H.R. 4173 in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, for almost 3 years I've been deeply moved by the \nplight of our atomic veterans and their families, and frankly dismayed \nand angered when I have learned of the many injustices they've \nexperienced over the past 50 years. My mentors on this issue have been \nMinnesota atomic veterans, particularly veterans of the U.S Army's \n216th Chemical Service Company who participated in ``Operation Tumbler \nSnapper,'' a series of eight atmospheric nuclear tests in Nevada in \n1952. They are an extraordinary group of Americans who despite their \nmany trials and tribulations have not lost faith in this country and \nbelieve and hope they will one day receive the recognition and \ncompensation that is due them.\n  Mr. President, since January 1994, I have had numerous meetings and \ncontacts with the men of the ``Forgotten 216th'' and their families. \nSince their problems typify those of other atomic veterans nationwide, \npermit me to tell you about veterans of the U.S. Army's 216th Chemical \nService Company and about why they now term themselves the ``Forgotten \n216th.''\n  When the men of ``The Forgotten 216th,'' about 50 percent of whom \nwere Minnesotans, participated in ``Operation Tumbler Snapper,'' they \nbelieved their Government's assurances that it would protect them \nagainst any harm, but now are convinced they were used as guinea pigs \nwith no concern shown for their safety. Many were sent to measure \nfallout at or near ground zero immediately after a nuclear bomb blast, \nencountering radiation so high that their geiger counters literally \nwent off the scale while they inhaled and ingested radioactive \nparticles. They were given little or no protection, sometimes even \nlacking film badges to measure their exposure to radiation and were not \ninformed of the dangers they faced. Moreover, they were sworn to \nsecrecy about their participation in nuclear tests, sometimes denied \naccess to their own service health records, and provided with no \nmedical follow-up to ensure that they had not suffered adverse health \neffects as a consequence of their exposure to radiation. Many members \nof the 216th have already died, often of cancer, some as long as 20 \nyears ago. It should be obvious to all why these men now refer to \nthemselves as ``the Forgotten 216th.''\n  For 50 years, atomic veterans have been one of America's most \nneglected groups of veterans. For almost 40 years there were no \nprovisions in Federal law specifically providing veterans compensation \nor health care for service-connected radiogenic diseases. Even now, \nwith laws on the books covering radiogenic diseases on both a \npresumptive and nonpresumptive basis, the rate of VA approval of atomic \nveterans' claims is abysmally low.\n  Mr. President, in this connection, permit me to quote from the \ntestimony of Mr. Joseph Violante of the Disabled American Veterans \nbefore a House subcommittee on April 30, 1996:\n\n       The DAV believes that a great injustice has been done to \n     America's Atomic veterans and their survivors. . . . Only 10 \n     percent of those atomic veterans who seek compensation for . \n     . . disabilities are granted service connected benefits, \n     although the VA cautions that ``it cannot be inferred from \n     this number that service-connection was necessarily granted \n     on the basis of radiation exposure.'' . . . As of April 1, \n     1996, VA statistics show that there have been a total of \n     18,515 radiation [claim] cases. Service connection has been \n     granted, as of April 1, in 1,886 cases. . . . Statistics \n     current as of December 1, 1995, demonstrate that of the total \n     number of cases in which atomic veterans have been granted \n     service-connection, 463 involve the granting of presumptive \n     service connection. . .\n\n  To sum up, if we were to exclude the 463 veterans who were granted \npresumptive service connection, atomic veterans had an incredibly low \nclaims approval rate of less than 8 percent. And of this low \npercentage, an indeterminate percentage may have had their claims \ngranted for diseases unrelated to radiation exposure. Moreover, in the \nroughly 7-year period following the 1988 enactment of a law granting \natomic veterans service connection on a presumptive basis for certain \nradiogenic disease to a degree of 10 percent disability or more, only \n463 claims of presumptive diseases have been improved. By any standard, \nthe VA's record of approving veterans' claims based on disabilities \nlinked to radiogenic diseases is a sorry one.\n  Mr. President, permit me to quote further from the eloquent and \npersuasive testimony of Mr. Violante:\n\n       It cannot be overemphasized that radiation claims are \n     wrongfully denied because of inaccurate reconstructed dose \n     estimates used as the basis for the determination that the \n     estimated minimal level of exposure experienced by the atomic \n     veteran was insufficient to cause the cancer or other disease \n     ravishing the atomic veteran's body. The reality is that \n     atomic veterans are fighting a losing battle, not only with \n     the disease or diseases that have taken away their good \n     health, but with the very government that put them in harm's \n     way. . . . . Why are only 15 diseases given a rebuttable \n     presumption of service connection for atomic veterans while \n     Marshall Islanders receive an irrebuttable presumption for \n     25 medical conditions [now 27 conditions]? Why does our \n     government continue to put the needs of its veterans \n     behind those of other groups, such as the Marshall \n     Islanders? . . . Congress should consider making all the \n     recognized ``radiogenic diseases'' and any other disease, \n     illness or disability that others, such as the Marshall \n     Islanders are being compensated for, diseases for which \n     presumptive service connection is granted.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with the DAV's cogent analysis and this is one \nof the reasons I'm determined to ensure that atomic veterans are \ngranted service-connected compensation for all radiogenic diseases.\n  The cover of every copy of the Atomic Veteran's Newsletter, the \npublication of the National Association of Atomic Veterans, contains \nthe simple but eloquent statement: ``the atomic veteran seeks no \nspecial favor . . . simply justice.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting the valiant and long struggle of atomic veterans \nfor justice by strongly backing the bill that I plan to introduce next \nyear and in fighting for its enactment.\n  I dedicate this statement to the members and families of ``The \nForgotten 216th'' who have educated me about the plight of atomic \nveterans and whose courage and perseverance I shall always admire.\n  I ask that excerpts of the statement of Mr. Joseph Violante of the \nDisabled American Veterans before the Subcommittee on Compensation, \nInsurance and Memorial Affairs, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nApril 30, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  The excerpts follow:\n\n                    Statement of Joseph A. Violante\n\n       Mister Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:\n       On behalf of the more than one million members of the \n     Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and its auxiliary, I wish to \n     thank you for this opportunity to present DAV's views on the \n     controversy surrounding access to Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) medical treatment and VA disability compensation \n     for veterans exposed to ionizing radiation, referred to \n     hereinafter as ``atomic veterans.''\n       At the outset, Mr. Chairman, we wish to thank you, Ranking \n     Democratic Member Representative Evans, and the members of \n     this subcommittee for scheduling today's oversight hearing \n     regarding the problems experienced by atomic veterans with \n     respect to access to VA health care and disability \n     compensation. Clearly, action taken by this subcommittee will \n     materially affect the lives of America's citizen/soldiers who \n     were placed in harm's way by our government for the sole \n     purpose of obtaining first-hand evidence about the effects of \n     exposure to ionizing radiation.\n       As my testimony will show, some atomic veterans have not \n     received adequate health care treatment for the ailments \n     believed to be associated with radiation exposure. Nor have \n     the vast majority of atomic veterans been compensated for \n     their residual disabilities. The remedial legislation passed \n     by Congress over the years has not had the desired effects \n     and must be revisited in order to provide meaningful health \n     care and disability compensation for this group of veterans.\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\n       As you know, Mr. Chairman, the issue of ionizing radiation \n     and its potential adverse health effects have been present \n     for more than 50 years. Atomic veterans and their loved one \n     have been patiently waiting for answers from the scientific \n     and medical communities, as well as responses to their \n     concerns from Congress and the VA. Unfortunately, all too \n     often those answers were not forthcoming. Nor does it appear \n     that definitive answers will ever be known. For each study \n     done concluding one point, another study surfaces to discount \n     the findings of the prior report. Thus, the debate rages, \n     with no apparent end in sight.\n       Before I get into the specifics of VA health care for \n     atomic veterans, let me state that atomic veterans experience \n     the same frustrations as all other veterans who attempt to \n     access the VA health care system--a system inadequate to meet \n     veterans' medical needs and their demand for services. The \n     crisis in VA health care results from years of inadequate \n     funding and a ``patchwork'' approach to addressing the health \n     care needs of veterans. In addition, atomic veterans believe \n     that their particular medical needs are not being adequately \n     met because the physicians who examine them, for the most \n     part, do not have expertise in the harmful effects produced \n     in body tissue by exposure to ionizing radiation to properly \n     diagnose their illnesses and injuries. In fact, some atomic \n     veterans honestly believe that these physicians are ``intent \n     on not encouraging radiation claims and, therefore, play down \n     the medical problems'' of atomic veterans.\n       Generally speaking, receiving disability compensation from \n     the VA is another frustrating aspect of the ionizing \n     radiation debate. All too many radiation claims are denied \n     due to the unanswered questions from the scientific and \n     medical communities, the apparent failure of dose \n     reconstruction methods to adequately reflect the true extent \n     of radiation exposure experienced by atomic veterans, and the \n     inability to obtain meaningful adjudication of radiation \n     claims. All too often, atomic veterans, their dependents \n     and survivors are denied compensation from our government \n     for the residual illness, disease, or death allegedly \n     associated with exposure to ionizing radiation while \n     others, such as the Marshall Islanders, receive \n     compensation from the United States Government for the \n     same disability(ies).\n       Before getting to the specifics of my testimony regarding \n     access to VA health care and the payment of disability \n     compensation for atomic veterans, I would note for the record \n     that the DAV membership, present at our National Convention \n     in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 1995, adopted a resolution in \n     support of a military medal to recognize and honor the \n     courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty of those veterans \n     exposed to ionizing radiation during military service. This \n     is but a small step towards recognizing the honorable service \n     of these brave men and women, and we call upon the members of \n     this subcommittee to support such legislation.\n       I also call your attention to another resolution passed by \n     the delegates at our last National Convention in Las Vegas, \n     Nevada, noting the inaccuracy of dose reconstruction \n     estimates provided by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) and \n     calling for the condemnation of this action by DNA as well as \n     urging the VA to undertake a review of the accuracy of dose \n     reconstruction estimates by DNA. Your kind attention to this \n     matter would be greatly appreciated.\n       At the very least, our government needs to take immediate \n     action on these two items.\n\n\n    Controversy Surrounding Potential health effects of exposure to \n                           ionizing radiation\n\n       Radiation exposure may be external or internal. External \n     radiation exposure occurs when the radiation source is \n     outside the body. External exposure can come from standing in \n     a cloud of radioactive gas, swimming in water that has \n     radioactive material in it, or x-rays. Internal radiation \n     exposure occurs when radioactive material is taken into the \n     body by such means as eating, breathing, drinking, or through \n     cuts or breaks in the skin. Both external and internal \n     radiation exposure can directly harm internal organs, cells, \n     and tissues.\n       After radioactive material is taken into the body, some of \n     it may enter the bloodstream. This blood then flows through \n     various organs and tissues in the body, providing them with \n     material necessary for their functioning. The body does not \n     distinguish between radioactive and nonradioactive materials. \n     Sometimes, radioactive substances concentrate primarily in \n     one organ of the body and that organ, therefore, receives a \n     larger dose of radioactive substance than do other organs. \n     Other times, the radiation substance is distributed \n     throughout the body. The dose received by different parts of \n     the body depends on a number of factors, including whether \n     the radiation substance dissolves easily in the blood, the \n     type and energy of the radioactive material, the amount of \n     radioactivity present, and its distribution in the body.\n       The radioactive substance, once taken into the body, will \n     continue to give off radiation until either it has decayed or \n     is eliminated from the body through normal metabolism. The \n     rate of decay depends on the radioactive substance's half-\n     life--the time required for a radioactive substance to lose \n     one-half of its activity by radioactive decay. Half-lives for \n     different radioactive substances vary from hours to thousands \n     of years. Plutonium, for example, has a half-life of 24,100 \n     years.\n       For obvious reasons, researchers know more about the \n     effects of high-dose radiation on the immune system than \n     about low-dose radiation exposure. High-dose radiation is \n     defined as any exposure above fifty rad to the whole body. A \n     rad is the unit of radiation dose used to measure the amount \n     of energy a body absorbs from ionizing radiation. Information \n     on the effects of high-dose radiation exposure comes from \n     studies of Japanese atomic bomb victims, radiation accidents, \n     such as the accident at Chernobyl, and studies of Marshall \n     Islanders exposed to radiation fallout from nuclear tests in \n     the 1950s.\n       Less is known about low-dose exposure--less than fifty rads \n     to the whole body--and its effect on the immune system \n     because of the delayed period of time between the incident \n     of exposure and the development of the disease. The late \n     effects may show up months, years, or even decades after \n     the exposure. . . .\n       Many mistrust the agency established to care for them--the \n     VA--because it is part of the government, a government they \n     perceive as covering up the true facts about the extent of \n     their exposure and the adverse health effects associated with \n     the exposure. While Congress has enacted a number of laws to \n     provide atomic veterans with priority access to VA health \n     care and VA disability compensation for their illnesses, \n     diseases, and disabilities due to exposure to ionizing \n     radiation, very few atomic veterans are able to access the VA \n     health care system and receive adequate care and treatment. \n     Even fewer atomic veterans and their survivors are able to \n     establish entitlement to VA disability compensation benefits. \n     . . .\n\n\n                  va disability compensation benefits\n\n       Prior to the enactment of the Veterans' Dioxin and \n     Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, Pub. L. No. \n     98-542, 98 stat. 2725 (1984) (``the Act''), the authority for \n     38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.311 (formerly 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.311b), there \n     was no legal limitation to establishing service connection \n     for residuals of ionizing radiation exposure. Service \n     connection for a disability is generally established when a \n     veteran's present condition can be reasonably related to an \n     injury or disease which is shown to be incurred coincident \n     with service. See 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.303(a). Determination of \n     service connection is based on a broad and liberal \n     interpretation of the law consistent with the facts in each \n     individual case. Id. It has long been the VA's policy that \n     any condition which can be attributed to service shall be \n     granted direct service connection, no matter how long after \n     service the condition first became manifest. See 38 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 3.303(d). However, because of the difficulty in proving \n     causation in ionizing radiation cases, and the significantly \n     small number of claims which had been allowed. Congress, in \n     1984, recognized that, statistically, there was enough of an \n     association between some diseases and radiation exposure to \n     establish them as ``radiogenic.'' Congress responded by \n     enacting remedial legislation, the Act, whereby a veteran \n     suffering from a ``radiogenic disease,'' was not required to \n     submit evidence of causation. . . .\n       The stated purpose of the 1984 Act is ``to ensure that [VA] \n     disability compensation is provided to veterans who were \n     exposed during service . . . to ionizing radiation . . . for \n     all disabilities arising after service that are connected, \n     based on sound scientific and medical evidence, to such \n     service. . . .'' The Act, Sec. 3. Congress's findings \n     included: There is scientific and medical uncertainty \n     regarding the long-term adverse health effects of exposure to \n     ionizing radiation. Id. Sec. 2(2). Due to the long latency \n     period involved, radiation claims present adjudicatory issues \n     which are significantly different from issues generally \n     presented. Id. Sec. 2(12). ``It has always been the policy of \n     the [VA] and is the policy of the United States, with respect \n     to individual claims for service connection . . . that when, \n     after consideration of all evidence and material of record, \n     there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \n     evidence . . . the benefit of the doubt in resolving each \n     such issue shall be given to the claimant. Id. Sec. 2(13).\n       Presently, the VA recognizes 20 diseases as ``radiogenic \n     diseases''--a disease that may be induced by ionizing \n     radiation--under Sec. 3.311. These ``radiogenic diseases'' \n     include leukemia, other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia; \n     breast cancer; lung cancer; bone cancer; liver cancer; skin \n     cancer; esophageal cancer; stomach cancer; colon cancer; \n     pancreatic cancer; kidney cancer; urinary bladder cancer; \n     salivary gland cancer; multiple myeloma; posterior \n     subcapsular cataracts; non-malignant thyroid nodular disease; \n     ovarian cancer; parathyroid adenoma; and tumors of the brain \n     and central nervous system.\n       Pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.311, an \n     atomic veteran diagnosed with a recognized ``radiogenic \n     disease'' can have his or her claim for direct service \n     connection for residuals of exposure to ionizing radiation \n     adjudicated by the VA, notwithstanding the fact that the \n     atomic veteran does not have any medical evidence to \n     establish a cause and effect relationship between his \n     exposure to ionizing radiation and his diagnosed ``radiogenic \n     disease.'' Otherwise, (based on a recent court decision \n     discussed infra) an atomic veteran who believes that his or \n     her disability, not found on the list of ``radiogenic \n     diseases,'' may have his or her claim for service connection \n     on a direct basis adjudicated by the VA providing the atomic \n     veteran has medical evidence to support the claim. Once the \n     atomic veteran has demonstrated that he or she suffers from a\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\n     ``radiogenic disease'' or provides medical evidence of a \n     cause and effect relationship between his or her disability \n     and exposure to ionizing radiation, the VA, pursuant to \n     Sec. 3.311 must obtain a dose estimate as to the range of \n     doses to which the atomic veteran may have been exposed. \n     Final review of direct service connection claims based on \n     exposure to ionizing radiation is conducted by the Under \n     Secretary for Benefits, who may obtain and consider any \n     opinion of the Under Secretary for Health in reaching his \n     determination whether the atomic veteran's disease resulted \n     from radiation exposure in service.\n       Mr. chairman, although Sec. 3.311 was passed by Congress in \n     1984 as remedial legislation, designed to assist atomic \n     veterans and their survivors in obtaining compensation for \n     illnesses, diseases, disabilities, and death due to exposure \n     to ionizing radiation, this legislation has benefited very \n     few atomic veterans or their survivors. Until recently, the \n     VA considered the list of ``radiogenic diseases'' as an \n     exclusive list thereby refusing to consider any claims for \n     direct service connection for residuals of radiation exposure \n     if the atomic veteran or his or her survivors could not \n     demonstrate that the atomic veteran suffered from a listed \n     ``radiogenic disease,'' regardless of the evidence submitted \n     in support of the claim. The VA's practice of adjudicating \n     only those claims where the atomic veteran suffered from a \n     recognized ``radiogenic disease'' was overturned by the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on \n     September 1, 1994, in Combee vs. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1045 \n     (Fed.Cir. 1994).\n       Once an atomic veteran seeking direct service connection \n     for residuals of exposure to ionizing radiation has \n     established that he or she suffers from a recognized \n     ``radiogenic disease'' or have provided the VA with medical \n     evidence of a cause and effect relationship, the burden of \n     proof then shifts to the VA for consideration of the case on \n     the merits. It is at this point that atomic veterans face \n     their greatest obstacle in establishing their entitlement to \n     service connection. Dose estimates and dose reconstruction \n     data for the various radiation tests are handled by the \n     Defense Nuclear Agency.\n       In more cases than not, no actual individual exposure \n     record is available for the atomic veteran, and reconstructed \n     dose estimates routinely fail to provide an accurate \n     estimation of the level of radiation exposure experienced by \n     the atomic veteran. Film badges, not issued to all \n     participants in nuclear tests, did not provide a complete \n     measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of \n     recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses, or often \n     shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only \n     limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.\n       Many atomic veterans who participated in the nuclear tests \n     in the Pacific report visiting these islands a short time \n     after the test detonation and eating locally grown fruits and \n     swimming in the lagoons. Atomic veterans who participated in \n     the Nevada test sites report being covered in fallout dust \n     which was either brushed off of them by hand or with brooms. \n     Many report being transported to mess halls shortly after \n     walking through ``ground zero'' and not being able to \n     properly clean themselves before eating. These factors are \n     extremely important in determining a proper reconstructed \n     dose estimate; however, it does not appear that the \n     participant's comments are used to further the analysis with \n     regards to the dose reconstruction estimate. Without accurate \n     reconstructed dose estimates, atomic veterans and their \n     survivors find it virtually impossible to obtain the benefits \n     they seek.\n       All too often, reconstructed dose estimates show that the \n     overwhelming majority of participants were supposedly exposed \n     to one rem or less of external doses of ionizing radiation. \n     It is extremely difficult to believe, based on the statements \n     made by participants, that their total exposure was so \n     minimal. The DAV believes that a great injustice has been \n     done to America's atomic veterans and their survivors. As \n     will be discussed later, only ten percent of those atomic \n     veterans who seek compensation for their residual \n     disabilities are granted service-connected benefits, \n     although the VA cautions that ``[i]t cannot be inferred \n     from this number that service connection was necessarily \n     granted on the basis of radiation exposure.'' In other \n     words, although the atomic veteran claimed residual \n     disability as a result of his exposure to ionizing \n     radiation, the claim could have been allowed under general \n     principles establishing service connection such as the \n     disease or illness was evidenced in the service medical \n     records, etc. . . .\n       Adjudication of radiation claims pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \n     3.311 have been a total failure. With almost 95% of atomic \n     veterans failing to establish service connection for their \n     illness, disease, or disability, the remedial legislation \n     passed in 1984 has not provided atomic veterans with \n     meaningful consideration of their claims. The present \n     statistical data showing an extremely high denial rate has \n     changed very little since 1984 when former Senator Cranston \n     expressed the need for this remedial legislation.\n       In May 1988, aware that something more was needed, Congress \n     passed Pub. L. No. 100-321, Sec. 2(a), 102 Stat. 485, which \n     grants service connection on a presumptive basis for certain \n     diseases becoming manifest in an atomic veteran to a degree \n     of 10% or more. Currently, the list of presumptive diseases, \n     a total of 15 in all, include: leukemia, other than chronic \n     lymphocytic leukemia; thyroid cancer, breast cancer; cancer \n     of the pharynx; esophageal cancer; stomach cancer; cancer of \n     the small intestine; pancreatic cancer; multiple myeloma; \n     lymphomas, except Hodgkin's disease; bile duct cancer; gall \n     bladder cancer, primary liver cancer, except if cirrhosis or \n     hepatitis B is indicated; salivary gland cancer; and urinary \n     tract cancer. While 20 diseases are recognized as \n     ``radiogenic diseases'' pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.311, \n     only 15 diseases are presumed to be service-connected as a \n     result of exposure to ionizing radiation. Yet, pursuant to \n     the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal Act, 25 separate \n     medical conditions are irrebuttably presumed to be the result \n     of radiation exposure and Marshall Islanders are compensated \n     for these disabilities. It is difficult to understand the \n     lack of consistency in these lists. Why are only 15 diseases \n     given a rebuttable presumption of service connection for \n     atomic veterans while Marshall Islanders receive an \n     irrebuttable presumption for 25 medical conditions? Further, \n     at the very least, why are not all 20 ``radiogenic diseases'' \n     presumed to be service-connected as a result of ionizing \n     radiation exposure pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1112(c)? Why does \n     our government continue to put the needs of its veterans \n     behind those of other groups, such as the Marshall Islanders? \n     America's veterans should always be considered a special and \n     unique group for having served their nation with honor. . . .\n       Congress should consider making all the recognized \n     ``radiogenic diseases,'' and any other disease, illness, or \n     disability that others, such as the Marshall Islanders, are \n     being compensated for, with those diseases for which \n     presumptive service connection is granted. The Marshall \n     Islanders have an irrebuttable presumption, at the very \n     least, America's atomic veterans should receive a rebuttable \n     presumption for all diseases, illnesses or disabilities for \n     which others are compensated.\n       The DAV commends this subcommittee for it's recent, \n     favorable action on adding bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma, a \n     form of lung cancer, to the list of diseases presumed to be \n     service-connected for veterans exposed to ionizing radiation. \n     As stated above, however, all recognized ``radiogenic \n     diseases'' including lung cancer should be added to the list \n     of diseases presumed to be service-connected. . . .\n       In closing, I would like to refer to a phrase which appears \n     on the Atomic Veterans' Newsletter, published by the National \n     Association of Atomic Veterans, Inc. that states: ``The \n     atomic veteran seeks no special favor . . . simply justice.'' \n     This justice is long overdue. DAV encourages this \n     subcommittee to do everything necessary to ensure that this \n     group of forgotten veterans--atomic veterans--receive \n     meaningful justice from our government.\n       This concludes my statement. I would be happy to answer any \n     questions you may have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12133-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12136-S12143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, even in an age of spin control, when \nit is often difficult to wade through the rhetoric to find the truth, \nit is possible to determine the true measure of a government. That \nmeasure can be found quite revealingly in the budget. For it is in the \nbudget that the priorities become clear. It is in the budget that the \nrhetorical claims can be separated from the real claims. In Elizabethan \nEngland, as the old saw tells us, the proof may have been in the \npudding. But in modern day America, the proof of an administration's or \na political party's claims is in its budget proposals.\n  We have just come through two exceptionally challenging years. The \nRepublican Party, led by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and then-\nSenate majority leader and now Presidential nominee Bob Dole, sought to \nupend government--to eliminate or slash service after service upon \nwhich Americans depend. The effect of their efforts, had they been \nsuccessful, would have been to heap on the rich and the powerful in \nthis Nation even greater riches and power. Those additional riches and \npower would have come at the expense of working Americans, at the \nexpense of the environment which we have been laboring for decades to \nclean up, at the expense of those who need health care, at the expense \nof children and young people seeking quality education, at the expense \nof those who have been victimized by crime, drug abuse, and domestic \nviolence, at the expense of America's future.\n  The Republican Party correctly identified the importance of gaining \ncontrol of our Nation's fiscal household, but then threw wisdom and \nprudence to the wind, and concluded that the only legitimate objective \nwas to slash Federal spending, regardless of how or where, regardless \nof the harm that would be caused to our Nation and its people as a \nresult of those actions. Paradoxically, the only large category\n\n[[Page S12137]]\n\nof discretionary spending Republicans excepted from their frenzied \nassault was that for armies and weapons, despite the fact that the cold \nwar ended over 5 years ago, and that, for the first time in 50 years, \nwe have no superpower adversary.\n  The budget the Republicans brought forward last year dramatized this \nextremist philosophy. It portrayed a singular absence of vision, \nconfirming that the Republican party neither understood nor subscribed \nto the concept of investment in the future by our Government on behalf \nof this Nation's citizens.\n  The Democrats in the Senate and the House, led by President Clinton, \nrejected this extreme agenda. We did not shy from the fierce conflict \nthe Republicans promised if anyone dared challenge their zealous \nactions to demolish vital services.\n  After nearly a year of pitched battle over the 1996 budget--that \nresulted in several Government shutdowns--it became clear even to the \nRepublicans that the American people did not support their objectives \nor their approach. A budget finally was enacted halfway through the \nfiscal year that came much closer to reflecting the principles and \npriorities Democrats had consistently said the American people \nsupported.\n  But while the Republicans acknowledged tactical defeat, they had not \nyet learned the lesson. Once again, in the form of the 1997 budget, \nthey showed their true colors. Once again, they launched forth in \npursuit of an extremist agenda to cut education funding, cut job \ntraining, cut health care, cut law enforcement assistance, cut \nassistance to small businesses, cut programs to help American companies \nmore effectively compete with foreign firms.\n  Again, the Clinton administration and congressional Democrats met \nthem head-on. Today we have reached the end of this second budget \ncampaign of the 104th Congress. Once again, because the congressional \nDemocrats more accurately reflected the values and views of the \nAmerican people, the Republicans' budget has been repudiated in large \nmeasure. This time, in fact, the battle has been won with far less \nbloodshed and in far less time. The Republicans, knowing they did not \nhave the support of the majority of the Nation, and knowing the \nelections are only weeks away, ran up the white flag almost as soon as \nthe battle was really joined.\n  Mr. President, the American people are the winners. The future of our \nNation is the winner. I am relieved and heartened to see that our \ndemocratic process has operated in such a way as to earn our faith and \nconfidence.\n  With the leadership of President Clinton and his administration, we \nhave taken a devastating Republican budget and transformed it into one \nthat manages to pass the basic test of responsibility. I commend the \nPresident and the Vice President for their courage and resolve. I \ncommend White House Chief of Staff Panetta and his staff, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and others from the Administration who were \ninvolved. Also deserving of praise are Senate Democratic Leader Tom \nDaschle and his staff, Appropriations Committee ranking Democrat Robert \nByrd and his staff, and the subcommittee ranking members and their \nstaffs.\n  While none of us has ever seen a budget that is identical to the one \nhe or she would have proposed, the budget that emerged from the \nnegotiations in the wee hours of this past Saturday morning is one that \nI can support. It is true that the portions that address our \nGovernment's domestic services generally are preferable to the portion \nthat addresses defense; the defense portion provides more funding than \nwe need in the post-cold-war era to ensure our national security. We \nhave pressing domestic needs to which this surplus defense funding \nwould be more beneficially targeted. And some of this excess funding \nbeyond the Defense Department's request should be used to further \nreduce the deficit, a vital objective.\n  Not only for this reason--but significantly for this reason--this \nlegislation could be better; it could be stronger; it could be fairer. \nBut it passes the threshold test. With many reservations, I voted for \nit because it is better than anything we've seen in the past 2 years; \nit is better than we were afraid we would see this year; and it \nprotects and in some cases enhances some vital services for the \nAmerican people. In some cases the best that can be said for it is that \nit preserves important services through another year so that we may \nreturn to attempt to allocate sufficient resources to them next year. \nBut that was enough to secure my vote.\n  I would like to mention several of the bill's components that are of \nparticular importance to Massachusetts and the Nation.\n\n\n                           PARKS AND INTERIOR\n\n  I am proud of the rich historical heritage of my State of \nMassachusetts and I am pleased to support funding for many of the \nState's historic sites in the continuing resolution for fiscal year \n1997.\n  The first historic site, established in 1938, the Salem National \nHistoric Site, represents a slice of Massachusetts life from the 17th \nthrough the 19th centuries, when Salem traded with the East Indies and \nthroughout the world, opening new markets for exports and importing \ntreasures from far away. The site includes 18th- and 19th-century \nwharves, the Custom House, the West India Goods Store, and the 17th-\ncentury Narbonne-Hale house, where local craftsmen worked. In June \n1994, the new regional visitors center opened after a $4.7 million \nFederal investment. The operational funding increase of $341,000, plus \nfive additional personnel, will ensure that the regional visitors \ncenter, which offers information about cultural and natural resources \nthroughout Essex County, remains open year-round. These increased funds \nwill help the site to accommodate the growing number of visitors to the \npark, which has grown by at least 30 percent since 1990, and exceeded 1 \nmillion in 1992.\n\n  The site is also completing construction of the sailing vessel \nFriendship, an exhibit dedicated to the master craftsmen shipbuilders \nof the 18th century. This funding will also go toward operating the \nSalem site. With its authentic replica of the historic Friendship \nnearly completed, it offers an educational opportunity for children and \ntheir families that can be a model for similar parks in the State.\n  I am also pleased, Mr. President, that funds have been approved for \ncontinued maintenance, protection, and development of the Lowell \nNational Historic Site, and to continue the 17-year efforts of the \nLowell Historic Preservation Commission. The operating increase of \n$404,000 is required to continue operations in the park that \ncommemorates the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution. \nLocated in downtown Lowell, the park includes the Boott Cotton Mills \nMuseum, ``mill girl'' boarding houses, and the Suffolk Mill turbine, \nand offers guided tours depicting how the transition was made from \nfarming to industry, the history of immigrants and labor in Lowell, and \nthe development of industrial technology. Although the economy in \nLowell has not been strong in the past few years, the tourist industry \nhas been a staple of the city's livelihood. The National Park Service \nconducts tours that take visitors around the city, via canals, \ntrolleys, and walking tours. With the addition of professional baseball \nand hockey teams, there are now more reasons than ever to visit Lowell, \nand its historic preservation efforts will reflect the renewed interest \nin the city.\n  To many of us, classic American poetry and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow \nare synonymous. His home, a national historic site, will justifiably \nreceive an operating increase of $112,000. Longfellow lived in this \nresidence for nearly 50 years while teaching at Harvard. This house was \nalso General George Washington's headquarters during the siege of \nBoston in 1775. In addition, the Longfellow National Historic Site \nmanages one of the largest and most important fine arts collections in \nthe National Park Service. Unfortunately, recent cutbacks in funding \nhave forced the Park Service to close its door for 6 months a year, \nthus ending public tours and student programs from November to May. \nCountless historic books and textile exhibits have deteriorated. \nMoreover, the vast majority of the archives remain uncatalogued and \ninaccessible to researchers. This operating increase will enable the \nLongfellow House to provide critical security and management for the \nmuseum collections contained in this\n\n[[Page S12138]]\n\nmonument to America's struggle for independence and rich cultural \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased this continuing resolution contains \n$301,000 for continued maintenance, protection and security of the Cape \nCod National Seashore. This increased funding for park operations and \nmaintenance will be used to improve park security, caretaking, and fire \nprotection at the newest section of the Cape Cod Seashore, the \ndecommissioned North Truro Air Force Station that was annexed in 1986. \nThis request was supported by the Cape Cod Commission, many residents, \nand organizations on the Cape. Over 5 million visitors and vacationers \nannually visit the Cape Cod National Seashore, a park on the outer \nbeaches of Cape Cod, extending 40 miles from Chatham to Provincetown. \nThe park is made up of oceans, beaches, dunes, woodlands, freshwater \nponds and marshes. It is home to a vibrant ecosystem of plants and \nanimals. The area is also home to numerous historical structures, \nincluding Marconi's wireless station.\n\n  I am also very pleased that this omnibus package includes nearly $1 \nmillion for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor \nincluding $324,000 to support the important ongoing efforts of the \nCorridor Commission and $460,000 for development and construction \nprojects in the Blackstone River Valley. With the passage last week of \nlegislation to expand the boundaries of the Blackstone Corridor, the \ncorridor size will increase by 60 percent, with approximately 150,000 \nnew acres including two national historic landmarks. These funds are \nneeded to develop resource inventories, interpretive programs, and \nprotection strategies for the five communities newly included in the \nCorridor, including Worcester, MA.\n  Established in 1986, the Blackstone Valley National Heritage \nCorridor, encompassing 400,000 acres, is the largest national park in \nthe North Atlantic Region of the National Park Service. It contains \nover 10,000 historic structures, and is significant for its 18th and \n19th century industrial production systems of mill villages, farms, and \ntransportation that illustrate America's transition from an \nagricultural to an industrial Nation. It also includes acres of farms \nand pastures and beautiful riverside scenery. The Blackstone Corridor \nis unique in the National Park Service because it is predominantly \nfunded and maintained with local resources, encouraging a public-\nprivate partnership that has become a model for other parks, using \nfederal seed money to encourage local preservation and revitalize the \neconomy.\n  I applaud the inclusion of additional funds for land acquisition in \nthe Mashpee National Wildlife Refuge. A transfer of $750,000 from \nanother defunct Fish and Wildlife Service project was recently made to \nMashpee. While my request for $1.582 million for the acquisition, which \nwas originally included in the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill \npassed by the Senate, was not fully funded in the conference report, I \nam pleased that two-thirds of our request was included in this \nlegislation to secure this important natural resource.\n  Mr. President, with regard to one other parks and Interior component \nof this legislation that directly impacts my State of Massachusetts, I \nsupport the increased funding it contains for the John F. Kennedy \nNational Historic Site. Although the site attracts 15,000 visitors \nduring its brief open season--one-third of which are visiting from \nabroad and who consider the birthplace their primary destination--\nrecent funding shortages have forced the JFK National Historic Site to \neliminate school programs, and significantly reduced the number of \ntours that can be accommodated. The funding increase of $57,000 will \nallow the hiring of one permanent park ranger and three seasonal park \nrangers to give tours, conduct school programs, and provide information \nservices. The additional resources will allow the site to remain open \nfor at least 9 months per year.\n  Interior Subcommittee and full Appropriations Committee Ranking \nDemocrat Robert C. Byrd, Subcommittee Chairman Slade Gorton, and their \nstaffs have done a commendable job in addressing all the needs for \nfunding within the constraints that have been imposed on them. I thank \nthem for their help.\n\n\n                            FISH AND OCEANS\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Commerce, Justice, State, \nand Judiciary appropriations provisions in this continuing resolution \nand I want to especially commend the ranking member of the Commerce, \nJustice, State and Judiciary subcommittee, Senator Hollings, for his \nwork on this portion of the bill. The Appropriations Committee faced \nthe daunting task of fairly distributing funding to a broad array of \nimportant programs, many of which are critical to our economy, our \npersonal security, our marine environment, and international relations \nwithin a budget framework of extremely limited resources. While there \nare always some disappointments about specific programs and projects, I \nbelieve this portion of the bill is a balanced measure of significant \nbenefit.\n\n  As the ranking member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries, I am pleased that this measure provides funding \nincreases to some key marine and coastal programs and at least assures \nthe continuation of others.\n  The importance of a healthy environment to the citizens of this \nnation and to those living in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is \nreflected in the bill's provision of $1.85 billion for NOAA. NOAA is \none of the Federal Government's premiere scientific research agencies, \nwith responsibility for the stewardship of our living marine resources, \noperation of our National Weather Service and its environmental \nsatellite system, management of our National Marine Sanctuaries, the \ncoordination of activities impacting the coastal zone, and the \nintegration of a cooperative research program with universities through \nthe Nation.\n  Of special interest to many citizens of Massachusetts are programs \nwhich help to protect and conserve valuable natural resources along our \ncoastline. Just a few of the programs of national importance which are \nfunded include the Coastal Zone Management Program, the National Marine \nSanctuary Program, the National Undersea Research Program, the Coastal \nOcean Program, and the National Sea Grant Program. Working in concert \nwith each other, and with other Federal, State and local programs, \nthese NOAA programs constitute part of the front line in defending the \nnatural beauty and biologic diversity of our coastal resources. We all \nhave come to recognize the important cultural and economic benefits of \nmarine-related industries and recreational activities and I believe \nthat strong support for these program will help to ensure that these \nbenefits will be passed along to future generations.\n  Of great importance to me and to my fishing constituents is the \ncontinued funding for the research programs targeted on the New England \ngroundfish disaster. The Gulf of Maine Groundfish Survey, New England \nStock Depletion Studies and Management of Georges Bank projects provide \nfunding for scientists in the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS] \nto more carefully examine the causes of the groundfish fishery collapse \nand to identify ways to rebuild and manage these stocks so they return \nto healthy levels. This continued support is needed for the scientific \nand assessment efforts that form the basis for the difficult management \ndecisions necessary to preserve fisheries while considering the needs \nof those whose livelihoods depend on fishing or on commerce in fish and \nfish products.\n  Massachusetts will also benefit from additional resources provided to \nNMFS. These programs include right whale research, the New England \nFishery Management Council, Marine Mammal Protection Act \nimplementation, habitat conservation, and fisheries enforcement. \nAdditionally, the funding provided for Atlantic salmon, the Atlantic \nMigratory Pelagics Observer Program, and the aquaculture programs will \ncontinue valuable programs which provide both direct and indirect \nbenefits to citizens of the Commonwealth. The health of living marine \nresources along the coast of the Commonwealth continues to be of great \nconcern to my constituents, and I echo their sentiment both personally \nand as their representative in the U.S. Senate.\n  Whales are one of the great symbols of the ocean and are closely \nassociated with Massachusetts. Funding for North Atlantic right whale \nresearch is of critical importance this year. The North\n\n[[Page S12139]]\n\nAtlantic right whale is the most endangered of all mammals, with \napproximately 350 remaining in the world. Unfortunately, this year \nalone, seven right whales have died as a result of being hit by ships \nand other unknown causes. The funds provided in this bill will help to \nadvance our knowledge of right whale behavior and habitat requirements \nand hopefully lead toward measures which will avoid the unacceptable \nlevel of mortalities experienced this year.\n  The Saltonstall-Kennedy fisheries grants programs is another \nimportant program for our Nation's coastal regions, providing funding \nfor research to enhance fish stocks, develop new markets for \nunderutilized fish species, and assess new fishing gear technologies. \nOften, Saltonstall-Kennedy grants are the only source of funds \navailable to assist the fishing industry in its effort to adapt and \ndiversify.\n  I am also pleased to see continued funding for the Coastal Zone \nManagement [CZM] Program, particularly the funding for State grants. \nJust this past spring we reauthorized the Coastal Zone Management Act. \nThe CZM program is a highly successful voluntary State-Federal \npartnership to protect, develop, restore, and enhance our coast for \npresent and future generations. The program has proven to be very \neffective in enhancing coastal economies while minimizing the impacts \nof the increasing pressures of growing populations, environmental \ndegradation, and conflicting uses of our fragile and finite coastal \narea.\n  NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program [COP] is a Nationwide science program \nconducting important interdisciplinary research on oceanographic \nproblems, including ecosystem research on Georges Bank. The COP \nprovides one focal point through which NOAA integrates and coordinates \nits research activities with other Federal, State, and academic \nprograms. Through its comprehensive, proactive approach, the COP offers \npolicy makers the best information available, providing them with the \nbalanced perspective needed to promote economic growth while \nmaintaining a healthy and sustainable environment.\n  I would like to commend the committee for its continuing support for \nthe Sea Grant Program. This is a Program that builds bridges between \nGovernment and academia, as well as between research laboratories and \ngroups in need of reliable information. It serves as a successful model \nfor multidisciplinary research directed at scientific advancement and \neconomic development by funding regional research, promoting \ntechnology, and enhancing public education and outreach services for \nthe Nation's coastal resources.\n  I am also pleased to see continued funding for the Global Climate \nChange Program. This Program seeks to develop a clearer picture of the \nrelative roles of various greenhouse gases in causing global warming. \nThe NOAA Program is an important part of the overall U.S. interagency \neffort to improve the science that is needed to make critical decisions \nabout the future of our planet.\n  Another ocean Program very important to my State is the National \nMarine Sanctuary Program. Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary off \nthe coast of Massachusetts is an excellent example of Federal activity \nthat produces both environmental protection and economic enhancement. \nThis marine mammal feeding area is popular with whale watchers and \nfishermen, and protection of the bank has received wide support--not \nonly among my constituents but Nationwide. The funding provided in the \nCR will help to maintain this important national program, especially \nStellwagen Bank.\n\n  Another program which is receiving well-deserved funding is the \nNational Undersea Research Program [NURP]. This program consists of six \ncenters where regional undersea research activities are conducted. Its \nfunding also will cover the NURP share of the operating expenses for \nthe ALVIN, the deep submersible research vessel based at the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institute.\n  The Fishing Vessel Obligation Guarantee Program is also administered \nby NOAA and was established to provide loan guarantees to the \ncommercial fishing industry. The program was recently expanded to \ninclude aquaculture facilities, making the program the single most \nimportant financing vehicle for this rapidly expanding industry.\n  On global environmental issues, I have worked actively for an \nAntarctic Environmental Protocol, including the Convention on the \nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources [CCAMLR]. \nAdditionally, the President soon will sign the Antarctic Science, \nTourism, and Conservation Act, which I authored, which will implement \nthe International Antarctica Treaty. Data provided by NOAA's Antarctic \nMarine Living Resources [AMLR] Program are critical to CCAMLR's \nimplementation and I am very pleased that $1.2 million has been \nprovided to ensure the continuation of this critical work.\n  I compliment my good friend and colleague, Senator Hollings, for his \nleadership in these oceans issues which he has successfully championed \nfor years. It is my pleasure to serve with him on the Commerce \nCommittee, where he served as chairman until 1995.\n\n\n                       BOSTON HARBOR--CLEAN WATER\n\n  Mr. President, recently the Congress passed and the President signed \ninto law the VA-HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1997. During Senate consideration of that bill, I expressed \nmy deep concern that the Republicans refused to meet the President's \nrequested funding level for a critical environmental protection \nmeasure, the project to clean up Boston Harbor. While the President \nheld firm in his support for $100 million for Boston Harbor for 1997 as \nSenator Kennedy and I urged him to do, by a party line vote the \nRepublican conferees forced a funding reduction to just $40 million.\n  However, the story did not end there. I continued to work closely \nwith Senator Kennedy in supporting the President's efforts to secure \nmore funding for Boston Harbor. I wrote and spoke to the President, his \nChief of Staff, Leon Panetta, and others in the administration many \ntimes over the past few weeks, urging them to increase funding for this \nenvironmental cleanup effort.\n  Therefore, I am very pleased and very appreciative that the President \nand congressional Democrats were victorious in their attempts to secure \nmore funding for Boston Harbor in this omnibus budget package. It \ncontains an additional $35 million for Boston Harbor, raising the \nfiscal year 1995 funding level to $75 million. The residents of \nMassachusetts and the ratepayers of the Boston metropolitan area are \nwell served by this action.\n\n\n                          ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\n  I am extremely pleased to have secured another key provision for \nMassachusetts in this bill--language that will permit financing to go \nforward to revitalize the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, MA. This \nprovision was originally sought by Senator Kennedy and me in the \nCommerce/State/Justice appropriation bill for fiscal year 1997, and was \nlater modified by Majority Leader Lott, who sought, not inappropriately \nin my view, to toughen up the language. In the case of the Quincy \nproject, this language alteration will place a greater responsibility \non the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to help underwrite the necessary \nfinancing. I am satisfied that the new language leaves enough \ndiscretion to the Maritime Administration so that a suitable \narrangement can be reached that is both affordable and acceptable to \nthe Commonwealth. This is a matter on which I, Senator Kennedy, and \nRepresentative Studds have been working for over a year.\n\n  Specifically, section 1139 establishes the basis for the Secretary of \nTransportation to assist certain shipyards, including the yard at \nQuincy, by facilitating the extension of Federal loan guarantees for \nthe reactivation and modernization of those yards and the construction \nof vessels by the yards. Significantly, this section has been carefully \ndrafted to provide several layers of protection to the Federal \ntaxpayer, and to ensure the State where a yard is located shoulders a \ndegree of the financial burden of revitalizing the yard, and also a \nportion of the financial risk. For example, subsection (d) requires the \nState or a State-chartered agency where the yard is located to deposit \ninto the Federal treasury the amount of funds needed to cover the \npercentage of the risk factor cost required by the Federal Credit \nReform Act, and provides for the reversion of the funds to the State if \nno obligation\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\nneeds to be paid from the deposited funds. I fully expect that the \npercentage of the risk factor under this subsection will never exceed \n12 percent for the Quincy project. It appears to me that a deposit from \nthe State of 12 percent will be more than adequate to fulfill the \nrequirements associated with the risk of default for a project of this \nnature.\n  This provision is significant to my State because the Quincy Shipyard \nproject is the first of its kind. It is the first project to revitalize \nan inoperative shipyard and put it back into production as a State-of-\nthe-art facility that will employ up to 2,000 workers in good jobs. \nThis makes sense, because the proposal to revitalize the Quincy \nShipyard will turn it into a shipyard on the cutting edge of technology \nand one which will produce vessels that will be in demand in the \ninternational marketplace for years--double-hulled oil tankers to carry \npetroleum safely around the world. The Federal Government's investment \nin the Quincy Shipyard will be repaid many times over through the jobs \nthat will be created, and through the renewed position of American \nmaritime leadership that the project will help us attain. Now that \nCongress has done its part, it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth, the \ncity of Quincy, the Massachusetts Heavy Industries Corp., and the \nMaritime Administration to bring the project to reality.\n  I must note with disappointment that, despite the stalwart support of \nadministration and Senate Democratic negotiators, House Republicans \ninsisted on cutting the cap on the permissible guarantee for any one \nproject from $100 million to $50 million. This would have constrained \nthe project in Quincy. Fortunately, however, with identical legislation \nmoving on a separate track, which now has been sent to the President \nfor signature, we have overcome that last-minute partial hurdle.\n  I am pleased that the continuing resolution contains language \nexpressing the support of House and Senate appropriators for \nMassachusetts Biomedical Research Institute [MBRI] and other biomedical \nresearch and innovation centers throughout the country that have \nreceived past financial support from the Department of Commerce. This \nlanguage is specifically intended to continue the Federal Government's \nsupport for one institution in particular--MBRI. MBRI is familiar to \nsome of my colleagues from other States because it has been a model for \nseveral biomedical research programs elsewhere in the country. Designed \nby the business and academic community of Worcester, MA, to nurture the \ntransfer of biomedical technology from the laboratory into new business \nstart-ups and the growth of those start-ups into job-creating \nbusinesses offering cutting-edge medical products, since its inception \nin 1986, MBRI has spawned 20 new firms in the biomedical industries--\nfirms that now employ over 2200 people.\n\n  I am proud that Democratic majorities in the Senate wisely chose to \nfund MBRI. I regret, however, that the new Republican majority again \nthis year, as it did last year, has refused to fund MBRI directly. This \nyear, it chose instead to instruct the Commerce Department to ``provide \nsupport for * * * initiatives previously supported by [the Department] \nto * * * increase small business global competitiveness in \nbiotechnology.'' Nonetheless, using this language, I will continue to \nwork closely with the administration to maintain MBRI's vital services.\n  I am also pleased that the continuing resolution contains a provision \nwith the effect of making the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth \na full member of the National Textile Center University Consortium, and \ndirecting the Department of Commerce to provide financial support to \nthe University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to sustain its activities \nas a member of the National Textile Center. This will help to ensure \nthat the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth can meet the research \nneeds of Massachusetts textile companies and help revitalize textile \nmanufacturing in Massachusetts.\n  Over 30,000 people living in Massachusetts work in the textile \nindustry. The 1,000 textile companies located within Massachusetts are \nmostly small-to-midsized companies whose unique research needs have \nbeen well served by the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. I am \nconfident that the research activities at Dartmouth will be greatly \nenhanced by the designation of the University as a full member of the \nNational Textile Center University Consortium.\n  I must, however, express my disappointment that the Republicans who \ncontrol the Congress chose to provide for the inclusion of the \nUniversity of Massachusetts at Dartmouth in the National Textile Center \nthrough a ``direction'' to the Department of Commerce, rather than \nthrough the express language which Senator Kennedy and I had asked be \nincluded in the Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations Committee report. \nI am fully confident the Department of Commerce will provide to the \nUniversity of Massachusetts at Dartmouth the full $500,000 that is \ncontained in the Senate Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations Committee \nReport.\n  I am disappointed that, once again, Congress decided to severely \nunderfund the Advanced Technology Program, or ATP, at the Department of \nCommerce. The continuing resolution funds ATP at a level of $225 \nmillion. While this is a welcome increase from the level contained in \nthe Senate Commerce/State/Justice bill, this amount is significantly \nless than the President's budget request of $350 million.\n  ATP provides matching funds for high-risk, enabling technologies with \ncommercial potential. To date, ATP has had a significant impact upon \nthe development and successful marketing of new technologies by \nbusinesses in Massachusetts and across the Nation. More than 40 \nMassachusetts organizations have participated in 27 ATP projects. In \nMassachusetts alone, ATP has produced over $110 million in public-\nprivate partnership funding to enhance Massachusetts businesses that \nare on the cusp of technological innovation. Furthermore, the impact of \nthis program is one in which all Americans can take pride. ATP \ngenerates a return to the economy of $6 for every dollar of program \nfunding.\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  I am pleased that Congress has decided to increase funding for Amtrak \nover the amount that was approved in the Transportation appropriations \nbill recently sent to the President for signature. This will permit the \nMassachusetts portion of the Lake Shore Limited to continue to operate \nfor an additional 6 months. The Lake Shore Limited crosses \nMassachusetts from east to west with stops in Pittsfield, Springfield, \nWorcester, Framingham and Boston. Saving this train is especially \nimportant to the residents of the Berkshires and Western Massachusetts \nwho depend on the Lake Shore Limited as their sole source of intercity \npassenger rail service. I strongly opposed Amtrak's decision to \neliminate this service when the cuts were announced in August. We must \nnow confront the more serious challenge of finding a permanent solution \nto preserve Amtrak service throughout Massachusetts. I intend to work \ndiligently with Amtrak, the State, and congressional appropriators in \nthe next Congress to ensure that the Lake Shore Limited can continue \nits present level of service.\n\n  I am also pleased that the omnibus bill increases funding for \nAmtrak's Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, or NECIP, by $60 \nmillion over the amount that was approved in the transportation \nappropriations bill. The funds will finance much need track maintenance \nand upgrades, and the electrification of the Northeast Corridor. This \nadditional funding will greatly facilitate achievement of NECIP's goal \nto provide reliable, high-speed rail transport service between \nWashington, DC, and Boston, with the objective of achieving 3-hour \nservice between Boston and New York.\n\n\n                             SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  I am pleased that the Small Business Programs Improvement Act of \n1996, which is included in the omnibus appropriations bill, includes \nlegislation that I introduced earlier this year to end discrimination \nby the Federal Government against small business and also includes an \namendment I sponsored that will provide fishermen access to SBA's \ndisaster assistance program when fishing is prohibited because of a \ncommercial fishery failure or a fishery resource failure.\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\n  Last year, Congress passed the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act \nof 1995 which lowered the maximum guarantee rate for SBA's section 7(a) \nguaranteed loan program. The legislation also lowered the guarantee \nrate from 90 percent to either 75 or 80 percent depending on differing \ncircumstances, for SBA's Export Working Capital Program, which \nguarantees loans made by banks and other lenders who use loans to \nproduce goods and services to export. However, financing for business \nloans through the Export-Import bank are still guaranteed at 90 \npercent.\n  My legislation that is as part of the omnibus bill restores the 90 \npercent guarantee for the Export Working Capital Program to assure that \nsmall businesses do not lose export opportunities just because they \ncannot get financing from banks. This change will have a minimal impact \non SBA's credit subsidy rate and overall lending authority. However, it \nis crucial to small business exporters who need better access to \nfinancing. At a time when exports are a key component of continued \neconomic growth, increasing the SBA guarantee will increase the amount \nof small business exports--which in turn will create jobs in \nMassachusetts and across the Nation.\n  This legislation also includes an amendment which will provide \nfishermen access to disaster assistance under section 7(b)(2) of the \nSmall Business Act's disaster assistance program if fishing is \nprohibited because of ocean conditions or a commercial fishery failure. \nMost fishermen are individual small business owners and consequently \nare very susceptible to severe economic loss or even economic failure \nin the event of fishery closures or declines. Fishing is a capital \nintensive industry composed primarily of individually owned fishing \nvessels. These small businesses are financially incapable of enduring \neven a short term fisheries closure.\n\n  This amendment allows the Administrator of the SBA, after the \nSecretary of Commerce has declared a commercial fishery failure or a \ncommercial fishery disaster, to provide fishermen access to disaster \nassistance. I know how important it will be to helping maintain the \ncommercial fishing heritage in Massachusetts, and it is for that reason \nI believed it was essential to include such a provision in this \nlegislation.\n  The decline in the groundfish stocks off the coast of Massachusetts, \nand the subsequent Federal restrictions on fishing in Georges Bank, \nhave resulted in significant economic hardship for Massachusetts \nfishermen. These problems in the fishing industry have driven many \nfishermen to the brink of economic demise. In many cases, having taken \nloans to purchase their fishing vessels, fishermen confronting a \nfishery collapse have lost their homes which they commonly use as \ncollateral for their vessel loans.\n  I believe that we need to continue to implement fishery conservation \nand rebuilding measures or the Massachusetts fishing industry will \ncease to exist. I believe the interim financial support the SBA can \noffer through disaster assistance will play an important role in \nkeeping commercial fishing alive in Massachusetts and all Coastal \nStates that from time to time experience the economic devastation \nassociated with a fisheries natural disaster.\n  This bill also improves and expands the Small Business Investment \nCompany Program which is crucial to the growth of small business and \nour economy. Small businesses need access to capital, and SBIC's have \ninvested $12 billion in over 75,000 small businesses and have helped to \ncreate one million new jobs. This bill increases the level of private \ncapital needed to obtain an SBIC license from SBA, requires experienced \nand qualified management for all SBIC's, requires diversification \nbetween investors and the management team and increases fees paid by \nSBICs which will reduce the credit subsidy rate.\n  I want to thank Small Business Committee Democratic Ranking Member \nSenator Bumpers and his staff, especially John Ball, for their \nassistance with this portion of the omnibus bill. I also would like to \nacknowledge the assistance of Chairman Kit Bond and his staff.\n\n\n                            LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. President, this bill includes funding for a number of important \nanti-crime programs. I am encouraged that it contains language \noriginally offered by Senator Lautenberg which will keep anyone who has \nbeen convicted of a domestic violence crime from owning a gun. I co-\nsponsored his legislation because simple common sense dictates that \nguns absolutely must be forbidden for those who abuse their spouses.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Block Grants Program provides funds to \nlocal communities to use as they deem necessary to reduce crime and \nenhance public safety. This allows localities to address community-\nspecific crime problems using solutions that they have developed with \nadded resources and flexibility. Due to Democrats' efforts, $523 \nmillion is contained in this legislation, $20 million more than \nprovided by the Republicans.\n  I am proud of the role I was able to play in passing the Community \nOriented Policing Services [COPS] Program in the 1994 crime bill. This \nprogram was developed to deploy 100,000 new police officers on the \nstreets of our Nation by the year 2000. This bill continues the \ncommitment to that program with funding of $1.4 billion.\n  Both the block grants and the COPS funding have been widely and \neffectively used in Massachusetts communities, and crime statistics as \nwell as local observation show that they are working to reduce crime. \nIt is vital that they be continued.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. President, I am heartened that, despite the best efforts by some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it has been possible \nto include at least a minimally adequate level of funding in this bill \nfor many key programs designed to aid this Nation's children. Democrats \nsuccessfully fought to add money to the bills produced by House \nRepublicans and the Senate Appropriations Committee. Unfortunately, the \namounts still are not what this Nation ought to be providing for most \nof these programs and I urge Congress next year to provide sufficient \nresources to ensure that a floor of decency and hope is provided for \nall children.\n  Head Start provides comprehensive development services for low-income \nchildren and families, emphasizing cognitive and language development, \nphysical and mental health, and parent involvement to enable each child \nto develop and function at his or her highest potential. I support full \nfunding for this prevention program because it is cost effective--for \nthe price of a single space in a juvenile detention facility, we can \nprovide a full-day, full-year Head Start experience for five young \npeople. Children that participate in Head Start are more likely to \ngraduate from high school, earn more, and commit fewer juvenile crimes. \nThat is why I supported the President's 1997 request of $3.98 billion \nand am glad that due to Democrats' efforts, we will approve that \namount, which is $381 million more than the amount originally approved \nby the Republicans.\n  The Summer Youth Jobs Program offers work experience, supportive \nservices, and academic enrichment to economically disadvantaged youth, \nages 14 to 21. This important program addresses the severe problems \nfacing out-of-school youth in communities with high poverty and \nunemployment. Cities and towns in Massachusetts depend on it, and I am \nglad it will be funded at $871 million, the President's request--an \namount that is $246 million more than provided by the Republicans.\n\n\n                    HEALTH/HUMAN SERVICES/EMPLOYMENT\n\n  The National Institutes of Health [NIH] is the world's leading \nbiomedical research institution. Our investment in NIH's research saves \nlives and reduces health care costs while creating jobs and economic \ngrowth in a global economy. In recent years, this research has produced \nmajor advances in the treatment of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and \nmental illness that have helped thousands of American families. NIH \nsupports over 50,000 scientists at 1,700 universities and research \ninstitutes across the United States. I am glad that funding for NIH is \nincreased by $819 million over fiscal year 1996, a 6.5-percent \nincrease, bringing fiscal year 1997 funding to $12.7 billion, which is \n$332.6 million more than provided by the Republicans.\n  The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provides funds to States to \nmeet a broad range of enhanced, wrap-around health services, including \npersonal health services; general population-wide health services, such \nas\n\n[[Page S12142]]\n\nscreening; family support services; and integrated systems of care. \nAbout 16 million women, infants, children, adolescents and children \nwith special health care needs will be served in 1997. Due to \nDemocrats' efforts, $681 million is approved, which is $2.9 million \nmore than provided by the Republicans.\n  The Substance Abuse Block Grant provides funds on a formular basis to \nStates to support alcohol and drug abuse prevention, treatment, and \nrehabilitation services. Due to Democrats' efforts, this program will \nreceive $1.3 billion, which is $125 million more than provided by the \nRepublicans.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] provides \nassistance to States to help low-income households meet the costs of \nhome energy. It is crucial to New England States including \nMassachusetts. States have great flexibility in how they provide \nassistance, which may include direct payments to individuals and \nvendors and direct provision of fuel. In this legislation, LIHEAP is \nfunded at the President's request level of $1.3 billion and includes \n$300 million in fiscal year 1996 advanced emergency funds. Due to \nDemocrats' efforts, we were able to save this program from the House \nRepublicans who eliminated it in their Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that this legislation does not \ninclude any funding for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program \n[HVRP], which has been authorized for fiscal year 1997 by both the \nSenate and House Veterans Committees at $10 million. HVRP is a \nsuccessful job placement program that has put 13,000 homeless veterans \nback to work. A sizeable proportion of homeless people in this country \nare veterans; this should not be the case. The HVRP Program helps \nveterans on public assistance become productive, tax-paying citizens. \nIt is so successful because HVRP provides grants to community-based \ngroups that employ flexible and innovative approaches to help homeless \nveterans reenter the work force.\n  Furthermore, HVRP is cost-effective. It is estimated that it only \ncosts $1,200 per person placed in a job, which is equal to the cost of \nunemployment for 1 month. HVRP succeeds in breaking the cycle of \npoverty and homelessness by giving people the ability to work their way \nout. Instead of giving handouts, this program gives veterans the tools, \nskills, and training they need to be productive members of society. As \na veteran of the Vietnam war, I believe that we owe this type of \nservice, among others, to the men and women who so honorably served our \ncountry.\n  In my home State of Massachusetts, the New England Shelter for \nHomeless Veterans has helped over 6,600 veterans since opening its \ndoors in 1990, and housed within the shelter is the Vietnam Veterans \nWorkshop, which is one of the community-based organizations that \nprovides job training and work placement. The program has trained over \n1,600 veterans, 72 percent of which are working citizens today. In the \nabsence of earmarked appropriations for the coming year, I hope that \nthe Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Labor will find \nsome discretionary money to fund this important program.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Labor-HHS title in the bill \ncontinues the Democrats' strong commitment to combat the AIDS epidemic. \nAfter 12 years of inaction and ignorance by Republican administrations, \nthis country has moved decisively into a new era in the fight against \nHIV-disease. Working with President Clinton, Health and Human Services \nSecretary Donna Shalala, and the director of national AIDS policy, \nPatsy Fleming, the Democrats in Congress have pushed for increases in \nthe Ryan White CARE Act of more than $200 million over last year's \nlevel. We have nearly tripled the money going to States and cities \naffected by the AIDS epidemic through the previously underfunded Ryan \nWhite Program, and we have renewed our pledge to the States that the \nFederal Government will take seriously the critical AIDS Drug \nAssistance Program. In calling for these increases, I was pleased to \nwork with the AIDS Action Committee in Boston and other groups across \nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts who serve on the front lines of the \nepidemic as care and service providers.\n  Caring for those already infected with HIV is only one piece of a \ncomprehensive national response to the AIDS epidemic. In this \nlegislation, we are finally providing enough funding to the Centers for \nDisease Control to undertake a serious campaign to prevent new \ninfections. Democrats on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue urged the \nappropriators to increase funding for the CDC's AIDS prevention \nprograms by nearly $33 million over last year's level to bring it to \n$617 million for fiscal year 97. And we are providing a substantial \nincrease to the National Institutes of Health for our top biomedical \nresearchers to redouble their efforts to find a cure for this dread \ndisease. We cannot set our sights lower than finding a cure to AIDS. To \nthat end, in this bill, we are committing nearly $1.5 billion to NIH \nresearch and retaining the Office of AIDS Research.\n\n  Mr. President, these funding levels are the clearest signal of the \nDemocrats' commitment to fight a war on AIDS--and not a war on people \nwith AIDS that characterized the Government's response during the \n1980's and early 1990's.\n\n\n                       FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AID\n\n  Turning to the foreign aid components of this bill, I think it is \nimportant to note that the overall funding is $500 million less than \nwhat the administration requested. This decrease will result in \nprogrammatic cuts nearly across the board, resulting ultimately in the \ndecreased ability of the United States to address global issues such as \nfamine, child nutrition, sustainable development and the environment. \nWith respect to the last of those, I am deeply concerned that the bill \nprovides only $35 million for the Global Environment Facility. This is \n$65 million below the President's request.\n  I am pleased that the omnibus bill incorporates the Humanitarian Aid \nCorridor Act which I cosponsored. This provision reaffirms the United \nStates' commitment to the safe arrival of all U.S. humanitarian aid. It \nalso provides $95 million in aid to Armenia, an increase of $10 million \nfrom the fiscal year 1996 level.\n  The bill also retains a provision, which I strongly supported, taken \nfrom the Senate-passed foreign aid bill, that would establish a new \nexchange program focused on legal reform in Vietnam. I would note that \nthe Senate voted to retain funding for this program by a vote of 56 to \n43. This program is in our long term interest; it is a means of \nbringing Vietnam into the larger international community while \nimparting our own values and norms, particularly in the economic arena.\n  As one who has cosponsored all of Senator Leahy's bills on landmines, \nI am pleased that there is a $10 million earmark for demining in this \nbill and a $5 million earmark for assistance to the victims of \nlandmines. There are over 100 million active, deadly landmines in 60 \ndifferent countries around the world, killing and maiming approximately \n26,000 people per year. Most victims are innocent children. These \nearmarks indicate the broad bipartisan support in Congress for devoting \nresources to clearing landmines, recognizing the integral role that de-\nmining plays not only in saving the lives of innocent civilians, but \nalso in the rebuilding of communities.\n  Mr. President, by far the most egregious part of this bill that \npertains to foreign aid is its treatment of international family \nplanning programs. I am saddened and at the same time outraged that the \nHouse Republicans, in an undisguised way, tried to do as much damage as \npossible to population assistance. Their actions are mean spirited, \npunitive, and short-sighted.\n  This bill provides that no fiscal year 1997 funds can be used for \npopulation assistance until July 1, 1997--a full 9 months after the \nfiscal year begins. Beginning in July, the program will be funded at a \nrate of 8 percent of the annual appropriation each month. Mr. \nPresident, this is ludicrous. No other program in this entire \nappropriations bill is crippled in this way, and the unwillingness of \nthe House Republicans to accept the Senate's position on family \nplanning programs is disgraceful.\n\n  Mr. President, their tactics are simply illogical. By severing funds \nfor family planning programs the Republicans are taking away the one \ntool that allows women in impoverished countries to choose not to have \nan abortion. Family planning does not mean abortion--it means quite the \nopposite. Those who continue to equate\n\n[[Page S12143]]\n\nthe two should take a minute to look at the facts. Statistics, across \nthe board, show that when women have access to family planning \nprograms, the incidence of abortion decreases. Those who continue to \nequate the two should also read the laws. Federal law prohibits the \nUnited States from funding abortions abroad. The U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development has strictly abided by that law. For the \nHouse Republicans to slash funding for international family planning \nprograms on the premise that they do not want U.S. tax dollars funding \nabortions can only be described as illogical and wholly unwarranted.\n  By denying people access to family planning worldwide by slashing \nfunding for those programs, there will be millions more unintended \npregnancies every year, close to a million infant deaths, tens of \nthousands of deaths among women and--let me emphasize to colleagues who \noppose permitting women to choose abortions in the case of unwanted \npregnancies--over one million more abortions.\n  These programs provide 17 million families worldwide the opportunity \nto responsibly plan their families and space their children. They offer \na greater chance for safe childbirth and healthy children, and avoid \nadding to the population problem that affects all of us.\n  I am unwavering in my conviction that international family planning \nprograms are in America's best interest. Funding for these programs is \nan investment in our future and an investment that will save the lives \nof thousands of women and infants. I will continue to fight for what is \nmoral. The House majority needs to start acting responsibly on an issue \nthat will affect generations to come.\n  On matters pertaining to foreign policy, the bill offers mixed news. \nIt provides $892 million for contributions assessed on the United \nStates as a result of its membership obligations to the United Nations \nand other international organizations. While this figure is an \nimprovement over the levels in the House-passed bill and the Senate-\nreported bill, it is still $110 million less than the administration's \nadjusted request. This means that the administration will lack the \nfunds to pay arrearages and that we will fall into greater debt at the \nUnited Nations. I strongly believe that we must press the United \nNations to make administrative, financial, and management reforms, but \ncontinued failure to pay our contributions will only serve to undercut \nour ability to achieve those reforms. The bill provides a somewhat more \nreasonable level for peacekeeping, $352.4 million, but, it, too, falls \nshort of the administration's adjusted request of $377 million.\n  With respect to funding for international exchanges, the bill \nprovides only $185 million. In the last 2 years, the Republican \nCongress has succeeded in cutting funds dramatically for exchange \nprograms. I believe that this is a mistake. Exchanges, particularly the \nFulbright program and other academic exchanges, are one of our most \neffective instruments of foreign policy.\n  I am pleased that at the end of the day, House and Senate negotiators \nagreed to provide the President with his adjusted request of $41.5 \nmillion for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The challenges in \nthe area of arms control and nonproliferation are increasing, \nnot decreasing in the more complicated world that pertains after the \nbreakup of the former Soviet Union. To make deep cuts in the ACDA \nbudget, as was contemplated by the Senate appropriators, would have \nseriously undermined our national security interests.\n\n\n                                DEFENSE\n\n  Providing a sufficient national defense is one of the bedrock \nresponsibilities of our Government to its people. I stand behind no \nMember of this institution in my commitment to an adequate defense. But \nI do not believe a gold-plated defense serves our Nation's interests, \nand I know without doubt that the tax dollars we spend for weapons and \narmies beyond those our armed services chiefs believe are necessary \nresult in shortchanging our people in other vital ways, both now and in \nthe future.\n  Despite a number of component decisions that appear to me to be \ncarefully considered and justified, the defense and national security \nportion of this omnibus bill demonstrates the inability of this \nRepublican-controlled Congress to make tough choices when it comes to \ndefense. While the budget negotiators used approximately $1 billion in \ndefense spending to offset antiterrorism efforts funded in this bill, \nthe bill still contains $9.3 billion more than the Pentagon's budget \nrequest. Illustrative of the flawed decisions that contributed to this \ndistressing overrun is the Ballistic Missile Defense Program. Certainly \none is not vulnerable to the charge of failing to prepare for a \nballistic missile threat by supporting the Pentagon's and \nadministration's request for $2.9 billion for their BMD effort. Indeed, \nI strongly support the vigorous research and development effort to \nenhance our technical capabilities to spot, track, intercept, and \ndestroy intercontinental ballistic missiles and their warheads, and I \nhave been a consistent supporter of programs to develop and field \ntheater ballistic missiles.\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans cannot recognize when they have had \nenough of a good thing. They insisted on spending an additional $885 \nmillion for ballistic missile defense.\n  The absence of the spending discipline with respect to defense and \nnational security that the Republicans adamantly insist be directed \ntoward domestic Government services is the cause of this legislation's \nsingle greatest flaw--an unsupported and unsupportably high aggregate \nappropriation for defense.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, the negotiators labored mightily. Thanks \nto the fortitude of President Clinton, his Chief of Staff, and other \nadministration negotiators, and Democratic congressional leaders and \nappropriators, this product passes the smell test, and manages to pass \nmuster. I voted for it, disappointed that it fails in so many ways to \nprovide what I believe our Nation should be providing, but cognizant \nthat it could have been far worse. That definitely is not the measure \nto which I believe we should aspire. But in the final days of the 104th \nCongress, I believe it is the best anyone could have expected. As we \nlook to November, we also look with great hopes to the 105th Congress \nand the opportunity it will afford to come to terms again with the way \nin which our budget reflects our national priorities and values. I hope \nwe will do better next time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12136-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12143-S12144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRS. JOHN AND WINONA VERNBERG\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, South Carolina has been dealt a \ndouble blow by the retirement of two leaders who have dedicated their \nprofessional lives to the public good. Drs. John and Winona Vernberg \nhave been the University of South Carolina's power couple in the areas \nof public health, science, and the environment.\n  This beautiful couple has been together for nearly 50 years and has \nbeen serving the public just as long. They met in the Navy Hospital \nCorps at the end of World War II, and embarked on stellar careers in \nacademia afterwards at Duke University and then at the University of \nSouth Carolina. John became a Guggenheim Fellow, both won Fulbright-\nHayes Fellows, both won the Russell Award for Research in Science and \nEngineering, both received the William S. Proctor Prize for Scientific \nAchievement, and Winona was named Woman of the Year in 1980 by the \nUniversity of South Carolina.\n  While their academic work has been top notch, they have not confined \ntheir activities to the classroom or laboratory. Winona became dean of \nthe School of Public Health at USC in 1978, and within a year it was \naccredited. She has made that school an active, leading institution.

Mr. President, passage of a Coast Guard \nreauthorization bill is a matter of vital importance to Oregon, \nparticularly to smaller communities on the Oregon coast. A strong Coast \nGuard presence is essential to safeguard the lives of fishermen, \nrecreational boaters, and all others who venture out into the frigid \nNorthwest waters.\n  Because of the cold temperature of Pacific Northwest waters, a delay \nin Coast Guard response time by even a few minutes could mean a matter \nof life and death to capsized boaters. For that reason, I worked with a \nbipartisan group of coastal State Senators to ensure Coast Guard \nstations would not be closed unless there are strong safeguards in \nplace to ensure maritime safety will not be diminished.\n  Specifically, under section 309 of the conference report, the \nSecretary of Transportation is prohibited from closing any Coast Guard \nmultimission small boat station unless the Secretary determines that \nclosure of a station will not diminish maritime safety in the area of \nthe station, taking into account water temperature and other local \nconditions.\n  This section also provides an opportunity for affected communities to \nhave a voice in any decision on a proposed station closure. The \nSecretary must provide an opportunity for public comment and hold \npublic meetings before closing any small boat station.\n  The Coast Guard stations in Oregon covered by section 309 are: Coos \nBay, Depoe Bay, Siuslaw River, Tillamook Bay, Chetco River, Yaquina \nBay, and Umpqua River.\n  Section 309 also contains a provision I authored to ensure that all \nsmall boat stations will have available at least one vessel capable of \nperforming ocean rescues. This provision was included to address a \nsituation that arose last summer when the Rogue River Sardet station \nnear Gold Beach was assigned a 20-foot vessel that was useless for \nperforming ocean rescues. Under my provision, all small boat stations, \nincluding seasonally operated facilities like the Rogue River Sardet, \nwill be guaranteed to have at least one vessel capable of performing \nocean rescues.\n  By including these provisions in the conference report, we are giving \nthe Coast Guard the tools needed to protect our citizens' lives and \nenhancing safety in the waters off Oregon's coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12144-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IN RECOGNITION OF MARIAN MCPARTLAND'S ``PIANO JAZZ\"\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Marian \nMcPartland's Piano Jazz, produced by the South Carolina Educational \nRadio Network. This Peabody Award-winning show has earned recognition \nfor its educational value and importance in promoting and preserving a \ndistinctly American art form--jazz.\n  Piano Jazz is National Public Radio's [NPR] longest running music \nseries and airs on over 250 NPR member stations nationwide. The series \nwas conceived in 1979 by the South Carolina Educational Radio Network. \nSouth Carolina Educational Radio took a considerable risk by launching \none of the first station-based, locally produced public radio programs \nto air across America.\n  The risk paid off. Serving South Carolinians for 17 years, the \nprogram is a showcase for many of jazz's greatest performances and \nartists, including Bobby Short, Mary Lou Williams, Dizzy Gillespie and \nWynton Marsalis, and has helped launch the careers of some lesser known \nmusicians as well.\n  The programs are hosted by Marian McPartland who blends informal but \ninformation packed conversation with improvisational performances. \nMcPartland has been honored by special performances of Piano Jazz at \nthe Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. In 1986, she also was inducted \ninto the International Association of Jazz Educators Hall of Fame.\n  The program has been recognized with many major awards for \nbroadcasting excellence, including the Peabody, Gabriel, Armstrong, \nOhio State and several New York International Radio Festival awards. In \nfact, the show's recordings are so valuable that both the Library of \nCongress and the Rogers & Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound of the \nNew York Public Library at Lincoln Center are preserving complete \ncollections of the series.\n  I hope this innovative and award-winning show is able to continue \nserving its broad and varied audience which includes older, established \njazz aficionados, as well as listeners 25 years old and under. From \nsenior citizens to seniors in high school, this program provides the \nbest of South Carolina Educational Radio network. Piano Jazz has been \nsuch a success because of the public's longstanding support. I hope the \npublic continues in this support so the show remains strong and \nprosperous.\n  In recognition of Piano Jazz, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to Marian McPartland, Henry Cauthen, president and \nfounder of the South Carolina Educational Radio Network, and Shari \nHutchison, the program's producer, for this tremendous and valuable \ncultural jewel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12144-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12144-S12146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on September 12, Secretary of State \nWarren Christopher personally asked the Senate majority leader to \nwithdraw the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] from consideration by \nthe Senate. The majority leader had scheduled a vote on the treaty on \nthat day. Obviously the administration did not believe the Senate would \nratify the agreement. As a result, we were not able to have the public \ndebate that, I believe, would have shown why the treaty was in such \ntrouble. Since the treaty could be resubmitted for consideration by the \nSenate, I believe it is important to submit for the Record a sampling \nof articles, editorials, and opinion editorials which outline the basis \nfor the case against the CWC.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 1996]\n\n                     A Treaty That Deserved to Die\n\n                              (By Jon Kyl)\n\n       An extraordinary thing happened in the Senate yesterday. \n     The proponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     surprisingly pulled the plug on their effort to obtain \n     immediate Senate approval of the treaty's ratification.\n       Last June, the advocates thought this treaty was all but \n     ratified. They had won a commitment for it to be brought up \n     for a vote in the last few weeks before the November \n     elections. They assumed, not unreasonably, that the treaty \n     would be seen as a motherhood and apple-pie proposition--\n     aiming as it does to ban these horrible weapons worldwide.\n       By any political analysis, this calculation should have \n     been right. But substantive analysis of the treaty's flaws \n     proved to be more powerful than superficial political \n     considerations.\n       That such serious deliberation could occur reflects great \n     credit on both the treaty's proponents and its opponents. In \n     particular, its champions largely refrained from portraying \n     themselves as the champions of the abolition of these weapons \n     and casting the other side as ``pro-poison gas.''\n       The opponents, however, made clear that they too are in \n     favor of the elimination of chemical weapons, including the \n     American stockpile. By law, the destruction will take place \n     with or without this convention. But they fear that under \n     present circumstances the treaty will not accomplish its \n     purpose and that it will do more harm than good.\n       First, the convention will not include many dangerous \n     chemical-weapons states,\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\n     notably Iraq, North Korea, Libya and Syria, which will not \n     become parties. Worse yet, American intelligence could not \n     reliably detect militarily significant cheating in countries \n     like Iran, Cuba, China and Russia that are likely to became \n     parties to the treaty.\n       Second, the convention would impose significant costs on \n     the American taxpayer and new, substantial burdens on \n     industries. It would, moreover, actually aggravate the \n     current, serious problem of chemical weapons proliferation. \n     This is true for several reasons.\n       The treaty prohibits restrictions on trade in chemicals \n     among its parties. It even requires them to transfer chemical \n     technologies to other treaty members. In other words, if the \n     United States and Iran were to ratify the convention, Teheran \n     would have a powerful claim, under the treaty's Article XI, \n     against American-led trade restrictions in the chemical \n     field.\n       This arrangement repeats the mistake made in the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty--the so-called Atoms for Peace \n     initiative--under which ostensibly peaceful technology is \n     provided to nations determined to divert it to proscribed \n     military purposes.\n       The treaty would also create a false sense of security, \n     probably increasing the dangers from these weapons. And it \n     will harm arms control and international law to enter into a \n     convention that everyone knows is going to be unverifiable \n     and ineffective. For all these reasons, the United States is \n     better off having no treaty than a seriously defective one.\n       This critique was sufficiently compelling that a number of \n     leading proponents acknowledged the serious flaws. Although \n     these advocates nonetheless content that the treaty was still \n     worth having, more than a third of the Senate concluded that \n     the convention was, at best, deeply flawed. At worst, it \n     would exacerbate the problem it was trying to fix.\n       As a result, the treaty's proponents realized that they \n     were going to lose. Let us hope that the serious discussions \n     we have had leading up to that decision will lead to \n     bipartisan support for constructive, sensible arms control \n     approaches for dealing with this scourge in the future.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 12, 1996]\n\n                             Reject the CWC\n\n       Opposition is mounting to the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     (CWC), which the Senate is expected to vote on today. While \n     most people--terrorists and lunatic dictators excepted--\n     regard chemical weapons with abhorrence and indeed would like \n     to see them banished from the face of the earth, the \n     unfortunate fact is that the CWC will do little to inhibit \n     their production and use by those who are sufficiently \n     unscrupulous. What will happen instead is that law-abiding \n     American businesses, both those who manufacture chemicals and \n     those who merely use them, will be subjected to an intrusive, \n     expensive and possibly unconstitutional international \n     regulatory regime.\n       For anyone interested in what the reporting procedures will \n     look like for users of chemicals covered under CWC--and that \n     includes companies from Starbucks to Revlon--the chart on the \n     opposite page should give an indication. Some might find that \n     it bears a more than passing resemblance to the chart \n     depicting Hillary Clinton's health care reform plan in all \n     its infinite variety.\n       An estimated 3,000 to 8,000 U.S. companies will be affected \n     by the CWC. That means they will be subject to warrantless \n     inspections with only 48 hours notice for an international \n     U.N.-style bureaucracy. Those most likely to be affected are \n     users of what the treaty calls Discrete Organic Chemicals \n     (DOCs). That includes not just the members of the Chemical \n     Manufacturers Association, but also companies in such \n     industries as automotive, food processing, biotech, \n     distillers, brewers, electronics, soap and detergents, \n     perfume--even manufacturers of ball point pens! While it may \n     seem a little far-fetched that international inspectors might \n     descend on the Bic factory forthwith, the burden of reporting \n     the use of chemicals will be severe. And this from the \n     administration that calls for ``smaller, less intrusive \n     government.''\n       And, of course, inspections, when they do occur, will be \n     golden opportunities for countries that engage in industrial \n     espionage against the United States--just as they will be for \n     those eager to learn because they harbor the notion of \n     developing their own chemical weapons industry. (Remember the \n     Iraqi scientist who boasted to representatives of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency how the Iraqis had gained \n     invaluable information on nuclear technology this way?)\n       Senators who plan to vote to ratify the treaty must ask \n     themselves whether they are ready to impose this kind of \n     burden on domestic companies for the sake of an elusive and \n     unrealistic goal. The list of distinguished experts in the \n     fields of defense and foreign policy who have denounced the \n     CWC as ineffectual, unverifiable and certainly not global, \n     since numerous outlaw nations like Libya and Iraq will not \n     sigh, ought to give serious pause. A letter dated Sept. 9 to \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, urging him to ``reject \n     ratification of the CWC unless and until it is made genuinely \n     global, effective and verifiable,'' is signed among many \n     others by former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, former \n     National Security Advisor William Clark, former Secretary of \n     State Alexander Haig, former Secretary of Energy James \n     Herrington, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former \n     Attorney General Edwin Meese III, former Secretary of Defense \n     Donald Rumsfeld and former Secretary of Defense Casper \n     Weinberger. Weigh that list against the Clinton \n     administration, and it really shouldn't be a difficult \n     decision.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 1996]\n\n                         Chemical Weapons Fraud\n\n                          (By Lally Weymouth)\n\n       If the Clinton administration succeeds in persuading the \n     Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, the mere \n     fact of a new treaty will not help the United States combat \n     the spread of this weapon of mass destruction. Indeed, this \n     particular treaty may do the reverse: Some of the treaty's \n     opponents argue convincingly that it would actually increase \n     the trade in chemical agents with military application. \n     Certainly, it would facilitate the establishment of an \n     unnecessary international regulatory agency with unlimited \n     police powers over thousands of U.S. companies that produce \n     chemicals that could be used to make weapons.\n       Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) agrees with the majority staff of \n     the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations: Of course a \n     verifiable treaty that achieved real reductions in chemical \n     weapons would serve U.S. national security interests. But, \n     argues Kyl, this treaty isn't verifiable. Nor would it reduce \n     the chemical arsenals in countries U.S. officials deem most \n     likely to use such war tools against America and its allies: \n     Libya, Syria, North Korea and Iraq. Not surprisingly, these \n     rogue states have refused to sign on to the regime.\n       In fact, not one country of concern to the United States on \n     the chemical weapons front has ratified this convention: not \n     the People's Republic of China, Iran, Cuba or even Russia, \n     which has signed but not ratified and is said to possess one \n     of the most sophisticated chemical arsenals in the world.\n       When President Bush signed the chemical weapons treaty, he \n     did so with the understanding that Moscow would implement a \n     1990 U.S.-Russian bilateral agreement that called for both \n     countries to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles. Thus \n     far, however, Moscow has refused to implement this accord, \n     thus undermining the larger international convention.\n       One of the treaty's most dangerous features is that it \n     undercuts the work of the Australia Group, a collection of \n     Western countries that have an informal agreement banning the \n     transfer of potentially dangerous dual-use chemicals to non-\n     members. If ratified, the convention will end restrictions on \n     trade in deadly chemicals and chemical technology. Treaty-\n     signers, in fact, will have a right to demand both the \n     chemicals and the relevant technical information they need \n     from other signatories, who will have an obligation to \n     fulfill the requests.\n       This raises the issue of dual-use chemicals--those that, \n     while intended for peaceful use, can be used to make weapons. \n     If Cuba and Iran sign and then ratify the convention, they \n     can break out of the embargoes on chemicals the United States \n     has imposed on them.\n       Treaty proponents argue that the convention would enable \n     the United States to gather intelligence on other countries' \n     chemical weapons programs. But Sen. Kyl calls such benefits \n     ``marginal'' and says, ``It's not worth the price.''\n       If the treaty is ratified, moreover, the United States will \n     have to pick up a considerable part of the setup costs of a \n     massive new international regulatory body in the Hague. This \n     superagency would be empowered to subject U.S. businesses to \n     routine or ``challenge'' inspections of sites that allegedly \n     might contain chemical weaponry or its key ingredients.\n       A challenge inspection would be undertaken merely upon the \n     request of a member. The CWC gives any ratifier the right to \n     ask for an arbitrary inspection of a private facility--\n     anytime, anywhere; the ratifier merely has to allege that \n     deadly chemicals might be on the premises. The treaty \n     requires that ``the inspected . . . party shall be under the \n     obligation to allow the greatest degree of access.'' \n     According to the implementing legislation for CWC, it would \n     be ``unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to permit \n     entry or inspection.\n       The inspection teams that will enter U.S. plants if this \n     convention is ratified could have representatives from states \n     such as France and Japan, for example, that practice \n     industrial espionage. Ironically, Washington also will have \n     to foot some of the bills for these inspections, which \n     experts believe may violate the constitutional rights of U.S. \n     companies and citizens.\n       Lt. Gen. James A. Williams, a former director of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency, has written to Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott warning that ``the opportunity for unfettered \n     access to virtually every industrial facility in this \n     country, not merely the pharmaceutical and chemical plants, \n     would make most foreign intelligence organizations very \n     happy.''\n       American companies also would have to provide continuing, \n     time consuming reports. While arms control officials told the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee that at least 3,000 U.S. \n     firms that use, process or consume chemicals would have to \n     make so-called ``data declarations'' under CWC, the majority \n     staff of the committee contends that as many as 8,000 \n     companies--firms that manufacture anything from dyes to \n     pigments to insecticides--could be forced to contend with \n     this burdensome load of paperwork.\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\n       Negotiations on the treaty began under President Reagan; \n     the accord was seen then as a verifiable, global ban on \n     chemical weapons. As time passed, the purposes changed. Arms \n     control experts concluded that constitutional rights clashed \n     with the need to verify. There would have to be a compromise. \n     The balance that was struck, according to Kyl, adversely \n     affects the United States: While the convention doesn't catch \n     and punish many countries that have secret chemical weapons \n     programs, it ends up imposing heavy costs and constitutional \n     burdens on the United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 1996]\n\n                          Peace Through Paper\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       The Senate is about to vote on ratification of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. Senate Democrats maneuvered--by \n     threatening to filibuster the defense authorization bill--to \n     have the vote just before the election. The timing fits the \n     political strategy. And the strategy is emotional black-mail: \n     Who is going to vote against a treaty whose lofty goal is to \n     eradicate chemical weapons from the face of the earth?\n       Who? Every senator should. The goal is indeed lofty, but \n     the treaty that purports to bring it about is a fraud.\n       The fatal problem with the chemical weapons treaty is that \n     it is unverifiable. Sure, it has elaborate inspection \n     procedures. And an even more elaborate U.N. bureaucracy to \n     oversee them. No treaty is complete without that nowadays. As \n     a result, the treaty will be perfectly able to detect the \n     development of chemical weapons by free, open governments \n     (like ours) that have never used and have no intention of \n     using chemical weapons. (Indeed, the United States now is \n     actively destroying its Cold War stockpile.)\n       And the treaty will be perfectly useless at preventing \n     development of chemical weapons by closed societies such as \n     Iran, Iraq (which in 1988 blatantly violated the current \n     treaty banning the use of chemical weapons), Libya, Syria and \n     North Korea. These are precisely the places where chemical \n     weapons are being made today for potential use against the \n     United States or its allies.\n       How can anyone seriously defend this treaty as verifiable \n     when, even as the Senate votes, Iraq--subject to a far more \n     intrusive inspection regime than anything contemplated under \n     the CWC--nonetheless is going ahead with its chemical (and \n     nuclear and biological) weapons programs right under our \n     noses? When North Korea, signatory and subject to all the \n     fancy inspection provisions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation \n     Treaty, went blithely ahead and with impunity made nuclear \n     bombs?\n       And these are violations by countries that had submitted to \n     intrusive international inspection. Yet we already know that \n     Libya, North Korea and Syria have not agreed to sign the CWC \n     and thus will be subject to no chemical weapons inspection at \n     all! Not to worry. The treaty will definitively banish the \n     threat of chemical attack by Australia.\n       All arms control treaties have problems with verification. \n     But with chemical weapons, the problem is inherently \n     insoluble. Consider the (nuclear) START treaties with Russia: \n     hard to verify, but at least they involve fixed numbers of \n     large objects--missiles--with no other use and not that hard \n     to find. Chemical weapons, on the other hand, involve small \n     quantities of everyday stuff that is impossible to find.\n       How small? The sarin nerve gas use for the Tokyo subway \n     attack was manufactured by the Aum Supreme Truth cult in a \n     single room.\n       How everyday? As Jeane Kirkpatrick and Dick Cheney and many \n     others pointed out in a letter to the Senate majority leader \n     opposing the CWC, the treaty does not even prohibit the two \n     chemical agents that were employed to such catastrophic \n     effect in World War I and that are the backbone of Iran's \n     current chemical arsenal--phosgene and hydrogen cyanide. Why? \n     Because they are too widely used for commercial purposes.\n       All right, you say (and many senators up for reelection are \n     privately thinking): So the CWC is useless. What harm can it \n     do? The harm it--like all panaceas--does is induce a false \n     sense of security.\n       Treaties are not feel-good devices. They are not \n     expressions of hope. They are means of advancing peace by \n     putting real constraints on the countries that pose threats.\n       Syria has put chemical weapons on the tips of its Scud \n     missiles. Iraq is rebuilding its arsenal. Libya is \n     constructing the largest underground chemical weapons plant \n     on the planet. And what are we doing? Passing a treaty that \n     will allow international agents to inspect up to 8,000 \n     American businesses, searching and seizing without warrant.\n       The logic is more than comical. It is dangerous. The \n     chemical weapons treaty is part of a larger administration \n     scheme to build a new post-Cold War structure of peace \n     through the proliferation of paper. Yesterday, a test ban \n     treaty. Today, chemical weapons. Tomorrow, a biological \n     weapons convention and strengthening the ban on anti-\n     ballistic missiles.\n       The conceit of this administration is that it is following \n     in the footsteps of Truman and Marshall in the 1940s, \n     building a structure of peace after victory in a great war. \n     In fact, they are following in the footsteps of Harding and \n     Coolidge, who spent the 1920s squandering the gains of World \n     War I on the false assurances of naval disarmament treaties \n     and such exercises in high-mindedness as the Kellogg-Briand \n     Pact.\n       The Clinton administration calls the chemical weapons \n     treaty ``the most ambitious arms control regime ever \n     negotiated.'' Its ambition is matched only by that of the \n     Kellogg-Briand Pact, also an American brainchild, also \n     promulgated to great international applause. (Frank Kellogg, \n     Coolidge's secretary of state, won the Nobel Peace Prize for \n     it.) All parties to that piece of paper pledged the \n     renunciation of war forever. The year was 1928. Germany and \n     Japan were signatories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/01/senate-section/article/S12144-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-36\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the Convention \non International Maritime Organization, Treaty Document No. 104-36, \ntransmitted to the Senate by the President on October 1, 1996; and I \nask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; \nthat it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on \nForeign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's \nmessage be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \naccept, amendments to the Convention on the International Maritime \nOrganization, signed at Geneva, March 6, 1948 (the IMO Convention). The \namendments were adopted on November 7, 1991, and November 4, 1993, by \nthe Assembly of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) at its \nseventeenth and eighteenth sessions. I also transmit, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State \ndescribing the amendments, their purpose and effect.\n  The United States is the world's largest user of international \nshipping. These amendments strengthen the International Maritime \nOrganization's capability to facilitate international maritime traffic \nto carry out its activities in developing strong maritime safety and \nenvironmental protection standards and regulations. The IMO's policies \nand maritime standards largely reflect our own. The United States pays \nless than 5 percent of the assessed contributions to the IMO.\n  The 1991 amendments institutionalize the Facilitation Committee as \none of the IMO's standing committees. The Facilitation Committee was \ncreated to streamline the procedures for the arrival, stay and \ndeparture of ships, cargo and persons in international ports. This \ncommittee effectively contributes to greater efficiencies and profits \nfor the U.S. maritime sector, while assisting U.S. law enforcement \nagencies' efforts to combat narcotics trafficking and the threat of \nmaritime terrorism.\n  The 1993 amendments increase the size of the IMO governing Council \nfrom 32 to 40 members. The United States has always been a member of \nthe IMO governing Council. Increasing the Council from 32 to 40 Member \nStates will ensure a more adequate representation of the interests of \nthe more than 150 Member States in vital IMO maritime safety and \nenvironment protection efforts worldwide.\n  The 1991 amendments institutionalize the Facilitation Committee as \none of the IMO's main committees. The 1993 amendments increase the size \nof the Council from 32 to 40 members, thereby affording a broader \nrepresentation of the increased membership in the IMO's continuing \nadministrative body.\n  Support for these amendments will contribute to the demonstrated \ninterest of the United States in facilitating cooperation among \nmaritime nations. To that end, I urge that the Senate give early and \nfavorable consideration to these amendments and give its advice and \nconsent to their acceptance.\n                                                  William J.
