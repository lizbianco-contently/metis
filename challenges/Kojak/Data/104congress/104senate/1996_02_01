Mr. President, someday, perhaps a year from now, we will \nfinally achieve genuine welfare reform to change welfare from the way \nwe have known it, but it will not happen today. Indeed, it may not \nhappen this year, not while President Clinton continues to brandish his \nveto pen against all efforts to clean up the welfare mess, to encourage \nwork, and to help people who need assistance to get off welfare and get \na job.\n  His first veto of welfare reform received little notice because it \nwas part of our larger Balanced Budget Act. That legislation was long \nand complicated, touching upon many different programs. So the \nPresident was able to block welfare reform in the process of opposing \nother provisions in the bill.\n  His second veto of welfare reform likewise received scant attention \nbecause much of the country was distracted by the blizzard of 1996. It \nwas vetoed late at night, and there was not much press coverage because \nmost of official Washington was not paying attention. They were still \nconcentrating on the overall budget agreement.\n  Now the President has promised a third veto of welfare reform, and he \nhas done so in a way that blatantly violates his previous pledges on \nthis issue. In an interview that appeared in yesterday's, that is \nWednesday's, Washington Post, the President made clear that his earlier \nendorsement of the welfare reform bill that passed the Senate last fall \nis no longer operative.\n  The bill that passed the Senate was H.R. 4, which this body approved \non September 19, 1995, by a strongly bipartisan vote of 87 to 12. It \nsailed through \n\n[[Page S672]]\nthe Senate with the strong personal support of the President. But that \nwas then, and now I guess his position has changed, based on this \ninterview in the Washington Post. This is what Ann Devroy and John \nHarris reported in the Post interview:\n\n       On welfare reform, Clinton said he has not given up hope \n     that a compromise bill acceptable to him will be approved \n     this year. But he set a new price for his signature on a \n     welfare system overhaul, asserting that the Senate proposal \n     he indicated he would support last fall will have to be \n     changed for him to support it now. He called on Republicans \n     to send him a revised bill that would contain fewer cuts in \n     funding for food stamps, provide child care for welfare \n     recipients who work and preserve current protections for \n     disabled children.\n\n  This is another example of the President's acknowledged skill at \npackaging and repackaging his positions, but it is a far cry from what \nwas actually involved in the legislation that we considered.\n  The truth, as every Member of the Senate knows, is that the bill we \npassed last September was a compromise. A lot of work was put into that \nlegislation by members of the committees involved, including the \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. That is why it gathered 87 \nvotes on the Senate floor. It is why few Senators on both sides of the \naisle opposed it.\n  The truth is that the Senate-passed bill did provide additional \nfunding for child care for welfare recipients. It earmarked $1 billion \nper year for child care assistance, and it provided another $3 billion \nover the next 4 fiscal years for child care in certain States. In sum, \nthat was a few billion more than what President Clinton had called for \nin his budget.\n  The truth is that the Senate-passed bill provided a base amount of \n$16.8 billion in welfare funding in each of the next 5 years; an \nadditional $879 million for States with higher growth; a $1.7 billion \nrevolving fund for special borrowing; additional funds as incentive \ngrants to States which make the most progress in getting persons off \nthe welfare rolls; a $800 million emergency assistance fund; a \ncontingency fund of up to $1 billion; $150 million for second chance \nhomes for unwed mothers and more.\n  The truth is that by returning control of public assistance to the \nStates, the Senate-passed bill did not weaken protections for disabled \nchildren. On the contrary, 87 Members of the Senate, from both sides of \nthe political aisle, voted to give flexibility to States in meeting the \nneeds of those children.\n  The truth is that the Senate-passed bill required an 80-percent \nmaintenance of effort--80-percent maintenance of effort--by the States \nto allay any fears that benefits to the needy might be recklessly \nreduced.\n  In fact, we made so many changes, we put in so much more money, that \nit was just marginally possible for this Senator to even vote for the \nbill. But it was a compromise; it was a step in the right direction, \nand, like a lot of others on both sides, I went along with it.\n  But, based on what we are hearing from the administration, all that \ngoes down the memory hole. The President is now upping the ante, \ndemanding that the Congress give him a version of welfare reform not \nworthy of the name. His goal in doing so is obvious. Having campaigned \non a promise to end welfare as we know it, he has done his utmost to \nend welfare reform as we know it, substituting in its place a gutted, \ntoothless, costly sham.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned--and I am certain I speak for a \nnumber of other Members of Congress--that just cannot happen. We are \nnot going to betray our promise to the American people in order to get \nthe President's signature on a welfare bill.\n  There is nothing worse than for Congress to say, as we have too many \ntimes in the past, that we have accomplished something with a bill, \ngiving it a glorious sounding title, when there is no substance to it--\nand when there will be no glorious results when it is actually \nimplemented.\n  There are some things worse than no welfare reform. Phony reform is \nthe main one. A welfare bill that leaves AFDC as an entitlement is \nphony reform. A welfare bill that keeps control of welfare in \nWashington in the Federal bureaucracy, in my opinion, is phony reform. \nA welfare bill that makes dependency more attractive by providing more \nbenefits to more people is not genuine reform.\n  The President's latest comments on this subject present us with a \nstark choice between false reforms, misleading action, and nothing at \nall. He is probably hoping that, rather than return to the voters \nempty-handed, we will collude with him to give the public the \nappearance of reform, that we all declare victory, and it will be years \nbefore the taxpayers figure out they have been duped by what is called \nwelfare reform.\n  I do not believe the majority in Congress is going to play that game. \nWe are not going to break faith with the American people on this issue. \nIf welfare reform has to wait until next year, I guess it will be worth \nthe wait. If welfare reform must wait until the veto pen has been \nremoved from the President, then so be it. But that delay is not \nnecessary.\n  We can get genuine welfare reform. It can be one that will be \nsupported in a bipartisan way, and it can be one that will be good for \nthe people who now depend on the system and are looking for a way out. \nBut that will take real cooperation. We must make sure that whatever we \ndo is genuine reform that will produce the results we promised. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S671-6", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S672-S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1541, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1541) to extend, reform, and improve \n     agricultural commodity, trade, conservation, and other \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Craig (for Leahy-Lugar) amendment No. 3184, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate is equally divided between \nnow and 11:25.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in beginning debate on S. 1541, the farm \nbill, let me just say that it is very important to farmers all over the \ncountry who have been notifying Senators and Members of the House that \nthey want, certainly, a degree of certainty before they get into the \nfields to plant.\n  They would like, as a matter of fact, to see the Congress at work on \nthis vital legislation. In response to that, the distinguished majority \nleader has, in fact, called us to that cause today, as Senators are \naware.\n  This is a very important day. It is extraordinarily important \nlegislation for all of America. Farmers want to know what is going to \nhappen now. Hopefully, the Senate will provide that guidance through \nconstructive action to completion and passage of this legislation \ntoday.\n  Over a year ago, at the beginning of the 1995--and now 1996--farm \nbill debate, I posed 53 questions about future agricultural policy in \nthis country. The answers to those questions made it clear that a \nstatus quo farm policy was not a good idea. S. 1541, the legislation \nbefore us today, represents a bold new direction. It answers the 53 \nquestions that I asked and that other Senators posed in a broad review \nof farm policy in this country.\n  There were five basic reasons to support Senate bill 1541.\n  First of all, a good reason to support it is its simplicity of \napproach. Traditional farm policy is so arcane that even many U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture officials can barely comprehend all of its \ncomplexity. The bill we consider today offers a straightforward, \ncommonsense policy.\n  Second, the bill offers certainty. Farmers who sign contracts will \nknow their future payments for the next 7 years. Taxpayers, \nimportantly, will know precisely what money is going to be spent during \nthe next 7 years and that the budget savings we have already debated in \nthis Chamber are certain.\n  That is especially important, Mr. President, because as you will \nrecall, \n\n[[Page S673]]\nwe debated a farm bill that has just expired, estimating that the \ntaxpayers' expense would be about $41 billion. In fact, the final cost \nto the bill was close to $57 billion due to all the contingencies, \nincluding the weather and foreign trade and demand. In this particular \ninstance it was important for those of us who favor a balanced budget \napproach to know precisely how much was for agriculture, and for \nfarmers to know precisely the payments that would come to them.\n\n  Third, the bill does provide very substantial savings for taxpayers. \nWith this bill, agriculture has done its part to help balance the \nFederal budget in 7 years. Senate bill 1541 will reduce Federal \nspending by about $4.6 billion over the 7 years from a new baseline \nwhich reflects actual market prices in this country.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that baseline recognizes that outlays, as \nexpenditures by taxpayers, to the farm community will be $7 to $8 \nbillion less than earlier anticipated largely because market prices for \nmany of the farm programs are very high this year and, therefore, the \nnormal deficiency payments do not kick in under those formulas.\n  The fourth reason for supporting this legislation is its market \norientation. Farmers' payments will be the same even if they plant \nalternate crops. As a matter of fact, they will make planting decisions \nbased on market forces, on the signs of prices in the market. Today \nplanting decisions affect eligibility for Government payments, and \nsubsidies have driven much of the business planning of many farmers.\n  Under Senate bill 1541, farmers will have full planting freedom, \nthus, the label given to this act, the ``freedom to farm,'' the ability \nto manage your land, to make decisions for the market. We will end, in \nfact, Federal Government production controls. That is an important step \nforward all by itself.\n  A fifth reason for support is that farmers support Senate bill 1541. \nThis long-term plan for U.S. agriculture has been endorsed by a wide \nrange of farm groups. National groups such as the American Farm Bureau \nand the National Corn Growers and State groups such as the Kansas Wheat \nGrowers and the North Dakota Grain Growers have given strong \nendorsement to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has approved this bill once already as a \npart of the Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately for our Nation, the \nPresident vetoed that act and thus vetoed the farm bill. That veto \ncreates a problem for U.S. agriculture. Since commodity support \nprograms were a part of the Balanced Budget Act, we are left with no \nworkable farm program for many crops, except for the outdated 1949 and \n1938 laws, which could cause price supports. For wheat, for example, \nfor those farmers who had allotments in that period of time almost 50 \nyears ago, those price supports could triple.\n  Now the Clinton administration confirms that implementing these old \nstatutes, the 1949 and the 1938 acts, could add $10 to $12 billion to \nthe cost of running farm programs for the 1996 crops alone. That is \nclearly intolerable. We have talked, Mr. President, about savings as a \npart of the Balanced Budget Act. Failure to enact this legislation \ncould mean that $10 to $12 billion in only 1 year alone would be added \nto the deficit.\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that the Congress and the President will \nbe ridiculed by the public for gridlock, for inactivity, for myopia, \ngiven the apparent crisis that lies immediately ahead of us. The new \nbill must be fiscally responsible.\n  Proposals to raise loan rates, as some of our colleagues want to do, \npotentially is a very expensive option. And some of our colleagues have \ncharged, in fact, that we have delayed writing a farm bill and that the \nSenate bill 1541 was written without full participation, without \nhearings.\n  Mr. President, Congress did produce a farm bill. It passed two Houses \nand went as a part of the Balanced Budget Act to the President. \nPresident Clinton vetoed it, and only that veto has prevented timely \npassage of new farm laws.\n  Second, the Senate Agriculture Committee held thorough hearings. The \ncommittee held 15 farm bill hearings in 1995 involving 157 witnesses \nfrom all over our country. Additional and lengthy hearings were held on \nfarm legislation in the Budget Committee. Every conceivable approach to \nfarm policy was discussed in those hearings.\n  Much of the farm bill has, in fact, been developed in a bipartisan \nway. In July 1995, the Agriculture Committee of the Senate gave \npreliminary, but unanimous, approval to four titles of the farm bill. \nThey cover trade, farm credit, research, and rural development. Since \nthen, there have been further bipartisan efforts on a miscellaneous \ntitle and a conservation title.\n  Some of our colleagues have declined to be involved in the balanced \nbudget amendment consideration. They informed us in the Agriculture \nCommittee that they would not vote for the cuts required by the \nBalanced Budget Act. We were told that we would have to pass that act \nwith Republican votes alone in the committee, and we did so. If some \ncolleagues feel left out at this point, it is because they chose to be \nleft out. They were within their rights to take that option, but it is \nstrange now to hear complaints about a process that included 15 full \nhearings and very thorough debate before passage of the farm bill from \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  I suspect the real complaint is with the substance of the bill. It \ncalls for the end of Government planting controls. It calls for freedom \nto farm. It provides an entirely new outlook for American agriculture, \nwhich I find very exciting as a farmer, as somebody who has walked \nthrough this legislation not only as a legislator but as one who is \nsubject to it.\n  I will say, Mr. President, parenthetically, with the exception of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, I am the only farmer \non the committee, the only one that might be visibly affected by this \nlegislation and have some idea of how it actually works. So from that \nstandpoint, I have a sense of liberation about the process, which is \nshared, I might say, by farmers in the State of Ohio, the State of the \ndistinguished Chair, and Indiana, and, in large number, farmers in \nIowa, whom I have been visiting the last 2 days. They want action, and \nthat is why I am here as opposed to staying another day with friends in \nIowa with whom I have been visiting.\n  Fundamentally, a few of our colleagues do not want to reduce spending \non farm programs. That is their privilege, but most of us believe they \nare mistaken. Most farmers know that they, as well as other Americans, \nwill benefit from a balanced budget. They know as well that our Nation \nwill be stronger for that, and they know that S. 1541 defines exactly \nwhat the farm commitment is, and it is an acceptable commitment to farm \ngroups.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, S. 1541 is a bold departure from the past. \nIt is clearly a new direction. It will reduce Federal spending and \nFederal deficits with certainty. It will reform farm programs and give \nthem both certainty and much greater simplicity, and it will prepare \nU.S. agriculture for what promises to be a very exciting new century.\n  One of the great ironies of consideration of farm legislation during \nthe past year is that initially we talked in terms of Federal programs \nvery similar to the ones which we now have. As the Chair knows, for the \nlarge program crops--corn, wheat, cotton, and rice--target prices are \nestablished. If the market prices are below those target prices, \nfarmers may receive deficiency payments, the difference between the \ntwo, the target price and the market price, for the crop history on the \ncovered acreage they have in the plan for which they have signed. These \nare the so-called deficiency payments. Others would call them \nsubsidies. They have mounted up to very large totals in some years.\n  In this particular year of the farm bill, suddenly, export demand \ntook off in a very dynamic way. The Chinese changed from becoming \nexporters to very strong importers. That provided new opportunities for \nthe United States in Southeast Asia, but our traditional customers in \nEurope and in Japan come in for much stronger orders really across the \nborder. Cattle feeders and hog producers throughout this country have \ncontinued to feed large herds of livestock and, despite the rising \nprice of feed, have continued the size of those herds. \n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have a situation unlike any that I have seen in \nagriculture in the last generation in which clearly the price in the \nmarket went way above the target price and remains there. If a farmer \nwere to go into the futures market this morning and he was bold enough \nto know exactly what his crop was going to be for this year, the \nplanting of 1996 or 1997, a farmer could sell both crops for prices \nhigher than the target price for corn, for example. I addressed this \nissue, as I mentioned to the Chair a moment ago, in Iowa in the last \nfew days, with farmers saying, ``What should we do? How much fertilizer \nshould we buy, or other inputs, for our crop?''\n\n  My advice has been to take a look at the markets, take a look at the \nfutures prices. Note that we are going to have strong demand for corn, \nfor wheat, for soybeans, and at least it would appear for cotton for \nsome time to come. Freedom to farm means that, that you plant for the \nmarket. I would advise farmers to do that.\n  Farmers, being prudent people, say, ``That is clearly the decision we \nare going to make anyway, but at the same time, we want to know what \nyou legislators are going to do sort of postmortem, after those \ndecisions. If you come back then and say, `We really didn't mean \nfreedom to farm. As a matter of fact, we wanted the same old status quo \nlegislation with all of the controls, the set-asides, the planting \ndecisions made in Washington,' if, in fact, that is what happens weeks, \nmonths, years down the trail after gridlock finally is gone and \npolarization is less intense, what would be the penalties for us if, in \nfact, we made sound decisions for our farms and for our country, for \nthe general export thrust of a country that exports a great deal more \nin agriculture than it imports and with a balance of payments that \ngrows stronger every year?''\n  That is the fundamental question. It is not that farmers need market \nsignals. They are there and abundantly clear what we ought to be doing. \nThey are worried about being undercut by legislators who are not \nfarmers, who really do not understand what is going on out there but \npurport to do so in behalf of farmers, and by a President who has \napparently, through the Secretary of Agriculture, threatened to veto \nalmost all legislation that bears some idea of freedom to farm.\n  So this is why we are having this debate today to bring some \ncertainty to the field. We are having it in the context, as the Chair \nknows, as the distinguished Senator from Mississippi has already \nannounced, that we are going to have a cloture vote at 1:30 p.m. Why \nwould we already understand we are going to have a cloture vote? It is \nbecause the distinguished Democratic leader, in conversations with \nSenators, has indicated that there is strong opposition on his side of \nmany Senators to this legislation, such strong opposition that it might \nlead to extended debate, and, therefore, the cloture vote at 1:30 is \nvery important.\n  If cloture is established, we are going to have farm legislation, \nprobably today, but whenever the cloture procedure runs out. If we are \nnot successful, as the Chair knows, another cloture vote will be held \non freedom to farm, plus additional amendments that have been offered \nby the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Leahy. And, hopefully, we will bring debate to a conclusion in \nsome orderly way on that proposition, in the event my legislation that \nI have introduced and am debating this morning should not pass.\n  In any event, this is a very important day for agriculture and for \nAmerica. It is a privilege to lay before the Senate, I believe, \nremarkable legislation that I hope will find favor with the Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Mississippi, \nsuch a valued and important member of our committee and, in his own \nright, chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he has 3 \nminutes, 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the remaining time to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, for yielding to me. I urge the \nSenate to approve this Agricultural Market Transition Act. We are \nconfronted with an emergency. It is essential that farmers know \nimmediately what the farm programs for this crop year will be. Farmers \nare unable to make the decisions that must be made about what to plant \nor how much to plant, with the current uncertainty of this year's farm \nlaw.\n  If we fail to pass a new farm bill, wheat and feed grain farmers will \nbe operating under the provisions of the 1938 and 1949 agricultural \nacts. There will be no rice program. This forces the Secretary of \nAgriculture to announce a new rice program under the authority he has \nunder the 1948 Commodity Credit Corporation. And while cotton, peanut, \nand sugar titles of the previous farm bill would continue for the 1996 \ncrop-year, a great deal of confusion and possible economic hardship for \nmany of our Nation's farmers could result.\n  The Department of Agriculture has even suggested that this chaos \ncould add $10 to $12 billion to the cost of farm programs this year. \nThis is just not acceptable for either farmers or the taxpayers.\n  So I urge the Senate to act favorably on this cloture vote so we can \nhave a vote on the bill, S. 1541, to continue the commitment to \nprotecting public and private investments in production agriculture and \nin rural America.\n\n  I am pleased that the bill includes, with the support of the \nchairman, the Marketing Loan Program that has proved so workable and \nhelpful in the rice and cotton areas. There are also other provisions \nthat have been tried and tested and proven to be helpful to your effort \nto compete effectively in the international marketplace with our strong \nagriculture sector.\n  Our farmers are ready to go to work, but they need to know what the \nprograms are going to be so they can make rational and thoughtful \ndecisions. The Government's role in providing stability and an orderly \ntransition to a market economy in agriculture is very important and \nwill be carried forward and implemented in this bill. It does it fairly \nand with a clear-cut commitment to curb spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can get a vote on this \nbill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand we are technically out of time \non the farm bill, but I see no other Senators seeking the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allotted the remaining time before \nthe recess in order to make remarks about S. 1541, the farm \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe S. 1541, the underlying \nlegislation, which is the subject of discussion in the cloture motions \ntoday, presents a very important opportunity for the Senate to move \nforward in a bipartisan way to shape policy in behalf of our Nation's \nfarmers and consumers. This modified freedom-to-farm legislation offers \nreform, opportunity, flexibility and predictability in a fiscally \nresponsible way and with the growing support of Members on both sides \nof the aisle and, I would say most important, growing support from the \npeople in America who are looking to the Congress to tell them what the \nFederal farm policy will be.\n  All of us, as Senators, should understand that farmers need to know \nwhat the Federal policy will be. For better or worse, the Federal \nGovernment has been a very large part of decisions made by farmers in \ndeciding what to plant, where to plant, and how to plant. We know that \na new, long-term plan is far better than an extension of the current \nlaw. We know that if we do not move this legislation, the alternative \nis delay, confusion, frustration, continuation of current law, or \nperhaps even the reinstitution of long-outdated policies still on the \nbooks.\n  We also should know, based on the discussions that have gone on here, \nthat there is only one vehicle that has \n\n[[Page S675]]\nbeen under the light, has been scrutinized, has met the test, and can \nbring a legislative bipartisan consensus. Simply put, I find no \nconstituency for continuing the status quo. We cannot leave the Federal \nfarm programs in the quandary in which they now find themselves. \nFarmers do not want it. Fiscal conservatives do not want it. Reformers \ndo not want it. Urban Members who have been critical of the current \nfarm programs, certainly they should not want it.\n  This process is terribly difficult under normal circumstances, but it \nis especially difficult when working under balanced budget constraints. \nIt is even more difficult when the comprehensive proposal which has \nsurvived this legislative marathon represents significant change \nbecause change produces political anxiety. There is no question that \nthis will be a very difficult measure, but it has been through the \nprocess and it has reached a consensus that I believe is absolutely \nessential.\n  I offer my thanks and congratulations, on behalf of farmers in my \nState and all those of us who want to put this country on a path \ntowards a balanced budget, to the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, to Chairman Lugar, to Senator Grassley, particularly to \nSenator Leahy, the ranking member on the agriculture authorizing \ncommittee, and the others who have worked under difficult circumstances \nto find a bipartisan consensus for which the Senate now has an \nopportunity to move, to a post-cloture scenario that can get a bill to \nthe President's desk.\n  I know the majority leader and Chairman Lugar and their staffs have \nlabored tirelessly to find a bipartisan solution and I applaud them for \ntaking decisive action to answer the pressing need to produce a farm \nbill for the future.\n  I regret that some remain opposed to this legislation. I believe that \nthe stage was set during consideration of the budget resolution when \nCongress voted cuts--not disproportionate cuts--but real cuts \nnonetheless. At that time, I think some on the other side decided that \nthe cuts were too great and that any program that carried these cuts \nwould be opposed.\n  I want to warn anyone listening, if you find yourself confused, there \nmay be ample reason. You may hear from some that this legislation cuts \nfarming too much and that it simultaneously pays farmers too much under \nthe fixed market transition payments. We may also hear from some who \nhave historically opposed existing law that this reform legislation \nshould be defeated to preserve existing law.\n  Mr. President, I am hearing from my farmers that they want modified \nfreedom to farm, and they do not want an extension of current law. Let \nme address this notion that we are cutting agriculture too much and \npaying farmers too much. In my State, farm prices may be better than \nthey were last year, but to them, there is no way these prices are \nhigh. These prices are the same as they were 13 years ago while the \ncost of a pickup truck has doubled over that same period. ``High \nprices'' is a relative term. If you ask a rancher feeding steers corn--\ncorn is high. If you ask a corn farmer, prices are not high--hardly \nenough to cover the costs of production. I read a wire story where \nSecretary Glickman observed from China that he was concerned that \nfarmers will get a tremendous windfall.\n  I know the Secretary is doing marvelous work promoting trade and he \nshould be applauded for that, but he would not want to sit down with \nfarmers in my State and explain to them how this slimmed down program, \ncombined with moderate prices is going to give them a windfall.\n  Additionally, prices may be higher than they were several years ago, \nbut after this past year's flood, drought, and frost, many farmers had \nnothing or significantly less to sell. The existing program does not \naddress that problem and this is a critically important point. You \ncannot tell my farmers who have little to sell while facing a refund of \ntheir advanced deficiency payments that the current program is a safety \nnet and the modified freedom to farm is not.\n  I might also suggest to Members who are worried that farmers might \nget a payment when prices are higher than normal that farmers can \nallocate the money to prepare for the bad years--they do not need the \nGovernment to do it for them. I believe farmers can manage a \npredictable 7-year income stream to mitigate economic risk just as well \nor better than Washington can do it on their behalf. They can sock it \naway for the bad year, they can buy down their debt, they might buy a \nnew used 15-year-old tractor to improve their efficiency.\n   Mr. President, I urge Members to take a look at this bill and \nrecognize that it is an exciting new approach to the challenge of \nmaintaining a healthy food-producing sector, promoting important \nenvironment practices, and doing so within the budget constraints that \nwe are imposing on ourselves on behalf of future farmers who want our \nNation to afford farm programs.\n  The first feature of this package is that it is responsible. As the \nother side has testified again and again, farmers were not exempt from \nthe difficult choices necessary to balance a budget. Farmers have \nalways been supportive of a balanced Federal budget and have proven \ntheir willingness to share in the sacrifice necessary to get there. \nFarmers are highly sensitive to the cost of capital and, according to \nFAPRI at the University of Missouri, stand to save over $15 billion \nover the next 7 years if we achieve a balanced budget.\n  This package provides predictability. Farmers, bankers, and the \ntaxpayers know how much this program will cost over the next 7 years. \nIt locks in spending to protect agriculture from the next round of \nbudget cuts while simultaneously preventing the fluctuations that have \nshocked budgets in the past.\n  This package dramatically reduces burdensome paperwork and the \nperverse antimarket incentives that frustrate farmers who are \naggressively competing for and securing growing international markets. \nFarmers would rather compete to feed Asia than protect their crop base \nnecessary to maximize deficiency payments.\n  Simplicity, flexibility, predictability, and budgetary soundness are \nfeatures--any one of which is a step forward in this debate--but \ntogether, they mark an historic effort to make the transition to the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I do not blame Members for being hesitant to embrace \nchanges to a program that has lasted my lifetime. It was only after \nmultiple meetings with farmers in my State that I was prepared to make \nthis change. In this town, if one is in doubt, she or he is expected to \nstick with the status quo. But there are two things that have changed.\n  There is a recognition that the deficit must be addressed and farmers \nare ready to free themselves from the regulations of the current \nprogram.\n  There is one other observation I wish to share from my experience \ntraveling in Missouri. As Senators know, the number of farmers is \ndecreasing and the age of the average farmer is increasing. Most \ntalented young rural people are moving to town. Of the young people who \nare endeavoring to be our next generation of farmers, there is a great \noptimism despite the difficulties in agriculture. These young farmers \nwill tell you they want to farm for the market. They think the current \nsystem is old, outdated, complicated, frustrating, inflexible, \nbureaucratic, and costly. Our next generation of farmers tell me they \nwant to turn the corner as we move into the next century and I think we \nowe these young farmers that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has been out there since last summer \nand it was included in the Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in \nNovember and vetoed by the President on December 6, 1996. It was \ncarefully crafted after months of negotiations between House and Senate \nconferees. As all Members know, this was a difficult process and many \ndelicate regional issues were addressed.\n  Since the veto, I know there have been bipartisan negotiations led by \nthe distinguished majority leader, Chairman Lugar, and Members on the \nother side. I must tell Senators, until the most recent bipartisan \nnegotiations with Senator Leahy, one of the more difficult press \ninquiries I have fielded is, ``Who are the Republicans negotiating \nwith?'' I know that the distinguished minority leader introduced a bill \non marketing loans and the House has a blue dog plan. The \nadministration once hinted at 21 percent unpaid \n\n[[Page S676]]\nflex but I see in a report off the wire that they now support a 2-year \nfreedom to farm experiment and, here is the kicker, with dramatically \nreduced transition payments. I raise this point because there is simply \nno consensus alternative. There is, however, consensus in the \nagricultural community on this legislation and I believe it is time for \nus to join together to reflect that consensus.\n  Mr. President, we all share the goal of continuing to provide the \nsafest, most abundant, and the most affordable supply of food and fiber \nin the world. I know there are some who may call this welfare. As farm \nState Senators know, we have argued until we are blue in the face that \nthe current system is not welfare but people are not listening.\n  Farmers know it is not welfare and most Senators do not consider the \nexisting program welfare, but try to pass that off on an editorial \nboard or local chamber of commerce. You cannot argue that the reform \nprogram will be accused of welfare when the existing system is accused \nof welfare.\n  In my State, farmers are supportive. Over time, more and more of the \ncommodity groups representing farmers have weighed in. Missouri's \ncorngrowers were in this week to request that freedom to farm be \nadopted and a continuation of current law be rejected. Farm Bureau is \nasking us to move this legislation. The underlying bill represents \nserious reform, it moves us in the right direction and is fiscally \nresponsible. This is why it has been endorsed by: the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; Citizens Against Government Waste; representatives of the \nHeritage Foundation; Citizens for a Sound Economy; National Taxpayers \nUnion, Americans for Tax Reform, Consumer Alert; the Cato Institute; \nand the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n  I understand that change is not easy and I congratulate again the \nefforts of the majority leader, Chairman Lugar, and the bipartisan \nnegotiators who have been searching for a way to move this legislation \nforward and get farmers a program that moves them into the next \ncentury. I think the President will see that farmers and citizens will \nbe best served if he adopts this legislation and I am hopeful that \nCongress can continue to work on sensible regulatory reform, capital \ngains and estate tax relief and other measures that will help our \nfarmers compete in the next century. I urge adoption of the bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture. The farmers of America \ndeserve better than to be filibustered into uncertainty for the rest of \nthe spring. We need to move forward on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S672-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nJOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH \n                                REPUBLIC\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, how many minutes are left on our side of \nthe aisle on debate of the farm bill at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 45 seconds remaining on \nthe Republican side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 10 minutes. Before speaking, I ask \nunanimous consent that George Stickels, a fellow in my office, have \naccess to the floor during the debate on the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue before us is one of the utmost \nimportance, the farm bill. We have to debate this now because, as \neverybody knows, the commodity provisions of the new farm bill were \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. That Budget Act was vetoed by \nthe President. The farm bill provisions went down with that. We did not \nhave the votes to overturn the President's veto on the Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  Consequently, the farmers of America do not know for the first time \nin 5 years, since we passed the 1990 farm bill, what the Government \npolicy is toward agriculture. This is necessary information that must \nbe factored in to a lot of business decisions that are made by farmers.\n  The legislation that is before us will guarantee an investment of $6 \nbillion in rural America this crop year, an investment in rural America \nat a time when there is a tremendous transition from the agriculture of \nthe last half of the 20th century to the more free market, \ninternational-trade-oriented agriculture of the 21st century. When this \ntransition is going on, this is when we need to bring some certainty to \nthe business decisions of agriculture as best we can.\n  There has been some fault found, particularly on the other side of \nthe aisle, with the fact that we might be spending $6 billion in rural \nAmerica as an investment when grain prices are high, even though there \nis not a profit in cattle, there is not a profit in livestock \ngenerally, particularly cattle and pigs, but right now there is some \nprofit in grain.\n  Some people have said on the floor of this body that we are giving \nwelfare to farmers at a time when there are high prices. The \ninclination is to say that there is too much money in this farm bill \nfor agriculture. I have heard some of those same Members say that they \ncould not vote for farm bills in the past because they did not do \nenough for agriculture. How ironic that we have the same people today \nsuggesting that we might be passing a farm bill that is too good for \nagriculture. It just does not add up.\n\n  Not only does it guarantee an investment in agriculture of about \n$43.5 billion over the next 7 years in this transition from a \nGovernment-controlled agriculture to a free market agriculture, but it \ngoes from an agriculture system inclined toward domestic production for \ndomestic consumption to a farm program for production to meet the \ncompetition and the demand of international trade. There is no more \nimportant time to do that.\n  Also, this legislation locks in the agricultural baseline and \nguarantees an investment in rural America of this $43 billion. It is \nimportant to have that baseline out there because this legislation, \nlike most legislation, does not provide for a farm program beyond the \nsunset year of 2002.\n  There will be plenty of time for Congress to enact legislation beyond \nthat period of time. But if we are not careful, what we do today will \npreclude agriculture having a baseline, and then when we come up with a \nfarm program beyond the year 2002, it may be impossible to raise the \nmoney for that baseline.\n  This bill before us locks in that baseline, guarantees payments to \nfarmers and for other programs such as conservation programs and export \nprograms. It provides a real safety net by \n\n[[Page S677]]\nmaking sure that there are payments even when we have low yields that \npush prices higher.\n  Again, we have an ironic situation here where some people on the \nother side of the aisle are suggesting that because grain prices are \nhigh, there should not be any Government program. Do not forget about \nthose farmers in west central Illinois, the northern third of Missouri, \nthe southern third of Iowa, plus a lot of other places--I only mention \nthose because they are close to the Midwest where I am from--who do \nhave high prices but because of the wet spring and the flooding \nconditions could not plant their grains last year. They do not have \ngrain to sell at a high price.\n  This program will help those people as well.\n  So it guarantees a 7-year payment. It will help a farmer in his cash \nflow situation have a steady, predictable cash-flow. At least a portion \nof that would come in Government payments that will allow the farmers \nand their bankers to make long-term business decisions that are so \nimportant to the success of agriculture.\n\n  This legislation also maximizes farmers' profit potential. The Food \nand Agriculture Policy Research Institute--this is a combination \nresearch institute of the University of Missouri and Iowa State \nUniversity--estimates that even though payments from the Treasury will \ndecline 21 percent under this bill from the previous 5 years, gross \nfarm income will increase by 13 percent and net farm income by 27 \npercent over the next 10 years.\n  We eliminate this process by which people in the urban areas can say \nfarmers are getting paid for not tilling the soil. This eliminates the \nset-aside authority so that farmers can send a clear signal to our \ninternational competition that we are going to produce on every \nproductive acre what we can to meet international trade demands, to \nmeet the humanitarian demands of a growing population throughout the \nworld that otherwise, without the productivity of the American farmer, \ncould have more instances of famine.\n  We give increased flexibility to the farmers to make planting \ndecisions. We take that decisionmaking out of the hands of Washington \nbureaucrats and public servants.\n  It will be in the mind and office of every farmer to decide how many \nacres of corn or how many acres of soybeans to plant. Presently, those \ndecisions are made, to the greatest extent, by people in Washington, \nfar removed from the reality of farming, ignoring the marketplace and \ntrying to insert their judgment upon the people on the spot. Full \nflexibility means plant what you want to plant, not what some \nWashington bureaucrat says.\n  This legislation significantly reduces Government regulation and \nbureaucratic redtape, thus enabling our farmers to compete in the world \nmarketplace. It increases flexibility, or the increased flexibility \nallows farmers to plant specifically beyond what they would normally \nplant, moving to other crops, particularly the emphasis in American \nagriculture today to have value-added products instead of simply the \ntraditional commodities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for yielding to me. I ask if the Chair \nwill remind me when I reach the 4-minute mark. At that point, I will \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 4 minutes remaining on your time or 4 \nminutes----\n  Mr. PRYOR. No, I want to speak only 4 minutes, Mr. President, and \nthen I will yield to the distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. President, I was standing here listening a moment ago to my good \nfriend from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He talked about regulations and \nbureaucrats and freedom to farm and all of those things that we talk \nabout generally when we have an agriculture bill on the floor. For us \nto have an agriculture bill on the floor for a 1996 program, I might \nsay, is somewhat unique, because the normal process for the first time \nin 60 years did not work.\n  We did not draft this legislation in the Agriculture Committee. This \nlegislation, basically, was born and drafted, passed from the Budget \nCommittees of the House and the Senate. But when we talk about \nregulations and bureaucrats and freedom to farm and all of the \nconstraints placed on farmers today in our country, let us also \nremember something else: That we today are the envy of the world with \nthe production of food and fiber in our country for the rest of the \nworld. We have the opportunity to feed the rest of the world. In many \ninstances, had it not been for the American farmer and the American \nfarm system, which we are about to annihilate, we would see that many \nareas of the world would have gone hungry.\n\n  I say this in all respect to those advocates for the freedom to farm \nlegislation. If we pass this legislation, we will be going on a cheap \ndrunk. We will be sorry, and we will rue the day that we totally \ndismantled the farm programs that have served this country and served \nthis world so well.\n  The two people and the two groups of persons and the two entities, I \nthink, who should be supporting the freedom to farm bill are those \ncompetitors of ours in the international market. They should be \nsupporting the freedom to farm bill, because it is going to be a total \ndisruption of farm ownership ultimately in our country. We are going to \nsee the small fail and the large and the powerful prevail.\n  Second, the big landowners should love the freedom-to-farm bill. They \nshould love the freedom to farm bill because their farms are going to \nget bigger, their farms are going to become richer, their farms are \ngoing to produce more and more, and the small family farmers are going \nto be there with less and less.\n  The other aspect of this legislation--and I hope my friend from Iowa \nwill address this, or some other proponent of freedom to farm--does \nanyone in this Chamber feel that we can in this calendar year \nimplement, have the regulations and administer a totally new farm \nprogram for all of America's farmers? This is not a 7-year farm bill. \nThis is a bill that is going to last until the first show on ``60 \nMinutes'' embarrasses us, embarrasses farmers by showing that the \nfarmer no longer has to produce in order to get a big paycheck from the \nFederal Government. It is a 7-year welfare program.\n  It is wrong, Mr. President, and we should be no part of it. We should \ndefeat the motion for cloture. We should enact a farm bill only after \nwe, in this Senate, and in the Senate Agriculture Committee, perhaps \nthe House committee, have the opportunity to shape a farm bill that \nwill look beyond 7 years and then to the next seven generations.\n  Mr. President, today we are considering what will prove to be one of \nthe most important and most disastrous pieces of legislation affecting \nthe State of Arkansas and family farms across this Nation. Agriculture \nhas been and continues to be an integral part of the fabric that makes \nup rural America and is responsible, directly or indirectly, for about \n1 out of every 5 jobs throughout America.\n  In Arkansas, from Texarkana to Blytheville, from Gentry to Eudora, \nfamilies all across our State make enormous contributions to the \nworld's food and fiber supply. In 1994 alone, Arkansas farmers \nharvested over 8 million acres of agricultural products: rice: 1.42 \nmillion acres produced over 175 million bushels of rice; cotton: \n970,000 acres produced over 1.7 million bales of cotton; soybeans: 3.4 \nmillion acres produced 115.6 million bushels of soybeans; wheat: \n880,000 acres produced 40.5 million bushels of wheat; and corn: 90,000 \nacres produced 10.8 million bushels of corn.\n  With crops, poultry, and livestock combined, Arkansas' farmers and \nranchers were responsible for over $5 billion in economic activity for \nour State. So why am I concerned? Because, the legislation under \nconsideration before the U.S. Senate is the beginning of the end for \nfarm programs and the safety net function they perform. We can argue \nover whether it will happen in 2 years or in 7, but the undisputable \nfact is that the safety net will disappear.\n  Perhaps some of my colleagues favor this approach. Perhaps some \nSenators feel that farm programs are not a good deal. I would simply \npoint out that for roughly one-half cent out of every Federal dollar, \nour farm programs provide \n\n[[Page S678]]\nthe safest, most affordable, and abundant supply of food and fiber in \nthe world. Americans spend about 10 percent of their disposable income \non food--compared to the French who spend 16 percent, the Japanese who \nspend 18 percent, Chinese who spend 48 percent, and Indians who spend \n53 percent--it is hard to imagine a better deal.\n  My good friends may be wondering--how did this come to be, how could \nwe pay so little and get so much? The answer, in large part, is due to \njust how productive our farmers and ranchers have become. The U.S. \nagriculture represents some 3 percent of the world's agriculture labor \nforce, yet it produces about 40 percent of the world's corn, about 15 \npercent of the world's cotton, about 50 percent of the world's \nsoybeans, about 10 percent of the world's wheat, about 25 percent of \nthe world's beef, and about 11 percent of the world's pork.\n  Now, I can hear someone suggesting that if agriculture is so \nproductive and costs so little, why do they need any support at all? \nWhy should we help agriculture over other industries? Mr. President, \nagriculture is unique. It is like no other industry in our economy. \nFarmers are almost entirely at the mercy of Mother Nature, as well as \nthe actions of foreign governments, both of which are entirely out of \ntheir control. But even worse, unlike most businesses, farmers and \nranchers have no control over the prices they receive. They are price \ntakers, not price setters. The weather and policy in China could, and \nusually does, have more control over how well an Arkansas cotton farmer \ndoes from one year to the next than anything the farmer could do.\n  Perhaps, there are other colleagues who are under illusions that \nagriculture spending has been like most other Federal programs that \nhave grown ever larger. Perhaps they believe agriculture must be one of \nthose programs where we debate what is a true cut or what is just a cut \nin the rate of increase.\n  Among many other points, a bipartisan group of Senators pointed out \nto the Budget Committee that agriculture spending has come down by \nabout 60 percent in the last decade, from $26 billion in fiscal year \n1986 to less than $11 billion fiscal year 1994.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to point out all of this information for one \nsimple reason. It makes absolutely no sense to abandon these \nsuccesses--and successes they are--for a policy that is irresponsible, \nirrational and, most importantly, indefensible.\n  The freedom-to-farm bill under consideration would pay farmers \nwhether the market warranted it or not--despite the other side calling \nthis a market-oriented bill. Under freedom to farm, it makes absolutely \nno difference what the market conditions are. The farmer gets his or \nher payment regardless. According to economists, prices are supposed to \nbe good for the next couple of years, but as we all know, few years of \nhigh prices are most commonly followed by a few years of low prices as \nfarmers around the world create an oversupply of a commodity chasing \nthat higher price. The tragedy, in this scenario, is as follows: \nSuppose in 2 years farmers receive payments despite high market prices. \nThe media and the public become outraged by the waste and the 105th \nCongress responds to the outcry by removing the remaining payments from \nthe farmer. This could happen because the so-called contract doesn't \nbind a future Congress. The next time commodity prices plummet and \nfarmers need a safety net, it will be gone.\n  Some proponents have called this a contract modeled after the popular \nCRP contract which paid farmers to remove land from production. They \npoint out that over the 10-year life of these contracts, Congress \nalways honored them. The difference, Mr. President, is that in return \nfor funding a CRP contract the taxpayers receive a specific public \nbenefit such as conservation, wildlife habitat, or water quality. The \nfreedom-to-farm contract has nothing in it for the public or taxpayer. \nThe taxpayer simply transfers money to the farmer for no other reason \nthan that the farmer was in some sort of agriculture program in at \nleast 1 out of the last 5 years.\n  The bill we are considering is a perfect script for a ``60 Minutes'' \nor a ``Prime Time Live'' show called the ``Fleecing of America,'' when \nit's discovered that under this bill a farmer can receive the freedom-\nto-farm payment and not do anything at all. That's right, Mr. \nPresident, under this legislation, a farmer can receive thousands upon \nthousands of tax dollars and spend the entire growing season in the \nCaribbean or Bahamas. In fact, the only restriction is that if they \ngrow something it can't be fruits or vegetables. Other than that, sand \nand sun would be the only worries on the minds of farmers as the \ntaxpayer would foot the bill.\n  But, a word of warning. For all those that would take this approach, \nmay I suggest they invest your payments wisely. Find a good money \nmanager or investment banker because they're going to need them. If \nwhat many predict will happen when word gets out about this program, \nyou will have to make a couple of years worth of promised payments last \na very long time.\n  Mr. President, supporters of this bill tout endorsements by \nagribusiness companies and big processors. This should not come as a \nsurprise to my colleagues. It is very simple; this freedom-to-farm bill \nwill ultimately drive the price of commodities down. Whether a big \ncompany is purchasing feed for livestock or grain to process and mill, \nthey want to pay the family farmer as little as possible. They want to \nbuy low and sell high like Wall Street speculators, with no concern for \nthe future of farming.\n  The freedom-to-farm bill gets worse. By capping the programs based on \neconomic projections and theoretically locking those in, we give no \nroom for error. I would defy anyone to find an economist anywhere in \nthe world who has accurately predicted the price of a commodity with \nany accuracy for a full 7-year stretch. It simply cannot be done. Yet, \nthat is the logic embodied in this bill. We are entrusting the future \nof the farmers of this country with some guess by economists down at \nthe Congressional Budget Office [CBO]. And, if they guess wrong about, \nfor instance, the price of rice in the year 2001, the farmers in my \nState will be left with little recourse and less help.\n  The proponents of this legislation have said that it is important \nbecause of the baseline problem. Baselines in agriculture only matter \nin two circumstances: First, if you require ag to come up with unfair \nand unreasonable cuts, as the Republicans have; or second, if you cap \nthe programs so the baseline can never adjust upward, which the \nRepublicans also have done. So, there is a budget baseline problem, but \nonly if you buy into the rest of the flawed Republican policy.\n  Although the Republicans did indeed manage to capture the baseline, I \nam at a loss to understand why they would want to capture it after a \ndecade of reduction--over 60 percent. Conversely, why not wait until \nthis bill forces a decline in market prices that will automatically \nraise the baseline again before we try to capture anything.\n  We will rue the day we pass a freedom-to-farm bill. What we must all \nrealize is this ends farm programs. It unilaterally disarms our farmers \nagainst the rest of the world. In fact, the only farmers this bill is \ngood for are those in France, Thailand, Argentina, and any other \nforeign country.\n  In the first years, this bill will prove to be a taxpayer ripoff. In \nthe later years, it will prove to be false hope and empty promises as \nthe safety net for American agriculture is destroyed. Let us at least \nchange the name to reflect accuracy. Maybe we should call it the bait \nand switch act of 1995, or as others have suggested, the freedom-from-\nfarming bill or the farmers death assistance act.\n  For all the reasons I have mentioned today and many more I have not \nhad the opportunity to make, I cannot and will not be associated with \nending the necessary safety net our farmers and our consumers depend \non. Therefore, I will vote against the freedom-to-farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent \nto Senator Domenici be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate Budget Committee begins \n     consideration of the FY 1996 budget resolution, we understand \n     it has under review a number of options, including possible \n     reductions in agriculture-related spending. Difficult \n     challenges are facing your committee as well as Congress as a \n     whole. However, we believe it is important for a number of \n     reasons that agriculture not be unfairly singled out to bear \n     a disproportionate share of any required spending reduction \n     as part of any budget proposal.\n       First, agriculture spending has already been reduced \n     substantially in recent years as a result of the 1990 Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act and subsequent legislation which \n     reduced income and price supports; limited eligibility and \n     participation; imposed new or higher fees and other \n     assessments related to certain programs; and reduced the \n     availability of funds for certain export and market promotion \n     programs. As a result, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) \n     outlays for farm commodity programs have declined from a high \n     of $26 billion in FY 1986 to less than $11 billion in FY \n     1994, a reduction of almost 60 percent. Outlays are projected \n     to remain below this level for FY 1995-2000. By contrast, \n     total federal spending during this same period increased by \n     approximately 50 percent, and entitlement programs nearly \n     doubled. Such spending is projected to continue to increase \n     significantly in the future.\n       Second, as a result of legislation relating to USDA \n     reorganization, future agriculture outlays are further \n     expected to decline by as much as $3.6 billion through FY \n     1999 with the closing of over 1,200 field offices, \n     eliminating approximately 11,000 employees, and consolidating \n     43 separate agencies into 29. No other Department or federal \n     agency has undergone such an extensive reorganization.\n       Third, while there may be opportunities for additional \n     savings, it is important before any further reductions are \n     required to ensure that such action does not jeopardize the \n     continued ability of U.S. agriculture to meet the food and \n     fiber needs of consumers at home and abroad. U.S. farmers are \n     the most efficient and competitive in the world, and our \n     government policies and programs should help maintain the \n     technological advantages that will enable them to stay that \n     way.\n       Under the recent Uruguay Round GATT agreement, the U.S. \n     along with other countries, is required to reduce its support \n     for domestic farm programs by 20 percent by the year 2000 \n     from the 1986-88 base period. However, the U.S. has already \n     more than achieved such reductions. To make further \n     reductions in such programs without requiring similar \n     corresponding reductions by the European Union and other \n     foreign competitors would be unfair to U.S. farmers.\n       History has shown that our foreign competitors will utilize \n     every possible resource to maintain and expand their share of \n     the world market. The European Union (EU), for example, \n     continues to significantly outspend the U.S. in terms of its \n     support for agriculture and in competing for foreign markets. \n     In 1994, outlays for domestic farm programs by the EU \n     amounted to more than $30 billion, nearly three times the \n     U.S. level of outlays.\n       In terms of export subsidies, the EU has outspent the U.S. \n     6 to 1 over the past 5 years. Although the GATT agreement \n     will require a reduction in the use of such subsidies, the EU \n     will be able to more than maintain its substantial advantage. \n     Further, as export subsidies are reduced, the EU can be \n     expected to redirect much of those resources into other GATT-\n     allowable programs to maintain and strengthen the \n     competitiveness of its agricultural sector.\n       Without asssistance from our government, U.S. agriculture \n     will be at a competitive disadvantage. Not only would this \n     adversely affect America's ability to capitalize on potential \n     market opportunities as a result of GATT, but our ability to \n     remain competitive in existing markets, both domestic and \n     foreign, could be affected as well.\n       This could have significant consequences for both the \n     economy and the budget. Nearly one million Americans have \n     jobs which are dependent on agricultural exports alone. \n     Exports now account for more than a third of total U.S. crop \n     production and total over $43 billion. This results in a \n     positive trade balance of nearly $18 billion. Such exports \n     also account for approximately $100 billion in economic \n     activity and, in turn, helps generate as much as $8 billion \n     in related Federal tax revenues.\n       Overall, our agriculture and food industries account for \n     nearly 16 percent of GDP and nearly 1 out of every 6 American \n     jobs. Other sectors of the economy, including input \n     manufacturing, handling, processing, marketing and \n     transportation, are heavily dependent on a healthy \n     agricultural economy. Any significant reduction in \n     agriculture's balance sheet will have a corresponding effect \n     on commercial banks and other lending institutions, including \n     the farm credit system.\n       Finally, it is important to recognize why we have farm \n     programs. Every nation has a responsibility to ensure that \n     its citizens have access to a dependable supply of food. This \n     is one of the basic purposes of U.S. farm programs. To meet \n     this objective, farmers must receive a fair return on their \n     productivity and investment in an industry characterized by \n     continued subsidized foreign competition and subject to wide \n     swings in production and prices due to weather and other \n     related factors.\n       By any measure, U.S. farm programs have been successful and \n     cost-effective. Currently, such programs represent less than \n     one percent of the entire federal budget. And, for that, we \n     have an agricultural system that is the envy of the world. It \n     has provided our citizens with a dependable source of \n     reasonably priced food and fiber. U.S. consumers, for \n     example, spend the lowest percent of disposable personal \n     income on food--approximately 11 percent--of any country in \n     the world.\n       If other federal programs had been reduced by the same \n     percentage as agriculture commodity programs, we would have a \n     budget surplus.\n       As your Committee examines the options in the budget \n     process, we hope you will consider the interests of U.S. \n     agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n         Thad Cochran, John Warner, Robert Kerrey, David Pryor, \n           Howell Heflin, Jesse Helms, Tom Harkin, Dale Bumpers, \n           Max Baucus, Trent Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas for his strong statement just now. \nI wish to associate myself completely with his remarks. I think it is \nfair to say that we all agree we are in a mess, we are in a big mess, \nand there are a lot of reasons why we find ourselves in the situation \nwe are in this afternoon.\n  The last time we failed to produce a farm bill was the year I was \nborn, 1947. Coincidentally, it was the last time Republicans controlled \nthe Congress. We should have passed this legislation, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas said, last year, but the bill did \nnot even come to the floor. The bill was not even allowed up for \ndebate. It was the first time in memory, and may be the first time \never--we are checking it now--that legislation this important passed \nout of the Senate Agriculture Committee on a strict party-line vote.\n  It was then, as everyone recalls, buried in the budget agreement, and \nit went absolutely nowhere. And now here we are in February of 1996 \nconsidering a farm bill for 1995. Even if we passed a piece of \nlegislation as radical as this is, let there be no mistake, it will \ntake months and months and months for the Department of Agriculture to \nget set up to administer it.\n  So the situation is very unfortunate. Farmers are out there \nclamoring, as the distinguished Senator from Iowa said, for some \nanswers. They need to know the 1996 winter wheat crop has been planted, \nsouthern crops are going to be planted this month, and farmers should \nnot be put in the untenable position of making huge investments in \ntheir agricultural operations without knowing anything about what farm \npolicy will be this year or the next.\n  Last year, farmers were prevented from planting due to excessive \nrain. This year, they will be prevented from planting due to excessive \npolitics.\n  There is only one option for 1996--only one. I do not like it. Not \nmany people here would consider it their first option. It certainly is \nnot mine. But there is no other alternative right now but to extend for \n1 year at least current legislation. We need to extend current law only \nbecause we have to provide farmers with that certainty.\n  It is no secret that we have put a tremendous amount of effort and \ntime into finding an alternative that we feel very excited about. It is \nno secret that there may not be a resolution between the Farm Security \nAct and the so-called freedom-to-farm bill. But there is a realization \nthat we have to do something, and there is no possibility of doing \nanything with the mess we are in right now.\n  We have to do what the Senator from Iowa has suggested, and that is \ngive farmers the maximum degree of flexibility. We need to extend \ncurrent law but ensure that those farmers who have to have additional \nflexibility are given every opportunity to do so. Plant whatever their \nmanagement dictates, whatever their desires may be given current \nmarketing conditions.\n  There ought to be no constraints at all on their ability to make \ndecisions for themselves. Farmers are familiar with the current \nlegislation. Prices are relatively high. The administration \ninfrastructure for the current farm bill is in place.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, we can do it today. What some of my \nRepublican colleagues want to do at this \n\n[[Page S680]]\nlate date is to pass the most radical farm bill in 60 years. They \neliminate permanent law; they slash the conservation reserve, one of \nthe most successful programs for conservation on the books this time or \nany time; they cut exports just when we need to expand the export \nmarkets abroad; we eliminate the farmer-owned reserve; we ignore \ncompletely the need for rural development, and we destroy research. And \nat the same time we do all of that, there are those on the other side \nwho argue that we ought to be giving huge payments to farmers, whether \nor not they plant, regardless of whether they have good prices or not.\n  I would like my Republican colleagues to explain to a small \nbusinessman or a working family why a farmer is entitled to a quarter \nof a million dollar payment while they idle their land and spend a year \nin Hawaii. If a farmer could idle his land, not do a thing on it for an \nentire year, go to Hawaii and spend that quarter of a million dollars, \nwhy cannot a small businessman or a working family or anybody else do \nthat?\n  How ironic that at this very time when we are trying to cut back and \nreduce the tremendous budgetary exposure we have in so many ways, we \ncan find ways with which to give farmers huge payments whether they do \nanything to farm or not.\n  Mr. President, the closer you look, the worse this gets. Even with \nthe laudable improvements Senator Leahy has suggested that we make to \nthe freedom to farm, this bill is a disaster.\n  I was very pleased for the letter we received just this morning from \na large number of very reputable organizations--including the National \nAudubon Society; Environmental Working Group; Henry A. Wallace \nInstitute for Alternative Agriculture; Sustainable Agriculture \nCoalition; Natural Resources Defense Council; National Rural Housing \nCoalition; National Family Farm Coalition--who are saying that even \nwith the Leahy improvements, they are very strongly in opposition to \npassing this so-called freedom to farm.\n  Most important, Mr. President, the President has indicated that he \nwill veto this legislation if we were to see it pass and sent to him \nfor signature. He is making the right decision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Secretary Glickman, laying out the President's grave \nconcerns about this bill, be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: S. 1541, the Agricultural Market Transition Act \n     of 1996, as well as several amendments to it, may be \n     considered in the Senate today, and I want to take this \n     opportunity to reiterate the Administration's position on a \n     farm bill.\n       As discussed in the Statement of Administration Policy \n     issued yesterday, I would recommend that the President veto \n     S. 1541 if it were presented to the President in its current \n     form. In my view, the bill fails to adequately address a \n     number of basic requirements I believe should be included in \n     the farm bill. These requirements include the preservation of \n     the farm program ``safety net,'' continuation and enhancement \n     of conservation programs and environmental protection, and \n     enhancement of economic opportunities for rural America and \n     production agriculture.\n       I understand that Senator Leahy may offer one of the \n     amendments to S. 1541. This amendment appears to be a \n     positive step in the direction of a farm bill that meets the \n     Administration's priorities. For example, it contains \n     authority to sign up new acres in the Conservation Reserve \n     program, continues the option of offering permanent easements \n     through the Wetlands Reserve Program, and reauthorizes food \n     and nutrition programs. However, the amendment fails to \n     address other needed improvements in S. 1541, such as changes \n     to strengthen the safety net for farmers and increase support \n     for rural development. Therefore, I would recommend that S. \n     1541, as amended by Senator Leahy, be vetoed by the \n     President.\n       I want to reiterate my willingness to work with the \n     Congress to enact a comprehensive farm bill as soon as \n     possible that best serves American agriculture and the \n     American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let us be clear. Win or lose on these \ncloture votes, we are no closer to an agreement if that is what happens \ntoday. Sooner or later, we are going to have to compromise. The House \nRepublicans just do not seem to get it. So far, the 104th Congress \ncould be summed up simply in two words: lost opportunity. On welfare, \non reg reform, on the budget, and on appropriations, many in the House \nseem to think compromise is a four-letter word.\n  Let us not allow the farms to fall victim to this, too. We can work \nthis out. We can find compromise. We can find a way to ensure that \nfarmers are going to have the certainty that they are asking for this \nafternoon, and we can begin all of that by defeating both cloture \nmotions in the next hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Lugar-\nDole Agricultural Market Transition Act. This bill is not good for my \nState of California because it cuts and caps export promotion programs; \nexcludes critically important agricultural research and nutrition \nprograms, and phases out farmland conservation programs. The Lugar-Dole \nbill contains essentially the same provisions, with some changes, as \nthe Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995 which was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  The most important positive aspect of this bill is that it preserves \na provision in current law that is of enormous importance to fruit and \nvegetable growers in my State of California and across the Nation. \nPrevious versions of this legislation included so-called ``flex acre'' \nprovisions, which would have permitted the production of fruits and \nvegetables on up to 15 percent of a program crop farmer's former base \nacres.\n  Nationwide, there are approximately 11 million acres planted with \nfruits and vegetables. This acreage supplies U.S. and foreign consumers \nwith a ready supply of high quality and affordable produce, while \nallowing fruit and vegetable producers to go about their business free \nof Government involvement or Federal subsidies.\n  The ``flex acres'' language would have resulted in nearly 32 million \nacres becoming eligible for fruit and vegetable production on \nsubsidized farms that traditionally have been planted to program crops. \nIf even a small number of those acres were to shift into fruits and \nvegetables, farm prices for many fruit and vegetable commodities were \nexpected to drop abruptly and dramatically.\n  Republican budget negotiators originally argued that the ``flex \nacres'' provision would help balance the budget. However, they now \nconcede that the provisions would have no impact on the deficit. They \nwould, however, help subsidized commodity crop growers at the expense \nof nonsubsidized fruit and vegetable growers.\n  The California produce industry recognizes that should a 7-year \nphaseout of subsidies be enacted, growers will eventually have to \ncompete in the marketplace with one and all. But in the interim, it \nwould be grossly unfair to require unsupported fruit and vegetable \ngrowers to compete with their subsidized brethren.\n  I am pleased that we have won the flex-acre battle by fighting hard \nto keep current law on the books. Current law has now been reinstated \nin both the House bill and this Senate bill. However, I remain very \nconcerned about the impact of flexible planting on California farmers \nin the long run--7 years from now.\n\n  Mr. President, we are in unprecedented times. The 1990 Farm Act \nexpired in December, leaving only the permanent 1949 law in place. So \nclearly, the Congress needs to enact a farm bill.\n  But the Lugar-Dole bill is a radical departure from an American farm \npolicy which for almost 5 decades has supported the world's most \nsuccessful agricultural system--one that has resulted in consistently \nhigh quality produce and low consumer food prices.\n  Some changes are necessary in these tight budget times, to ensure \nthat we are getting the most for every taxpayer dollar spent. But \nchanges in a system that has been so enormously successful must be done \ncarefully, thoughtfully, slowly, and responsibly. They must make the \nsystem better. We must not take chances that might result in weakening \na terrifically successful system.\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\n  Farm policy is not just about supporting the growing of our crops. It \nis also about promoting exports of American farm products; promoting \nenvironmentally sound uses of farmlands; emergency food assistance \nprograms; the distribution of surplus farm produce to soup kitchens and \nfood banks; and critically important agricultural research programs \nsuch as research on the California Medfly and research on alternatives \nto methyl bromide.\n  The Lugar-Dole bill does not achieve these objectives. In fact it \nexcludes most of them. It does not reauthorize nutrition and \nagricultural research programs; it phases out conservation programs; it \ncuts and caps export promotion programs.\n  If nutrition programs are not reauthorized, they will be in jeopardy \nduring the appropriations process. Federal funding for domestic food \nassistance represents over 60 percent of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's budget and includes the food stamp program, child and \nelderly nutrition programs, the special and commodity supplemental food \nprograms for women, infants and children [WIC and CSFP], commodities \nfor soup kitchens and food banks, and the Temporary Emergency Food \nAssistance Program [TEFAP].\n  I oppose the provisions in the bill that cap the Market Promotion \nProgram at $100 million per year and the Export Enhancement Program at \nlevels far below the Congressional Budget Office baseline and the \nUruguay round permitted levels for fiscal year 1996 through 1999. The \nMarket Promotion Program is an important tool in expanding markets for \nour agricultural products. The Export Enhancement Program is used to \nsubsidize export sales to more than 80 foreign countries. It is the \nprimary means by which the United States has attempted to meet \nprice competition in world markets when domestic policies supported \nprices above the world market or to counter subsidies used by foreign \ncompetitors.\n\n  The Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] is a voluntary program that \nenables producers to bid to retire highly erodible or environmentally \nsensitive land for 10 years. It is one of the most important \nconservation programs in the Nation. To date, about 36.5 million acres \nhave been enrolled in 375,000 contracts. CRP saves soil, enhances \nwetlands, improves soil and water quality, expands wildlife habitat and \npopulations, encourages tree planting, and helps balance commodity \nsupply and demand.\n  The Lugar-Dole bill in effect phases out CPR by capping enrollment at \nthe current 36.4 million acres and providing no new enrollment \nauthority. Contracts on 24 million acres expire in 1996 and 1997. If \nthey are not renewed, CRP would be reduced by 56 percent by 1997.\n  This bill also guts current law which allows acres to be enrolled \npermanently in the Wetlands Reserve Program. About 335,000 acres are \ncurrently enrolled permanently. The bill only allows 15 year easements \nand places a cap on enrollment. The 7-year savings of $387 million are \nfalse economy. Short term contracts may reduce outlays over next 7 \nyears, but outlays would increase in subsequent years and no \nprotections remain in place after contracts expire. Over half a million \nacres are bid into the Wetlands Reserve Program each year by farmers \nwho want permanent easements. Congress should not take away this option \nfor farmers.\n  Finally, I believe that the principal intention of the Lugar-Dole \nbill--to phase out Federal support for the ``program crops'', for \nexample, rice, cotton, wheat, and feed grains--is bad policy for family \nfarmers. Under current law, program crop farmers get ``safety net'' \npayments when market prices fall below a certain threshold. Under the \nLugar-Dole bill, farmers will receive subsidy payments--decreasing over \n7 years--based only on the production history of a farmer--with no \nrelation to market prices or actual output. In other words, the nature \nof farm payments changes from being a ``safety net'' received only when \nprices are low, to a form of direct ``welfare payment'' received no \nmatter what the market conditions and regardless of how profitable the \nfarming operation. Although ``Freedom to Farm'' lowers the payment \nlimitation from $50,000 to $40,000, it retains the ``three entity \nrule''. So, one farmer could theoretically earn $120,000 from the \nFederal Government in 1996 while on a year-long sabbatical.\n  Farmers need predictability in order to make planting decisions and \nsecure financing from lending institutions. This bill is being sold to \nthe agriculture community as the best vehicle to guarantee an income \nsafety net to farmers through direct payments for 7 years. Many farmers \nbelieve that given the Federal deficit and efforts to balance the \nbudget, this bill is the best way to look in Federal support payments. \nBut decoupling makes no sense. Under this bill, one farmer could be \nreceiving windfall gains while another hard-working farmer could go \nbankrupt in a bad year because of lack of assistance.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lugar-Dole bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat \ncloture so that we can come together in a bipartisan way to write a \nfarm program that makes sense for the future. Mr. President, this could \nbe a very dark day for farmers, for their families, and the future of \nAmerican agriculture, because--make no mistake--if the so-called \nfreedom-to-farm legislation is passed, it will be the death knell for \nfarm programs in this country.\n  I have just come from my office and talked to a farmer who was urging \nme to vote for freedom to farm. He told me, ``Senator, we need the \nmoney and we know that the design of this program is to phase out farm \nprogram payments and kill the underlying law that allows us to have a \nfarm program for the future.'' He said, ``Senator, we know you will not \nlet us down in the future.''\n  Mr. President, I am just saying to that farmer that that is not what \nthis plan is all about. They are making transition payments. You are \ngetting that money for a reason. The reason is that they then ratchet \nthem down and eliminate them and kill the permanent authority to have a \nfarm program. I am saying to them, despite the best efforts we might \nmake in the future, this will be the end, make no mistake about it. \nThis will be the end. I told him that it is a little like the Rev. Jim \nJones, who had all of his followers drink the Kool-Aid that was laced \nwith poison, and then they died. I said it is a little like Reverend \nJones and that Kool-Aid. It tastes good going down--just like those \ncouple of years of initial payments look good--but it will kill you.\n  There is not a farmer I know that does not realize that sometimes \nprices are high and sometimes they are low. The purpose of a farm \nprogram is to be there as a safety net when prices are low. This \nprogram provides a payment, regardless of what the price is.\n  Mr. President, it is a scandal waiting to happen. Wait until ``60 \nMinutes'' gets a hold of this one. In the high-priced years, farmers \nare making good money, and, in addition, they get a payment from the \nGovernment. I do not think so, Mr. President. I think it would be a \nprofound mistake, and it would kill farm programs and reduce, according \nto the State university in North Dakota, farm income by 30 percent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor so that my colleague might have a \nchance to speak as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are \nabout 4 minutes remaining. At that point, the majority leader intends \nto use the remaining time on the Republican side.\n  This vote is going to be a cloture vote on a farm proposal. We did \nnot have a debate on the floor of the Senate on a farm proposal last \nyear. Last year was the time when we were supposed to have had a 5-year \nfarm plan debated. We did not have a farm bill debated at all on the \nSenate floor. A farm bill was put in the reconciliation bill. Right now \nis the first time we have had a farm bill debated on the floor, and we \nstarted about an hour or two ago. We had an hour or two of debate and \nnow there is a cloture vote at 1:30.\n  The issue is something called the freedom to farm, which is an \nattractive name. This plan is to disconnect farm program payments from \nproduction or prices. The interesting thing about the \n\n[[Page S682]]\nfreedom-to-farm proposal is you do not have to farm in order to receive \npayments.\n  All you have to have is land with a base, but you do not need a \ntractor. All you need is a bank account and some land, and you can get \na payment. It is decoupling the support price from whether or not you \nproduce, decoupling the support price from whether or not market prices \nare high.\n  You could have a bumper crop with very high market prices, and you \nstill get a payment under this plan. Or you can have a circumstance \nwhere you have no crop because you just went off to Puerto Rico and had \na vacation and did not plant a thing, and you can still get a big \npayment under freedom to farm. It defies logic to me to understand why \nyou want to move in this direction.\n  For those who want to give a big payment to farmers, I say, fine, \nsign me up, let us try to recapitalize family farms. But if you want to \ndo that, I disagree with coupling it with the notion that we must then \nrepeal permanent farm law. That is the understanding--as Congressman \nRoberts said last evening on a program I was on--that we are going to \ntransition you out of a farm program, make some payments up front, and \nthere will be no farm program later. I am not willing to agree that \nthere ought not be permanent farm law.\n  FAPRI says wheat prices go to $3.22 next year. USDA says grain prices \nare going down in 1998. What happens when grain prices are $3 a bushel \nfor wheat and there is no support price at all, none at all? What \nhappens to a family farmer? They are going to be washed away, and all \nof us know it.\n  Who will farm then? The big agrifactories will farm from California \nto Maine. This is great for a corporate farm bill. If you like \ncorporate farms, and you want agrifactories to farm America, this is a \ngreat and quick way to get rid of family farmers.\n  They will get dollars maybe next year, maybe the year after, and \nevery single year after that they will be worse off, and at the end of \nit they will have no support at all against the risk of low prices. \nZero. No safety net at all. This takes a safety net we have had for 50 \nyears and yanks it right out from under family farmers. If you like \nthat, vote for this.\n  If all of you who want to add some extra money to farmers' \npocketbooks, you want to do that now, I will support you in doing that \nnow. However, I want you to join me in retaining some permanent law \nthat provides some safety net for the risks that family farmers will \ninherit when prices become very low. Why would you want to pull out \nthat rug and say, ``Well, the risk is your own; we do not care whether \nyou succeed or fail''?\n  I had a farmer call me yesterday who said, ``I want the Freedom-To-\nFarm Act but I want you to make sure, that, if prices are low, you give \nme a farm program.'' I had a farm commodity group come in to see me \nthat has endorsed the Freedom-To-Farm Act, and they said, ``We endorsed \nit with one condition: We have a farm program.'' I said, ``You do not \nunderstand; when Congressman Roberts talks about transitioning, when \nsomeone with a white shirt from Washington says we will transition you, \nyou had better get your seat belt on the tractor seat and buckle up. \nTransitioning means you will get a payment up front in exchange for \nwhich they will abolish the farm program down the road.''\n  No debate about that. That is exactly what will happen. That is why \nmany of us cannot support this. No one wants to be more generous than I \nto family-sized farms. I believe in the future of this country there \nought to be a network of family sized farms. I also believe that we \nwill not see a network of family sized farms in America if we decide \nthat when market prices collapse to $2.50 a bushel there should be no \nprogram for a safety net to continue family farming. We will have \ncorporate farming from California to Maine under this proposal.\n  I hope we will reach a compromise that is much better for the future \nof family farmers sometime this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The time on the Democratic side is \nexpired. There are 8 minutes and 45 seconds remaining on the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, here we go again, another farm debate. \nWinter wheat farmers have already planted. They could not wait any \nlonger for Congress to act. It happens about the end of every 5-year \nfarm program. There is always a little gap, and particularly winter \nwheat producers do not have much choice but to plant fence to fence and \nhope we will pass the farm bill, and then they can comply with the law \nat that time.\n  President Eisenhower was born in Kansas and raised in rural America. \nHe hit the nail on head when he said, ``Farming looks mighty easy when \nyour plow is a pencil, and you're 1,000 miles from a corn field.'' That \nstatement was made a long time ago, but it has not changed over the \nyears.\n  What I see happening here is we thought we had a pretty good \ncompromise worked out, but now I understand the other side of the \naisle, for the most part, has said, ``No, we are not going to let it \nhappen. We do not believe in the freedom to farm. We do not believe in \ntransition payments. We do not believe you ought to take a look at many \nfarmers and say, OK, have this 7-year period also be a transition and \nduring that period they will determine whether or not we ought to \ncontinue farm programs or whether we ought to bring them to an end.''\n\n  I must say, as I sat in a meeting here a while back with Secretary \nGlickman--a good friend of mine who is doing a good job as Secretary--\none thing he said bothered me: ``Farm prices are so high in the market, \npeople may not sign up for the program.'' I thought that was the goal--\ngo back into the marketplace with high prices so farmers could rely on \nthe market rather than the Government. Produce for the market. That is \nwhat the freedom to farm act is all about.\n  I do not know where we go from here if we do not get cloture on the \nso-called compromise. I want to congratulate the distinguished chairman \nof our committee, Senator Lugar, and Senator Leahy, the ranking \nDemocrat on the committee, and others, Senator Craig from Idaho and \nSenator Grassley from Iowa, my own staff and others who have been \nworking, we thought, in sort of a bipartisan way so we can get to \nconference. If we do not go to conference, we will not have anything.\n  I know farm bills are difficult. We have had farm bill debates on \nthis floor before and they are even more difficult on the House side. \nNormally you can pass a farm bill in the Senate. It is a little easier \nbecause most of us represent some farmers. Some may not fully realize \nit, but there are always a few farmers in every State. I know in my \nState we have a saying, ``if you do not eat, don't worry about the \nfarm.'' A lot of people do eat, but not many worry about the farm.\n  We have the best food bargain in the world. We spend less of our \ndisposable income on food in America than any other industrialized \nnation because of our farmers and ranchers in America, and now we are \ntrying to have a little safety net here, a little farm bill, to make \ncertain that certain things happen and there will be some protection \nthere.\n  Farming looks pretty easy to some. But we know the tremendous amount \nof work required by not only farmers but their families. We know there \nis overregulation, overtaxation, and I have had farmers tell me if we \nget rid of some of the regulations and other things we could keep the \nsubsidies. We would probably be better off. Farmers make a lot of \nsacrifices. They have hailstorms, winter kill, a lot of other things to \ncontend with, sometimes they do not have any crop at all, sometimes \nthey live from crop to crop, and sometimes they borrow money every year \nand every year and every year.\n  It is pretty important that we move ahead in this Chamber. They have \nenough uncertainties out there without the uncertainty of whether or \nnot we will act. I believe on this side of the aisle we are prepared \nalmost unanimously to act. It does not mean we think it is perfect. It \ndoes not mean we cannot address some of the concerns expressed by my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side, including the Democratic \nleader, who also understands agriculture, coming from South Dakota, and \nhopefully we will be able to work together on this.\n\n  While negotiations continue, as I said, Kansas farmers have planted \ntheir \n\n[[Page S683]]\ncrop without knowing any program details, and farmers of other crops \nwill be in the same position unless we take action. We did take action \nlast year, and we attached the legislation to our historic Balanced \nBudget Act. The legislation would have provided farmers with certainty, \nsimplicity, and flexibility-- three key words when you are on the farm. \nIt would have allowed them to plant for the market and not for the \nGovernment. It would have set a policy that transitions our farmers \ninto the next century, without disrupting the farm economy or land \nvalues. That act was vetoed by the President of the United States. I do \nnot think the American farmer should forget that--or the farm families. \nThat act was vetoed by President Clinton. That is why we are here \ntoday. That is why we are late. That is why we do not have our work \ndone.\n  It seems to me that we ought to get together here, pass the \nlegislation contained--the language we passed last year. That will be \nthe first vote on cloture. I urge my colleagues to support that. I \nbelieve the plan is good for farmers and good for taxpayers and good \nfor America. I have some reservations just as some of the others have \nreservations, that we could address in conference. I probably would be \na conferee.\n  After that vote, we will also have a cloture vote on a bipartisan \npackage, and I congratulate those who put that together. I think it \ndoes respond to the crisis. I thought we would have a third cloture \nvote but the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, vitiated \ncloture, which really started all this--I do not quite understand \nthat--on a 1-year extension. My view is we have two votes, we have two \nopportunities to move ahead for American agriculture. Stop the \nuncertainty right now.\n  I guess the good news for America's farmers is that this bipartisan \nagreement keeps intact the provisions farmers have overwhelmingly \nendorsed: Certainty, simplicity, and flexibility. We also have dairy \nprovisions, nutrition, and conservation. I believe the Senate must \nprovide leadership and keep faith with our commitment to rural America \nand move this farm bill forward. I believe it is good for farmers, it \nis good for America.\n  I finally say, if I can take a minute or two of leader's time, over \n200 years ago, George Washington wrote: ``I know of no pursuit in which \nmore real and important services can be rendered to any country than by \nimproving its agriculture.''\n  I think those words were probably pretty good a couple hundred years \nago and I think they are just as true today.\n  Now, I certainly hope that we could obtain cloture on both bills, if \nnot on the bipartisan efforts put together by Democrats and \nRepublicans--by Democrats and Republicans. Then let us go to \nconference, let us work together in a bipartisan way in the conference, \ncome up with a package that the American farmer can live with, the \nAmerican consumers will benefit from, and that the American taxpayers \nwill also support.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader allow me to \nrespond to the point he made about vitiating?\n  Mr. DOLE. I thought we had an agreement about voting on yours first, \nthen you vitiated the yeas and nays, and so there is nothing there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just mention to the majority \nleader, the Senate will now have two cloture votes. If cloture is \ninvoked, of course, the issue of extending the current farm program \nwill probably be moot. But if cloture is not invoked, then it would be \nmy desire to offer the Senate an opportunity to vote on the question of \nwhether we extend the current farm program or whether we provide for \nsome Farm Security Act approach. But the only way we will get to that \npoint is if we get past these two cloture votes. So we would still have \nan opportunity to vote on an extension of the farm program if there is \nnot cloture invoked.\n  Mr. DOLE. Not today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might be added \nas a cosponsor of both measures, S. 1541 and the Lugar-Leahy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The absence of a quorum is \nsuggested. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  By unanimous consent the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The farm bill is the most important legislation we have \nbefore us insofar as my State of South Dakota and insofar as our Nation \nis concerned. We forget that we are an agricultural Nation. Most of our \nexports in our Nation are agriculture. In fact, we pay our trade bills \nthrough agricultural exports.\n  Many economists have predicted that in the next few years commodity \nprices will be at an all-time high because of the demand in Asia and \nelsewhere for our farm products. Therefore, I hope this farm bill will \ntake into account the key role that agriculture plays.\n  Mr. President, we seem to be split between two approaches here, \ntemporarily: The freedom-to-farm approach and the traditional \nDepartment of Agriculture subsidy approach. It appears to me we will \nhave to find a compromise between the two. In the long \n\n[[Page S684]]\nrun, this Senator likes the concept of freedom to farm, possibly with a \ncap, because it may be that new crops will be developed. A farmer might \nwell experiment with a totally new crop. Right now with our \nbureaucratic approach, the Department of Agriculture basically defines \nwhat crops are appropriate.\n  However, I realize legislation is the art of the possible. It appears \nwe will have to reach a compromise. I am very much anxious to be part \nof that compromise. I look forward to discussing this with my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am informed that there is going to be, \nshortly, a unanimous-consent request to take up the telecommunications \nbill. I will not object to the unanimous-consent request, nor aspects \nof it.\n  I would like to point out that there have been letters exchanged \nbetween the members of the Federal Communications Commission and \nChairman Pressler, chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, and also between Republican Members of the other body \nas well as the majority whip, to Senator Dole, concerning the issue of \nspectrum auction, and a letter from Congressmen Bliley and Gingrich, \nSenator Pressler and Senator Lott, to the Honorable Reed Hundt, \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Federal Communications Commission,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: Thank you very much for your letter \n     this morning about the concerns expressed by Senate Majority \n     Leader Dole and others regarding the distribution of \n     additional spectrum to television broadcasters. We share the \n     determination of you, Senator Dole and others to protect \n     American taxpayers. As you know, under current law and \n     pursuant to the language of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 (should it become law), the Commission lacks authority \n     to auction, or charge broadcasters for the use of, the \n     spectrum that has been identified for the provision of these \n     broadcast services. In addition, given the many \n     administrative steps necessary to implement any assignment of \n     digital broadcast licenses, we would not be in a position to \n     issue those licenses any earlier than 1997.\n       We recognize the serious policy questions involved, and \n     that you intend to hold hearings and enact legislation \n     dealing with this issue as part of an overhaul of policies \n     governing the electromagnetic spectrum. Any award of initial \n     licenses or construction permits for Advanced Television \n     Services will only be made in compliance with the express \n     intent of Congress and only pursuant to additional \n     legislation it may adopt resolving this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Reed E. Hundt, Chairman,\n     James H. Quello, Commissioner,\n     Andrew C. Barrett, Commissioner,\n     Susan Ness, Commissioner,\n     Rachelle B. Chong, Commissioner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We appreciate your leadership on \n     telecommunications reform. Clearly the next step in \n     bolstering America's edge as we enter the Information Age \n     will be to overhaul outdated policies governing the \n     electromagnetic spectrum or airwaves.\n       We agree that you have raised legitimate concerns that must \n     be addressed, and we share your determination to protect \n     America's taxpayers. To this end we are committed to moving \n     comprehensive legislation this year and plan to be ready for \n     floor action this summer. As part of this reform, we believe \n     it is of the utmost importance to closely examine and \n     question the Federal Communications Commission's proposals to \n     give additional spectrum to television broadcasters. Until \n     action is completed on this legislation, we agree that the \n     FCC should not issue any initial licenses or construction \n     permits for Advance Television Services until Congress sets \n     policy in this area.\n       The Commission is a creature of Congress and our committees \n     have oversight over its operations. In the attached letter, \n     we inform the Commission of our concerns and have requested \n     that the Commission take no further action until instructed \n     otherwise.\n       We agree this issue should be subject to full, public \n     scrutiny, and we look forward to working with you to ensure \n     that America's taxpayers are fairly compensated for this \n     precious national resource.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Bliley,\n     Larry Pressler,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1996.\n     Hon. Reed E. Hundt,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you are aware, Senate Majority Leader \n     Dole and others have raised legitimate concerns about giving \n     additional spectrum to television broadcasters. As you are \n     aware, these concerns raise serious policy questions which \n     include providing taxpayers fair compensation for the use of \n     a national resource to the policy implications of giving \n     preference to the broadcasters over all other potential \n     competitors.\n       We share Senator Dole's determination to protect America's \n     taxpayers, and to satisfactorily resolve this issue. We wish \n     to inform the Commission that it is our intention to conduct \n     open hearings and move legislation to overhaul our nation's \n     policies governing the electromagnetic spectrum. We request \n     that the Commission not issue any initial licenses or \n     construction permits for Advance Television Services until \n     legislation is completed. Furthermore, your input would be \n     greatly appreciated as we work to solve this complicated \n     issue.\n       We appreciate your cooperation in advance on this issue of \n     the utmost importance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Bliley,\n     Larry Pressler,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the interesting thing about this is we are \nabout to see what should have been done, not done, and what may happen \nis a loss to the taxpayers of, conservatively, about $30 billion in \nspectrum that would be auctioned off.\n  In the language of the bill that we will be considering, there is no \nauthority for the Commission to auction or charge broadcasters for the \nuse of the spectrum that has been identified for the provision of \nbroadcast services.\n  I want to repeat. In the present bill we are about to consider, there \nis no provision for spectrum auction. The fair and decent thing to do \nfor the American taxpayer was to strip that language out of the bill, \nthereby leaving it neutral, and saying that this issue will be taken up \nand the issue of spectrum auction will be decided through hearings and \nfreestanding legislation.\n  I have been around here long enough to know what is going on here. \nWhat is going to probably happen is that we will not act on this issue \nthis year; that sometime in 1997 the broadcasters will begin to sue for \nthe provision of their spectrum, and in court will probably have \nstanding because of this bill we are about to pass. I am not sure how \nany court could refuse when in the legislation it does not provide the \nCommission authority to auction off the spectrum.\n  I want to tell you what should have been done here. What should have \nbeen done is the language stripped out of the bill that does not give \nthem authority and does allow them to give spectrum to the \nbroadcasters.\n  About a month ago we had a vote around here on some spectrum that was \nabout to be given away to a company. We had a vote here. It ended up, \nthanks to my colleague from Colorado and his cooperation and \nassistance, with a vote of 98 to 0 that mandated that this spectrum, \nwhich was about to be given away, be auctioned off. The estimates of \nthe value of that spectrum at that time ranged between $150 to $170 \nmillion. The auction took place a little over 2 weeks ago, and the \nspectrum was auctioned off for $682 million.\n  Now, what we are about to do here is allow, over time, this spectrum \nto be given away to the broadcasters. I congratulate the broadcasters \nand their surrogates here in the Senate and the Congress. I \ncongratulate them on prevailing. I congratulate them for their \nincredible influence that has prevented \n\n[[Page S685]]\nus from mandating an auction of the spectrum which belongs to the \ntaxpayers.\n  The estimates are that this spectrum is worth somewhere around $30 \nbillion--``b,'' billion dollars. Now we are going to accept language \nwhich is exactly what the broadcasters wanted.\n\n  In exchange for it, we get letters. We get letters which have no \nstanding in law, which have no standing anywhere. I have grown a bit \ncynical in the years that I have spent here in Congress, not to \nrecognize what is happening.\n  I can only speak for people on this side of the aisle about our \nphilosophy of the role of Government. When something is owned by the \ntaxpayer and is of great value and we are facing debts of incredible \nproportions, $4, $5 trillion, annual deficits of $150 billion, and we \nhave a way of taking that very valuable commodity that is owned by the \ntaxpayers and auctioning it off, and now we are being prevented \nbasically from doing so--despite the fig leaf of these letters--I think \nit is a very sad day. Because in this legislation the broadcasters are \nwell represented. The taxpayers of America are not represented at all.\n  So, as we adopt this legislation, and these letters, which I could \ndescribe in somewhat graphic terms but will not--they are entered into \nthe Record--let us have no illusions about what is happening here. What \nis happening here is the odds are the taxpayers of America will never \nreceive that $30 billion in return for the auctioning off of a \ncommodity which they own.\n  Mr. President, I had a lot of problems with the telecommunications \nbill, as is well known here. I proposed numerous amendments which were \ndefeated. But all of them pale in comparison to what we are talking \nabout here, especially since we already have proof, with a $682 million \nauction of a small amount of spectrum that took place a couple of weeks \nago, of the value which we are not addressing in this legislation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I first want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his statement. I can assure him that if the FCC means what \nthey say in the letter, ``only pursuant to additional legislation it \nmay adopt resolving this issue''--I think both the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Kansas are going to be around. And there will not \nbe any legislation unless it resolves the issue fairly for the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I think this is very important. I know there are Members on each side \nof the aisle who are concerned about it. It is not a partisan issue. \nHere we are, trying to balance the budget, cutting welfare, cutting \nother programs, and about to give a big handout here to the rich, the \npowerful.\n  We have not seen a single story on any of the networks about this \nissue. We see a lot of stories on the networks about some Member of \nCongress going somewhere on a ``junket,'' they always like to say on \nthe networks. But I have not seen anybody, except for CNN, not a single \nstory on what could be the biggest giveaway of the century--not one.\n  I think we could have done better in the discussions, myself, \nyesterday.\n  I talked to the Speaker, and the Speaker said, ``You got rolled.'' \nEverybody got rolled. But that is history. It will not happen again. I \nthink this is a very important issue. You will not see it on \ntelevision. You will not see it on the networks. You probably will not \nsee it in any newspaper that owns television because this affects them. \nWe should not raise things, in effect, for the rich and the powerful.\n  So I appreciate the concerns expressed, and we will continue to \npursue this matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \ncomment?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the majority leader for his efforts on \nthe spectrum auction. It would have sailed right through, because the \nfix was in. Had it not been for his efforts--I am sorry that he was out \nof town yesterday. I am sorry that we did not get, as the leader said, \na better deal.\n  The thing I worry about, of course, is that with the present language \nin the bill, which should have been stripped out, next year sometime \nsomeone will sue and go to court with the FCC and force the FCC to be \nin compliance with the law that we are about to pass today. That is \nwhat I worry about.\n  But I do want to thank the majority leader sincerely for his efforts \nfor bringing this issue to the attention at least to the print media. \nAs the majority leader mentioned, we will not see this story on any \ntelevision or hear it on any radio broadcast because it directly \naffects them.\n  But I want to thank the majority leader for his efforts. I take in \ngood faith his commitment for us to try to get it up. I just know that \nthe forces that are represented--the special interests here in \nWashington--have won. I regret it because it is the American taxpayer \nwho now may be losing $30 billion. If we had done the right thing and \nstripped that language out of the bill, there was no chance that \nanything else would have happened.\n  I thank the majority leader for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S684-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE.

I think the managers on each side of the aisle are here. We \ndo not want to take a lot of time. We are trying to work out something \non the agriculture bill, a bipartisan solution, if you please. Senator \nLugar, Senator Leahy, and others on both sides have been active. We had \na meeting in Senator Daschle's office, including myself, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Leahy, and Senator Lugar. We believe there can be a \nresolution. But rather than keep people here late, late tonight, we \nwould like to move ahead and have the debate on the telecommunications \nconference report.\n\n  I understand that is agreeable to the Senators from South Dakota and \nSouth Carolina. I think there is a need to get consent on the other \nside of the aisle before we can proceed. There is no time limit. We \nhope to get an hour or two for a time limit. We said we cannot get that \nat the present time. But we would like to ask consent--I will not make \nthe request now, but if we can get it cleared, I would simply ask \nconsent that, notwithstanding the absence of official papers, the \nSenate now turn to the consideration of the conference report to \naccompany S. 652, the telecommunications bill, and the conference \nreport be considered read.\n  That would just permit us to go ahead and have the debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the absence of official \npapers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have not made the request yet. I will repeat what I said \nand make the request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that there is a consent request to move \nright now to the conference report on the telecommunications bill. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that the bill be read.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has not yet finished the \nrequest.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me repeat the request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a moment?\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, without going into the issue of the \ntelecommunications bill--which I will not--I just want to emphasize \nwhat the distinguished majority leader said. As my colleagues know, he, \nI, and some others had an amendment at the desk. We would have voted \ncloture under normal circumstances. Following the first cloture vote \ntoday, the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic \nleader, Senator Lugar, and I have met. I want to emphasize one thing. \n\n[[Page S686]]\n\n\n  In the 21 years that I have been here, the most successful farm \nlegislation has been bipartisan farm legislation. The most successful \nfarm legislation has been that where we have worked together. There are \na lot of issues in this, from the normal crops to issues of nutrition, \nconservation, reserve areas, which are very important to me. I know \nthat the only kind of legislation we are ever actually going to see go \ninto law is something we all work together on.\n  I commend Senator Dole and Senator Daschle and Senator Lugar and \nothers for working so hard to bring us together. I think we will \nshortly be in a position to put before the body a piece of legislation \nthat we can at least all vote cloture on and then go on in the normal \ncourse of things on the farm bill.\n  But I commend those Senators again on both sides of the aisle who \nhave been willing to work together on legislation to protect the \nfarmers of our country, to require the production of food and fiber and \nallow family farms to continue, but also to protect the environment of \nthis country and to feed the people of this country through the \nnutrition programs. Those programs work best when we come together to \npass it. I think we are coming very close to that.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S685-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

If we can do that, then we will start the \ndebate on the telecommunications bill. I have read the colloquy. I do \nnot see any problem with it. But I am not on the committee.

Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  The majority leader may have already covered this. I am concerned \nabout this. I am vitally interested in the farm bill. I have no \nobjection whatever going to the telecommunications bill. But if at some \npoint this afternoon some sort of a compromise is reached, I hope that \nwe will not have any difficulty setting the telecommunications bill \naside and then get back to the farm bill and, hopefully, dispose of it \nthis evening.\n  Mr. DOLE. We would like to dispose of it this evening. We are hoping \nthere can be an agreement and that we have 80 votes on cloture--not 61 \nor 59, or whatever. I know some Members have to depart fairly soon. We \nare trying to accommodate everyone. It is difficult to do. But I think \nthey are meeting as we speak in a bipartisan group.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, his staff, mine, \nSenator Lugar's, and Senator Daschle's are meeting. I think we are \ngoing to have very soon a package on the farm bill before us, at least \nthe original package most of us can vote for and, obviously, subject to \namendment after that. But the desire, I think, of the principals--those \nof us on both sides of the aisle who are handling this--is to get \nsomething that we can compress in time, if at all possible, and protect \nthe legitimate interests reflected not only geographically but \npolitically.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My concern, Mr. President, to the majority leader was, I \nwish we could incorporate into the unanimous-consent request that the \nmajority leader will have a right to automatically set the \ntelecommunications bill aside. I do not want somebody to object to that \nand get us bogged down here so that we cannot get back to the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will assure the Senator I am interested, too, just as the \nSenator from Arkansas is. If we get bogged down on this, we could set \nit aside.

Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill S. 652, \n     to provide for a procompetitive, deregulatory national policy \n     framework designed to accelerate rapid private sector \n     deployment of advanced telecommunications and information \n     technologies and services to all Americans by opening all \n     telecommunications markets to competition, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of January 31, 1996.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it is with a sense of relief and pride \nthat we bring to the Senate floor the conference report on the \ntelecommunications bill. I wish to commend my colleague, Senator \nHollings, for his outstanding leadership and bipartisan spirit \nthroughout this debate. This long debate has brought us to the point \ntoday where we have a conference report that is very positive. It is \nprocompetitive and deregulatory. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 \nwill get everybody into everybody else's business.\n  The purpose of this bill is to update the 1934 Communications Act. \nThis is the first complete rewrite of the telecommunications law in our \ncountry. It is very much needed.\n  I predict that this will be succeeded someday as we get into the \nwireless age by another act, maybe in 10 or 15 years. But this \nTelecommunications Act will provide us with a road map into the \nwireless age and into the next century.\n  Mr. President, what has occurred in our country is that through court \ndecisions and through the 1934 act we have developed an economic \napartheid regarding telecommunications, that is, the regional Bell \ncompanies have the local telephone service, the long-distance companies \nhave the long-distance service, the cable companies have their section, \nthe broadcast companies have their section.\n  This bill attempts to get everybody into everybody else's business \nand let in new entrants. For example, at President Clinton's recent \nWhite House conference on small business many small business people \nwrote and said, we want the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to pass \nbecause it will allow small business people to get into local telephone \nservice, it will allow small business people to get into different \nsegments of telecommunications.\n  Mr. President, this conference report we bring here today is a vast \nbill. It covers everything from the rules of entry into local telephone \nservice by other competitors--it deals with long distance, it deals \nwith cable, it deals with broadcast, it deals with the public utilities \ngetting into telecommunications, it deals with burglar alarm issues, it \ndeals with the authority of State and local governments over their \nrights of way, and it deals with the rules of satellite communication.\n  It will result in many things for consumers. For example, I believe \nit will accelerate an explosion of new devices, an explosion of new \ninvestment. What has happened in our country is that we have forced our \nregional Bell companies to invest overseas because we limit what they \ncan manufacture. We have limited many of our companies in what they can \ndo in our country. This legislation unleashes them, makes them \ncompetitive and is deregulatory in nature.\n  It will do a great deal for consumers. For example, and specifically, \nit will lower prices on local telephone calls \n\n[[Page S687]]\nthrough competition. It will lower prices on long-distance calls \nthrough competition. It will lower cable TV rates through competition. \nIt will provide an explosion of new devices, services and inventions.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota yield? I hate to interrupt.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S686-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S687-S721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have a unanimous-consent agreement I \nbelieve we are ready to enter. It is a very important effort to \ncomplete this legislation.\n  After consultation with the Democratic leadership, Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that there now be 90 minutes on the conference \nreport to be equally divided in the usual form, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to the \nadoption of the conference report without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I ask that my \nfriend allow the ranking Member to have equal time for what the \nchairman has had, say 5 minutes, and add that to that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend my unanimous-consent request to that effect.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my colleagues and my colleague from Kentucky.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill is an industrial restructuring. It will \nbe like the Oklahoma land rush because many investors have not had a \nroad map as to what to do. It will mean we will be more competitive \ninternationally, and it will mean many of our companies can form \nalliances internationally.\n  Some have said, well, will this just allow one or two companies to \ntake everything over? No, it will not. I think it will prove to be the \nage of the small, nimble business. I believe that we will see small \nbusinesses emerging. We have seen AT break up into three companies. I \nthink that is going to happen more and more.\n  This bill does not affect our antitrust laws. The antitrust laws stay \nin place. But this bill will encourage small, nimble companies and \nentrepreneurs to enter the telecommunications area.\n  It will also bring us to a point where many of our companies that \nhave not been able to get into other areas can do so. For example, the \npublic utilities will be able to get into telecommunications.\n  What does this mean to the average consumer? I have already mentioned \nI think it will mean lower prices through competition. It also will \nmean many new devices for senior citizens who might be living alone and \nwant to summon emergency help with some of the wireless technologies \nthat will be available. They can stay in their own homes longer with \nthe security of mind of being able to call for help by pushing a \nbutton.\n  For the home, I believe we will see the computer and TV and telephone \nblended into one source of education, news, and entertainment. For the \nsmall town hospital, it will mean telemedicine, new devices and \ninvestment, where a large hospital can partner with a small hospital in \nresearch.\n  For the small business located in a smaller town, it will mean that a \nsmall businessman there will be on an equal footing with a bigger \nbusinessman in an urban center in terms of access to research and the \nability to partner.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I have asked my staff to help \nfind ways that when big universities get a research grant for cancer \nresearch, for example, that they use telecommunications to partner with \na small university. That will make the research more accurate at lower \ncost.\n  So there are a number of benefits to consumers, farmers, small \nbusiness people, and universities. There are many new devices that will \ncome online that we have not even heard of yet. This bill will be like \nthe Oklahoma land rush in terms of investment, inventions and \ndevelopment. We have just begun imagining what the telecommunications \nrevolution will be like.\n  This will be the starting gun. We have kept our companies in bondage. \nThose companies will break free and there will be a whole group of new \nsmall entrepreneurs coming forth to participate in the \ntelecommunications revolution.\n  Another area that it will help our country is jobs. This is the \nbiggest jobs bill ever to pass this Congress. It will result in a \ncreation of thousands of jobs, good jobs, good-paying jobs across our \ncountry.\n  We read about layoffs every day, but they are frequently in \nindustries that have grown obsolete. This bill will allow an unleashing \nof new high-technology jobs in the information age. And it is very \nimportant.\n  This bill is a jobs bill without spending any Federal money. It will \ngo down in history as the largest jobs bill in American history.\n  So, Mr. President, I shall, to save time, because I know some of my \ncolleagues wish to speak--I want to pay tribute to both the Republicans \nand Democrats who have worked on this bipartisan bill, to my colleague, \nSenator Hollings, to my colleague, Senator Daschle, who is on the \nfloor, and many others on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It has been all the way through the \nSenate. First of all, this bill has been simmering for many years. We \nhave worked on it first in the Senate and then in the House. There were \nbipartisan staff meetings.\n  We have brought the White House into the conference discussions. I \nspoke with President Clinton and Vice President Gore on a number of \noccasions throughout this process. I thank them for their \nparticipation. Mr. Simon of Vice President Gore's staff was a guest \nspeaker at the conference staff's first meeting. We invited him so we \ncould bring this together on a bipartisan basis.\n  This bill is not one that could be partisan. I think it is one of the \nmost bipartisan pieces of legislation in the Congress. Mr. President, I \nshall have additional remarks as time goes on. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the \nconference agreement to S. 652, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. \nThis bill is intended to promote competition in every sector of the \ncommunications industry, including the broadcast, cable, wireless, long \ndistance, local telephone, manufacturing, pay telephone, electronic \npublishing, cable equipment, and direct broadcast satellite industries. \nThis legislation has the support of the Clinton administration and \nalmost every sector of the communications industry. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this comprehensive legislation.\n  Mr. President, this conference agreement comes before the Senate for \nfinal passage after years of debate. In 1991, I authored legislation to \nallow the Regional Bell Operating Companies [RBOC's] into \nmanufacturing. That bill passed the Senate by almost \\3/4\\ of the \nSenate, but the House could not pass it. Several other bills were \noffered, but at each stage, one industry blocked the other. As a \nresult, communications policy has been set by the courts, not by \nCongress and not by the Federal Communications Commission [FCC], the \nexpert agency.\n  In 1994, I introduced S. 1822, the Communications Act of 1994, which \ncontained the most comprehensive revision of the communications law \nsince 1934. In that year, the committee held 31 hours of testimony in \n11 days of hearings from 86 witnesses. Though that bill was reported by \nthe Commerce Committee by a vote of 18 to 2, there was not enough time \nin the 103d Congress to complete our work.\n  Senator Pressler and I decided earlier this year to pick up where we \nleft off in the last Congress. We jointly introduced S. 652 early in \n1995 and succeeded in passing the bill out of the Commerce Committee by \na vote of 17-2 on March 23 of last year. The bill passed the Senate in \nJune by an overwhelming vote of 81-18. After the House passed its \nversion of the legislation in August, the two Houses entered into the \ndifficult task of reconciling the two bills over several months through \nthe fall and winter.\n  I am pleased that the conferees have succeeded in reconciling these \nbills. I \n\n[[Page S688]]\nbelieve that the conference report that is brought before the Senate \ntoday is a fair and balanced compromise between the bills passed by the \ntwo Houses. It retains many of the concepts contained in my legislation \nfrom the 103d Congress. For instance, it promotes competition, it \nretains strong protections for universal service and rural telephone \ncompanies, it promotes consumer privacy, and it allows the RBOC's into \nlong distance and manufacturing under certain safeguards.\n  At the same time, this legislation contains many more deregulatory \nprovisions than were contained in my legislation from last year. It \nallows greater media concentration than I would have preferred. It \nderegulates cable on a date certain, rather than upon a determination \nthat there is actual competition. Nevertheless, I believe that this \nlegislation on the whole presents a balanced package that deserves the \nsupport of every Member of this body.\n  The basic thrust of the bill is clear: competition is the best \nregulator of the marketplace. Until that competition exists, monopoly \nproviders of services must not be able to exploit their monopoly power \nto the consumer's disadvantage. Timing is everything. \nTelecommunications services should be deregulated after, not before, \nmarkets become competitive.\n  Competition is spurred by the bill's provisions specifying the \ncriteria for entry into various markets. For example, on a broad scale, \ncable companies soon will provide telephone service, and telephone \ncompanies will offer video services. Consumers will soon be able to \npurchase local telephone service from several competitors, and vice \nversa. Electric utility companies will offer telecommunications \nservices. The RBOC's will engage in manufacturing activities. All these \nparticipants will foster competition to each other and create jobs \nalong the way.\n  We should not attempt to micromanage the marketplace; rather, we must \nset the rules in a way that neutralizes any party's inherent market \npower, so that robust and fair competition can ensue. This is Congress' \nresponsibility, and so the bill transfers jurisdiction over the \nmodification of final judgment [MFJ] from the courts to the FCC. Judge \nGreene, who has been overseeing the MFJ, has been doing yeoman's work \nin attempting to ensure that monopolies do not abuse their market \npower. But it is time for Congress to reassert its responsibilities in \nthis area, and this conference agreement does just that.\n\n  Mr. President, let me address some of the specific areas of important \nin the bill.\n\n\n                           Universal Service\n\n  The need to protect and advance universal service is one of the \nfundamental concerns of the conferees in drafting this conference \nagreement. Universal service must be guaranteed; the world's best \ntelephone system must continue to grow and develop, and we must attempt \nto ensure the widest availability of telephone service.\n  The conference agreement retains the provision in the Senate bill \nthat requires all telecommunications carriers to contribute to \nuniversal service. A Federal-State joint board will define universal \nservice, and this definition will evolve over time as technologies \nchange so that consumers have access to the best possible services. \nSpecial provisions in the legislation address universal service in \nrural areas to guarantee that harm to universal service is avoided \nthere.\n\n\n                     RBOC Entry into Long Distance\n\n  One of the most contentious issues in this whole discussion has been \nwhen, or if, the RBOC's should be allowed to enter the long-distance \nmarket. I share the concern of many consumers that the RBOC's should \nnot be permitted to enter the long-distance market while they retain a \nmonopoly over local telephone service. For this reason, I strongly \nopposed the idea that the RBOC's should be permitted to enter the long-\ndistance market on a date certain, whether they face competition or \nnot. I am pleased that the conference agreement recognizes that the \nRBOC's must open their networks to competition prior to their entry \ninto long distance.\n\n\n                        Cable Rate Deregulation\n\n  The 1992 Cable Act was a great success. The rate regulation \nprovisions of that legislation have saved consumers about $3 billion a \nyear. The 1992 law also stimulated competition for cable service by \nwireless cable providers and direct broadcast satellite [DBS]. For \nthese reason, I have agreed to go along with the provisions in the \nfinal conference agreement what would deregulate the upper tiers of \ncable service on March 31, 1999. By that time, we expect that \ncompetition from DBS and wireless cable, and perhaps from the telephone \ncompanies, will provide enough restraint on further cable rate \nincreases. I believe that this is a fair compromise that serves the \ninterests of consumers and the cable industry.\n\n\n                            Broadcast Issues\n\n  The conference agreement changes some of the current rules and \nstatutory provisions concerning media concentration. I share the \nconcerns of the Clinton administration and others that excessive media \nconcentration could harm the diversity of voices in the communications \nmarketplace. At the same time, that marketplace has undergone several \nchanges since many of these rules were first adopted in the 1970's. As \na result, I have agreed to some changes in the ownership rules to allow \nthe broadcast and cable industries to compete on more equal footing.\n\n\n                        importance of must-carry\n\n  I would like to add one more point concerning the importance of must-\ncarry. Broadcast stations are important sources of local news, public \naffairs programming and other local broadcast services. This category \nof service will be an important part of the public interest \ndetermination to be made by the Commission when deciding whether a \nbroadcast renewal application shall be granted by the Commission. To \nprevent local television broadcast signals from being subject to \nnoncarriage or repositioning by cable television systems and those \nproviding cable services, we must recognize and reaffirm the importance \nof mandatory carriage of local commercial television stations, as \nimplemented by Commission rules and regulations.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  This comprehensive bill strikes a balance between competition and \nregulation. New markets will be opened, competitors will begin to offer \nservices, and consumers will be better served by having choices among \nproviders of services. I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill. I \nmyself would go further in several areas covered by the legislation, \nand not as far in other areas. But I have seen that, unless we adopt a \ncomprehensive approach to legislation, any one sector of the \ntelecommunications industry can stop this bill and checkmate the \nothers. Telecommunications reform is too important to let this \nopportunity go by. This conference agreement is an equitable approach \nto most of the areas covered by the bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a ``Resolved Issues'' \ntable be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Telecommunications Bill Resolved Issues\n\n       1. Long Distance.\n       a. FCC decides whether to allow a Regional Bell Operating \n     Company to provide long distance under the following \n     conditions:\n       i. FCC gives substantial weight to the DOJ;\n       ii. RBOC application must be in the public interest;\n       iii. RBOC must face a facilities-based competitor or must \n     have received approval from the State that it has met the \n     unbundling requirements;\n       iv. RBOC must have opened and unbundled its network using a \n     specific checklist;\n       v. RBOC must apply on a state-by-state basis;\n       vi. RBOC must use a separate subsidiary for long distance;\n       b. RBOCs can provide long distance outside their region \n     immediately upon enactment;\n       c. RBOCs can provide incidental long distance (i.e. long \n     distance related to cellular, information services cable \n     services, cable services) immediately after enactment;\n       d. the RBOC can jointly market local and long distance \n     service immediately after enactment;\n       2. Media Ownership:\n       a. nationwide reach raised from 25% to 35%--no waivers\n       b. duopoly rule--FCC will study whether to change duopoly \n     rule. Current rule prohibits ownership of two TV stations in \n     the same market. If it changes the rule, there should be a \n     higher standard on V-V combinations than U-U or U-V \n     combinations\n       c. Local Radio--raise the limits on the number of stations \n     one person can own as follows: \n     \n[[Page S689]]\n\n\n                     NUMBER OF STATIONS IN A MARKET                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Current limit        New limit    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1-14..............................                  3                  5\n15-29.............................                  4                  6\n30-44.............................                  4                  7\n45 or more........................                  4                  8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This also includes raising the current 49% limit on small \n     markets (1-14 stations) to 50%.\n       d. Cable-Broadcast: remove statutory ban, direct the FCC to \n     review its rule that has the same effect without prejudice.\n       e. Dual Network: allow someone to own a second network if \n     it is starting a new network\n       f. One-to-a-market: allow someone to own one TV, one AM \n     radio, and one FM radio in the top 50 markets (current rule \n     allows common ownership in top 25 markets). Allow existing \n     waiver process to continue.\n       g. Network-cable: allow networks to buy cable systems \n     subject to FCC safeguards.\n       h. Cable-MMDS: allow cable operator that face effective \n     competition to buy an MMDS system in the same market; but a \n     cable system that retains its monopoly cannot buy an MMDS \n     system in the same market.\n       3. Cable-telephone: allow telephone companies to provide \n     cable service in their regions.\n       4. Cable-telephone buyouts: allow a telephone company and \n     cable company to buy each other in markets below 50,000 and \n     outside an urbanized area.\n       5. Cable rates: deregulate small cable companies of fifty \n     thousand or less immediately; deregulate upper tier rates as \n     of March 31, 1999; no change to the regulation of the basic \n     tier.\n       6. Universal Service: universal telephone service shall \n     evolve over time, and the rates should be affordable. An FCC-\n     State Joint Board will recommend changes to the current \n     system to insure that all providers contribute.\n       7. Rural Telephone Company Protections: States may protect \n     rural telephone companies from competition; only essential \n     carriers will be eligible to receive universal service \n     support.\n       8. Snowe-Rockefeller: give schools and hospitals discounted \n     rates for telephone services.\n       9. V-chip: require TV sets to include a chip to screen out \n     programs; encourage broadcasters to develop rating codes for \n     violent programs.\n       10. Foreign Ownership: provisions taken out. No agreement \n     was reached on how to enforce the reciprocity approach.\n       11. Cyberporn: require operators of computer networks to \n     screen out indecent material for children; carriers of \n     indecent information will not be liable for the content of \n     information generated by others; expedited judicial \n     review.\n       12. Set-top Box: allows consumers to purchase the cable \n     set-top box on a retail basis from stores; cable companies \n     will no longer have a monopoly over set-top boxes.\n       13. DBS Taxation: Cities are preempted from taxing the \n     services provided by Direct Broadcast Satellite.\n       14. Pole Attachments: Cable companies may continue to pay \n     the same rate as long as they provide only cable service; \n     once cable companies start to provide telephone service, a \n     higher rate will phase in over 10 years.\n       15. Electronic Publishing: The RBOCs must use a separate \n     subsidiary when they provide electronic publishing in their \n     regions. Electronic publishing includes generating stock \n     information, sports scores, newspaper stories, and other \n     databases of information.\n       16. Manufacturing: The RBOCs are allowed into manufacturing \n     after they are permitted into long distance in any one State \n     in their region. The RBOC must use a separate affiliate.\n       17. Privacy Information: All telecommunications companies \n     must protest the privacy of customer information.\n       18. Anti-redlining: amends Section 1 of the Communications \n     Act to prohibit discrimination based upon race, national \n     origin, religion, sex; applies to broadcasters, common \n     carriers and cable.\n       19. Disabilities: ensures access by disabled persons to \n     telecommunications equipment and services, if readily \n     achievable.\n       20. Pricing Flexibility: provisions taken out. The \n     provisions in both bills would have told the States to adopt \n     price cap regulation with consumer safeguards. Companies and \n     consumers are better off leaving these issues to the States.\n       Specturm Flexibility: allows broadcasters to provide \n     ancillary and supplementary services once they deploy HDTV.\n       22. Preemption of state and local entry barriers: allows \n     competition for local telephone service.\n       23. Infrastructure Sharing: allows small telephone \n     companies to share the infrastructure provided by the RBOCS; \n     parties may negotiate the rates for such sharing.\n       24. Payphones: prohibit the RBOCs from cross-subsidizing \n     their payphone business.\n       25. Broadcast License Renewal: extends radio license terms \n     from 7 years to 8 years; extends television license terms \n     from 5 years to 8 years.\n       26. Anti-slamming: requires long distance companies to be \n     liable for charges if they switch a customer to its long \n     distance service unlawfully.\n       27. Regulatory Forbearance: allows the FCC to forbear from \n     applying any provision of the Act in the public interest.\n       28. Educational Technology Corporation: Sen. Moseley-Braun \n     sponsored this provision to allow this corporation to receive \n     federal funds to provide technologies to schools.\n       29. Telecommunications Development Fund: makes funds \n     available for small telecommunications businesses; sponsored \n     by Rep. Towns.\n\n\n                       alarm monitoring industry\n\n  Mr. HARKINS. Mr. President, I want to begin by making a comment to \nthe Senator from South Dakota, the distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, and chairman of the Senate-House conference which \nlabored long and hard to produce this bill. I want to thank the Senator \nfor the attention he has personally given to the small business alarm \nindustry. I know that on several occasions we have talked about the \nimpact of this bill on the alarm industry, and when the bill was on the \nSenate floor last year we worked out an agreement on the waiting period \nprior to Bell entry into alarm monitoring.\n  I also want to express my gratitude to the distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from South Carolina, who has taken a special \ninterest in the economic vitality of small businesses that comprise the \nalarm industry.\n  There is one issue that deserves some additional clarification. The \nbill and the report language clearly prohibit any Bell company already \nin the industry from purchasing another alarm company for 5 years from \ndate of enactment. However, it is not entirely clear whether such a \nBell could circumvent the prohibition by purchasing the underlying \ncustomer accounts and assets of an alarm company, but not the company \nitself. It was my understanding that the conferees intended to prohibit \nfor 5 years the acquisition of other alarm companies in any form, \nincluding the purchases of customer accounts and assets. I would ask \nboth the chairman and ranking member whether my understanding is \ncorrect?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes; the understanding of the Senator is correct. The \nlanguage in the bill designed to prevent further acquisitions by a Bell \nengaged in alarm monitoring services as of November 30, 1995, is \nintended to include a prohibition on the acquisition of the underlying \ncustomer accounts and assets by a Bell during the 5-year waiting \nperiod.\n  This would not prohibit, as is stated in the bill, the so-called swap \nof accounts on a comparable basis, whereby a Bell which was engaged in \nalarm monitoring as of November 30, 1995, would be allowed to swap, or \nexchange, existing customer accounts for a similar number and value of \ncustomer accounts with a non-Bell alarm company.\n  I thank the Senator for helping the committee to further clarify the \nmeaning of the legislation in the area of alarm monitoring services.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would agree with the explanation given by the \nchairman and am pleased to have this opportunity to further clarify our \nintent in the alarm industry provisions.\n  Mr. President, I am trying to save time and yield to our \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota. While he is coming to the \nfloor, let me first acknowledge the leadership and the understanding \nand, more than anything else, the persistence of our distinguished \nchairman.\n  Senator Pressler has been a dogged fighter all last year. He set \nhistory, there is no question in my mind, in this particular measure. I \nhave been here 28 years, now in my 29th year. I have been chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and on the Budget Committee for over 20 years, \nand this measure is far more complex than any annual budget or any \nnonsensical 7-year budget plan. It is totally ludicrous to think that \nwe could bind Congresses into the next century. That is gamesmanship \nthat has been going on.\n  On the contrary, here is a bipartisan measure that was reported out \noverwhelmingly from our Commerce Committee, not only 2 years ago under \nS. 1822, but again this year under S. 652. I will acknowledge and then \nget back to two leaders in this particular cause, in addition to our \ndistinguished chair.\n  The former chairman of our Communications Subcommittee and now \nranking member, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, has been in the \ntrenches all the time giving his leadership, and also most particularly \nto Judge Harold Greene. I do not see how, having worked intimately on \nthis particular measure, one Federal judge could do \n\n[[Page S690]]\nthe remarkable job that has been done by Judge Greene.\n  Now we move from the judiciary back over to the jurisdiction of the \nFederal Communications Commission, let it be noted, not on account of \nany inadequacy of the court in the person of Judge Harold Greene, but \nrather because no single entity could possibly enunciate and pursue the \npolicy of communications of the national Congress.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 10 \nminutes, under our agreement, to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the conference report on the \ntelecommunications reform legislation embodies a unique \ncharacterization. While this report is, in many respects, a substantial \nimprovement from either the Senate or House versions, it also invites \none of the most serious policy errors of this Congress.\n  This dramatic overhaul of our Nation's communications laws will, in \nmy judgement, lead to many significant advancements for American \nconsumers and help spur an already explosive industry. Indeed, \nconsumers will, in many areas, have more choices and lower prices. \nAlso, there will, without a doubt, be thousands of new jobs created by \nthe accelerated expansion of the telecommunications industry.\n  The legislation that came out of the conference report is better than \nthe bill that left the Senate and better than the bill that left the \nHouse. That is pretty unusual. We seldom ever see that in the Congress, \nbut this is better.\n  Last June, I voted against the telecommunications bill when it left \nthe Senate for a number of reasons. One reason being the lack of the \nrole of the Justice Department in determining when there is competition \nin the local exchange before the baby Bells will be allowed to go out \nand compete in the long distance service areas.\n  As some may recall, a couple of us stood on the Senate floor and led \nthe fight for a role of the Justice Department. We lost that vote, and \nI made the case then that this bill is supposed to be a bill about \ncompetition, a bill to promote, expand and foster competition when, in \nfact, if we do not have a Justice Department role, it is and can be \nincreasingly a bill about monopolies and concentration.\n  In the conference, they did address a Justice Department role. There \nwill now be a strong role for the Justice Department in evaluating \ncompetition in local exchanges before allowing the Bell Companies to go \nout and compete in long distance service. The role provided for the \nDepartment of Justice will ensure that competition and anti-trust \nissues will be reviewed adequately. This is an important guarantee that \ncompetition, and the innovation that results from healthy market \nforces, will be the centerpiece of our telecommunications policy.\n  The conference report contains a bulk of the key rural provisions \nthat are designed to protect rural areas. One provision will maintain \nthe universal service system which ensures that rural and high cost \nareas will continue to receive affordable phone services. This issue is \nof enormous importance to those of us from small States.\n  We have always felt that way about telephone service. A telephone in \nthe smallest city in North Dakota or the smallest town in North Dakota \nis as important as a telephone in lower Manhattan in New York because \none makes the other more valuable. The lack of universal opportunity \nand universal communications services is very troublesome. That is why \nwe have a universal service fund. This conference report protects that \nand does so in a meaningful way.\n  The conference report contains important provisions that will help \nlink our schools, libraries, and rural hospitals with advanced \ntelecommunications services.\n  I do not want to oversell this piece of legislation either. There are \ndeficiencies in it. There is one which gives me enormous pause and \nalmost persuaded me to continue voting against it. This report makes \nsome serious steps toward concentration in broadcasting by eliminating \nthe television ownership cap.\n  We now say you can own no more than 12 television stations covering \nno more than 25 percent of the population of the country. This report \nsays, ``By the way, we've changed that; you can own as many television \nstations as you want covering up to 35 percent of the population of \nthis country.'' I guarantee you, if that stands, a dozen years from now \nwe will have six, maybe eight major companies owning most of the \ntelevision stations in America. That is not a march toward competition; \nthat is a march backwards towards concentration. It makes no sense. I \nalmost voted against this bill because of that defect.\n  Today, Senators Hollings, Daschle, Kerrey, and I are introducing a \npiece of legislation that will call for the restoration of those \nownership limits. I believe very strongly that we ought not remove the \nownership caps.\n  Upon enactment of the conference report cable rates for 20 percent of \nAmericans will go up. While the bill maintains controls on cable rates \nfor the next 3 years, the fine print immediately lifts all controls for \nso-called small systems. Under this definition, over 60 percent of all \nNorth Dakota cable subscribers will likely see their rates increased.\n  Again, I want to say we have seen a virtual explosion in the \ntelecommunications area of this country. It has changed everything. I \ngrew up in a town of 300 people. Every day that I went to school I \nunderstood, and everybody in our town understood, our major \ndisadvantage was that we lived too far from everybody. We could not \nhave a manufacturing plant because we were too remote, we were too far.\n  Mr. President, do you know what telecommunications has done? \nTelecommunications makes Regent, ND, as close to Manhattan as is the \nHudson River. The telecommunications revolution has eliminated a whole \nrange of products and services, and the disadvantage of geography.\n  We see telecommunications firms springing up all over the country in \nrural areas. Why? Because geography is no longer a disadvantage. We see \nbreathtaking changes occurring all over this country with firms that \nhave innovative approaches to transmitting information, to new \ntelephone services.\n  We are going to see cable companies compete with new telephone \nservices and new transmission of data. We are going to see broadcast \nsignals change dramatically to be able to transmit information \nservices. Everything is changing. There will be circumstances in our \nfuture in which you will have access to every corner of this country \nand probably every corner of the globe with the latest information and \nwith the most breathtaking technology that any of us can imagine. All \nof this is occurring despite the fact that our communications laws are \n61 years old and in desperate need of revision.\n\n  Again, let me say that it is unusual to come to the floor and say \nthis is a better bill than the bill that left the Senate, or the House \nlast year, and this advances the interests of telecommunications in \nthis country. The people who worked on this bill did awfully good work, \nand I commend them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his leadership and participation within the committee. \nThroughout the entire debate, it was his influence, and he almost won a \nvote on the floor. At one time, it seemed down in the well here he had \nprevailed. That kind of pressure I welcome, because I happen to have \nagreed with him. But you have to get together in a bipartisan fashion \nin order to get things done. I emphasize that. I will also join as a \ncosponsor on the bill of the distinguished Senator. I think the Senator \nfrom Vermont momentarily is proceeding to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask a question, Mr. President, the Senator is \ncorrect. I did prevail on a vote on the Senate floor, and dinner \nintervened, and about eight people came back with arms in slings and we \nhad another vote and it turns out that some people changed their minds \nover dinner, and I lost. Some of that was remedied later.\n  One additional comment. The reason competition is so important--and \nthe Senator has talked about it--is that we have seen the result in \nlong distance. We have 500 companies in long distance competing \naggressively in this country, and prices have dropped 60 percent. \n\n[[Page S691]]\n That is good for this country. We want to make sure the companies \ncompeting in those circumstances do not face unfair competition. That \nis why we were so concerned about the Justice role. I appreciate the \nwork the Senator did to restore the role of the Justice Department in \nconference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the chairman yield me 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think this is among one of the most \nsignificant days I have been here on the floor of the Senate. The 1934 \nCommunications Act has served this Nation well. It brought us from a \ncountry with a fledgling communications system to the age of \ntelecommunications. And now with the advent of digital communications \nbecoming universal, this bill is absolutely necessary to assure the \nexpansion of these industries that depend upon telecommunications.\n  This is not a total deregulation bill. It is not time yet for a total \nderegulation bill. We are dealing with a bill that lessens regulation. \nBut it is not a re-regulation bill. It begins to bring into our present \nsystem the total power of competition, with the approval of the \nNational Government.\n\n  I think one needs only to look at the definitions to see the scope of \nthis bill as compared to the 1934 act. Look at it: Dialing parity, \nexchange access, information service, interLATA services, local \nexchange carriers, network elements, number portability, rural \ntelephone companies, telecommunications, telecommunications carrier. If \nyou look at the scope of the definitions alone, it signifies the \nchanges in our system that are driven by telecommunications.\n  I am particularly pleased to be here with the two leaders of our \ncommittee, who have worked so hard--Senator Pressler, as chairman and \nSenator Hollings, the ranking member and former chairman. We have \nworked many years now to bring us to this day, where we could literally \nsay that we are ready now to take the telecommunications industry of \nthe United States into the 21st century.\n  In doing so, we have been careful to recognize that there are places \nin the country that have not been totally served by the existing \ntelephone and information communications system. This bill has \nextensive universal service concepts. It has specific provisions \nregarding telecommunications services for health care providers, \neducation providers, education and secondary schools. It is a bill, the \nscope of which I think every American is going to have, at some time, \nreason to understand.\n  I am going to present here, soon, a unanimous-consent request to \nassure that there will be sufficient copies printed so that we can \nimmediately send a copy of this conference report to those people in \nour individual States that must have this law available as soon as it \nis signed.\n  I believe you could literally say, without being thought of as \nimproper at all, that this is going to be the telecommunications \n``bible.'' This is a bill that sets new parameters. It sets new \nrequirements. It changes the authority of the Federal Communications \nCommission. It deals with the scope of the authority of the State \ncommissioners, as well as with the regulation of utilities. In some \nplaces, it preempts State and local authorities, which is something I \nam very, very slow to do, but in this instance, I agree that it is \nnecessary.\n  The real reason, I think, for the application of this now relates \nback to the suggestion I made to the Congress many years ago that we \nought to stop having lotteries for the excess capacity on the broadcast \nspectrum. In days gone by, Mr. President, for $20, you would file an \napplication without having any interest at all in the broadcast system \nor the telecommunications system, and if there was a spectrum \navailable, there would be a lottery. If you were lucky, you then got \nthe spectrum license, and immediately the world beat a path to your \ndoor to get the certificate that you had just won in a lottery.\n  We thought, and I thought, that we ought to auction that available \nspectrum, which is, after all, something that belongs to the public. I \nfelt it had a substantial chance to bring in revenue. Mr. President, \nthe first estimate we got from the Congressional Budget Office, if \nmemory serves me, was that it would bring in about $250 million if we \nauctioned these licenses rather than having lotteries. I remember a \nconversation very well with the Chairman of the FCC, Reed Hunt, where \nhe told me they had taken in $12 billion last year from the auction of \nspectrum licenses.\n\n  We now are in the budget process of planning additional amounts to \ncome in from spectrum. As we do so--and there has been discussions here \non the floor--we have to keep in mind the equities of the situation and \nthe fact that the telecommunications system is not all going to \ntransition to digital concepts immediately. It is going to take time, \nand it is going to take the formation of a substantial amount of \ncapital to be able to utilize the powers and privileges that are \navailable to the American business and American public under this bill.\n  I hope everyone realizes it is not going to happen overnight. There \nmay be some substantial challenges in court to some of these \nprovisions. We are not unanimous here, and certainly the industry is \nnot unanimous in terms of every provision in the bill. But I view this \nbill as an interim measure, Mr. President. I hope that our successors \nin the Senate, within 10 or 15 years, will move forward and take us \ninto an era where there is even greater impact of competition and of \nthe marketplace, and a reduced need for any Government involvement in \nthis system. I described once to a friend of mine that I believe the \ncurrent system is a series of playing fields, but they are on different \nlevels. It is like they are on different levels of a very tall \nbuilding. We have been talking, in the past, about trying to level the \nplaying field. But you could not do it because some were on one floor \nand some on another, and now we have tried to find a way to literally \nlevel the playing field and set down the rules for competition. I do \nbelieve that we have succeeded. Even though I still have some \nreservation as to portions of this bill, as I know others do. We have \nsucceeded.\n\n  There was a reluctance on the part of many people to present this \nbill to the Congress. I am glad it has come because I think its time \nhas come. We have spent, those of us on the Commerce Committee now, I \nthink, the last 4 years working on a version of this bill. This means, \nnow, that we have the chance to send to the President an advanced \ntelecommunications and information bill that is generally accepted. \nThere is a general consensus that this is timely and that the \nprovisions are right. Those who have reservations, I hope they will be \ncareful, because I think to force this country back to relying once \nagain on the 1934 Act would be wrong.\n  The Members of the House who worked on this bill, particularly \nChairman Bliley, I think deserve substantial credit. And we ought to \nhave credit here for the staff. I hope my staff assistant joins me \nsoon, but Earl Comstock, who has worked with the Commerce Committee as \none of the draftsmen on this bill, joins the ranks of a few members of \nthe staff who literally deserve credit for what they have done to bring \nus together by getting the language that meets our needs and eliminates \nthe controversy among us over particular provisions.\n  I am very pleased to be able to present this bill and be part of the \ngroup that presents this bill to the Senate. I have signed the \nconference report. Not all of us did. I do think it is imperative we \nact, and I congratulate the leader for being willing to bring this bill \nforward under these circumstances today.\n  Let me once again thank Senator Pressler for his leadership on our \nside, for the hard work that he has done. As he pointed out to others, \nhe has been on call and so have the rest of us, literally daily and \nthrough the weekends and on holidays as our staff people labor to carry \nout the instructions that we had given them and to reflect the \ndecisions we made accurately in the text of this bill.\n  I have followed drafting of legislative bills now for a substantial \nportion of my life, Mr. President. I think this is the finest drafted \nbill I have been able to participate in. I congratulate the staff \nmembers who worked so hard and so long.\n  Let me say to my good friend, the former chairman of the committee, \n\n[[Page S692]]\n  Senator Hollings, I know how hard he worked in the last session, and \nSenator Pressler and I joined and worked hard with him, trying to get \nthe bill during the period that he was chairman. This is a bipartisan \nbill. I think, by passing this bill, we may send a signal to the \nCongress. It is time we stop the fighting among us and start getting \ndown to passing the laws that the Nation needs to provide the new job \nopportunities for the next century.\n  As Chairman Pressler has said, this is the largest jobs bill that has \never been before the Senate. This has more to do with developing new \ntechnologies, implementing new technologies, and stimulating the growth \nof new business than any bill I have ever been involved with.\n  I am delighted to be able to be here. As a matter of fact--again, I \nwill yield in a moment, but I want to reserve a portion of the time to \nbe able to ask later for agreement to the unanimous consent agreements \nbeing framed that will make available immediately an additional 5,000 \ncopies of this as a Senate document so we can distribute this as soon \nas it is available.\n  I come from a State, Mr. President, one-fifth the size of the United \nStates. It is rural in nature. We have a small population. We have \npeople in our State who are just now getting telephone service as known \nto the rest of the country for the whole century, almost. Now, what we \nhave assured here, as this program goes forward, is that universal \nservice will be available to rural areas. It will be the state-of-the-\nart telecommunications system. It will mean that the small schools in \nrural America will have access to modern technology, and can \nparticipate through telecommunications. It means that telemedicine will \nnow come to my State.\n  My State, when I first came here, had no assistance whatever for \npeople in small villages. They had to find their way to Indian \nhospitals in regional areas. We created a system of clinics. Those \nclinics are, by and large, operated by young women from the villages \nwho have a high school education and some technical training now. This \nbill means telecommunications will bring telemedicine in. They will be \nable to have a direct exposure of patients to doctors miles and miles \naway. They will be able to get assistance in dealing with mothers who \nhave complications in pregnancies.\n  This bill, above all the things I have dealt with--in particular \nuniversal service, eligible telecommunications carriers, and rate \nintegration, opens the whole horizon of telecommunications to the \npeople of this country, and it does so on a fair basis. It has been \ncriticized by some, but the universal service provisions that I \nmentioned when I first started my comments here, I think are the most \nimportant to me. They mean that rural America will come into the 21st \ncentury with everyone else as far as telecommunications is concerned. I \ncould not be more happy that the bill is here. I could not be more \nproud of those who have worked on it and to be able to be part of the \ngroup that presents it to the Senate. I urge its early approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I pay tribute to Senator Stevens of Alaska. He is the \nfather of spectrum auctions. In my opinion, he is a real U.S. Senator. \nEverybody seems to be leaving the Senate, and they get a 21-gun salute \nwhen they leave. Some stay and do the hard work on difficult bills. Ted \nStevens is such a man. He and Senator Hollings are examples of people \nwho stay and do public service--honest, hard-working experts on this \ntechnical legislation.\n  Some day I will be a professor in a university, I hope, out in \nwestern South Dakota. One of my lectures will be on real U.S. \nSenators--those who are not necessarily media stars, but who do the \nhard, honest work on the technical things, the real U.S. Senators. \nCertainly Ted Stevens is one of those, along with Senator Hollings. I \nbelieve both are in about their fifth term, and if they announced they \nwere retiring, they would get a 21-gun salute.\n  I thank Ted Stevens, the father of spectrum auctions and one of the \noriginators of this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in the comments of my \nchairman. There is not any question that we would not have this bill if \nwe did not have Ted Stevens and his wonderful leadership and work. He \ntook over the so-called farm team.\n  We have been working for 4 years, as the Senator from South Dakota \nknows. The farm team, the rural areas--we wanted to protect those. We \nlearned in airline deregulation that we did not protect the rural \nareas, sparsely settled areas. So we made, under the leadership of \nSenator Stevens, requirements that any competition, any competitor \ncoming in must serve the entire area, and the States had the authority \nto say how that competition would develop in the rural areas.\n  We provided infrastructure sharing with the RBOC's, and on down the \nlist. That is all attributed to the wisdom of our distinguished Senator \nand colleague from Alaska. I join in the complimentary remarks made by \nmy distinguished chairman.\n  The Senator from Vermont has given leadership to this from the very \nbeginning and has had various provisions in the bill while we debated \nit on the floor, and I want to thank him publicly for his leadership. I \nyield now 10 minutes under our time agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from South Carolina, \na man whom I have been privileged to serve with in my whole Senate \ncareer. He was already a senior Member of the Senate when I came here. \nI appreciate all the help he has given me. I appreciate the fact that \nhe and the chairman were able to protect the Breaux-Leahy amendment on \n1-plus dialing parity as part of the conference report to permit \nintraLATA toll dialing parity requirements to stand in States that \nalready ordered it by December 19, 1995, and in single-LATA States like \nVermont. Preserving this amendment, which Senator Breaux and I worked \nout on this floor, has helped my State.\n  There are so many things I like about this bill. For example, the \nconference agreement places restrictions on buyouts between phone \ncompanies and cable. The conference agreement also includes a very \nstrong savings clause to make clear that mergers between companies in \nthe media and communications markets are subject to a thorough \nantitrust review.\n  Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower \nprices and greater choices for consumers. So, while there are some \nimprovements in this legislation that I support, I will not be voting \nin favor.\n  I have expressed my concern on the lack of a stronger Department of \nJustice role in evaluating the anticompetitive effect of a Bell \noperating company's entry into the long-distance market, as well as my \nconcern that this legislation is placing censorship restrictions on the \nInternet. As a user of the Internet and as one who communicates \nelectronically with constituents and others around the country, I am \nconcerned this legislation places restrictions on the Internet that \nwill come back to haunt us.\n  I know these provisions were done with the best of intentions. All of \nus, 100 Members of the U.S. Senate, oppose the idea of child \npornography. All of us abhor child pornographers and child abusers. I \nam one person who has prosecuted, convicted, and sent to prison child \nabusers. We do not have to demonstrate our adherence to that principle. \nBut I am concerned we have not upheld our adherence to the first \namendment with the proposed restrictions on the Internet. That creates \nan overwhelming barrier for me.\n  I am also concerned that after passing the 1992 Cable Act over a \nPresidential veto, that we are now taking the lid off all cable rates \nin 3 years, whether or not there is competition in cable service. \nBefore the 1992 Cable Act was passed, cable rates were rising three \ntimes faster than inflation rates. I do not think you can name a \nconsumer in this country who did not feel that he or she was being \ngouged.\n  But the law worked. Since passage of the law, consumers have saved an \nestimated $3.5 billion in their monthly bills. And, as the rates have \ngone down, more people have signed up. In 1994 alone, nearly 2.5 \nmillion new customers have signed up for cable service.\n  I do not want to see a repeat of the skyrocketing cable rates that \nprompted passage of that law. It is too easy to see what might happen \nif the cable companies are not restrained, either by competition or by \nlaws. \n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n  I do not have cable in my home in Vermont. I live out in the country \nwhere we get 1\\1/2\\ channels. I think sometimes I am blessed by that \nbecause I actually get to read, which is a good way of obtaining the \nnews. You can make up your own mind. You can read in detail or not, and \nnot be limited by the photographs selected by multimillion-dollar news \nmedia.\n  But I digress.\n  With the cable company I subscribe to here, you get these $2 remote \ncontrols but they charge you $3 a month, or something like that. They \ncan give you antiquated equipment and charge as though you were getting \ngood equipment and even make it impossible to watch one show and tape \nanother one. All the things that sound great are not available because \nthere is no competition. We are about to make that even worse. We had \nsome restrictions in the cable bill, but I am afraid we are going to \nlet them go before we have the protections provided by effective \ncompetition.\n  I must admit, having said all that, I do not envy the managers of \nthis bill. This is probably the most complex piece of legislation I \nthink I have seen in 21 years. It has probably had more conflicting \ninterests that had to be reconciled than I have seen in 21 years.\n  I commend the Senators who had the ability to stick it out and bring \nit this far. Senators still have to determine whether they will vote \nfor it or not, but whether you like or dislike different parts, we can \nall appreciate the hard work and long hours it took.\n  The telecommunications legislation that has emerged from the \nconference will have an enormous impact on multibillion dollar cable, \nphone and broadcast industries and, most importantly, on the American \nconsumer. This legislation will affect how much we pay and from whom we \ncan obtain cable, TV, phone, fax, and information services. It will \nalso, unfortunately, affect what we can say online.\n  We have heard a lot about the support for this legislation by the \nBell phone companies, AT and other long-distance phone companies, the \ngiant cable companies and other media interests. But while they have \nbeen arguing over business advantages, who have been advocates for \nAmerican consumers and fundamental American values, like first \namendment free speech rights?\n  Most of us have no choice who gives us cable TV service or our local \nphone service. Whether or not the service is good, we are stuck with \nour local phone or cable company. And, if the price is too high, our \nonly choice is to drop the service altogether. The goal of this \ntelecommunications legislation must be to foster competition, not just \nfor the short term, but over the long haul. Competition will give \nconsumers lower prices and more choices than simply dropping a service.\n  I raised a number of questions about the Senate-passed bill, and \nfought for several amendments that in my view would have made the bill \nmore consumer-friendly, pro-competitive and constitutional. I commend \nthe conferees for the progress they made in several of these areas, \nwhich I detail below.\n  First, the bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have \npermitted our local phone monopoly to buy out our local cable monopoly \nso that consumers have even less choice rather than more. Senator \nThurmond, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nAntitrust Subcommittee, and I raised concerns that allowing such \nunlimited buyouts between monopoly phone companies and cable companies \ncould result in giant monopolies providing both phone and video \nprogramming services.\n  The conference agreement makes a significant improvement in these \nprovisions by limiting buy-outs between cable and phone companies to \nrural areas where fewer than 35,000 people live. The conference \nagreement also limits a phone company's purchase of cable systems to \nless than 10 percent of the households in its service area. This will \ninsure that a single large phone company cannot simply buy up all the \nsmall cable systems serving the small towns in its service area. This \npart of the conference agreement helps fulfill the promise of the bill \nto maximize competition between local phone companies and cable \ncompanies.\n  The conference agreement also contains a very strong ``savings \nclause'' to make clear that mergers between cable and telephone \ncompanies, or between independent telephone companies or between any \ncompanies in the media and communications markets are subject to a \nthorough antitrust review under the normal Hart-Scott-Rodino process. \nNothing in this conference agreement even impliedly preempts our \nFederal antitrust laws. Mega-mergers between telecommunications giants, \nsuch as the rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or the \ngigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns about \nconcentrating control in a few gigantic companies of both the content \nand means of distributing the information and entertainment American \nconsumers receive. Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to \nassure lower prices and greater choices for consumers. Rigorous \noversight and enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more important \nthan ever to insure that such megamergers do not harm consumers.\n\n  I have been particularly concerned about how well the \ntelecommunications legislation protects universal service. Vermont is \namong the most rural States in the country, but those of us who live \nthere do not want to be denied access to the advanced \ntelecommunications services our urban neighbors enjoy. I, therefore, \ncommend the conference report for including the Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-\nKerry provision requiring preferential rates for telecommunications \nservices provided to schools, libraries, and hospitals in rural areas, \nwhich I supported. This requirement provides an important building \nblock to ensure universal access to advanced telecommunications \nservices. Students whose families cannot afford sophisticated hi-\ntechnology services at home will be able to use those services at \nschool or at their neighborhood public library. Rural hospitals will be \nable to use advanced technology to provide better treatment at lower \ncosts to their patients. This provision assures the broadest possible \naccess to advanced telecommunications services.\n  I am also pleased to see that the conference report includes the \naddition of a State-appointed consumer advocate to the newly created \nFederal-State joint board. This board will have the critical task of \npreserving and expanding universal service, and I agree with the \nconference that a consumer advocate will bring a necessary and \nimportant perspective to that task.\n  The conference agreement also adopts a provision designed to make \ncable equipment cheaper and easier to use for all consumers, who are \ntired of paying rent for cable converter boxes and struggling with \nmultiple clickers for the TV set-top box and their video machines. This \nprovision is one that Senator Thurmond and I urged to be included as \npart of the telecommunications legislation in the last Congress. Under \nthe conference agreement, the FCC is directed to assure the competitive \navailability to consumers of converter boxes and other electronic \nequipment used to access cable video programming services.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I remain ready to address the \ncopyright issues that will arise as a result of this legislation. There \nwas no consideration of copyright matters during the debate over this \nlegislation and I commend the conferees for not prejudging these \nmatters.\n  The bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have unnecessarily \npreempted State efforts to promote the development of competition in \nlocal phone service. Richard Cowart, the chairman of the Vermont Public \nService Board, provided invaluable testimony to the Antitrust \nSubcommittee last year about the detrimental preemption provisions in \nthe bill.\n  For example, this bill rolled-back State requirements to implement \n``1+'' dialing parity for short-haul toll calls. A number of States \nalready require dialing parity. Without ``1+'' dialing parity, \nconsumers must dial lengthy access codes to use carriers other than the \nlocal phone company for in-State toll calls. IntraLATA ``1+'' dialing \nparity encourages competition in the in-State toll market and helps \nconsumers.\n  As I noted before, I am pleased that the Breaux-Leahy amendment on \n``1+'' dialing parity is part of the conference report. The report \npermits dialing parity requirements to stand in the States \n\n[[Page S694]]\nthat already ordered it by December 19, 1995, and in single-LATA \nStates, including Vermont. The prohibition against ``1+'' dialing \nparity for intraLATA calls in nongrandfathered States expires at a date \ncertain 3 years after enactment.\n  In addition, the Commerce Committee bill would have prohibited State \nregulators from using rate-of-return regulation for large phone \ncompanies. As Chairman Cowart of the Vermont Public Service Board made \nclear when he testified, this prohibition would have tied the hands of \nState regulators trying to adopt different forms of pricing regulation \nto stimulate local phone service competition. The conference agreement \ntook a constructive step by dropping the prohibition on rate-of-return \nregulation.\n  Despite this significant progress, the conference agreement still \nsuffers from such serious flaws that I cannot support it.\n  First, and foremost, the conference agreement contains \nunconstitutional provisions that would impose far-reaching new Federal \ncrimes for so-called indecent speech. I do not often agree with Speaker \nGingrich, but I share his view that this legislation violates free \nspeech rights.\n  Apparently, the conferees also have serious doubts about its \nconstitutionality. They added a section to speed up judicial review to \nsee if the legislation passes constitutional muster. In my view, this \nlegislation will not pass that test.\n  You would think the telecommunications conference would have their \nhands full with just the task of changing our communications laws to \nallow new competition among phone companies, broadcasters, cable \noperators, and wireless systems while also protecting universal service \nand other appropriate consumer protections. Yet, they also decided to \nadd new Federal crimes, despite the absence of any hearings on these \nprovisions, or any Senate Judiciary Committee members on the \nconference. I called for an in-depth, fast-track study of these issues \nbefore we took precipitous action in legislation. That study was \nincluded in the House-passed bill but dropped by the conference, in \nfavor of provisions that will ban constitutionally protected speech on \nthe Internet.\n  I note that the explanatory statement accompanying the conference \nreport refers to a July 24, 1995 hearing, at which I participated, \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee on ``online indecency, obscenity, \nand child endangerment.'' This hearing did not address the \nconstitutionality of the indecency standard adopted by the conference \nreport, nor the least restrictive means by which to implement such a \nstandard, particularly in an electronic environment like the Internet. \nThe hearing referred to in the statement of the conference committee \ndealt with stalking, obscenity and indecency with regard to an entirely \ndifferent bill, S. 892. No witnesses at the hearing defended the \nconstitutionality of the indecency standard in the telecommunications \nbill. Nor did any witness testifying in support of S. 892 examine in \ndetail whether the indecency standard as applied to online \ncommunications complies with the least restrictive means test. On the \ncontrary, several witnesses questioned whether any indecency standard \ncould be constitutional as applied to online communications. Thus, \nCongress has opted to appear tough on pornography without examining the \nconstitutional implications of this unprecedented restriction on \nfreedom of expression.\n  Let us make no mistake about what these provisions in the conference \nagreement will do and how it could affect you.\n  The bill will make it a felony crime to send a private e-mail message \nwith an indecent or filthy word that you hope will annoy another \nperson, even if you were responding in kind to an e-mail message you \nreceived. Who knows when you might annoy another person with your e-\nmail message? To avoid liability under this legislation, users of e-\nmail will have to ban curse words and other expressions that might be \ncharacterized as offensive from their online vocabulary.\n  The bill will punish with 2-year jail terms any Internet user who \nuses one of the seven dirty words in a message to a minor. You will \nrisk criminal liability by using a computer to share with a child any \nmaterial containing indecent passages. In some areas of the country, a \ncopy of Seventeen magazine, could be viewed as indecent because it \ncontains information on sex and sexuality. Indeed, this magazine is \namong the 10 most frequently challenged school library materials in the \ncountry.\n\n  This legislation sweeps more broadly than just regulating e-mail \nmessages sent to children. It will impose felony penalties for using an \nindecent four-letter word, or discussing material deemed to be \nindecent, on electronic bulletin boards or Internet chat areas \naccessible to children.\n  Once this bill becomes law, no longer will Internet users be able to \nengage in free-wheeling discussions in news groups and other areas on \nthe Internet accessible to minors. They will have to limit all language \nused and topics discussed to that appropriate for kindergartners, just \nin case a minor clicks onto the discussion. No literary quotes from \nracy parts of Catcher in the Rye or Ulysses will be allowed. Certainly \nonline discussions of safe sex practices, of birth control methods, and \nof AIDS prevention methods will be suspect. Any user who crosses the \nvague and undefined line of indecency will be subject to two years in \njail and fines.\n  Imagine if the Whitney Museum, which currently operates a Web page, \nwere dragged into court for permitting representations of \nMichelangelo's David to be looked at by kids.\n  The conferees call this a display prohibition and explain that it \n``applies to content providers who post indecent material for online \ndisplay without taking precautions that shield that material from \nminors.''\n  What precautions are the conferees talking about? What precautions \nwill Internet users have to take to avoid criminal liability? These \nusers, after all, are the ones who provide the content read in news \ngroups and on electronic bulletin boards. The legislation gives the FCC \nauthority to describe the precautions that can be taken to avoid \ncriminal liability. All Internet users will have to wait and look to \nthe FCC for what they must do to protect themselves from criminal \nliability.\n  We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of \nthis legislation has had on online service providers. A few weeks ago, \nAmerica Online deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated with \nfellow breast cancer survivors online. Why? Because, according to AOL, \nshe used the vulgar word ``breast''. AOL later apologized and indicated \nit would permit the use of that word where appropriate.\n  Complaints by German prosecutors prompted another online service \nprovider to cut off subscriber access to over 200 Internet news groups \nwith the words ``sex'', ``gay'' or ``erotica'' in the name. They \ncensored such groups as ``clarinet.news.gays,'' which is an online \nnewspaper focused on gay issues, and ``gay-net.coming-out'', which is a \nsupport group for gay men and women dealing with going public with \ntheir sexual orientation.\n  What is next? The Washington Post reports today that one software \nprogram used to protect children from offensive material blocked the \nWhite House home page because it showed pictures of two couples \ntogether. Those two couples happened to be the President and Mrs. \nClinton and the Vice-President and Mrs. Gore. Will Federal Government \ncensors do any better when they dictate blocking technologies?\n  The Communications Decency Act is the U.S. Government's answer to the \nproblem that China is dealing with by creating an intranet. According \nto news reports, this censored version of the Internet allows Chinese \nusers online access to each other, but an official censor controls all \noutside access to the world-wide Internet.\n  We already have crimes on the books that apply to the Internet, by \nbanning obscenity, child pornography, and threats from being \ndistributed over computers. In fact, just before Christmas, the \nPresident signed a new law we passed last year sharply increasing \npenalties for child pornography and sexual exploitation crimes.\n  Unlike these current laws, which do not regulate constitutionally \nprotected speech, this legislation would censor indecent speech. While \nthe proponents of the proposals claim that they do not ban indecency--\nonly prohibit making it available to minors--the practical result of \nsuch a restriction on the \n\n[[Page S695]]\nInternet is the criminalization of all indecent speech.\n  Because indecency means very different things to different people, an \nunimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic, scientific and \nother speech will disappear in this new medium. What about, for \nexample, the university health service that posts information online \nabout birth control and protections against the spread of AIDS? With \nmany students in college under 18, this information would likely \ndisappear under threat of prosecution. In bookstores and on library \nshelves the protection of indecent speech is clear, and the courts are \nunwavering. Altering the protections of the first amendment for online \ncommunications could cripple this new mode of communication.\n  The Internet is a great new communications medium. We should not \nunderestimate the effect that the heavy-hand of Government regulation \nwill have on its future growth both here and abroad. With the passage \nof this bill the U.S. Government is paving the way for the censorship \nof Internet speech. Apparently, China already censors weather \npredictions from foreigners. What do we think the Iranian Government \nwill make illegal? What could Libya ban and criminalize?\n  Also, as I alluded earlier, I continue to have grave concerns about \nletting the Bell operating companies, with their monopoly control over \nthe phone wires going into our homes, enter the long-distance market \neven when the Department of Justice finds an anticompetitive impact. I \nsupported efforts to amend the bill and give the Justice Department the \nauthority to review the Bell companies' long-distance entry in advance. \nThese efforts were unsuccessful.\n  The conference report requires the FCC to consult with the Justice \nDepartment and give substantial weight to the Justice Department's \nopinion, in determining whether to permit entry of a Bell company into \nlong-distance service. Although this provision strengthens the Senate-\npassed bill, it does not go far enough. It fails to achieve the balance \nproposed by the Commerce Committee in 1994. In the end, the FCC is the \nfinal decision maker and can decide to disregard the Justice \nDepartment's evaluation of the anticompetitive effect of letting the \nBell companies offer long-distance service.\n  The conference agreement would permit a Bell company to offer long \ndistance service in its own region, upon approval by the FCC and after \nsatisfying an in-region checklist. This checklist could be satisfied by \nthe presence of a competitor with its own networking facilities. \nDespite recognition by the conferees that building local telephone \nnetwork facilities will require a significant investment in time and \nmoney, the bill allows only 10 months after enactment for facilities-\nbased competitors to get established and apply for interconnection and \naccess to the Bell company's network. Absent a facilities-based \ncompetitor in those 10 months, I fear that the language of this bill \ncould be interpreted broadly to allow the Bell operating company to \nseek approval to enter long-distance service, and authorize the FCC to \ngrant that approval, even without any actual competition in local \nphone service. The short time-frame provided in the bill to establish a \nfacilities-based competitor, compounded by the lack of a dispositive \nJustice Department role in the approval process, could provide the \nincumbent Bell company with the ability to use its stranglehold \nmonopoly on local service to leverage its new long-distance service, to \nthe detriment of consumers. Regulators will have to be vigilant to this \npotential consequence.\n\n  As I noted, the conference agreement takes the lid off all cable \nrates in 3 years, whether or not there is any competition in cable \nservice.\n  We passed the 1992 Cable Act over a Presidential veto because \nconsumers were being gouged by cable company monopolists. Cable rates \nwere rising three times faster than the inflation rate. Consumers \ndemanded action to stop the rising cable rates. This law worked. Since \npassage of that law, consumers have saved an estimated $3.5 billion in \ntheir monthly rates. As rates have gone down, more people have signed \nup.\n  Congress has already responded once to complaints of cable \nsubscribers in the 1992 Cable Act. I, for one, do not want to see a \nrepeat of the sky-rocketing cable rates that prompted passage of that \nlaw. The conferees must be predicting that, in 3 years, cable companies \nwill face plenty of competition from satellite systems and phone \ncompanies offering video services. But if their prediction is accurate, \nand the cable companies faced effective competition, they would be \nderegulated under the 1992 Cable Act anyway. This is a precipitous \naction to sunset a law that worked to reduce cable rates on the hope \nthat effective competition will grow over the next 3 years.\n  Finally, the conference report requires the FCC to preempt State or \nlocal rules that may have the effect of barring any entity from \nproviding telecommunications services. Although the report says this is \nnot supposed to affect local management of public rights-of-way or \nlocal safeguards for the rights of consumers, in Vermont, citizens are \nrightly concerned that rules designed to protect our environment and \nhealth may be preempted by bureaucrats at the FCC who are focused on \nhelping entrants in the telecommunications business.\n  I recognize the need for an over-haul of our communications laws. We \nhave not kept up with the dramatic technological changes that are \nfueling the Information Age. But I cannot support this bill, which \nthreatens fundamental constitutional rights of free speech over the \nInternet and provides insufficient consumer protection from \nmonopolistic pricing for cable and telephone service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                            Commending Staff\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I should pay tribute to the staff on \nboth sides who have worked so hard on this.\n  On our side of the aisle there has been Paddy Link, Katie King, \nDonald McClellan and Earl Comstock. On the Democratic side, Kevin \nCurtin, John Windhausen, Kevin Joseph and Chris McClean. The \ncommittee's legislative counsel, Lloyd Ator. All this staff has done a \nmagnificent job.\n  Let me also mention the dilligent efforts of David Wilson, Mark Buse, \nBrett Scott, Jeanne Bumpus, Dave Hoppe, Kevin Pritchett, Margaret \nCummisky, Tom Zoeller and Cheryl Bruner.\n  I do not know if people know it, but the only days the staff got off \nwere Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and barely Christmas Eve, in \ndrafting this technical legislation and in all the negotiations. This \npiece of legislation was drafted entirely by Senators and staff. Many \ntimes there have been accusations that legislation was drafted by \noutsiders, but this technical piece of legislation was drafted line by \nline by Senators and staff. Many times we would have to call a Senator \non the weekends and ask about a line or word change.\n  I do not know if people realize how hard these staff people work. I \njust wanted to pay tribute to them because, to me this technical \ndocument is a remarkable achievement. They did it as public servants.\n  One day I went in on a Sunday and bought them some pizza. I said, \n``Someday a judge may look down upon you from his bench and say, \n`Obviously, counsel does not know what he or she is talking about.' And \nyou can look up at the judge and say, `Oh, yes, I do. I wrote that.' ''\n  That is not their motive. But these young people should be heralded. \nAgain, I pay tribute to the staff on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                            Commending Staff\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, awaiting the attendance here, to deliver \nhis comments, of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nKerrey, let me join with my distinguished chairman in thanking the \nhardest-working staff I have ever been associated with during my years.\n  The truth is, as the Senator from South Dakota has said, they only \nhad that 1 day off at Thanksgiving. We worked all weekends and \neverything else. But this started, really, in October 1993. We had \nworked very hard, gotten a three-fourths vote of the U.S. Senate on a \nmanufacturing bill. We learned the hard way that these entities, the \nvarious disciplines in telecommunications, had the power to obviate or \ncancel out the enactment or \n\n[[Page S696]]\npassage of any measure, once they got determined to do so. With a \nthree-fourths vote, we still could not pass the simple manufacturing \nbill, the text of which is already in this measure here as a minor item \ncompared to being a single bill.\n  So we agreed to work in a bipartisan fashion and bring in every week \nthe various interests involved--every Friday the regional Bell \ncompanies, the principals involved, and thereupon on every Monday, the \nvarious long distance carriers. They have been doing this now for the \npast almost 3 years.\n  So, I thank, as I pointed out, Paddy Link, Don McClellan over on the \nminority side--as well as Katie King and Earl Comstock. I particularly \nwant to thank for their guidance and counseling Kevin Curtin, John \nWindhausen, and Kevin Joseph on our Commerce Committee Democratic \nside--because I never really would be able to imbibe this entire \nmeasure without their help. They have really been in the trenches over \nthe many years. They have given expert advice. They have listened to \nall the parties. They know all the lawyers.\n  This town has 60,000 lawyers registered to practice before the \nDistrict of Columbia bar. I think 59,000 of them are in the \ncommunications discipline. And I think we met all 59,000, I am \nconvinced, in the last 3 years.\n  I also want to thank Jim Drewry, Yvonne Portee, Sylvia Cikins, Pierre \nGolpira, Lloyd Ator, and Joyce Kennedy of our Commerce Committee staff; \nJim Weber of Senator Daschle's leadership staff; Greg Simon for Vice \nPresident Gore; Steve Richetti for the White House; Carol Ann Bischoff \nfor Senator Kerrey; and the staff members of our Commerce Committee \nmembers. These include Margaret Cummisky for Senator Inouye, Tom \nZoeller and the late Martha Moloney for Senator Ford, Chris McLean for \nSenator Exon, Cheryl Bruner for Senator Rockefeller, Scott Bunton and \nCarole Grunberg for Senator Kerry, Mark Ashby and Thomas Moore for \nSenator Breaux, Andy Vermilye for Senator Bryan, and Greg Rohde for \nSenator Dorgan.\n  Let me also thank, Mr. President, talking about the bipartisan \nnature, the leadership over on the House side that we have the \nprivilege to work with. Because Chairman Dreier on the House side was a \ntiger on this measure. He was determined that we get this bill passed. \nIn fact, we were ready really before Christmas. And working with him, \nMr. Markey, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Fields--all on that Communications \nCommittee, a major committee over on the Judiciary Committee--Mr. Hyde, \nand Mr. Conyers, they all worked hand in glove to make sure that the \npublic interest was protected.\n\n  Particularly, since I mentioned the Judiciary Committee feature of \nthis measure, the Department of Justice was protected in the sense that \nwhat we did was have the savings clause for all antitrust laws \nincluded, positive language, and the substantial weight of the \nDepartment of Justice be given by the Federal Communications Commission \nin their decision.\n  I yield now to our distinguished colleague from Nebraska, Senator Bob \nKerrey, who has worked intimately with us. He was not on our \nCommunications Committee, but I thought he was by the way he attended \nthe meetings, and his staff was in there making suggestions and making \nsure that the public interest was protected.\n  So it is a particular pleasure for me at this time to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nand the Senator from South Dakota.\n  I believe this conference report is substantially improved from both \nthe House and the Senate bill. I voted against the bill when it left \nhere, and I intend to support the conference report in its current \nform.\n  I appreciate in particular the language that provides a more \nmeaningful role for the Department of Justice. I, frankly, would have \npreferred the language which the Commerce Committee produced last year. \nI think that would have been better than the 14-part interconnection \ncompetitive checklist requirement that is in there. But I think that a \nmeaningful role, including the substantial weight requirement for the \nDepartment of Justice, will make it more likely that we will see \ncompetition at the local level.\n  I appreciate very much the concern of both the chairman and the \nranking member, concern about including some good consumer protection \nprovisions as well as the inclusion of interconnectivity language, \nincidental interLATA relief for the RBOC's to provide Internet and \ninteractive distance learning services to K through 12 schools, and the \nso-called Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey, et al, language that will \nallow the K through 12 schools to be able to go either to the Public \nService Commission or the FCC. They will now have the force of law to \nbe able to argue for subsidized rates.\n  I particularly appreciate as well, finally, the inclusion of the so-\ncalled farm team provisions in the conference report.\n  Mr. President, when the request came for a unanimous consent on a \ntime agreement, I asked for 15 minutes. I do not know if it will take \nthat long given where I am right now in my comments.\n  I will observe, as I did on a number of occasions during the debate \nearlier on the bill, that this is a very unusual piece of legislation \nin that the demand for it is not coming from the citizens; it is really \ncoming from corporations, the whole range of corporations--I do not \nmean the RBOC's; I mean RBOC's, long-distance, cable, broadcast; all of \nthem are in this business--that feel the current law, which does not \nallow them to do a variety of things, is too restrictive. And they say, \nif you change the law and allow us to do these things, you are going to \ngenerate a lot of new economic activity and create new jobs. We have \nheard all kinds of representations about all the good things that are \ngoing to happen.\n  I am an advocate for embracing the future and changing the current \nlaw. So there is no question in my mind that the Communications Act \nneeds to be changed. But I am very mindful and very aware that the \ndemand for this change does not come from at least the citizens of \nNebraska, whom I represent. I did not hear any question in my \nreelection campaign in 1994 coming from citizens saying, ``Well, \nSenator, how do you feel about the regulation of local telephone, long \ndistance, and so forth, because I do not like the structure? I am \nunhappy with my phone, I am unhappy with my cable, or I am unhappy with \nmy network service, whatever it is I am buying.'' Yes. They might \ncomplain sometimes about the rates and have concerns about that sort of \nthing, and a lot of concern about the content, pornography, violence, \nand so forth. But nobody was really coming to me asking for this \nchange. This is Congress initiating change and saying it is going to be \ngood for the people.\n  It must be said, Mr. President, that that requires a substantial \namount of courage at the beginning. It is not my intention to come here \nand say that Members who are enthusiastic about this change are under \nthe influence of special interest money. That is not my point at all. I \nam not trying to say that any Member has been bought out or anything \nlike that. The problem, though, when you once cross the line, is \nsaying, OK, we are going to try to do something that is good for the \npeople. It seems to me that you have to do, in an irrationally cold-\nblooded way, an analysis of what the impact is going to be.\n  There are about 100 million households in the United States of \nAmerica, and we have achieved, over the 60 years of this Communications \nAct, a remarkable degree of not just penetration, but of universal \nservice. Ninety-four percent of all households today have a telephone. \nIt may be significantly lower than that when the Communications Act was \npassed in 1934. But we did not do it by saying let us let the market \nrun wild. We did it by monopoly, by creating a monopoly and giving \nmonopoly rights in 1934. We changed it substantially by divestiture. \nBut even with divestiture, we retained monopoly rights for local \ntelephone service. We have accomplished a remarkable thing.\n  Yes, there are market forces. There is lots of private capital. Most \nof these companies are private shareowner companies. But we have \nachieved not just universal service, but by all accounts the best \ntelephone and telecommunications system in the world, an active, \nvibrant industry, competitive industry, and it is a great success \nstory. \n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n  So when we radically alter the landscape, as we are with this \nlegislation, it seems to me appropriate to sort of ask ourselves: What \nis the consumer going to get out of it? I know the one thing that is \ngoing to happen is that the subsidy that has been in place for all \nthese years at the local level in order to achieve universal service is \ngoing to begin to come off. Say I have a market. If I am going to be \nout there trying to compete with a long distance company, to compete \nwith a cable company, whoever, at the local level, that subsidy is \ngoing to come off.\n  Indeed, the regional Bell operating company in our region has already \nindicated they would like to increase the residential rate by a $2 \nState subscriber-line charge in order to provide lower costs for long \ndistance. For those of us whose incomes are over $100,000, that sounds \nlike a pretty good deal. We have a lot of long distance charges. But \nthere are, I would surmise, a majority of Americans for whom long \ndistance is still a bit of a luxury. They budget it. They watch it. \nThey are careful about it. They do not have unlimited long distance \nservice. They may not come out so good in that transaction.\n  In fact, one of the things that is very often not understood in this \nwhole debate about universal service is there still is a substantial \nmeans test on it. Ninety-nine percent of the households in America with \nincomes over $100,000, which includes all of us in Congress, have \ntelephones. Only 75 percent with incomes under $5,000 have telephones, \nlargely because of cost. They probably would say, ``I cannot afford it. \nI cannot afford to buy it. So I am not going to have a telephone \nconnected to my house.''\n  There is a means test on these services. There is a means test as \nthese dollar figures go up for the cost of local service. I think you \nare going to see people say, ``I cannot afford it any longer. I cannot \nafford to pay the price.'' Though we have some protection in the farm \nteam universal service provisions, I think that we are going to have to \nbe alert in the first instance that there are going to be households \nout there currently able to afford the fare who are going to find \nthemselves saying, ``I cannot afford it any longer.''\n  I think, on the basis of policy, if the market does not get the job \ndone, we as Members of Congress are going to have to ask ourselves a \nquestion: Well, what is it like if you are in a household without a \ntelephone? How essential is it? How important, how valuable is it? One \nmeasure is going to be: Can I get out and talk to the people who may \nneed to come to my household and haul me to the hospital if I have a \nheart attack or some other sort of health problem?\n  But increasingly the question is going to be not only if I do not \nhave the dial tone, but if I do not have the volume, the enhanced \nservices, I may not be able to get as good an education as my neighbor, \nI may not be able to get as good a break with the economy, I may not be \nable to have a home-based company. One out of seven jobs in the State \nof Nebraska are self-employed today. We are seeing an increasing number \nof households that, in fact, are taking advantage of enhanced \ntelecommunications services. I think we are going to have to be alert \nto that in the second instance. Many Americans are not going to be able \nto buy enhanced services.\n  I think there is general agreement among Republicans and Democrats, \nbefore you ever get to the point of are we going to spend money, that \nthis land of opportunity ought to be a land of opportunity for \neverybody. That opportunity does not necessarily fall equally as a \nconsequence of your birth.\n  The next thing, Mr. President, that I think we are going to have to \nbe alert to is this question of the control of content. I have heard \nthe concentration debate. I appreciate very much the language changes \nmade in the legislation on media concentration. I think that we do have \nto worry about this even though there are all kinds of other choices \nout there.\n  All of us know it is the networks that dominate this deal. If the \nnetworks decide they want to raise a stink about something, they will \nraise a stink about something and they will drive it into the \nhousehold. If they decide they are not going to, as the distinguished \nmajority leader said earlier about the sale of digital spectrum, they \nare not going to say anything about it. They are not going to talk \nabout that ripoff. They are not going to talk about something that \nmight have an impact upon them.\n  This concentration issue is a very important issue, and we, it seems \nto me, are going to have to be alert to it and watch it very carefully \nin the aftermath of passing this conference report, and watch what \nhappens to universal service. Is there change in rural America? Are \nthere people who are genuinely not going to get service? We have \naccomplished a great thing in the United States of America with \nuniversal service.\n  Second, we are going to have to watch very carefully as to whether or \nnot people can afford to buy enhanced services. The laws of this land \nought to provide equal opportunity for all Americans who are willing to \nmake the effort. It ought to reward people who work hard and are \ndetermined through self-discipline to be a success. We need to be \ncareful over this legislation and watch in the aftermath and see what \nthe impact is going to be.\n  Finally, whether it is in education or whether it is in health care \nor whether it is merely trying to find out what is going on in your \ncountry with the budget and other sorts of things, we are going to have \nto pay a great deal of attention to content. Content determines what an \nindividual receives in their household. We do not want to follow this \nlegislation sort of blindly in presuming it is going to in all cases do \ngood.\n  Again, I intend to vote for the conference report. I appreciate very \nmuch the efforts made by the distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, and the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I think this conference report is substantially better \nthan the bill that we earlier passed. I believe it will in the main be \ngood for the economy, but there is a great deal of scrutiny that is \ngoing to have to occur in the aftermath of this legislation being \nenacted and signed by the President.\n  Mr. President, the conference report before us is substantially \nbetter than the bill that this body considered last summer for \ncompetition and consumers, for a number of reasons.\n  First, the House and Senate bills did not contain a meaningful role \nfor the Department of Justice [DOJ] in safeguarding competition before \nlocal telephone companies are allowed to enter new markets. Under the \nconference report, the DOJ's opinion on regional Bell operating company \n[RDOC] entry will be accorded substantial weight by the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] in its proceeding and will be included \nin the official record of decision.\n  Neither bill had sufficient provisions to ensure that the local \ntelephone market was open to competition before the RBOC's entered long \ndistance. The conference report provides that before RBOC's can enter \nlong distance, they must complete an interconnection checklist, have a \nfacilities-based competitor and satisfy a public interest analysis at \nthe FCC. They are required to offer long distance through a separate \nsubsidiary for 3 years, which the FCC can extend for a longer period.\n  The underlying legislation also would have preempted the States from \nusing rate-of-return regulation and forced them to use price caps or \nalternative rate regulation. Under the conference report, States \ncontinue to regulate local phone rates as they choose.\n  I strongly supported retention in the final bill of the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey [SREK] provision--which was not included in the \nHouse bill--that will ensure that K-12 schools, libraries, and rural \nhospitals have access to advanced telecommunications services. SREK was \nretained in the conference report, and there are important provisions \nto help rural areas, health care providers, libraries, and citizens \nwith disabilities.\n  Both House and Senate bills permitted waiver of the cable-telco \nbuyout provision. These were overly broad, and would have permitted an \nexcessive number of in-region buyouts between telephone companies and \ncable operators. The conference report limits cable-telco mergers to \ncommunities with fewer than 35,000 inhabitants that are outside of \nurban areas according to the Census Bureau.\n  Both bills also deregulated cable monopolies before there was \neffective \n\n[[Page S698]]\ncompetition. The conference report deregulates small cable systems only \nimmediately, and does not deregulate enhanced basic programming for all \ncable systems until March 31, 1999.\n  And both bills permitted excessive concentration in ownership of \nlocal TV and radio stations. The conference report retains the cross-\nownership ban on newspaper/broadcast and cable/broadcast; retains \nlimits prohibiting one person from owning two stations in one market; \nexpands the limits on local radio stations but retains numeric limits \non the number of stations in a market; dropped the provision allowing a \nloophole in the ownership attribution rules for TV stations; and \nexpands the national limit on TV ownership to 35 percent national \nmarket reach, but drops the provision allowing waivers.\n\n\n                      ``meaningful role'' for doj\n\n  Mr President, I would like to elaborate further on the role afforded \nthe Department of Justice in the conference report. The final bill \nappropriately includes a strong role for the Justice Department in \nevaluating applications by regional bell operating companies to provide \ninterLATA telecommunications.\n  The Antitrust Division has unrivaled expertise in assessing \nmarketplace effects, particularly so in telecommunications, where it \nhas been deeply involved continuously for more than 20 years.\n  During floor debate on S. 652, we worked hard to secure an \nindependence role for the Antitrust Division in determining when and to \nwhat extent to remove the consent decrees's core restriction, the long \ndistance or interLATA restriction.\n  Independent DOJ role narrowly lost in the Senate, but conferees were \npersuaded to give DOJ a special, strong advisory role within FCC \nprocedure, almost equivalent protection for competitive freedom. \nThirty-six Senators cosigned a letter supporting this meaningful role.\n  As I earlier indicated, the FCC is required by the conference report \nto consult with the Attorney General and give the Attorney General's \nevaluation substantial weight.\n  In conjunction with this evaluation, the Attorney General may submit \nany comments and supporting materials under any standard she believes \nappropriate. Through its work in investigating the telecommunications \nindustry and enforcing the MFJ, DOJ has important knowledge, evidence, \nand experience that will be of critical importance in evaluating \nproposed long-distance entry--which, as I indicated earlier, requires \nan FCC finding that such entry is in the public interest, and that a \nfacilities-based competitor is present. On both of these issues, the \nDOJ's expertise in telecommunications and competitive issues generally \nshould be of great value to the FCC.\n\n  While the substantial-weight requirement does not preclude FCC \ndeparture from the Attorney General's recommendation if sufficiently \nindicated by other evidence on the record, this additional legal \nrequirement means that the FCC's decision must be appropriately mindful \nof the Antitrust Division's special expertise in competition matters \ngenerally and in making predictive judgments regarding marketplace \neffects in particular.\n  This requirement will ensure that DOJ's position is given serious \nsubstantive consideration on the merits--by the courts on appeal as \nwell as by the FCC. DOJ also retains its full statutory authority to \nrepresent the interests of the United States before the courts on \nappeal.\n  Moreover, even after entry occurs, there are important separate \naffiliate requirements--section 271--that will apply for at least 3 \nyears.\n  The conference report further contains an absolute savings clause for \nantitrust laws. No authority that is given to the FCC, and no \nauthorization that is given to any private entity, will diminish in any \nway the full applicability of the antitrust laws. This is an important \nguarantee that competition, and the innovation that results from \nhealthy market forces, will be the centerpiece of our \ntelecommunications policy. In addition, telco-cable, broadcast and \nother media mergers are subject to full antitrust scrutiny, regardliess \nof how they are treated by the FCC.\n\n\n                     repeal of antitrust exemption\n\n  Finally, the conference report repeals a provision (47 U.S.C. Sec. \n221(a)) that exempts mergers between telephone companies from antitrust \nreview--a provision left over from the 1920's, a bygone era when \nFederal telecommunications policy was actually to promote monopoly over \ncompetition.\n  If not repealed, this provision could have taken on a new meaning \nunder the bill, since the provision did not define telephone company. \nAnd, as a result of the walls brought down and the forces unleashed by \nthe bill, it is not clear what will constitute a telephone company in \nthe future--perhaps every firm that transmits information by any \nelectronic means. Absent repeal of this provision, the entire \ncommunications industry might have merged into one vast monopoly \nwithout ever being subject to antitrust review.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman, I \nyield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have 21 minutes remaining. I will take then 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking \nand congratulating the members of the Commerce Committee in the Senate \nand also our House colleagues for the outstanding work that has been \nput into this legislation. But I particularly have to recognize the \ndogged, determined, tenacious, informed effort by the chairman of the \nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. We would not be \nhere without question if he had not continued to work on this \nlegislation to try to find ways to keep informed all the Members on \nboth sides of the Capitol on both sides of the aisle. He has been \nwilling to accept some compromises, and, after all, that is the art of \nlegislating. He has done a fantastic job. He has made history with this \nlegislation.\n  I believe we will pass this conference report overwhelmingly in a few \nminutes, and I venture to say right now there will not be a bigger, \nmore important piece of legislation that passes the Congress this year \nand probably not one in the last decade in terms of the impact this is \ngoing to have in the creation of jobs and bringing legislation out of \nthe Edsel era of the 1934 Communications Act into a modern Explorer \nbecause that is what this legislation is going to do--open up \ntremendous horizons for our people.\n  So I just have to say I take my hat off to the chairman, Senator \nPressler, from the great State of South Dakota. He has done a fantastic \njob.\n  I also have to say we would not be here without the leadership and \neffort of the ranking member on the committee, Senator Hollings. He has \nbeen good to his word. He has worked hard. He has been tough. He even \nthought I was trying to game him one time, which I might have been \ntrying to do. But he was always open. He was always willing to talk \nwith us. When he has made commitments, he has kept those commitments. \nHe has continued to work with the chairman to move this thing forward. \nHe has worked to keep his Members informed, and we have been informed \non this side.\n  I just think they have done a fantastic job. I think we will look \nback in years ahead and call this truly a historic activity and piece \nof legislation. I also have to say that Chairman Bliley in the House \ntook some real risks with his leadership, and the ranking member there, \nCongressman Dingell, who is obviously a very experienced, long-time, \ntough negotiator. But they have all done a great job.\n  I wish to also commend the staff. There have been times, I am sure, \nwhen our staffs on both sides of the aisle were ready to throw in the \ntowel or did not want to see us come in again. They worked hard, long \nhours, weekends, and they produced outstanding legislation.\n  Let me take a minute to talk just a bit about the process. There were \nthose who thought we could not get this bill through the Senate. There \nwere those who thought we could not get it through the House. There \nwere those who thought we could not get it through the conference. \nThere were those who did not want a conference \n\n[[Page S699]]\nagreement. But we moved it forward, and we reached a point where some \ndecisions had to be made, and the leaders of the committees in the \nHouse and Senate stepped up and made a decision.\n  It has been suggested that maybe some Senators or some Congressmen or \nsome of us got rolled. In some respects, all of us got rolled a little \nbit. I have some things I would like to change in this conference \nreport that are important to me and my State. But when you look at the \nentire package, this is good legislation. It took a little extra effort \nduring the past couple days to push it to where it could be completed \ntoday. And so while it is not perfect, it certainly is very good \nlegislation that is going to be good for our country and good for the \neconomy.\n  This legislation is deregulatory. Just take a look at what it does in \nterms of opening up markets; the local markets, the cable industry. We \nare going to have competition. Local telephone companies will be able \nto get into long-distance business and long distance will be able to \nget into local telephone service. They will be able to get into the \ncable area. Cable will be able to provide phone service. What it is \ngoing to mean is great competition and choices for the people. It is so \nfundamental to what America is all about. It is amazing to me it has \nbeen so hard to make this happen. But it is a bill that opens up \nmarkets. It is about more competition. It is deregulatory. I think that \nwe should say that over and over again and recognize that is what we \nhave here.\n  There are all kinds of people who are supporting this legislation \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask the Chairman, could I have an \nadditional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. The telephone companies are supporting this legislation. \nThe long-distance companies are supporting this legislation--both of \nthem would like to have a little more in their sections, but basically \nthey know this is good legislation--the cable industry, the \nbroadcasters. The utility industry is going to be able to be involved \nand provide another option, more competition. We made sure that the \npublic utilities law on the books did not keep the utilities from \noffering the services they could offer. We made sure that it was a fair \nbill even for the burglar alarm industry.\n  There is going to be a tremendous explosion in technology. It will \nhelp education. It will help health care. We will have manufacturing. I \nhope we are going to have manufacturing of telephone equipment in \nAmerica. But there will be more of it. At least now our companies that \nhave been prohibited over the past 15 or 20 years will be able to get \nin there, get into manufacturing and offer additional equipment and \ncreate some jobs.\n  But most of all, the beneficiaries of this bill will be the people. \nThey are going to be staggered by the choices, Mr. President, that they \nare going to have to choose between on their telephones and on their \ntelevision sets. There is going to be an absolute revolution occurring \nin the next 10 years in the telecommunications industry.\n  It was a question, frankly, of would the Congress step up and \nacknowledge what was happening. Would the Congress take off the \nshackles and allow the telecommunications industry to move forward \naggressively, or would we retard and restrain and regulate that \npotential?\n  We have decided in this legislation to open it up. The people will be \nthe beneficiaries. There are adequate safeguards in this legislation \nfor consumers. Some people might say too much. But I think that they \nare there. I think they are important. We are going to get jobs \ncreation from this legislation. The people will get choice in how they \nget their services. They can choose to have one company in the future \nto give them their local service, their long-distance service, their \ntelevision.\n  There is no end to the ideas that will come as a result of this \nlegislation. It is going to provide opportunities for growth and \ndevelopment and lower prices. Competition will give us more choices, \ntremendous developments and activities at lower prices.\n  So I just wanted to say briefly how important I think this \nlegislation is. We are changing 60 years of law with it. It is going to \nhave a tremendous impact.\n  I have been honored to be a part of the process through the \ncommittee, on the floor of the Senate, in conference. I thank the \ndistinguished majority leader for allowing us to get this legislation \nup this afternoon. Without his being willing to step up and say we \nshould go forward with this, it would not be happening.\n  He raises legitimate questions about the spectrum question. But the \nchairman and the ranking Member have made a commitment we are going to \nhave hearings on this. We are going to see what can be done there. We \nare going to make sure we do it right. The FCC is not going to go \nforward with giving away spectrum until we have taken an additional \nlook at it. But I have to say it is a very complicated area, and one we \nneed to be careful about.\n  We should not break our word, and we should not say we can get more \nmoney than we can get. And we should not take actions that slow down or \nstop the move to digital, the next step in the very pure picture that \nwe can get. So we are going to get this legislation, and we are going \nto get additional action on spectrum. We are going to do it, and we are \ngoing to do it properly.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me at this time. I \nthank the chairman for yielding it to me. I am anxiously awaiting the \nfinal vote on this historic legislation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, may I say to the Senator from \nMississippi that this legislation would not have happened without him. \nHe has been a valued member of the committee and a valuable friend. He \nhas taken great personal risks. I have seen him in meetings really \nperform as a leader. I am very proud to have him as a friend. This \nlegislation would not have happened without him. I pay tribute to \nSenator Lott of Mississippi who made this happen. I thank him very, \nvery much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 11 minutes. \nThe Senator from South Carolina has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my chairman and the Chair.\n  First of all, I rise today to join my colleague in pledging my \nsupport for this piece of legislation, the Telecommunications Act of \n1995. Let me first start out talking about the leadership that Senator \nPressler has shown on this particular piece of legislation.\n  As you know, we have gotten the reform of telecommunications further \nthan it has come since I have been in this body. In 1989, we started \nworking on telecommunications in the reform, the deregulation of it, to \ndo one thing, and that was to push new technologies into areas where we \ndesperately needed those new technologies, because all one has to do is \nto look around and say we are going to do things differently when it \ncomes to educating our kids, we are going to do things differently when \nwe talk about telemedicine.\n  I can remember almost 5 years ago I joined with then-Senator Gore to \nintroduce a series of telecommunications infrastructure bills. I \nremember that day. I think the ranking member of the Commerce Committee \nwas chairman at that time. I can remember that situation. We both \nstrongly believed at that time in the need to unleash the digital \nrevolution through the substitution of competition for excessive \nregulation. The bill basically achieves that basic goal, and because of \nthis, it will accelerate by decades the deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications infrastructure.\n  This is not to say, Mr. President, that the conference report is \nperfect or the best it could possibly be. In some places I would like \nto change it. But, you know, you do not get everything you want, but at \nleast you want everything that you got. I think basically that is the \nposition we are in. We cannot let the best become the enemy of the \ngood. It is time that we take what we can get now and move forward with \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Under this bill, the nature of regulation will change. Instead of \nregulating the profits of telephone companies, regulation will now \nfocus on ensuring that competition can take root in all \n\n[[Page S700]]\naspects of the telecommunications markets. Once full and effective \ncompetition can take root, it will protect the consumer interests and \nthe need for regulation will end. This process of using regulation to \nembrace and advance the cause of competition toward an ultimate goal of \nderegulation will require the conscience and the constant vigilance of \nthis Congress and Congresses to come. Cooperation between the FCC and \nthe States will also be mandatory.\n  We all must be vigilant to ensure that competition can take root and \nthat it grow and it prosper. If it does not, then this bill will be a \nfailure. I believe this bill will not be a failure. I am proud of most \nof the agreements that were made and reached in this conference.\n\n  I believe that a good deal was struck where both rural and urban \ninterests are well served. My home State of Montana will benefit \ngreatly from the universal services provisions and lower telephone \nrates, better cable services, and increased competition in all segments \nof telecommunications across the board.\n  What does it do? It removes almost all State and local government \nrestrictions on competition and local exchange telephone, video \nservices, wireless, and other communications markets. It also reforms \nthe broadcast license renewal process to forestall strike units or \nother abusive practices by self-styled consumer groups and community \nactivists, removing network cable owner limits and raising current \nradio and television station ownership caps. It restructures the \nremaining FCC procedures and requires speedy action on complaints, \npetitions for forbearance, applications and other requests, and \nestablishes a permanent biennial regulatory review of the process.\n  It also removes and relaxes the restrictions on the ability of public \nutility holding companies to engage in competitive telecommunications \nactivities.\n  Furthermore, the report's rules on interconnection will empower \ncompetitors by ensuring that they can gain access on fair and \nreasonable terms to existing local telephone facilities without \nimposing unreasonable burdens on rural telephone companies.\n  The report also protects the continuation of universal service, an \nessential feature, especially for rural areas where competition will be \nslow to evolve.\n  And, a backup provision, the so-called advanced telecommunications \nprovision, was included in the report to ensure that competition and, \nhence, infrastructure deployment evolve in a reasonable and timely \nmanner. If competition is stalled, the report gives the FCC authority \nto quicken the pace of competition and deregulation to accelerate the \ndeployment of advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n  These provisions, taken together, will ensure that all Americans--in \nurban, suburban, rural, and remote areas--gain access to the most \nadvanced telecommunications capability as quickly as market forces will \nallow.\n  Finally, I also support the radio ownership deregulation provision \nincluded in the report. The provision is a good compromise between \nthose who wanted complete deregulation and those who were concerned \nabout concentration in radio ownership in local markets. By \nderegulating radio ownership rules, we are setting the groundwork for \nour Nation's radio operators to compete and survive in this new \ntelecommunications environment.\n  For these reasons, I support the conference report and hope that my \ncolleagues will as well in the confidence that its enactment will \nensure the rapid deployment of advanced telecommunications capability \nto the benefit to all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Again, I want to congratulate the leadership of Senator \nPressler and the many people that it took to put this together, because \nwe know that it was frustrating at times. It was frustrating to all of \nus at times. But, nonetheless, I think it is a good piece of \nlegislation. I yield the floor.\n\n\n             commercial availability of navigation devices\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The competitive availability of navigation devices \nprovision, section 304, instructs the FCC to consult with appropriate \nvoluntary industry standards setting organizations for the purpose of \npromulgating a regulation. Given that the FCC is not a standards \nsetting organization, do you agree that this legislation does not \nauthorize the FCC to set a standard for interactive video equipment?\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree. Moreover, FCC involvement in the emerging digital \nmarket could have the effect of freezing or chilling the development of \nthat market. If private industry groups are able to develop sufficient \nstandards on their own, there is no need for the FCC to intervene. One \nsuch example of this policy approach is the so-called Eshoo amendment \nwhich leaves the development of ``features, functions, protocols, and \nother product and service options'' for analog cable equipment to the \nprivate sector.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Do you also agree that the intent of this provision is \nthat the use of rate regulated services to subsidize equipment might \nunfairly penalize the general rate-payer?\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree. However, when those services are no longer rate \nregulated such subsidy cannot be sustained and the prohibition on \nbundling is no longer necessary. The bill's prohibition on bundling and \nsubsidization no longer applies when cable rates are deregulated. \nConsumers should have the option of obtaining digital devices through \ncommercial outlets, but this does not mean that network operators must \nmake each type of equipment available through commercial outlets. \nNetwork operators should have the flexibility to package and bundle \nequipment and services.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today in opposition to the \nconference report on S. 652, the Telecommunications Deregulation Act of \n1995. I regret that I cannot support this legislation, because it \ncontains important protections for parents to be able to monitor what \ntheir children are viewing. I support the language in the conference \nreport that requires manufacturers to include V-chips in new \ntelevisions. I also hope that the television industry will voluntarily \ndevelop ratings for video programming. Parents need this rating system \nso that they can more fully monitor what their kids are viewing.\n  This bill also represents so much for our country. I can imagine \nworkers in rural Minnesota telecommuting to and from work as far away \nas New York or Washington without ever having to leave their homes or \nfamilies. As a teacher the possibilities really excite me--\nschoolchildren in Minneapolis reading the latest publications at the \nLibrary of Congress via thin glowing fiber cables or rural health care \nproviders on the iron range consulting with the top medical researchers \nat the Mayo Clinic in Rochester to better treat their patients. All of \nthis is before us.\n  When the Senate debated this bill in June, I felt then and still feel \nnow that this bill presents to each Senator a daunting responsibility. \nThe concern that I still have now that we are voting on the conference \nreport, has to do with whether or not we can make sure that there will \nbe true competition, and that this technology and information will \ntruly be available to everyone in the Nation, not just the most \nprivileged or the most wealthy.\n  The conferees maintained some very important Senate provisions, \nincluding language to keep telecommunication rates low for schools and \nhospitals. This will help to ensure that our communication technologies \nare affordable for future generations. I was proud to support this \nprovision when opponents tried to strip this provision in the Senate.\n  The conferees also kept language requiring V-chips in new \ntelevisions. I am proud to say that I supported this provision that \nwill help keep adult-oriented video programs away from children. I \nbelieve that this will give those who know best, parents, the ability \nto control the flow of new services into their homes.\n  What disappoints me the most is that this bill did not go far enough \nto assure competition and therefor does not go far enough to protect \nconsumers. I am not just concerned about the alphabet soup \ncorporations. I am concerned about the people that live in Eveleth or \nFergus Falls or Virginia or St. Paul or Northfield or Pipestone. I was \nhoping that at least we could build in more protection for consumers \nand more \n\n[[Page S701]]\nguarantees that there would in fact be the competition that we all talk \nabout.\n  I ask my colleagues, after you remove the protections against huge \nrate increases, against monopoly, against service just for the \nprivileged, what would you replace them with? Words, Mr. President. \nPromises, guarantees, reassurances that this time, although many of \nthese companies have misbehaved in the past, and have been fined \nrepeatedly for violating promises to protect consumers, that this time \nthe corporations promise to behave themselves and to conduct themselves \nin the consumer's best interest.\n  Mr. President, I have said it before, and I will say it again. I do \nnot buy it. I would rather put my trust in solid protections, written \nin law, to make sure that rates remain affordable, services are \navailable for everyone, and no one is left behind in the stampede for \ncorporate profits. Protections that ensure affordability, fairness, and \naccess in local and long distance phone service and cable TV.\n  Mr. President, the need for the continuation of consumer protections \nand antitrust circuit breakers is clear. With every passing day, we see \nmore integration in the telecommunications and information marketplace. \nOver the summer, we saw the Lotus Corp. agree to a friendly takeover by \nIBM. AT and McCaw Cellular will be joining forces, as will other \ncompanies, in preparing for this newly deregulated telecommunications \nenvironment. I am concerned that this integration will mean a broadcast \nconcentration where consumers will get their news and information from \nfewer and fewer sources.\n  This integration at the top corporate level and the market position \nof many of these companies demands that consumers be given a voice--a \ntrusted voice--to speak for them in the coming years. No more trusted \nvoice could be found on this subject than that of the Department of \nJustice. It was through that Department's courageous leadership that \nthe old AT Ma Bell monopoly was broken apart--it was a long, tough \nfight, but this experience gained by the DOJ has been invaluable in \nguiding the breakup of the Bell system, and the development of \ncompetition in long distance and other services. It only makes sense \nthat we allow the DOJ to put this experience to use again as we move \ninto an exciting, but potentially risky, new market. I believe that DOJ \noversight is essential to ensure competition and consumer protection to \nkeep telephone monopolies from reassembling themselves.\n  While I fully appreciate the potential of this legislation, I am \nreally worried about where we are heading because I think there is \ngoing to be entirely too much concentration of power. The New York \nTimes reported in a December 19, 1995, article:\n\n       For Wall Street, a frenzy of deals would be a bonanza. For \n     many consumers though, the activity is unlikely to make much \n     difference in the price of quality of their phone service. \n     Only in large metropolitan areas, where the lure of lucrative \n     markets might intensify competition, could the average phone \n     customer expect to see much benefit.\n\n  The article goes on to report from one investment analyst that ``What \nyou need to have is a large footprint to reach more customers with one \nnetwork.'' He went on to say ``There's no reason on God's Earth why you \nhave to have seven bell companies.''\n  Well this may be true if the only bottom line is to make money. But \nmy bottom line is to ensure that consumers all over America have access \nto affordable, quality telecommunications services.\n  I believe that this legislation will lead to too much concentration \nof power in a very, very important and decisive area of public life in \nthe United States of America. I think we are making a mistake if we \npass this piece of legislation. I will therefore, vote against it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there is language within S. 652 which \nrequires all must carry challenges filed with the FCC to be resolved \nwithin 120 days. Let me further state that broadcast stations are \nimportant sources of local news, public affairs programming, and other \nlocal broadcast services. This category of service will be an important \npart of the public interest determination to be made by the Commission \nwhen deciding whether a broadcast renewal application shall be granted \nby the Commission. To prevent local television broadcast signals from \nbeing subject to noncarriage or repositioning by cable television \nsystems and those providing cable services, we must recognize and \nreaffirm the importance of mandatory carriage of local commercial \ntelevision stations, as implemented by Commission rules and \nregulations.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the telecom conference \nreport and its adherence to procedures we set up with passage of S. 1, \nthe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  We passed S. 1 one year ago with overwhelming bipartisan support. It \nwas one of the two major items in the Contract with America that has \nactually been enacted. I am proud to be its coauthor along with my \ncolleague, Senator Kempthorne.\n  S. 1 sets up a process where, first, we would understand the cost of \nfuture Federal mandates on State and local governments before we voted \nto enact them. We would get this cost information from CBO and, to do \nso, we secured an additional $1.4 million in fiscal year 1996 funds for \nCBO to hire the needed analysts. Second, S. 1 ensures that we would pay \nfor those mandates or otherwise face a possible point of order on the \nfloor. We set a date of January 1, 1996 for the act's cost estimating \nand funding requirements to take effect.\n  This telecom conference report violates S. 1's spirit, intent and \nrequirements. Section 424(d) of the act stipulates that ``the \nconference committee shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable'' \nthat CBO shall perform cost estimates on conference reports containing \nFederal mandates. This provision was an amendment to S. 1 by Senator \nGramm from Texas that was unanimously adopted by the Senate. It is \nmeant to address the possibility of Federal mandates all of a sudden \nshowing up in conference reports.\n\n  State and local government groups alerted Members to three sections \nof the report, section 302, 303, and 602 that restricted or limited \ntheir authority to raise revenues through licensing and franchising \nfees. Section 421(3) of the act defines direct costs to mean ``the \naggregate estimated amounts that all State, local, and tribal \ngovernments would be prohibited from raising in revenues in order to \ncomply with the Federal intergovernmental mandate.'' So the State and \nlocal groups were right to raise these concerns and ask that CBO do a \nscoring of the conference report as required under S. 1.\n  Unfortunately, CBO did not receive the conference report until this \nmorning. Earlier efforts by the CBO analysts to get copies of earlier \nversions of the conference report were also unsuccessful. Apparently, \nthey were ignored by the conference committee staff. That's not the \nprocess we envisioned under S. 1.\n  I understand that the rights of way provisions in section 303 were \naltered to address State and local concerns. Those were the provisions \nthat were of the greatest concern to them. However, that still leaves \nsections 302 and 602. Those sections are being looked at right now by \nCBO for their cost on State and local governments, but I'm afraid it's \ntoo late. We are going to pass this conference report shortly without \nhaving any estimate of what those costs might be.\n  When we passed S. 1, I talked on the floor about how Congress and its \ncommittees would have to change the way they do business in order for \nthe act to work. That change didn't happen on this conference report. I \nhope there is a better effort at compliance next time.\n  I support this conference report because it makes long-needed and \nimportant reforms in the telecom industry. But in terms of following S. \n1's rules and procedures, it falls far short.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will \nvote today on final passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act of 1995--one of the most important \nbills to be considered by the 104th Congress. While there are many \nissues that have been addressed in this legislation, most notably to \nensure that there is competition among the telecommunications \ntechnologies of the 21st century, I have been particularly concerned \nabout one important issue associated with telecommunications reform--\nthe impact of television programming on our children, and the \nimportance of ensuring \n\n[[Page S702]]\nthat parents have information and the technology necessary to make an \ninformed decision about television programming for their children.\n  In this regard, I am very pleased that conferees have agreed to \naccept the Parental Choice in Television Programming provisions--the V-\nchip--that was adopted by both the House of Representatives and Senate \nby overwhelming margins during consideration of S. 652 and H.R. 1555 \nlast summer. The importance of this parental choice technology for \nparents was underscored by President Clinton last week in his State of \nthe Union Message to the Nation.\n  In that message, the President called on Congress to pass the V-chip \nrequirement in S. 652 that would permit parents to screen out \ntelevision programming inappropriate for children. The President also \ncalled on the entertainment media to create movies, CD's, and \ntelevision programming that members of the entertainment community \nwould want their children to view. He further challenged the broadcast \nindustry to help parents protect their children by providing families \nwith more information about TV programming through improved advisories \nor rating system. To accomplish this goal, the President invited \nleaders of the major entertainment media to the White House later this \nmonth to discuss and work on ways to improve what children view in \nentertainment programming.\n  Mr. President, I commend President Clinton for strongly endorsing the \nV-chip in his State of the Union Message, as well as for his leadership \non behalf of parental choice chip technology during consideration of \ntelecommunications reform legislation in the Senate and House. \nPresident Clinton remarked that the V-chip represents a reasonable \nsolution--not censorship--to the concerns of parents who have little \ncontrol over the television programming that is available to their \nchildren, and want more information on the content of this programming. \nThe President said, ``when parents control what their children see, \nthat's not censorship. That's enabling parents to assume more \nresponsibility for their children's upbringing''. I agree with \nPresident Clinton.\n  Regrettably, the reaction of the broadcast media to President \nClinton's support for the V-chip technology and appeal to the media to \nwork together to make the V-chip technology effective, has not been \nencouraging. Despite broad public support among parents, the medical \ncommunity, educators and other children advocates for this technology, \nand successful tests of this technology in Canada, broadcasters say the \nV-chip proposal is unworkable, and unconstitutional on free-speech \ngrounds. According to press reports, the broadcasters intend to oppose \nthe V-chip in court. I believe this decision is unfortunate--children \nwill be the losers if this technology does not become available to \nparents. Unfortunately, many in the television broadcast industry \ncontinue to misrepresent the provisions adopted in the conference \nagreement to S. 652.\n\n  As adopted in the conference report (Section 551--Parental Choice in \nTelevision Programming), manufacturers of television sets (13 inches or \nlarger), both domestic and foreign, would be required to install \ntechnology--the V-chip--that would allow parents to block the display \nof programming with a common rating. The Federal Communications \nCommission, following consultation with the electronics industry, would \ndetermine a date for the implementation of this provision. There is \nalso a provision under section 551 that would prohibit the shipping of \ntelevision sets in interstate commerce that do not meet the \nrequirements for the manufacture of television sets with blocking \ntechnology. These are the only mandates under section 551.\n  To make the parental choice chip technology an effective tool for \nparents, section 551 calls on television broadcasters, cable operators, \nand other video programmers to work with concerned interest groups, \nincluding parents, over a 12-month period--before any of the provisions \nof section 551 become effective--to voluntarily develop rules for \nrating television programming with violent, sexual, or other indecent \ncontent. Broadcasters and cable operators during this same period would \nalso be encouraged to voluntarily develop rules for the transmission of \nsignals encoding the ratings that would block certain television \nprogramming.\n  Effective voluntary rating systems have already been developed for \ntelevision programming in Canada. In addition, as I noted during the \ntelecommunications debate last summer, the Recreational Software \nAdvisory Council and the Interactive Digital Software Association on \nbehalf of video game manufacturers have voluntarily adopted a rating \nsystem that is included with most video games sold in the United \nStates. A voluntary rating system is workable.\n  Mr. President, following the 12-month period from the date of \nenactment of S. 652, if the television broadcasters, cable operators \nhave not taken the opportunity to voluntarily develop a rating system \nto guide parents, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would be \nauthorized to establish an advisory committee to develop \nrecommendations and guidelines for the identification and rating of \ntelevision programming. The advisory committee would include industry \nrepresentatives, parents, and public interest groups. Any guidelines or \nrecommendations established by the advisory committee could serve as a \nmodel for the television broadcast industry in the development of a \nrating system.\n  Section 551 does not mandate a government rating system, or that a \nprogram be rated if a broadcaster refuses to rate programming. Nor does \nthis legislation establish a government entity to rate television \nprogramming. There is also no authority or suggestion to rate or \nidentify in any way religious or political programming. No penalties \nare established by this provision if a television broadcaster's cable \noperator refuses to develop ratings, or apply whatever ratings or \nidentification system is established voluntarily, or by the advisory \ncommittee under the FCC. The development of any rating or other \ntelevision program identification is entirely voluntary--the \neffectiveness of the V-chip technology as an aid for parents rests with \ntelevision broadcasters and cable operators, not the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of the public supports the installation of \nthe V-chip on television sets--parents want more information on the \ncontents of television programming, and to be able to block that \nprogramming if they consider it inappropriate for children. They should \nhave that right. In Canada, recent trials of V-chip technology that \nwere conducted in Toronto and other communities have shown that the V-\nchip is popular, and workable. More than 80 percent of the families \nthat participated in the demonstration felt positively toward the V-\nchip, and more than 70 percent thought the system effective and should \nbe maintained.\n  I urge television broadcasters, cable operators, and other video \nprogrammers to take advantage of the 12-month period provided under \nsection 551 to voluntarily develop an identification or rating system \nthat will help parents to make informed decisions about television \nprogramming that is appropriate for children. I hope that media \nexecutives will view the upcoming White House meeting on violence and \nchildren's programming as an opportunity for constructive dialog on \nthis important issue for children, and to make this new parental choice \ntechnology an effective tool for parents and families. The time has \ncome to work together.\n  I applaud House and Senate conferees on S. 652 for including the V-\nchip provisions in the final conference agreement. I also want to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Hollings for his leadership on \nbehalf of children's television programming, and for his strong support \nof the V-chip provision in conference. I urge my colleagues to lend \ntheir strong support for passage of this important telecommunications \nreform conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we approach the end of the 20th \ncentury, it becomes increasingly clear that our telecommunications \nindustry has outgrown the Communications Act of 1934. Changes in \ntechnology and in consumer demands since then mean that it is now time \nto pass the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n1995. This legislation will foster technological growth, bring more \nchoices and lower prices to consumers, \n\n[[Page S703]]\nincrease productivity, jobs, and international competitiveness.\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 will \nprovide consumers with more choices and lower prices in long distance \nphone service and television programming. And it will do so in a way \nthat protects rural customers: This legislation explicitly preserves \nthe universal service fund which subsidizes telephone services to rural \nareas.\n  Right now, consumers have a choice among long distance phone \ncompanies. After this legislation takes effect, consumers will also be \nable to choose among companies that offer them local phone service.\n  This legislation will also give consumers more choices in how they \nreceive television programming. Currently, if a consumer's area is \nserved by cable, a consumer may choose between the cable company and \nDirect Broadcast Satellite [DBS] service. This legislation will allow \nthe phone company to offer television over phone lines, so consumers \nwill be able to choose television services from among cable companies, \nphone companies, and DBS.\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 will \nalso encourage investment in domestic telecommunications industries. By \nrequiring that local telephone service be provided solely through \nregulated monopolies, the Communications Act of 1934 has forced U.S. \ncompanies wanting to invest in local phone markets to invest overseas.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisors estimates that as a \nresult of deregulation, by 2003, 1.4 million service sector, U.S.-based \njobs will be created.\n  Over the next 10 years, a total of 3.4 million jobs will be created, \nand, according to telecommunications analyst George Gilder, the gross \ndomestic product will increase by as much as $2 trillion.\n  Increased investment in telecommunications products and services will \nbring a better quality of life to rural New Mexico. With fiber optic \ncable connections, doctors in Shiprock, NM, can consult with \nspecialists at the University of New Mexico Medical Center or any \nmedical center across the country.\n  These new technologies will enable students in Hidalgo County, NM, in \ntowns like Lordsburg and Animas, to share teachers through a video and \nfiber optic link. This legislation will remove the regulations that \ncurrently prevent local phone companies from making the investments \nnecessary to provide such technologies.\n  Mr. President, I support this legislation because it will help \nimprove rural education and rural health care, enhance local and long \ndistance phone services, and speed up the development of new technology \nand new jobs for Americans. I believe this legislation represents a key \nstep forward toward achieving these valuable objectives.\n  As with any effort at serious, large-scale reform, this legislation \nleaves a few important policy questions unresolved. I am pleased that \nwe have agreed to separate those issues out from this bill so that we \ncan give them the full attention they deserve in the future.\n  I wish to commend the managers of this bill, and their staffs for \ntheir tireless work to craft this legislation. In particular, I \nappreciate the legislative skill of Chairman Pressler, Majority Leader \nDole, Senator Stevens, and ranking member Senator Hollings, as well as \ntheir commitment to real reform of obsolete and burdensome regulations.\n  The public ought to be proud that by working together, Democrats and \nRepublicans have succeeded in crafting legislation that will enhance \nthe capacity of our economy to respond to the new, and rapidly growing \nchallenges of the information age.\n  Mr. HEFLIN, Mr. President, telecommunications technology has \nundergone a major evolution in the six decades since Congress passed \nthe landmark ``Communications Act'' in 1934. Enacted during the Great \nDepression, the ``Communications Act'' alleviated the turf disputes \nwhich emerged when AT entered the broadcasting arena to compete with \nthe well-established radio networks. The New Deal approach to this \nproblem was to erect strict walls between public utility communication \nproviders and broadcasters. Amazingly, though, the regulatory approach \nestablished 62 years ago is still the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that cellular telephones, fax \nmachines, cable television, direct broadcast satellites, and computers \nhave rendered obsolete the Nation's aging telecommunications regulatory \nframework. Therefore, I believe the time has come to overhaul that \nframework as we prepare to enter the 21st century. But as my friends on \nthe Commerce Committee can attest, the task of rewriting the antiquated \nCommunications Act of 1934 is much easier said than done.\n  I suspect that we all agree that the present regulatory structure \nneeds revision, but forming a consensus on just how to create a new \nregulatory environment that acknowledges and fosters competition while \nat the same time protects the public interest has proven to be elusive. \nAfter reviewing the conference report on the Telecommunications Act, \nthough, I feel that the conferees have done a commendable job in \nfinding an equitable balance between these two competing goals.\n  The past few months have been witness to some historic agreements. \nFor instance, those who negotiated the Dayton Peace Accord deserve \ncredit for a job well done, but the conferees who were able to broker \nan agreement between the long distance industry and the Bell operating \ncompanies deserve the Nobel Peace Price. The ability of these two \ndivergent interests to come to terms in regards to the Baby Bell's \nentry into the long distance market is one of the reasons I plan to \nsupport the bill.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the bill will provide independent, \nrural cable systems with the option to merge or be bought out by their \nlocal exchange carrier if the cable system in question decides it can \nnot compete head-to-head. I specifically want to thank Senator Hollings \nfor his help on this section of the bill.\n  One other issue worth mentioning in regards to the telecommunications \nbill is the spectrum flexibility issue. All television stations will \nsoon be making the transition from an analog signal to a digital \nsignal. This will provide the consumer with a better signal and will \ngive television stations new sources of revenue, such as digital paging \nand data transmission. In that broadcasters provide their services to \nthe viewing public for free, I think it would be a mistake to require \nthem to pay for spectrum on which to start digital broadcasts, \nparticularly since they will turn their analog spectrum back to the \nGovernment once the transition to digital is complete. This bill would \nnot actually give spectrum to broadcasters, but it would leave the \ndecision on how best to handle the transition to digital in the hands \nof the FCC, where it should be.\n  Mr. President, in closing this bill is good for the consumer because \nit will open the floodgates of competition among communications \nproviders. As we all know, increased competition means lower prices and \nnew services in the marketplace. In addition, the bill is supported by \nthe regional Bell companies, the long distance industry, the cable \nindustry, and broadcasters. Therefore, I intend to vote in favor of \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, and the \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, in supporting the \nconference report to S. 652, the telecommunications reform bill. As a \nconferee on this historic piece of legislation, I firmly believe that \nthis bill is a balanced approach to the overhaul of our \ntelecommunications laws and regulations and towards a de-regulated and \ncompetitive telecommunications industry.\n  In the last several months, the Congress has been highly criticized \nfor the partisan nature of our debates. And it is true that a \nsignificant number of legislative initiatives are caught in intense \npartisan differences. But at the same time, there have been a number of \ndevelopments where both sides of the aisle have come together, where \nboth sides have been able to reach an accommodation of differing views \nand opinions. I believe that this conference report is just one example \nof how this Congress can work in a bi-partisan manner to produce solid \nlegislation. \n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n  That is not to say that it is easy. This conference has been working \nthroughout the fall and early winter to produce this conference report. \nOur negotiations were long and difficult ones. But, Mr. President, I am \nby nature a compromiser. I guess that is because I am from Kentucky. \nAnd Kentucky produced many fine legislators and statesmen, including \nthe great compromiser, Henry Clay. And Henry Clay once said that \ncompromise is ``a mutual sacrifice.'' Well, let me tell you Mr. \nPresident, that we conferees have made many sacrifices in order to \nreach a bi-partisan conference report.\n  When the House passed its version of telecommunications reform last \nAugust, I was asked what the significance of that event meant. I stated \nthen that I was fairly confident that we could produce a final bill--\nbut that it was not going to be easy. There were significant \ndifferences between the Senate and House bills. In particular, I know I \nand many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle were concerned \nabout the scope of the deregulation contained in the House bill. But \nsomething significant happened in this conference. We sat down and we \nlistened to each other. Throughout numerous discussions and informal \nmeetings of conferees, we were able to state our concerns and have \nthose concerns understood and appreciated. And more importantly, we \nwere able to have those concerns addressed in a satisfactory manner. I \ndo not think that any one side prevailed over the other. This \nconference was one of significant negotiations and compromises. But the \nresult is that today we have a bi-partisan bill. I believe that this \nconference report is a fair, logical, and balanced approach towards \nreforming our Nation's telecommunications law and policies.\n  There is no question that we need to pass a reform bill. Not since \nthe passage of the 1934 Communications Act has the Congress taken a \nstep towards a major overhaul of that law. The 1934 Act has served its \npurpose in guiding our telecommunications policy for the last 60 years. \nBut we are at a crossroads in terms of policy and technology. Our \ntelecommunications industry has been in a state of complex \ntransformation that began in 1984 with the divestiture of AT Since \nthat time, the seven regional telephone companies have actively sought \npermission to enter into other areas of business. And as the regional \nBell companies have sought to expand, other companies and industries \nhave sought to enter into the local telephone market. Clearly, these \nchanges cannot be made through court rulings and petitions to the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  The slow and haphazard de-regulation that has been on-going since \n1984 has frustrated the ability for real and effective competition. In \nturn, I think that has also frustrated the ability for the \ntelecommunications industry to develop and improve technology. In fact, \nMr. President, I would argue that an initial and almost immediate \neffect of this legislation will be rapid advances in telecommunications \ntechnology.\n  Our telecommunications industry is on the cutting edge of technology. \nResearch and development and existing technologies are inhibited by \nrules created several years ago, if not several decades ago. The \nreforms contained in this conference report will help ensure America \nremains competitive.\n  Throughout my experience in this legislation, I always hear people \ntalking about the so-called ``information superhighway''. If we want to \nmake that ``information superhighway'' a reality for all Americans, \nthen I think we need to spur competition which will encourage \ninvestments.\n  Mr. President, competition and investments can only mean one thing--\njobs. This conference report is not just a regulatory reform bill. It \nis a job creation bill as well. Today, the telecommunications industry \nis 15 percent of the GDP. And it is also a sector with high-growth \npotential which will create high-skill and high-paying jobs.\n  In fact, in a recent study conducted by the Wharton School of \nBusiness, the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Association (``The WEFA \nGroup'') found that full competition in telecommunications has the \npotential to create 3.4 million jobs by the year 2005. And the \npotential to cause a $298 billion increase in the gross domestic \nproduct within 10 years.\n  In Kentucky, it is estimated that over 32,000 new jobs will be \ncreated during this same period. Telecommunications reform in Kentucky \ncould mean the distribution of 1,000 new jobs in the mining industry; \n2,900 jobs in the construction industry; 7,300 new jobs in \nmanufacturing; 1,200 new jobs in the transportation and utilities \nsector; 11,200 new jobs in the wholesale and retail trade sector; 1,300 \nnew jobs to the financial services industry; and, 7,500 new jobs to \nother services in general.\n  Mr. President, this telecommunications reform bill is also a pro-\nconsumer bill because it will create more competition, and in turn, \nlower prices. It is estimated that telecommunications reform will lower \nrates by 22 percent, saving consumers nearly $550 billion over the next \n10 years. Lower long distance rates alone will yield $333 billion in \nconsumer savings. With lower local telephone rates, consumers can \nexpect to save another $32 billion. Lower cellular rates could generate \nanother $107 billion and lower cable television rates will yield \nanother $78 billion in consumer savings.\n  But this bill is not simply about jobs and money. This bill also \ncontains important provisions which will enhance access to advanced \nservices in our public schools. I am pleased that this conference \nreport retains the provisions of the Senate bill known as the Snowe-\nRockefeller Amendment. Because of this provision in the legislation, \nour classrooms are going to be able to link with other institutions and \nother programs to enhance education. This is most important for a state \nlike Kentucky with a large rural population. Students and teachers in \nrural areas will gain access to sources of information and libraries in \nother locations across Kentucky and the Nation. The reforms contained \nin this bill will hasten the pace by which schools in rural areas will \nreceive comparable access to the Internet, just like those schools in \nmore urban areas. Access to advanced services can lead to improvements \nand efficiencies in the administration of education. In fact, this is \nalready occurring in Kentucky. Our State government has contracted for \nthe establishment of the Kentucky Information Highway. Schools and \nschool district offices are linked together on the network and advanced \nservices are made available at preferential rates.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have mentioned, this conference report includes \nimportant changes to our telecommunications laws which enable the \ndevelopment of new technologies. I am pleased to say that the \nconference report includes a provision which will limit the role of the \nFederal Communications Commission in setting standards that may affect \nthe computer and home automation technologies. Section 301(f) of the \nbill provides that the FCC may only set minimal standards for cable \nequipment compatibility, to maximize marketplace competition for all \nfeatures and protocols unrelated to descrambling of cable programming, \nand to ensure that the FCC's cable compatibility regulations do not \naffect computer network services, home automation, or other types of \ntelecommunications equipment. In short, this section keeps the \ngovernment out of setting high technological standards and prevents the \nFCC from setting standards for the computer and communications services \nof the future.\n  I believe that this section is a small but important aspect of this \nhistoric bill: to embrace the future by allowing new technologies to \nflourish with minimal government interference. Just as this bill will \nhelp open markets by eliminating the barriers to long-distance and \nequipment manufacturing competition, Section 301(f) ensures that our \nvital computer and high-tech markets remain open and competitive by \nensuring that the FCC's technical standards are kept to a minimum. \nSince almost all standards in the communications and computer \nindustries are voluntary, private standards, this section of the bill \nmaintains that this practice shall continue. This is very important as \nwe see the accelerating pace of the convergence of the computer and the \ncommunications industries.\n  Section 301(f) modifies the FCC's authority in order to reign in the \nCommission's ongoing rulemaking on cable equipment compatibility. This \nis a problem that arises out of the 1992 \n\n[[Page S705]]\nCable Act, which directed the FCC to assure compatibilitybetween \ntelevisions, VCR's and cable systems. But, I believe that the FCC has \ngone beyond the directions contained in that 1992 law. This section of \nthe conference report prevents the FCC from standardizing any feature \nor protocols that are not necessary for descrambling, by preventing the \nselection of an other home automation protocol as part of the FCC's \ncable compatibility regulations. It further prevents the FCC from \naffecting products in the computer or home automation industry in any \nway. Simply put, Section 301(f) leaves these standards to be set, as \nthey should be, by competition in the marketplace.\n  I understand that some have questioned whether the term ``affect'' is \ntoo broad. Indeed it is a broad term in order to effectively implement \nthe principle that the FCC regulations should not interfere in \ncompetitive markets. Because there is no reason to affect computers or \nhome automation products, and because even inadvertent or relatively \nsmall effects on emerging and rapidly changing markets can easily \ndisplace technological innovation, this section 301(f) is weighted \ntoward protecting competition and open markets. The accompanying \nStatement of Managers states that any material influence on unrelated \nmarkets is prohibited. Because it is impossible for agencies or courts \nto judge whether the impact of technical standards in emerging markets \nwould be harmful or substantial, Section 301(f) draws a bright line to \navoid any regulatory impact whatsoever.\n  I think this is an important policy. The risk associated with wide \nregulatory powers over technological issues in a time when we are \nseeing rapid technical change is that premature or overbroad FCC \nstandards may interfere in the market-driven process of standardization \nor impede technological innovation itself.\n  It is interesting to note that the industry itself has been able to \nsolve compatibility problems, and create workable standards in the VCR, \npersonal computer, compact discs and other products without any \ngovernment involvement. I believe that the inclusion of Section 301(f) \ncontinues that tradition and will permit the industry to set the \nstandards, not the FCC. That is in keeping with the nature of this \nlegislation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, in addition to reforms of the local and long distance \ntelephone companies, this conference report includes a number of \noverdue revisions to the laws regulating the broadcasters. I believe \nthat these changes are necessary to respond to the changing competitive \nnature of the broadcast industry, in the same manner as the changes \nthis conference report foresees for the telephone industry. One of the \nchanges in this legislation includes directions to the Federal \nCommunications Commission to conduct a rule-making on the so-called \nduopoly rule.\n  The duopoly rule was last revised by the FCC in 1964. And it prevents \nthe ownership of more than one television station in a local market. \nThis regulation served a useful purpose by ensuring there would be \ncompetition and a diversity of media voices in a television market.\n  However, in the last 32 years, the local media have gained so many \nnew competitors that I have begun to question whether the duopoly rule \nstill promotes good policy. That is why I endorse the provisions of the \nconference report which direct the FCC to conduct a rule-making to \ndetermine whether to retain, modify, or eliminate this rule.\n  Today, consumers have access to many more broadcast stations than a \ngeneration ago, let alone, a decade ago. More significantly, consumers \ntoday have access to a host of non-broadcast station video providers, \nall of which offer dozens or even hundreds of channels. Competition to \nbroadcasters is coming from the cable industry, wireless cable systems, \nsatellite systems, and video dialtone networks. With such competition, \nI believe that we may have reached the point where the viability of \nfree over-the-air programming, provided by single-channel broadcasters, \nmay be threatened by the new multi-channel competitors.\n  Too many local broadcasters, particularly in smaller markets, are \nalready losing money. This is a concern to me, and should be a concern \nto other Members, because I believe that local television broadcasters \nare just as important as local radio stations and local newspapers. \nTogether, these local broadcasters help to develop a sense of community \nthrough the coverage of local events. It is my hope that the FCC will \nexamine this matter thoroughly and revise the duopoly rule \nappropriately.\n  In addition to the duopoly rule, I am also pleased to see that this \nconference report grandfathers local marketing agreements, or LMA's. \nMany local broadcasters have stayed competitive by entering into these \nLMA's with one another. These innovative joint ventures allow \nseparately owned stations to function cooperatively, achieving \neconomies of scale through combined sales and advertising efforts, and \nshared technical facilities. These local marketing agreements have \nserved their communities in a number of ways: some have increased \ncoverage of local news; others have increased coverage of local sports, \nparticularly college sports; and, many LMA's have provided outlets for \ninnovative local programming and children's programming.\n  Together, a review of the duopoly rule and the grandfathering of \nLMA's, these provisions will help ensure that consumers always have \naccess to free local television programming.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the reform of our communications laws \nis long overdue. This conference report is a comprehensive and balanced \napproach to rewrite our National telecommunications policy for the 21st \nCentury and beyond. After years of debate, negotiations and compromise, \nwe have finally reached the point where we can make the promises of the \nadvanced telecommunications into realities.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \ndetermination and persistence in bringing together a comprehensive and \nbi-partisan bill to the floor. We would not be here today without their \ncombined leadership. We would not have bi-partisan support on the \nconference. As a result, it has earned the support of many on both \nsides of the aisle and the support of the President. S. 652 deserves to \nbecome law and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting final \npassage.\n\n\n          clarification of local station ownership provisions\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the gentleman from South Carolina, the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee, yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I'd be delighted to yield to the gentleman from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The conference report directs the FCC to conduct a \nrulemaking proceeding to determine whether to retain, modify or \neliminate its duopoly rule, which prevents ownership of more than one \ntelevision station in a market. Is it the intent of Congress that in \nreviewing the duopoly rule the FCC should consider whether broadcasters \nare able to compete fairly with other media providers while ensuring \nthat the public receives information from a diversity of media voices?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The gentleman's interpretation is my interpretation as \nwell.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I'd appreciate my colleague's help in clarifying the \nconference report's effect on the Hawaiian television market. No one \nneeds a geography lesson to learn that my state is located in the \nmiddle of the Pacific Ocean. As such, interference with adjacent \ntelevision markets is not a concern and, unlike every other market in \nthe United States, every VHF channel is utilized somewhere in Hawaii's \nmarket.\n  I'd ask of the gentleman, when the FCC considers the duopoly rule, \ndoes he agree that the FCC should strongly consider that Hawaii's \nunique situation represents an example of compelling circumstances that \ncould permit the combination between two VHF stations in that market?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The gentleman from Hawaii is correct. His state's local \ntelevision market developed differently from continental markets \nbecause of its unique geography and terrain, and thus is characterized \nby many VHF stations. Many of our concerns about combinations involving \ntwo VHF stations in local markets in the continental United States do \nnot apply to Hawaii. The FCC should recognize this \n\n[[Page S706]]\ndistinction when considering the duopoly rule.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague for his clarifications and for his \nexpertise and leadership on this historic revision of our \ntelecommunications law.\n  Today's local marketplace is characterized by an abundance of media \noutlets that were not present or contemplated when the rule was last \nrevised, and the FCC should take this development into consideration.\n  This new competition, such as from clustered cable systems offering \nadvertisers the same buy as local broadcasters (but on multiple \nchannels), threatens the very viability of free, over-the-air \nprogramming. Broadcasters have searched for creative solutions to these \nmarketplace changes, and one proven solution has been Local Marketing \nAgreements. These LMAs are innovative joint ventures which enable \nseparately owned stations in the same market to find economies of scale \nthrough combined operations.\n  The need to relax the duopoly rule is illustrated by broadcasters' \nexperience with LMAs. These joint ventures have generated substantial \nrewards for both competition and diversity, and improved the quality \nand quantity of free local programming. In Hawaii, an LMA has made \npossible a significant increase in local programming, including an in-\ndepth local news program at 9 p.m., extensive coverage of the \nUniversity of Hawaii's sporting events, weekly programs on Hawaiian \nculture and local issues, and a doubling of children's programming.\n  It is my understanding that Sec. 202(g) allows LMAs currently in \nexistence to continue as long as they are consistent with FCC rules. \nThese LMAs give stations the flexibility to meet the challenge of the \nmulti-channel marketplace.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member of the Commerce Committee for \nclarifying the intent of the conference report regarding the duopoly \nrule.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of one \nportion of the telecommunications legislation we are currently \nconsidering. In particular, I wish to speak on the cyberporn provisions \nof the bill. I believe that it is high time that Congress apply the \nsame rules to protect children on the Internet that have laws applied \nto other communications media. Since 1934, indecency has been regulated \nin broadcast. And when it became clear that children were vulnerable to \nsexually explicit material over the telephone, Congress prohibited \nproviding indecency to children via the telephone. Today, we are taking \nthe next step in protecting children from child molesters and \nunscrupulous porn merchants.\n  It is important to note that despite the best efforts of the liberal \nestablishment, the Supreme Court has never--not even once--ruled that \nthe indecency standard is unconstitutional. So the vocal opponents of \nthe legislation before us today are going to have a very hard time to \nchallenge it in court. Just a few weeks ago, in the Act III case, the \nSupreme Court was asked to review the constitutionality of the \nindecency standard. But the Supreme Court declined to do so, indicating \nto many constitutional lawyers that the indecency standard is on firmer \nfooting than ever.\n  I predict that the left-wing free-speech absolutists who have \npromised to challenge the cyberporn provisions will have no more \nsuccess with their antifamily efforts than they have had in the past.\n  This summer, I had the opportunity to chair the first-ever \ncongressional hearings on cyberporn. During that hearing, I had the \nopportunity to hear from parents who had discovered that their children \nhad been sent pornography or solicited by adults. One teenager girl was \neven stalked on-line by someone who was later arrested--but had to be \nreleased because his conduct was not illegal.\n  That's why, with the assistance of the distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Pressler, I worked to include a \ncyberstalking provision in the conference committee report. That \nsection makes it a crime to use computers to seduce or lure children. I \nbelieve that this is an important step. As with indecency on computers, \nAmerica's children should be given the same protections in the on-line \nworld that they have in the real world.\n\n  In my hearing this summer, I asked each parent that appeared before \nthe Judiciary Committee--do you believe that a technical solution \nalone, without Federal legislation, is enough to protect their \nchildren. Without exception these parents said no, that the technology \nis part of the Answer, but not the whole answer. So for those who claim \nthat Congress has no role at all to play in protecting America's \nchildren from on-line pornography and child stalking, I say ask \nAmerica's parents about that. The parents of America, who have to try \nto use cumbersome and highly technical computer programs to block out \ncyberporn and on-line child stalkers believe that congressional \nassistance is crucial and that there simply is no other way to keep \nAmerica's children safe.\n  Finally, let me say that me of the most perplexing misrepresentations \nduring the conference deliberations on this matter involved the so-\ncalled harmful to minors standard as opposed to the indecency standard. \nThe harmful-to-minors standard is a creature of State law, and there \nhas never, during the entire history of our Nation, been a Federal \nharmful-to-minors law. On the other hand, Congress has had indecency \nregulations on the books since 1934, the beginning of the mass \ncommunications era. So, despite statements to the contrary, the \nharmful-to-minors standard, which has never been the subject to \ncongressional action, is too uncertain, too new to be applied to the \ndynamic medium of computer communications. I believe that the harmful-\nto-minors standards would unduly chill the kind of freewheeling \ndiscussions we have become used to on the Internet. The tired-and-true \nindecency standard is much better, in the opinion of this Senator and \nnoted constitutional scholars like Bruce Fein.\n  I would like to take my hat off to Senator Exon, Senator Coats, and \nSenator Helms for their work and leadership on this issue. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate finally is \ngoing to pass this important telecommunications bill (S. 652). There \nhave been many attempts down through the years to reform the \ntelecommunications law, and I am happy that the Republicans have been \nable to get the job done this year.\n  This bill will remove barriers to competition and lead to lower \nprices for consumers. It can create as many as 100,000 jobs in North \nCarolina, help spur the economy, lead to innovative developments in \ntechnology, and provide children with greater access to educational \nopportunities. In addition, in the near future, millions of consumers \nwill be able to shop and bank from their homes through the use of their \ncomputers or television sets.\n  Mr. President, one study conducted by the WEFA group projected that \nopen competition could very well lead to 3.4 million new jobs in 10 \nyears. It further concluded that consumers could pay $550 billion less \nin communications rates.\n  There have been many hard fought battles on this bill. But in the end \nthis legislation is a very carefully crafted balance. For example, \nearlier versions of this bill would have allowed for an unhealthy \nconcentration of media power. These proposals could have made local \ncommunity broadcasting a thing of the past; but this concern has been \nresolved.\n  Perhpas most importantly, this bill will help protect children from \ncomputer pornography, which today is readily accessible on the Internet \nand elsewhere. I have been notified of numerous instances in which \nunscrupulous, sleazy individuals have used the Internet as a tool to \ndistribute pornography to minors. This legislation provides tough \nprison terms for any smut peddler who uses a computer to send or \ndisplay child pornography. This bill upholds standards of morality and \ndecency as well as protects children and families from the peddlers of \nsleaze. This is a victory for families and children.\n  Mr. President, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation \nAct of 1995 provides the American consumer with less expensive prices, \nmore competitive opportunities, and better service. Chairman Larry \nPressler and all of his colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee \ndeserve the gratitude and respect of all Americans for a job well done.\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I stand before you today to urge my \ncolleagues to support final passage of this telecommunications reform \nlegislation. It is truly a monumental piece of work. The competitive \nforces that this legislation will unleash will create an explosion of \nnew jobs, new technology. It will secure for this Nation, well into the \nfuture, its rightful place in the forefront of industry and \ntechnological development and utilization.\n  I am pleased that the conference report contains strong protections \nfor America's children. This provision reflects the concern of our \nNation to ensure that, as we establish the framework for the rising \ntide of the technology society, we take care to establish an \nenvironment safe for our children. I am speaking about the provision, \nsponsored by myself and Senator Exon, that deals with the issue of \npornographic material on the internet.\n  Mr. President, sometimes our technology races beyond our reflection, \nand we are left with a dangerous gap--a period when society is \nunprepared to deal with the far-reaching results of rapid change. This \nis the situation we have on the internet. This is the situation which \nthis legislation will address.\n  The type of pornography currently available on the internet includes \nimages and text dealing with the sexual abuse of children, the torture \nof women and images of perversion and brutality beyond normal \nimagination, and beyond the boundaries of human civilization.\n  Childhood must be defended by parents and society as a safe harbor of \ninnocence. It is a privileged time to develop values in an environment \nthat is not hostile to them. But this foul material on the internet \ninvades that place and destroys that innocence. It takes the worst \nexcesses of that red-light district and places it directly into a \nchild's bedroom, on the computer their parents bought them to help them \nwith their homework.\n  Let me take a moment to outline exactly what this legislation will \ndo:\n  Those who utilize a computer to persuade, include entice, or coerce a \nminor to engage in prostitution or any sexual act will be prosecuted, \nfined, and imprisoned up to 10 years.\n\n  If you use your computer to contact and harass another individual, \nyou will be prosecuted under this bill.\n  This legislation would prosecute those who utilize an interactive \ncomputer service to send indecent material directly to a minor or use \nan interactive computer service to display indecent material in a \nmanner easily available to a minor.\n  On-line services and access software providers are liable where they \nare conspirators with, advertise for, are involved in the creation of \nor knowing distribution of obscene material or indecent material to \nminors.\n  This legislation leaves unchanged E-mail privacy laws.\n  Simply put, this legislation extends the same protections for \nchildren that exist everywhere else in our society to the internet.\n  The bottom line is simple: we are removing indecency from areas of \ncyberspace easily accessible to children, if individuals want to \nprovide that material, it must be in areas with barriers to minors, if \nadults want to access that material, they must make a positive effort \nto get it.\n  Our warning is equally clear: if you post indecent material on the \ninternet in areas accessible to children, you will be held to account.\n  Mr. President, one of the most urgent questions in any modern society \nis how we humanize our technology--how we make it serve us. America is \nat the frontier of human knowledge, but it is incomplete without \napplying human values. And one of our most important values is the \nprotection of our children--not only the protection of their bodies \nfrom violence, but the protection of their minds and souls from abuse.\n  We can not, and should not, resist change. But our brave new world \nmust not be hostile to the innocence of our children.\n  Mr. President I am proud that we have taken this very important step. \nI am proud that as we usher in this information age, America has placed \nthe protection of our children as a central issue in this landmark \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, telecommunications technology is evolving \nat a speed that is unprecedented, and it has been and will continue to \nbe difficult to keep up with these revolutionary developments. However, \nwithout a vehicle that allows us to at least attempt to keep pace with \nthese changes, we cannot even hope to take full advantage of the \nbenefits that today's technology potentially affords us.\n  That is why I am pleased to support the telecommunications conference \nreport that we are considering today. It has been a very long and \ndifficult process over a number of years in order to get to this point \ntoday. There have been many hearings held in several committees, long \ndebates in both houses of Congress, and extensive hours spent in \nconference meetings. And, as is always the case with legislation that \nis as important and far-reaching, the conference report we will vote on \nshortly is not perfect.\n  As we have already heard on the floor today during this final debate, \nthere are still a number of issues upon which total consensus has not \nbeen reached. In fact, we can expect to be revisiting a number of \nissues in the not too distant future, and I look forward to that.\n  Nevertheless, I believe we can all agree that this legislation \nestablishes some basic principles that will provide a gateway to the \nfuture of communications in our country. I am convinced that the basic \npolicy changes contained in this conference report will not only \npositively impact our Nation's economy be enhancing competition within \na number of communications markets but will also result in noticeable \nbenefits for individual consumers throughout the United States.\n  I do not wish to take up too much time, but I want to commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee for his \nleadership over the past year in bringing this historic legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate. I especially want to thank him and his \ncommittee colleagues for effectively keeping the conference focused on \nthe communications issues under its jurisdiction. Implementation of the \nlegislation will raise issues in the area of intellectual property, \nwhich will need to be addressed in the future. These issues are best \nleft to the appropriate committees of jurisdiction and expertise. As \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is the committee \nof jurisdiction over intellectual property issues in the Senate, I look \nforward to working on these matters. We can support the efforts of the \nconference and to increase the opportunities the legislation makes \navailable to creators and users of intellectual property.\n  Again, let me commend the conferees for their work in the \ncommunications arena and thank them for not prejudicing the Judiciary \nCommittee's work on any relevant intellectual property issues.\n  I am pleased to support this bill. It is a major step forward.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nconference report to S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act. This legislation will revolutionize our \ntelecommunications industry as broadly as telecommunications have \nrevolutionized our society.\n  And I am pleased that it contains the Snowe-Rockefeller provision \nthat was included in the original Senate bill--a provision of \nsignificant importance to rural regions and rural Americans.\n  I would first like to thank my friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who also served \nas chairman of the House-Senate conference committee on this \nlegislation, Senator Pressler.\n  For over a year now, he has worked tirelessly to shepherd this \nlegislation through the Commerce Committee, the full Senate, and the \nHouse-Senate conference committee. In the process, he has worked to \nensure that telecommunications reform remains a priority for our Nation \nas we enter the next century--a century that is certain to bring even \ngreater advancements in technology and telecommunications.\n  I also want to congratulate the distinguished Senate majority leader, \nSenator Dole, for his outstanding efforts in bringing this critical \nlegislation to the floor of the Senate.\n  Telecommunications is an increasingly important part of our daily \nlife. Over the past few years, most of us have become dependent on \ncommunications services as diverse as wireless \n\n[[Page S708]]\ntelephones, fax machines, information services, computers, pagers, \nalarm monitoring services, and cable television. In many cases, it is \nhard to imagine functioning without them. We are clearly witnessing a \nrevolution in the way we do business and in the way we live, a \ntelecommunications and information revolution as important to our \nfuture as the industrial revolution was in the last century.\n  As I stated during debate on the legislation last summer, my State of \nMaine has, for more than a century, faced serious economic challenges \nin attracting business and industry. Thus, the revolution in \ntelecommunications technologies which has opened the door to the \ninformation age continues to be especially important for Maine.\n  At 60 miles an hour, the speed of truck transportation, Maine's \ngeography can be an economic disadvantage. At the speed of light--the \nspeed with which information can be transmitted over Maine's state-of-\nthe-art telecommunications networks--Maine's location becomes an asset. \nInformation technology coupled with our outstanding quality of life has \ncreated substantial business and employment opportunities in my State.\n  Recognizing the importance of telecommunications to Maine, the Maine \nState Legislature adopted legislation that established the policy goal \nof ensuring that all of Maine's businesses and citizens have affordable \naccess to an integrated telecommunications infrastructure capable of \nproviding voice, data and image-based services.\n  Furthermore, Maine intends to adopt policies that encourage the \ndevelopment and deployment of new technologies, and encourages service \napplications that support economic development initiatives or otherwise \nimprove the well-being of Maine citizens.\n  Mr. President, this conference report will bring unprecedented \ncompetition and development to the telecommunications industry. And \nwhile competition can bring an array of improved services at a lower \ncost, we must ensure that competition ultimately achieves this goal for \nall Americans, in both urban and rural areas.\n  I am, therefore, particularly pleased that the conference report \nbefore us recognizes that strong universal service provisions are a \nnecessary and important part of telecommunications reform.\n  Residents of rural areas should bear no more cost for essential \ntelecommunications services than residents of densely populated areas. \nJust as extending basic telephone service and electrification to rural \nareas rose to the top of our national agenda in the 1930's and 1940's, \nso telecommunications must be a top priority today. No American citizen \nshould be left out of the communications revolution.\n  Indeed, the concept of universal service was established in the 1934 \nCommunication Act, to establish widely available basic telephone \nservice at reasonable rates. The rationale for this policy is that \ntelephone service is essential to link Americans together, so that all \nAmericans can communicate with each other on approximately equal \nfooting. It was an important economic development tool, as well.\n  Everyone in our country must be able to engage in commerce using the \ntools and technologies necessary to interact with buyers and sellers, \nand be able to be informed and to inform others of emergency situations \nand to access emergency services.\n  Presently, every telephone can interconnect with every telephone, but \nevery computer cannot hook up with every computer. If in the future, \ncomputers replace telephones and become the basic standard equipment \nfor communication, a mechanism must to be in place to ensure that all \nAmericans can continue to be interconnected as they are presently via \nthe telephone.\n  Central to the concept of universal service is access for public \ninstitutions, which provide services to a broad segment of our \npopulation. We must ensure that key institutions in our society--\nschools, libraries, and rural hospitals--are also assured affordable \naccess to telecommunications services.\n  That can not be done when schools and libraries are paying business \nrates for educational services like access to the Internet. Business \nrates are frequently beyond these institutions' ability to pay--and \nwithout access, I am concerned about the consequences.\n  The Internet, the ``information highway,'' is increasingly critical \nto our children and our Nation. How can we hope to compete in the world \neconomy if our educational institutions are unable to link with a \ncritical telecommunications link?\n  I strongly believe that the economic future of our children is \ninexorably tied to their education. In turn, education is becoming \nincreasingly entwined with the use of emerging technologies and the \ninformation these services carry and provide.\n  Our schools need access to educational telecommunications services to \nprepare our children for economic success. In the 21st century, our \nchildren will be competing in a global economy where knowledge is \npower. Their future depends on their ability to master the tools and \nskills needed in that economy.\n  Unfortunately, there is a widening gap between the high expectations \nof an increasingly technologically driven society and the inability of \nmost schools--particularly rural schools--to prepare students \nadequately for the high-technology future. Almost 90 percent of \nkindergarten through 12th grade classrooms lack even basic access to \ntelephone service.\n  Telecommunications can help us provide a world class education to \nchildren across America. If we want young people to actively use the \ntechnology of the future so it becomes second nature to them, then we \nmust ensure that schools are part of the national information \ninfrastructure.\n  For starters, telecommunications will enable students and teachers to \ndo research in libraries across the country and the world, and to \nconnect to experts and other students across the country. It will \nensure that small schools in remote rural areas, and schools with \nlimited financial resources have access to the same rich learning \nresources.\n  Consider that only 30 percent of schools with enrollments of less \nthan 300 have Internet access, while 58 percent of schools with \nenrollments of 1,000 or more reported having Internet access. Only 3 \npercent of classrooms in public schools are connected to the Internet, \nand cost is cited as a major barrier to access.\n  Rural schools and libraries usually pay more for access to \ninformation services than schools and libraries in urban areas because \nthe information service providers do not have access points in local \ncalling regions, meaning that rural schools and libraries must make a \nlong distance telephone call to access the Internet and other \ninformation services. It is imperative that access the information \nsuperhighway be affordable, because America's schools and public \nlibraries operate on very slim, inflexible budgets.\n  And it is an area where we need the strength and innovation of the \nprivate sector as well. That's why I am especially pleased to note that \nNYNEX and the independent telephone companies that serve Maine have \nalready taken steps to deploy and encourage the utilization of needed \ntelecommunications services throughout Maine. As a result of a unique \nagreement with Maine's telephone companies--all Maine libraries and \nschools are now eligible to receive substantially discounted long \ndistance services that will now allow access to a broad range of \ninformation services.\n  But schools and libraries in Maine and across America will not be the \nonly ones to benefit from this provision. So does our health care \nsystem through telemedicine. When I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I cowrote the Rural Health Care Coalition's ``Rural \nHealth Care Bill of Rights.''\n  The paper argued that Congress should adopt policies that seek to \nensure that those who live in rural areas receive the same quality of \nhealth care as other Americans. All Americans, regardless of their age, \nincome, employment status, medical history or geographic location, have \na right to access affordable, quality health care.\n  Telemedicine can help us achieve this goal by enabling physicians in \nrural areas to communicate through state-of-the-art telecommunications \nnetworks with providers and specialists in other areas.\n  With Telemedicine, a burn victim in Presque Isle, ME, may be able to \nget care from some of the Nation's best \n\n[[Page S709]]\nburn specialists, without ever leaving the local hospital. Rural \ndoctors will be able to connect directly to major hospital centers for \nconsultation, diagnostic assistance, and ongoing professional \neducation. However, rural areas pay significantly more than urban areas \nfor transmission of Telemedicine services.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Snowe-Rockefeller provision is \nfundamentally important to assuring that we do not end up with a two-\ntiered telecommunications system in America.\n  The Snowe-Rockefeller provision is fundamental to assuring that all \nareas in America have access to the essential telecommunications \nservices of the future. And it is fundamental to ensuring that this \nlegislation provides a solid foundation for the future.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation offers tremendous \npromise, making this among the most exciting and meaningful bills we \nwill vote on this session.\n  By promoting true competition in telecommunications while providing \nnecessary safeguards that further the goal of competition and serve the \npublic interest, this conference report offers a strong framework on \nwhich the technological future of America can be built. I believe that \nthis bill strikes the right balance that is needed, and offer my strong \nsupport. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased that after years of \nstruggle, the Senate has before it, a telecommunications reform \nconference report that represents the dawning of a new \ntelecommunications era in this country.\n  I want to commend the Commerce Committee chairman, Senator Pressler, \nand the ranking member, Senator Hollings, for their hard work and \nefforts in bringing a measure before us today that will enhance true \ncompetition in telecommunications without shortchanging American \nconsumes.\n  This is complex and potentially far-reaching legislation, that will \naffect an economic sector that constitutes 20 percent of our economy, \nand whose services reach virtually every American.\n  Mr. President, this bill is all about competition in telephone \nservices, cable services, information and data services, and \nbroadcasting services. By unleashing these competitive forces, \ninnovation and progress will flourish in the rapidly expanding \ntelecommunications field, and will greatly increase the opportunity for \nevery citizen to affordably access the rapidly changing world of \nadvanced telecommunications technology.\n  While this legislation focuses on competition and deregulation, the \nconference report contains essential rural safeguards in the form of \nuniversal service provisions that will benefit our rural communities \nand greatly increase their ability to persevere in the 21st century.\n  There is little doubt that our urban areas can and will sustain the \nenormous expansion of telecommunications services in the years ahead. \nWe must make certain that our rural areas are not left behind as \nservices expand and new products come on line. In the long run, \nuniversal service at high standards nationwide is in the best interests \nof the entire economy.\n  I believe that telecommunications reform is essential in preserving \nthe economic vitality of rural America and am optimistic that the \naffordable accessibility to these new telecommunications services will \nbe the harbinger for a new renaissance among the main street economies \nin communities throughout rural America.\n  Already, many in my home State of South Dakota are beginning to \nrealize the importance and value of telecommunications services. Many \nsmall, rural medical clinics and hospitals are linking together with \nlarger, more urban hospitals via telemedicine to provide their citizens \nwith a higher quality of care. Children in schools that are hundreds of \nmiles from the nearest population center can now have access to the \nworld's greatest libraries at their fingertips. An increasing number of \nSouth Dakota agricultural producers are determining weather forecasts \nand market reports with a simple keystroke. And all across main street \nSouth Dakota, small businesses are reducing their overhead via \nnetworking services, reducing their paper work through electronic mail, \nand saving thousands of dollars a year in travel expenses through their \nuse of teleconferencing.\n  And all of this is just the beginning, As these technologies continue \nto develop, the playing field for economic development will begin to \nlevel. South Dakota is already enjoying the benefits of advanced \ntelecommunications and they can only stand to benefit from further \ntelecommunications reform.\n  The bill before us also recognizes the important role that must be \nplayed by Public Utilities Commissions [PUC's] in rural States. PUC's \nare the best entities to judge whether a given market within their \nState can support competition. That's not a judgment we should make \nfrom Washington.\n  Nor is it something we can or should leave to the unbridled, \nunsupervised judgment of the private sector. Those who have taken the \nrisks and made the investments to extend cable or phone services to \nsmaller rural communities should not be placed a risk of being \noverwhelmed by larger, better-financed companies.\n  I want to note, Mr. President, that consideration of this conference \nreport was delayed by the concerns raised by Senator Dole and others \nabout the future use of broadcast spectrum. There is no question that \nthe issues surrounding national spectrum management policy are complex, \nand worthy of full debate and thorough consideration in the Congress. I \nam pleased that the telecommunications conference report, which in my \nview is not a spectrum giveaway bill, will move to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  Mr. President, let me once again congratulate the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member for their efforts in producing this \ntelecommunications reform conference report.\n  Having been raised in a small community in rural South Dakota, I can \ntruly remark with wonder and appreciation at the rapid pace in which \nour communities are being brought together through the use of \ntelecommunications services. The changes that have occurred in our \nlives due to these services have been remarkable, and have benefited \nsociety greatly. I believe that the telecommunications reform \nconference report before us today strikes the balance needed between \nderegulation and consumer protection to allow these services to \ncontinue their remarkable advances in improving our society and \npreparing us for the challenges ahead.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the United States and, indeed, the world \nhave embarked upon a new technological revolution. Like previous \nrevolutions sparked by technological innovation, this one has the \npotential to change dramatically our daily lives. It will certainly \ntransform the way we communicate with each other.\n  What we are witnessing is the development of a fully interactive \nnationwide and, indeed, worldwide communications network. It has the \npotential to bring our Nation and our world enormous good; without \nappropriate groundrules to assure fair competition, however, this \nrevolution could create giant monopolies. It could hurt workers and \nfamilies. We bear a tremendous responsibility to assure that does not \nhappen with this legislation. The communications policy framework we \ncreate here will determine whether many voices and views flourish, or \nfew voices dominate our society.\n  The impact of this new age communications revolution on the way we \nsend and receive information, and the way we will view ourselves and \nthe world, is profound. Even more staggering is its potential impact on \nour economy. We could be seeing the largest market opportunity in \nhistory. Some forecasters, including the WEFA Group in Burlington, MA, \npredict an opening of the telecommunications market this year to full \ncompetition would create 3.4 million new jobs, increase GDP by $298 \nbillion, save consumers nearly $550 billion in lower communications \nrates and increase the average household's annual disposable income by \n$850 over the next ten years. As the Communications Workers of America \nhave underscored, delaying free and fair competition means fewer new \nhigh-wage, high-skill jobs.\n  For workers and companies in Massachusetts, which has a significant \ncomparative advantage in technology or knowledge-intensive industries, \nthis \n\n[[Page S710]]\nlegislation is good news. It should expand opportunities for our \ncurrent telecommunications companies, it should create a fertile \nclimate for the creation of new companies and it should create more \nfamily-wage jobs. The telecommunications industry in Massachusetts is \nwell situated to take advantage of the communications and information \nrevolution.\n  New telecommunications-related or dependent technologies and \nindustries seem to be emerging and merging almost daily. They range \nfrom such sectors as entertainment and education to broadcasting, \nadvertising, home shopping and publishing. One key player in this \nrevolution is the Internet--the global computer cooperative with a \ncurrent subscriber base of approximately 37 million in North America \nalone and a 10-15 percent monthly growth rate. One billion people are \nexpected to have access to the ``net'' by the end of the decade. While \nsome may consider the ``net'' to be the revolution, it is only one of \nmany players in the new communications network game.\n  We see examples of this new era almost daily, such as someone driving \na car while talking on a cellularphone. In the future, we are likely to \nsee more Americans accessing video dialtone, choosing their television \nprograms through their telephone service. Likewise, cable franchises \nmay enter the local telephone service market. Residents of Springfield, \nMA, may be able to watch their state legislators in Boston debate an \neducation bill and instantaneously communicate with those legislators \nabout how to vote on an amendment.\n  As we consider this brave new age of communications, it is clear the \ncurrent law, the l934 Communications Act, is not a sufficiently sturdy \nfoundation upon which to build a communications system for the 21st \nCentury. Moreover, although the courts on occasion properly have \nintervened to halt monopoly abuse--most notably a little over a decade \nago in the telephone industry--we should no longer leave the \nfundamentals of telecommunications policy to the courts.\n  The conference report on S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition \nand Deregulation Act of l996, is not perfect. In some respects, I would \nhave preferred S. 1822, the bill crafted so ably by Senator Hollings \nand reported by the committee in l994. However, the conference report \nbefore the Senate now is preferable to the status quo. It will foster \ncompetition and establish fair and reasonable groundrules for the \nintense competition that will continue in the communications sector as \nwe enter the next century.\n  This legislation sets forth a national policy framework to promote \nthe private sector's deployment of new and advanced telecommunications \nand information technologies and services to all Americans by opening \nall telecommunications markets to competition. Free and fair \ncompetition and maintaining universal service are the twin pillars of \nthis new framework.\n  The bill seeks to assure that no competitor, no business and no \ntechnology may use its existing market strength to gain an advantage on \nthe competition. The legislation requires that a company or group of \ncompanies satisfy certain competitive tests before being able to offer \na new service or enter a new market. Entry into new services and new \nareas is contingent upon a demonstration that competition exists in the \nmarket in which the business currently competes. But once competition \nhas been achieved, most Federal and State regulation is replaced by \nconsumer demand to regulate the market.\n  These fundamental features of the conference report on S. 652 are \ndesigned to create a level playing field where every player will be \nable to compete on the basis of price, quality, and service, rather \nthan on the basis of monopoly control of the market.\n  The conference report also maintains universal service as a \ncornerstone of our Nation's communications system. With many new \nentrants in the communications market, the legislation provides that \nevery player is to pay his fair share to continue universal service \nthroughout our Nation.\n  I am also pleased the conference report includes three amendments \nwhich I sponsored. The first deals with the cable broadcast rates for \npublic, educational and governmental entities, known as ``PEG'' access \ngroups. These are the local channels that produce and broadcast such \nthings as town council meetings, Chamber of Commerce seminars and \nlittle league baseball games. My amendment will assure the continued \nproduction and broadcast of these important community events by \nguaranteeing that the PEG access groups are not charged more than local \nbroadcasters to air their programs.\n  The second amendment will establish a level playing field for \nindependent payphone providers. For too long, these small, independent \nentrepreneurs have gone toe-to-toe against some of the biggest players \nin the telecommunications market. We have in Massachusetts about 75 \nindependent payphone providers, employing several hundred people. They \nrange from ``mom and pop'' operations with a handful of payphones to \nseveral that have more than 1,000 payphones. Virtually all of them have \ninvested their own capital in their businesses, from life savings to \nthe proceeds of mortgages on their homes, and it is a tribute to their \nperseverance that they now own ten percent of the payphone market in \nMassachusetts. My amendment will allow all the players in the payphone \nmarket to compete against each other on the basis of price, quality and \nservice, rather than on marketshare and subsidies.\n  The third amendment will make sure that as we build the information \nhighway, the builders do not bypass poor rural or urban communities. \nWhen interstate highways were built through cities across our Nation, \noftentimes they went directly through poor neighborhoods. Construction \nof the technology interstate system must not be allowed to detour \naround children and families in the same or similar areas who already \nface enormous challenges. My amendment is designed to assure that the \ntelecommunications network will reach every neighborhood, offering \naccess to those who need it most for a decent education, to upgrade \ntheir job skills or to connect them to medical help they need.\n  Another provision that I am pleased was included in the final hours \nof negotiations on the conference report relates to local regulation of \npublic rights-of-way. The language added to the conference report \nbrings needed clarification to this area. It retains for local \nauthorities the right to regulate public rights-of-way while at the \nsame time guaranteeing that if local authorities exercise that \nlatitude, they do so in a manner that is non-discriminatory and \ncompetitively neutral. A cable or phone company that needs to tear up a \nstreet to lay new line should not be allowed to disturb a neighborhood \nin the middle of the night. The clarifying language on public rights-\nof-way should help in this regard.\n  Through the debate we have had on this legislation, I believe we have \ncrafted a solid telecommunications policy framework for the next \ncentury. Today, each of us is in a sense a pioneer heading out on the \nnew information highway. Each of us is not only a witness to, but a \nparticipant in, one of the most amazing technological revolutions in \nhistory. We, as legislators, bear a special responsibility to assure \nthat competition in this new era is fair and that every American in \nthis and future generations may enjoy the fruits of this competition. \nThis is truly one of the greatest challenges we face as we enter the \n21st century.\n  I want to express my deep admiration for the outstanding work my good \nfriend and colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, has done on \nthis landmark legislation. He has exercised visionary leadership \nthroughout this long and arduous process. I also want to extend my \nappreciation to his very able staff, particularly Kevin Curtin, John \nWindhausen and Kevin Joseph, for their tireless efforts and the good \nhumour they always brought to the task. I also want to thank Chairman \nPressler and his staff for their hard work on this legislation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend the leadership, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Hollings, for their extensive \nefforts and good work on the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I am \npleased that the Senate is now giving consideration to final passage of \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n  I have seen the telephone business develop from its infancy, when \nobtaining a party-line telephone was a truly amazing step for many \nAmericans, to today's tremendous range of telecommunications products \nand services. It is impossible to predict what the future holds in this \ndynamic sector of our economy, but it is clear that telecommunications \nis among the most critical and far-reaching issues before the Congress.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust, Business \nRights, and Competition Subcommittee, two important antitrust issues \ndeserve mention as we consider final passage of this historic \nlegislation.\n  First, I am pleased that the legislation now includes a meaningful \nrole for the Department of Justice in determining when the Bell \nOperating Companies should be permitted to provide long distance \ntelecommunications. As I have previously stated, the Bell companies \ncertainly should be allowed to enter long distance markets under \nappropriate circumstances, for it is generally desirable to have as \nmany competitors as possible in each market. The issue is how to \ndetermine the point at which entry by Bell companies will help rather \nthan harm competition. That question, quite simply, is an antitrust \nmatter which will be informed by the antitrust expertise and \nspecialization of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.\n  The Justice Department's Antitrust Division has been deeply involved \nin nurturing and protecting a competitive environment in this industry \nfor more than 20 years, through five administrations. The Justice \nDepartment was responsible for the breakup of the AT telephone \nmonopoly, which created the current Bell companies. The Antitrust \nDivision has been evaluating the potential competitive effects--\npositive and negative--of Bell entry into long distance since that \ntime. Through this work, the Division has achieved unparalled expertise \nwhich is bolstered by its experience and perspective gained from \nevaluating numerous markets throughout our economy.\n  Anticompetitive conduct in long distance markets was at the heart of \nthe Antitrust Division's case against the old Bell system monopoly, and \nit has been a central concern in the current legislation. During the \ndebate over the telecommunications bill in the Senate in June 1995, I \nwas on the floor for several days with an amendment to give the \nDepartment of Justice primary responsibility to determine when the Bell \noperating companies should be permitted to enter long distance markets, \nand to avoid duplicative efforts by the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  My amendment to give the Antitrust Division independent authority \nonly narrowly failed on the Senate floor last June, while in August a \nsimilar amendment received the support of more than one-third of the \nHouse of Representatives. When it became clear that there would be one \nconsolidated procedure within the FCC to decide on Bell applications \nfor long distance authorization, it became important to ensure that the \nantitrust expertise of the Antitrust Division would be given adequate \nweight in the decision.\n  I am pleased that in the final legislation we are considering today, \nproposed long distance entry is determined by the FCC subject to \njudicial review, but only after the FCC consults with the Attorney \nGeneral on the application, and gives the Attorney General's evaluation \nsubstantial weight. This process, which permits the Attorney General to \nsubmit any comments and supporting materials deemed appropriate, is \ncritical to making accurate and proper determinations about long \ndistance entry. Through its work in investigating the \ntelecommunications industry and enforcing the MFJ, the Antitrust \nDivision has accumulated important knowledge, evidence, and experience \nthat can be constructively brought to bear on these evaluations.\n  The substantial weight requirement will also ensure that the \nexpertise of the Antitrust Division will be brought to bear in any \nappeal of a decision made on long distance entry. If the FCC rejects \nthe Antitrust Division's recommendation, the court must look to the \nweight the FCC accorded the Attorney General's evaluation in \nascertaining whether the FCC correctly followed the law.\n  Review of this legal requirement should be governed by the standard \nthat generally applies to questions of law. As a practical matter, this \nlegal requirement ensures that the reviewing court will consider the \nAntitrust Division's position on the merits--and will assess for itself \nthe views and evidence put forward in support of that position--and \nwill not discount that position out of customary judicial deference to \nthe FCC's decision. Moreover, the Antitrust Division retains its full \nauthority to represent the interests of the United States on appeal, \nwhich permits it to contribute its unique antitrust expertise and \nperspective to the judicial process.\n  The second important antitrust issue in this legislation is the \nunequivocal antitrust savings clause that explicitly maintains the full \nforce of the antitrust laws in this vital industry. Today we take for \ngranted that the antitrust laws apply to the communications sector. \nDuring the Antitrust Division's antitrust case in the 1970's against \nthe Bell system, however, some argued that the existence of FCC \nregulations displaced the antitrust laws and made them inapplicable. \nThe courts emphatically rejected that challenge them, and the antitrust \nsavings clause in the bill today makes clear that that question cannot \nbe reopened. A strong, competitive communications sector is essential \nto continued American prosperity in the next century. Application of \nthe antitrust laws is the most reliable, time-tested means of ensuring \nthat competition, and the innovation it fosters, can flourish to \nbenefit consumers and the economy.\n  The antitrust savings clause makes clear, for example, that the \nantitrust enforcement agencies are not barred from scrutinizing, under \nappropriate circumstances, the home satellite broadcasting market, even \nthough the new provision in section 205 of the bill gives the FCC \nexclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct-to-home \nsatellite services. While some might have been tempted to read that \nprovision to mean that the antitrust enforcement agencies would not \nhave any jurisdiction over these activities, the antitrust savings \nclause makes clear that that is not the case. The same is true of other \nprovisions of the bill, including those concerning access requirements \nfor commercial mobile providers--section 705--limits on telco-cable \nbuyouts--section 302--and broadcast ownership--section 202--and the \njoint marketing of commercial mobile services--section 601(d). In each \ncase, the antitrust laws will continue to apply fully.\n  Continued application of the antitrust laws is also the rule where \nthe Bell companies' entry into the long distance market is concerned. \nThe fact that the Attorney General is given a defined role in the FCC \nproceeding to decide Bell entry does not in any way supplant or limit \nthe separate applicability of the antitrust laws or the Justice \nDepartment's antitrust enforcement authority--either pre-entry or post-\nentry. For example, if a Bell operating company sought to enter long \ndistance markets through a merger or acquisition, that merger or \nacquisition would be fully subject to review under the Clayton Act. \nLikewise, if a Bell operating company were to engage in anticompetitive \nconduct after being granted entry into the long distance market, the \nAntitrust Division would not be precluded from addressing that conduct \nthrough the antitrust laws.\n\n  The importance of the antitrust savings clause is underscored by the \ndecision to repeal section 221(a) of the Communications Act of 1934. \nThat provision, a relic from the period when Federal policy sought to \npromote monopoly over competition, exempts mergers between telephone \ncompanies from antitrust review. That is an era I believe all of us \nagree should be put behind us, and the fact that this exemption has \nbeen eliminated in this legislation is another confirmation that the \nCongress intends for the antitrust laws to be the means by which free \nmarkets are maintained in telecommunications.\n  Finally, the hearing of the Antitrust, Business Rights, and \nCompetition Subcommittee, which I chaired in May 1995, confirmed the \nimportance of competition to achieve lower prices, better services, and \nproducts, and more innovation in telecommunication markets for the \nbenefit of consumers and our Nation. I am pleased, therefore, that this \nlegislation preserves the role of \n\n[[Page S712]]\nthe Antitrust Division in applying the antitrust laws--which have \nprotected free enterprise for over 100 years--in the telecommunications \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, enacting legislation of this magnitude, where the \nstakes are so high for so many businesses and other interested groups, \ninevitably requires the resolution of many conflicts. I would like to \ncommend all those who worked on this legislation and kept focused on \nthe ultimate objective--replacing regulation and monopoly with healthy \nfree market forces. This is the role that the Congress should play to \nassist this industry, as well as American consumers and the entire \nAmerican economy. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation.\n\n\n                           unfunded mandates\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The majority leader is aware that State and local \ngovernments had previously raised an issue with this Senator that \ncertain provisions of the conference report on S. 562 may violate the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 regarding local governments' \nability to manage their rights-of-ways. The majority leader is also \naware that I have worked with the Senate and House conferees for \nseveral days to resolve those difficulties and insert language to the \nsatisfaction of the local representatives of State and local \ngovernments.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Idaho is correct. I am aware that he has \nworked to represent the interests of State and local governments to \nassure that there is no unfunded mandates impact on them in this bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The majority leader is aware that the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995 does not require the Congressional Budget \nOffice to prepare an estimate of the impact of mandates on State and \nlocal governments for conference reports and that the Congressional \nBudget Office is currently preparing an estimate on this conference \nreport. Based on discussions my staff have had with CBO, it is my \nunderstanding that this conference report does not include unfunded \nmandates.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the majority leader agree that in the event the \nCongressional Budget Office determines that there are any unfunded \nmandates in S. 562 that he will work with me to make technical \ncorrections in the bill to eliminate those mandates.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the majority leader agree that in the event such \ntechnical corrections bill comes from the House which corrects any \nunfunded mandates found by the Congressional Budget Office that he will \nseek to have the Senate take up the bill to make those corrections.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, I do agree.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport on S. 652, the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  I know, Mr. President, that the conferees have made a number of \nimprovements to this legislation and that many of the stakeholders in \nthis bill are pleased with the results.\n  And it is with regret that I must oppose this bill. But I cannot in \ngood conscience cast a vote for legislation that I believe violates our \nfundamental first amendment rights to freedom of expression.\n  The Internet indecency provisions of S.652, as passed in the Senate, \nremain virtually intact in the conference report. I am referring to the \nsections of this bill which would subject to criminal penalties \nconstitutionally protected speech via interactive telecommunications \nnetworks--the so-called Internet Indecency provisions.\n  The sponsors of the Internet provisions have good intentions --to \nprotect children from those who might use the Internet to harm them. \nSadly, there are those who will use the Internet, as they will use any \ntool, to victimize children. The sponsors of the Internet provisions of \nthis bill have pointed to the obscene materials and child pornography \nthat can be accessed via the Internet. To be sure, Mr. President, it is \nout there.\n  Unfortunately, the provisions in this bill will do very little, if \nanything to protect children. That is because much of what the \nproponents of this legislation wish to banish from cyberspace is \nalready subject to criminal penalties--obscenity, child pornography and \nchild exploitation via computer networks are already criminal acts.\n  So, if that is the case, what exactly does the provision in the \nconference report cover? It covers ``indecent'' speech which is \nafforded far greater constitutional protection than obscenity which is \nnot protected by the first amendment. What is indecent speech? Indecent \nspeech may include mild profanity that children hear on the playground \nwell before they read it on a computer screen. While that language may \nbe offensive to some, it is protected by the first amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have found the rhetoric of the Internet debate \ninteresting. The terms obscenity and indecency have been used \ninterchangeably even though they have very different meanings. I have \nheard parents voice legitimate concerns about the obscene materials \navailable via computer networks. I have heard them express outrage that \ntheir children are solicited by adults for exploitative purposes. But I \nhave never heard a parent say there is too much profanity on the \nInternet. And yet, that is precisely what this bill covers. Rather than \naddressing the enforcement needs of existing law, it adds unnecessary \nto provisions to criminal statutes.\n  That is a fundamental flaw, Mr. President. The legislation does not \naddress the problem it seeks to solve. This does nothing more than \ncurrent law does to prevent obscenity on the Internet. Instead, this \nbill steps in and decides for parents which speech is appropriate for \ntheir children and which is not. I would contend, Mr. President, that \nis the role of parents, not the federal government, particularly given \nthat technology exists for parents to block objectionable material.\n  I think, Mr. President, this legislation will do more harm than good. \nWill parents become less observant of their childrens' use of the \nInternet now that they think the government has solved the problem? \nWill they fail to use the technology available to them to regulate \ntheir children's access to sites on the Internet? I fear that they will \nbecause the U.S. Congress has led them to believe that these new \nprovisions protect children when in fact, they do not.\n  This legislation which provides no additional protection for children \ncomes at a great cost--our rights to free speech over the Internet. \nThis legislation, when it becomes law, will establish different \nstandards for the same speech appearing in different media. More \nprotection will be afforded for profanity that appears in a library \nbook than for the same text which appears on-line. Equally important, \nthis legislation will require all adults to self censor the speech on \npublic newsgroups on USENET to what is appropriate for children in the \nmost conservative American communities. This legislation will bring \nabout the immediate demise of many socially valuable forums on the \nInternet. It will likely happen as quickly as CompuServe dumped some \n200 newsgroups from their network after a German prosecutor suggested \nthey might violate German law.\n  I have come to this floor many times to speak on this topic and I \nwill not take the Senate's time to reiterate the many arguments against \nthese provisions.\n  I do think, Mr. President, that this is a sad day on the Senate \nfloor. That the Internet indecency provisions have met with the barest \nresistance in this chamber, indicates how quickly this Congress is \nwilling to abandon the United States Constitution in favor of political \nexpediency.\n  My hope, Mr. President, is that the expedited judicial review process \nprovided for in this bill, will quickly lead to a judgment that the \nInternet indecency provisions are unconstitutional. In the meantime, \nMr. President, I will work toward solutions that will protect children \non the Internet without trampling on the first amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the conference report on S. 652 is finally \nbeing considered by the Senate. We have heard much about the positive \nchanges to this bill and the ramifications for the telecommunications \nindustry. But I must still express my concern about the absence of a \nprovision that I see as vital to the protection of the American \nconsumer. I am referring to the capability of telecommunication \nentities to \n\n[[Page S713]]\ndevelop monopolies and dominate marketplaces to the detriment of the \nconsumer.\n  This Nation learned through long and hard experience that laissez-\nfaire attitudes towards industries does not protect smaller entities \nwhen larger competition comes along and certainly does not provide \nsafeguards where consumers are concerned. I acknowledge the roles of \ngovernment oversight that the bill does now provide. But the larger \ncorporations will not be constrained in their ability, should they \ndesire, to monopolize media and various telecommunication mediums. And \nin our effort to allow such an environment do we want to place the \nconsumer on the altar of deregulation?\n  Nevertheless, my constituents from Nevada believe this bill will \nprovide genuine competition. And I note with some pride, their \nforesight and fairness in establishing a telephony commission to watch \nover the changes within the industry. Mr. President, the \ntelecommunications industry is clearly evolving. Everyday we read of \nnew emerging technologies that will directly impact all that this bill \nis trying to accomplish. While we should give it freedom to compete; we \nmust, as is our responsibility, watch carefully to protect the \nconsumers and small businesses so that this sphere of our economy is \ntruly competitive. Despite my reservations, I will vote for this bill \nbecause there are positives and I hope that steadfast government \noversight will preserve the competitive marketplace.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, anyone who has followed the debate over \ntelecommunications legislation in recent years knows that much of it \nhas been over when and under what conditions the Bell companies will be \nallowed to compete in the long distance market S. 652 resolves this \nissue.\n  Congress has determined that removing all court ordered barriers to \ncompetition--including the MFJ interLATA restriction--will benefit \nconsumers by lowering prices and accelerating innovation. The \nlegislation contemplates that the FCC should act favorably and \nexpeditiously on Bell company petitions to compete in the long distance \nbusiness. There are various conditions for interLATA relief. These \ninclude the establishment of Sate-by-State interconnection agreements \nthat satisfy the 14 point check list outlined in Sec. 271 of the bill. \nBell companies also have to show they face competition from a \nfacilities based carrier. They can also show that they have not \nreceived a legitimate request for interconnection from a competing \nservice provider within three months of enactment.\n  In short, interLATA relief should be granted as soon as competing \ncommunications service providers reach an interconnection agreement. In \nsome States these agreements have already been put in place with the \napproval of state public service commissions. In those instances, we \nsee no reason why the FCC should not act immediately and favorably on a \nBell company's petition to compete, once the test for facilities based \ncompetition is satisfied.\n  Congress fully expects the FCC to recognize and further its intent to \nopen all communications markets to competition at the earliest possible \ndate. The debate over removing legal and regulatory barriers to \ncompetition has been resolved with this legislation. Unnecessary delays \nwill do nothing more than invite vested interests to ``game'' the \nregulatory process to prevent or delay competition.\n  The time has come to let consumers--not bureaucrats--choose.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we are voting on the approval of \nhistoric telecommunications legislation that will reshape the landscape \nof the entire communications industry and affect every household in \nthis country. The future success of America's economy and society is \ninextricably linked to the universe of telecommunications. After a \ndecade of intense debate, this legislation rewrites the Nation's \ncommunications laws from top to bottom.\n  The bill before us, S. 652, has come a long way and survived many \nbattles. It is not a perfect bill in the sense that no one got \neverything they wanted--but I believe it will unleash a new era in \ntelecommunications that will forever change our society and make our \nNation a key driver on the information superhighway. We should applaud \nthis amazing effort and support the conference report to S. 562.\n  The debate over this measure has never been about the need for \nreform--everyone agrees that it's time. The real debate has been over \nhow we reform our telecommunications law. The 1934 Communications Act \nserves our country as the cornerstone of communications law in the \nUnited States. The current regulatory structure set up by the 1934 act \nis based on the premise that information transmitted over wires can be \neasily distinguished from information transmitted through the air. So \nregulations were put in place to treat cable, broadcast, and telephone \nindustries separately and for the most part, to preclude competition.\n  However, advances in technology have brought us to a melding of \ntelephone, video, computers, and cable. Digital technology allows all \nmedia to speak the same language. These once neat regulatory categories \nbetween telecommunications industries have started to blur and the \nassumptions upon which they are based are fast becoming obsolete.\n  The essential purpose of this measure is to foster competition by \nremoving barriers between distinct telecommunications industries and \nallowing everyone to compete in each other's business. But how do we \nincrease competition while simultaneously ensuring that everyone is \nplaying on a level playing field?\n  Coming from a rural State, this was an especially important question \nfor me. The overall goal of this legislation is to increase competition \nand I wholeheartedly believe that increased competition will benefit \nconsumers. However, we must also recognize that telecommunications \ncompetition is limited in some areas, especially in many rural areas. \nThe high cost of providing telecommunications to rural areas is \nprohibitive for most telecommunications service providers without some \nincentive. The 1934 communications bill understood this and adopted a \nprinciple called universal service, which was thankfully maintained and \nupdated in S. 652.\n  The universal service concept charged the FCC with responsibility for \n``making available, so far as possible to all people of the United \nStates a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio \ncommunications service with adequate facilities at reasonable \ncharges.'' So far we have done a heck of a job: 98 percent of American \nhomes have television and radio, 94 percent have telephone, close to 80 \npercent have a VCR, while 65 percent subscribe to cable TV--96 percent \nhave the option.\n\n  Without universal service protections, advanced telecommunications \nwill blow right by rural America creating a society of information \nhaves and have nots. S.652 recognizes that the definition of universal \nservice is evolving as the technology changes. S. 652 requires the FCC \nto establish a Federal-State joint board to recommend rules to reform \nthe universal service system. The Joint Board will base its policies on \nprinciples which understands that access to quality, advanced \ntelecommunications services should be provided to all Americans at a \nreasonable cost.\n  I was particularly pleased to support an amendment, now in the bill \nbefore us, which guarantees that our nation's K-12 schools, libraries \nand rural health care providers have affordable access to advanced \ntelecommunications services for education. As Congress moves forward on \nthis bold legislation it is vital to provide a mechanism to assure that \nchildren and other community users have access to the information \nsuperhighway. The information superhighway must be available and \naffordable to all Americans through schools and libraries.\n  And in the midst of the great battles among corporate titans like the \nBaby Bells and the major long distance carriers it's also important to \nbalance the needs of the little guy. Small businesses are the backbone \nof economic and community life in this country. I was proud to put \nforward two provisions, included in this bill, which maintained the \nintegrity of small businesses in the telecommunications revolution.\n  My first provision amended the telecommunications bill to allow \ncompanies with under 5 percent of the market nationally, to continue \noffering joint marketing services. Under current law, joint marketing \ncompanies can approach a business and offer to provide \n\n[[Page S714]]\nthem local and long distance service together, at a low rate. The \nbusiness therefore gets a low cost integrated service, with the \nconvenience of having only one vendor and one bill to deal with for all \ntheir telephone service. In an effort to prevent the big long distance \ncompanies from having a competitive advantage, the original \ntelecommunications bill would have prohibited joint marketing.\n  Such a prohibition would have put small company owners like Clark \nMcLeod out of business. Mr. McLeod has been offering joint marketing \nservices to businesses in Iowa for several years. In the process he has \ncreated thousands of jobs and filled a need for service. While I think \nany prohibition on joint marketing is anti-competitive, my proposal \nwill at least allow the many innovative companies like Mr. McLeod, to \ncontinue their operations and continue to provide the services valued \nby so many Iowans.\n  My other small business provision prevents the Bell Operating \ncompanies from entering into the alarm industry before a level playing \nfield exists. The burglar and alarm industry is unique among small \nbusinesses in the telecommunications industry. It is the only \ninformation service which is competitively available in every community \nacross the nation. This highly competitive $10 billion industry is not \ndominated by large companies. Instead, it is dominated by approximately \n13,000 small businesses employing, on average, less than ten workers. \nVigorous competition among alarm industry companies benefits consumers \nby providing high quality service at lower prices.\n\n  Lastly, I am pleased that the Senate unanimously adopted two \namendments I wrote to crack down on phone scams where enterprising \nswindlers have used the telephone to scam unsuspecting customers out of \ntheir hard earned money.\n  Today, it is all too easy for telemarketing rip-off artists to profit \nfrom the current system. The operators of many of these promotions set \nup telephone boiler rooms for a few months, stealing thousands of \ndollars from innocent victims. These scam artists often prey on our \nsenior citizens. Then they simply disappear. They take the money and \nrun--moving on to another location to start all over again.\n  My provision will protect consumers by providing law enforcement the \nauthority to more quickly obtain the name, address, and physical \nlocation of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. It makes it \neasier for officers to identify and locate these operations and close \nthem down. This change was requested by the U.S. Postal Inspection \nService--our chief mail and wire fraud enforcement agency. They do a \nvery good job and this provision gives them an important new tool to \nprotect the elderly and other Americans from scam artists and \nswindlers.\n  I also succeeded in adopting a provision to help stop another \noutrageous phone scam that has added hundreds, even thousands of \ndollars, to a family's phone bill. Worst of all, this ripoff exposes \nyoung people to dial-a-porn phone sex services--even when families take \nthe step of placing a block on extra cost 900-number calls from their \nhome.\n  Companies promoting phone sex, psychic readings and other \nquestionable services--often targeted at adolescents--use 800-numbers \nfor calls and then patch them through to 900-number service via access \ncodes. My amendment closes the loophole that allows these unseemly \nservices to swindle families and restores public confidence in toll \nfree 800-numbers.\n  If we pass this bill today, these provisions will become the law of \nthe land. As Microsoft giant, Bill Gates said in a recent interview \nwith Newsweek,\n\n       The revolution in communications is just beginning. It is \n     crucial that a broad set of people participate in the debate \n     about how this technology should be shaped. If that can be \n     done the highway will serve the purposes users want. Then it \n     will * * * become a reality.\n\n  This bill is a starting point, a gateway to the revolution, that \nallows all Americans to participate. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nNebraska, the author of Title V of the telecommunications conference \nreport, in a colloquy. I have a number of questions I hope you can \nanswer to help clarify the intent of title V.\n  Is a company such as Compuserve which provides access to all \nmainframes on the Internet liable for anything on those mainframes \nwhich its users view?\n  Is a company like Compuserve which maintains its own mainframe and \nwhich allows people to post material on its mainframe liable for \nprohibited material that other people post there in the absence of an \nintent that it be used for a posting of prohibited material?\n  Is the entity that maintains a mainframe, such as a university, that \nallows a person to post material on its mainframe liable for prohibited \nmaterial that other people post there in the absence of an intent that \nit be used for a posting of prohibited material?\n  When a user accesses prohibited material on a mainframe that was \nposted by a third party, does that constitute an ``initiation'' of \ntransmission for which the entity maintaining the mainframe or the \nentity providing access to the mainframe is liable?\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate the questions raised by my colleague, Senator \nLevin. These questions are important and helpful. In general, the \nlegislation is directed at the creators and senders of obscene and \nindecent information. For instance, new section 223(d)(1) holds liable \nthose persons who knowingly use an interactive computer service to send \nindecent information or to display indecent information to persons \nunder 18 years of age. You can't use a computer to give pornography to \nchildren.\n  The legislation generally does not hold liable any entity that acts \nlike a common carrier without knowledge of messages it transmits or \nhold liable an entity which provides access to another system over \nwhich the access provider has no ownership of content. Just like in \nother pornography statutes, Congress does not hold the mailman liable \nfor the mail that he/she delivers. Nothing in CDA repeals the \nprotections of the Electronic Message Privacy Act.\n  For instance, new section 223(e)(1) states that ``no person shall be \nheld to have violated subsection (a) or (d) solely for providing access \nor connection to or from a facility, system, or network not under that \nperson's control, * * * that does not include the creation of the \ncontent of the communication.'' In other words, the telephone \ncompanies, the computer services such as Compuserve, universities that \nprovide access to sites on Internet which they do not control, are not \nliable.\n\n  There are some circumstances, however, in which a computer service or \ntelephone company or university could be held liable. If, for instance, \nthe access provider is a conspirator with an entity actively involved \nin creating the proscribed information (223(e)(2)), or if the access \nprovider owns or controls a facility, system, or network engaged in \nproviding that information (223(e)(3)), the access provider could \npotentially be held liable. Access providers are responsible for what's \non their system. They are generally not responsible for what's on \nsomeone else's system.\n  Even in these cases, however, an access provider that is involved in \nproviding access to minors can take advantage of an affirmative defense \nagainst any liability if the entity takes ``good faith, reasonable, \neffective, and appropriate actions * * * to restrict or prevent access \nby minors to such communications ``(223(e)(5)). The Federal \nCommunications Commission may describe procedures which would be taken \nas evidence of good faith. One such good faith method is set forth in \nthe legislation itself--the access provider will not be liable if it \nhas restricted access to such communications by requiring use of a \nverified credit card or adult access code (223(e)(5)(B)). This \naffirmative defense is similar to the defense provided under current \nlaw for so-called ``dial-a-porn'' providers.\n  I hope that this response provides clarification to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes; it does, and I thank my friend from Nebraska for that \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, when the telecommunications reform bill was before the \nSenate in June, I supported giving the Justice Department a role to \nensure that existing monopoly powers are not used to take advantage of \nthe new markets being entered. While \n\n[[Page S715]]\nthe effort to give the Justice Department a role in this process was \nnot successful at that time, I'm pleased to see a Justice Department \nrole included in the final version of the bill. This is good news for \nAmerican consumers.\n  In addition to including a role for the Justice Department in \ndetermining when there is adequate competition in the local exchange, \nsome of the other problems I had with the earlier bill have also been \naddressed in the conference report. For example, it protects the right \nof local governments to maintain access to their rights-of-way.\n  I believe we should try to keep obscene material from being \ntransmitted on the Internet and by other electronic media. That is a \nconstitutional standard that is well known. But the words used in title \nV of the bill dealing with this matter include ``filthy'' and \n``indecent,'' broad and vague enough so they are unlikely to meet the \nconstitutional test. These words do, however, exist in current law \ncovering telephone calls. That's why it's useful to have an expedited \nreview to test the constitutionality of this provision which the bill \nprovides for.\n  I don't think the intent of Title V is to hold Internet service \nproviders liable for content they did not create or initiate. The \nprevious colloquy with my colleague from Nebraska who is the sponsor of \nthis provision developed this in greater detail.\n  While there are some problems with the bill, on the whole, it strikes \na better balance between making needed regulatory changes to encourage \ntechnological innovations while maintaining adequate protections of the \npublic interest than earlier versions of the bill. I will therefore \nvote for the conference report before the Senate today.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation \nAct. This legislation will promote significant new investment in and \nimprovement of our Nation's telecommunications infrastructure. It will \nheighten opportunities to export American goods overseas. It will \nincrease competition in many industries--the telephone industry, cable \ntelevision, utilities, long-distance telephone service providers, \ntelecommunications equipment manufacturers, and the alarm industry, to \nname several--leading to greater economic efficiency. Above all, the \ntelecommunications bill marks a victory for consumers, who will enjoy \nlower prices and better services.\n  Mr. President, I voted against the bill when the Senate first \nconsidered it last June because I was concerned about a provision which \npurported to prohibit computer transmission of obscene or indecent \nmaterial, particularly to minors. Such activity is, of course, \nreprehensible. But I voted against that amendment, No. 1362, which the \nSenate adopted, because I feared that we were taking action \nimprovidently and without adequate consideration for its constitutional \nand practical implications.\n  I remain concerned that the conference report's provisions dealing \nwith computer transmission of obscene or indecent material and language \nmay be overly broad, but this is a matter for the courts to decide and \nthe conferees have paved the way for expedited judicial review of the \nmeasure's constitutionality. Therefore, if this language is determined \nto be troublesome when put into practice, the courts will be able to \ncorrect it at the earliest possible moment.\n  Notwithstanding my concern about this particular matter, the bill on \nbalance is meritorious and I urge the adoption of the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I rise to associate myself with the \ncomments of the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator Pressler, and with the comments of the able majority leader, \nMr. Dole, regarding the conference report to S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed a historic day in the annals of the \nSenate. By an overwhelming vote of 91 yeas to 5 nays, the Senate passed \nlegislation which will revolutionize the telecommunications industry.\n  This landmark legislation will promote increased competition among \ntelecommunications service providers and will remove Depression-era \nrestrictions which have impaired the growth of this dynamic industry.\n  This bill will enact much needed reforms so that the \ntelecommunications industry is prepared to meet the challenges, and \nopportunities, of the 21st century. The conference report language, \nwhile not perfect, represents a marked improvement over current law.\n  Consumers and firms in my own Commonwealth of Virginia will gain \nunder this landmark legislation. Virginia is home to a rapidly \ndeveloping high-technology and telecommunications industry. Northern \nVirginia, in particular, is at the forefront of this technological \nrevolution and is poised to build on that lead under the bill.\n  Virginia's consumers will benefit from increased services and \nbenefits at a lower cost as telecommunications providers compete for \ntheir business. At the same time, this legislation is pro-family and \nwill assist parents in overseeing the type of programming that their \nchildren view.\n  In short, Mr. President, both consumers and industry will benefit \nfrom the passage of this historic bill. I would like to take this \noccasion to commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Pressler, and Chairman Bliley of the House Commerce \nCommittee, and the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, for \ntheir leadership in bringing this critical legislation to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. Most importantly, I want to thank the numerous \nVirginians who, over the past year, have provided me with their views \nand guidance on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport for the Telecommunications Act of 1995. This legislation \nestablishes real progress on important issues and I am pleased to \nprovide my support.\n  This legislation creates a new regulatory structure for the rapidly \nevolving communications technology and fills an important need. The \ncurrent regulatory scheme divides industries, like local telephone \nservice and long-distance service, broadcast television, and cable \ntelevision.\n  A new regulatory framework is needed, to permit the creation of new \ncompanies, new services, and promote competition between the previously \nseparated lines of business. Stronger competition in the communications \nindustry will bring new services to the market, present more choices \nfor the public and lower prices to consumers. This bill significantly \nderegulates the communications industry to permit that competition to \ntake place.\n  During consideration of the bill, I joined many of my colleagues in \nurging several components and I was pleased to see that a number of \nthese important proposals were able to be incorporated in this \nlegislation. Among the issues included were:\n  The V-Chip requirement, which will assist families to monitor \ntelevision in their homes to protect children from unsuitable and \ninappropriate TV programming, including sex or violence. During the \nstate of the union speech, President Clinton called for passage of the \ntelecommunications legislation with the V-chip and a content ratings \nsystem for television programming. I am pleased Congress could address \nthe concerns of families across America and incorporate these \nprovisions.\n  The cable scrambling amendment I offered with Senator Lott requiring \ncable companies to scramble indecent or sexually explicit materials to \nassist parents to protect minors.\n  Senator Exon's provisions to control access to indecent materials \nwill require the operators of computer networks, like America Online, \nto screen out indecent materials for children. Conferees had a \ndifficult time reconciling different proposals and I am pleased the \nprovisions could be accommodated.\n  Assisting high-technology industry from inappropriate standards and \nrequirements: During consideration of the bill, some of California's \nleading high-technology firms and computer companies raised a concern \nthat regulations prepared by the FCC would deny flexibility and limit \nthe computer industries' ability to develop standards based on market \nneeds. Computer companies including Apple, Motorola, and Echelon, urge \nadoption of a provision prohibiting the FCC from developing overbroad \nregulations that could impede progress in the computer industry. I was \npleased these provisions to \n\n[[Page S716]]\nallow the computer industry to develop and meet the needs of the market \nwere incorporated.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle don't want to stand \nin the way of technological innovation or consumer choice. When the \nSenate initially considered the legislation last May, Chairman Pressler \nobserved that the computer industry has transformed America and that \ncomputer industry competition has brought huge benefits to our homes, \nschools and workplaces. These provisions preserve that competition, and \nkeeps the government away from premature standards setting.\n  Adoption of a stronger role for the Justice Department to review \ncompetition in the telecommunications industry: In the years since the \nbreak-up of AT, the Justice Department has developed the expertise to \npromote competition in the communications industry and protect \nconsumers. It would be a shame to squander that expertise just as new \nconcerns for competition and fairness arise under this bill. With the \npassage of this legislation, we will enter a new era of \ntelecommunications policy and the experience of the Justice Department \nwill be critical in protecting strong competition and consumer \ninterests.\n  Important steps to promote universal service: In the 1930's, the \nnation's universal service goals involved providing telephone service \nto everyone, but as communications have evolved, the concept of \nuniversal service also must develop and evolve as well. The bill \nrecognizes the need to modernize the concept of universal service and \nwill provide for telephone service discounts for schools, libraries and \nhospitals to protect against our station splitting into the high-\ntechnology haves and have-nots.\n  When this legislation came before the Senate last spring, I joined \nwith our colleague Senator Kempthorne raising concerns about the impact \non our Nation's cities and counties. As a former mayor, I know how \nimportant it is to protect the cities' bridges, roads and other public \nrights-of-way. I know the local government officials remain concerned \nabout the bill and the preemption provisions.\n  While legislative adjustments addressed some of the concerns of State \nand local governments, cities, counties and States remain concerned \nabout the future and the possibility they could be brought to \nWashington before the Federal Communications Commission to defend local \nlaws, regulations or fee.\n  The revised language clarifies that cities can impose fees on \ncommunications providers like cable companies, as long as the fees are \nimposed in a way that does not discriminate between different \ncompetitors and the fees are fair and reasonable. Further, the \npreemption authority only applies to communications issues and if the \ncities have other authority to regulate communications provider, they \nmay continue to charge fees.\n  I am pleased that section 253(c) recognizes the historic authority of \nState and local governments to regulate and require compensation for \nthe use of public rights-of-way. It further recognizes that State and \nlocal governments may apply different management and compensation \nrequirements to different telecommunications providers' to the extent \nthat they make different use of the public rights-of-way. Section 253 \n(c) also makes clear that section 253 (a) is inapplicable to right-of-\nway management and compensation requirements so long as those entities \nthat make similar demands on the public rights-of-way are treated in a \ncompetitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner.\n  As for the issue of FCC preemption, while I favored the complete \nelimination of the preemption provision, I am pleased that the \ncommittee could accept the view that authorizes the Commission to \npreempt the enforcement only of State or local requirements that \nviolate subsection (a) or (b), but not (c). The courts, not the \nCommission, will address disputes under section 253(c).\n  The overwhelming vote in the House on the amendment offered by \nRepresentative Barton and Representative Stupak, as well as the \nunanimous acceptance of Senator Gorton's amendment in the Senate, \nindicate that the Congress wishes to protect the legitimate authority \nof local governments to manage and receive compensation for use of the \nrights-of-way.\n  I am concerned that mayors, county commissioners, and State utility \ncommissioners, including California Public Utility Commissioner, are \nconcerned that State telephone regulations will be preeempted. This is \nan important issue in California where 31 companies have applied to \nbegin offering services in July. Under the bill, California's efforts \nto license more competitors to offer local phone service could be \npreempted and slowed down if the Federal Government acts or declines to \nact. Under the bill, the State will be preempted and prohibited from \nacting contrary to the Federal decision.\n  I am troubled by the significant uncertainty which remains regarding \nthe role of cities, counties, and States who may face added burdens. \nEarlier, the unfunded mandates legislation was signed into law, yet the \nCongressional Budget Office acknowledges that the legislation includes \nunfunded mandates for State and local governments. Further, CBO \nrecognizes it lacks the ability to evaluate the potential cost. I will \ncontinue to monitor this issue and, if necessary, Congress may need to \nreturn to evaluate the balance between our State and local governments \nand the Federal Government on telecommunications policy.\n  Mr. President, the legislation raises important issues and represents \nimportant progress for the Nation. As a result of the bill, we can move \nforward with new technology, new products, and new services. The bill \nwill open up exciting new challenges and opportunities and we should \nembrace them. I look forward to these exciting new challenges. While I \nremain concerned about mandates and the role of cities, States, and \ncounties in our telecommunication policy, I am pleased by the exciting \nopportunities presented by the legislation. I am pleased to lend my \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nCarolina has 14 minutes. The Senator from South Dakota has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me, as we acknowledge the \ncontributions of so many--specifically on Senator Stevens' staff, I \nmeant to mention our friend Earl Comstock. I worked with him throughout \nthe years on our Commerce Committee, and he was really diligent, along \nwith Senator Lott's staff, in the early days, Chip Pickering and now \nKevin Pritchett, and, of course, Senator Lott himself over there, along \nwith Senator Stevens.\n  On our side, you would have to comment on the contribution of Senator \nFord, who has been down there helping us orchestrate everything. He was \nbeen there since the early times helping us, along with Senator Exon \nand his contribution on cyberporn and its control; Senator Rockefeller, \nalong with Senator Snowe in the Snowe-Rockefeller particular amendment \nrelative to the discounted rates of the schools, the libraries, the \nhospitals.\n  Senator Breaux of Louisiana has been very, very active on this \nmeasure. I certainly want to thank him.\n  The reason we do this, Mr. President, to go right to the point while \nwe have a minute, is so the public can understand the involvement.\n  We had involved in this particular measure and in the conference \nreport, which has just been adopted, incidentally, over on the House \nside by a vote of 414 to 16. I do not know what happened to 16 people, \nhow they got misled. I do not see why we did not get a unanimous vote, \nbut, in any event, it shows the wonderful work done by Chairman Bliley, \nCongressman Markey, and the others over on the House side.\n  Look at the entities involved: The regional Bell operating companies. \nThey have a tremendous interest and influence, and the long-distance \ncompanies. I think that was the real contest. I mentioned earlier that \non every Friday, we got together the RBOC's, the regional companies, \nand every Monday the staff would work. It was all on top of the table. \nThere was no downtown lawyering and that kind of thing. It was all on \ntop of the table with the long-distance companies. Necessarily, the \nlong-distance companies had been thrown into competition at the time of \nthe divestiture back some 10 years ago. And Bob Allen, chairman of AT \nsaid, ``Look, I have a third less personnel. I am doing a third more \nwork and \n\n[[Page S717]]\nmaking an increased profit.'' So as they downsized, as they call it, \nand became competitive, the best proof that competition has worked is \nwith MCI and Sprint and AT and the rest of them that come in under \nthat particular description.\n  But the long-distance companies have been so aggressive that they \nwere beginning to move into the local exchange. I know of one \nparticular concern this Senator had in the southern region where our \nfriends at MCI said they were going to move into Atlanta with our \nfriends of Bell South. Bell South is, yes, a monopoly, but it was a \ncontrol monopoly whereby they could not get into long distance.\n  It was to our interest and the public interest, of course, that they \nnot be cherry picked. In other words, take off the wonderful market of \nAtlanta and just leave the rest of the State wanting. That had occurred \nin downtown New York City with Teleport. So we wanted them to come in \non an even-steven, balanced basis. Trying to work that out was really \nthe task to bring them on board where they all approved of this \nparticular bill and supported this particular bill. Not that they are \n100 percent in agreement with every feature, obviously, but they \nrealize this is a mammoth step forward in trying to bring the \ncommunications law of America into the modern technological age.\n  So we had the guidance of the 8(c) test from our friend Judge Greene \nwhere he ruled that there be no substantial possibility of using \nmonopoly power to impede competition. Every word meant something to \nevery communications lawyer. So we had to really get a checklist of \n``unbundling'' and ``dialing parity'' and ``access,'' and all these \nthings to be agreed upon.\n  It took actually weeks on every one of those particular measures all \nlast year where we worked around the clock to get it balanced and not \noverweighted one way and not let long distance come in and market \nwithout the ability, let us say, of our Bell companies to joint market \nalso.\n  So we were educated about that and came around to a balance in this \nparticular measure and now have the support of, and can you imagine of \nall of these entities supporting this particular measure: The regional \nBell operating companies, the long-distance companies, the \nbroadcasters, the cable TV companies, the cellular, satellite \ncompanies, the newspapers, burglar alarm, electronic publishing, public \nutilities, pay phones, minority groups, computers were vitally \ninterested in the outcome of this particular measure, the schools, \nlibraries, the hospitals. Snowe-Rockefeller, the Secretary of \nEducation, Dick Reilly, and the administration were strong in this \ninformation superhighway of our distinguished Vice President.\n\n  The Department of Justice worked diligently to make sure it was not \njust a casual thing to send a letter or opinion over to the Federal \nCommunications Commission and just be thrown in the wastebasket; that \nit should be given substantial weight to their opinion to make sure \nthat no monopolistic tendencies and actual entities develop in opening \nup the markets for competition. The State public service commissions \nhad to be coached and brought along. The cities, the retailers of \nequipment, the privacy groups, the local competition or competitors \nlike Teleport, the manufacturers, the rural telephone companies, the \nindependent program producers. I can go on and on. But we now have the \nsupport of every one of these groups.\n  I think we have it because we feel very strongly that the public \ninterest has been protected in the long-distance section, in the \nbroadcast section and carried over from the 1934 Telecommunications \nAct. The antitrust laws have been protected, as I pointed out.\n  One of the big disputes that we had was the takeover of 50 percent of \nthe broadcast market in the United States. Mr. President, I could be \nPresident if I had that. I would call up Madison Avenue and say, \n``You're not going to advertise your Miller High Life unless,'' and \nthen I would complete my thought. You can control 50 percent of the \ntelevision advertising in this country, and we also already saw a \ntendency by cable news--CNN did not want to carry certain parts of \nadvertisements because it was against their interest. We tried to \nprotect against that.\n  But if you had 50 percent, you might as well forget it, because the \nmoney is there, they buy it out, they control it. You could become the \nPresident, as we can see right now on the buying of the Presidency up \nin the distinguished State of New Hampshire where the distinguished \nPresiding Officer lives. I as a candidate, if I take the public moneys, \nam limited to $600,000. But if I have millions, I have spent millions, \ngo to Channel 5 in Boston and cover Highway 128 going up to Nashua \nwhere half of the population of that great State resides.\n  It is not so much the flat tax as it is the sweep of the television \ncontrol and the purchase. We will get to that later on with campaign \nfinancing, because I have a one-line constitutional amendment: The \nCongress of the United States is hereby empowered to control \nexpenditures in Federal elections.\n\n  We have had bipartisan support, a majority vote. All we lack is two-\nthirds for that particular amendment. I go back to the day when our \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Russell Long, was elocuting in 1974 \nabout the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act and said every \nmother's son was going to be able to run for President. Nobody was \ngoing to be able to buy it. Now they are buying it. But let me go back \nto communications.\n  We are about to vote. We protected the 50 percent. We never would \nyield on that. That would be embarrassing for anybody to stand on the \nfloor and ask for it. To tell you, the only reason I agreed to 35 \npercent is CBS. Westinghouse already has 32 percent, and we did not \nwant to have to go backwards. Twenty-five percent is enough.\n  We protected the rural areas. The distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Pressler, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and Senator \nBurns of Montana and all, they protected those rural areas. Any \ncompetitor that comes in must serve the entire rural area. They cannot \njust come in and take a part. The public service commissions or \nauthorities will determine how competition will occur in those rural \nareas. The infrastructure sharing is provided for from the regional \nBell operating companies to help them sustain. We learned a lot with \nthat blooming airline deregulation.\n  I see I have a colleague who wants a few minutes. I want to yield to \nmake sure he can comment.\n  The RBOC's, the checklist, and the long distance I have touched on. \nUniversal service: Every carrier, Mr. President, coming into the local \nmarket shall contribute.\n  We have the Rockefeller provision and Senator Exon's cyberporn \nprovision, which he is momentarily ready to address.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield that to my colleague from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from South Carolina. My heartiest \ncongratulations to Senator Pressler, the chairman of the committee, and \nmy friend and colleague from South Carolina, the ranking member, for a \njob well done under some extreme circumstances. I congratulate you. I \nunderstand that the House has just agreed to the conference report by \nan overwhelming majority. I think the same thing will happen here.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to voice my enthusiastic support for this \nmost significant piece of telecommunications legislation since the \nenactment of the Communications Act of 1934.\n  As a Conference Committee member and author and backer of key \nprovisions of the bill I believe that this legislation is good for \nAmerican families, children and citizens in rural America.\n  Too often progress and discussions of this legislation has been \nsegregated to the business pages of many of America's newspapers. Too \nmuch attention has been paid to how this bill affects large \ncorporations. This legislation is not only about large corporations. It \nis legislation which will touch every person's life. It will open \nunprecedented economic, educational and information opportunities for \nall Americans.\n  Few pieces of legislation considered by this or any other Congress \nhave so embraced the concerns and needs of America's children and \nfamilies as has this legislation. I am very proud of the fact that this \nlegislation includes the \n\n[[Page S718]]\nCommunications Decency Act which I introduced earlier this Congress and \nin the last Congress to protect children from indecent, pornographic \ncommunications on the Internet and other computer services and to \nprotect all Americans from computer obscenity and electronic stalking. \nWith the passage of this bill, the Congress will help make the \nInformation Superhighway safer for kids and families to travel. The \ncurrent lawlessness on the Internet has opened a virtual Triple-X \n(XXX)-rated bookstore in the bedrooms of every child with a computer. \nThis law alone will not clean up the Internet. Parental supervision, \nindustry cooperation along with strict law enforcement, need to work \ntogether to make this exciting new technology the family friendly \nresource that it should be.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference report also included \nlegislation Senator Grassley and I put forward to crack down on those \nwho use various means of communications to lure children into illegal \nsexual activity.\n  Concurrent with our efforts to make the Internet and other computer \nservices safe for families and children, this bill includes legislation \nwhich will help turn the information revolution to the benefit of all \nAmericans but especially for America's children. The Snowe-Rockefeller-\nExon-Kerrey amendment which is part of this bill creates a unique \npartnership with private industry. It will ensure discount \ntelecommunications rates for schools, libraries and rural health care \nfacilities. This landmark provision will, perhaps, give children in \nHarvard and Cambridge, NE, opportunities to use telecommunications \ntechnologies to learn from libraries and scholars at Harvard and \nCambridge Universities.\n  Another area of critical importance is in enacting legislation to \nrequire new televisions to contain the so-called V-chip which will give \nfamilies an opportunity to block violent, vulgar or other objectionable \nentertainment programming from their TV set. If successfully \nimplemented, this legislation will lead to the objective rating of \nprograms and give to parents the power to bar from their homes those \nprograms which assault their values. I was proud to co-sponsor the \nSenate V-chip amendment.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also represents a major victory for \nrural America. The conference report gives approval to the so-called \nfarm-team provisions. These provisions assure that rural citizens enjoy \ntelephone technologies and prices which are comparable to those in \nurban areas. The provisions also allow rural phone companies to pool \nresources with each other and with cable companies to share new \ntechnologies and to give states the power to prevent unfair cherry-\npicking competition in rural markets. Under the farm-team provisions \nStates can require new telephone competitors to offer service to an \nentire community rather than just a select few highly profitable rural \nphone users. The provisions also give the Federal and State regulators \nflexibility in dealing with small and mid-sized phone companies. Too \noften, one-size-fits-all regulation needlessly pushes up costs for \nNebraska's home town phone companies.\n  The farm team, by the way, is a group of rural Senators which pushed \na package of rural-oriented reforms during last year's consideration of \ntelecommunications legislation. As a charter member of the farm team \nalong with Senators Bob Kerrey, Jay Rockefeller, Byron Dorgan, Ted \nStevens, and the current chairman of the Commerce Committee Senator \nLarry Pressler, it is very gratifying that our ideas on universal \nservice, rural markets, regulatory flexibility and preferential rates \nfor schools, libraries and rural health care facilities are now central \nprinciples of America's future telecommunications policies.\n  In a real sense this legislation is less about big corporation and \nmore about changing the way Americans live, work and learn. No one will \nbe untouched by this legislation. New options may confuse and frustrate \nsome consumers at first, but will bring new services, new choices and \nmore affordable prices to all Americans.\n  The barriers to investment and innovation have been removed while \nprotecting the essential elements of a free market. The \ntelecommunications reform bill does not disrupt the Nation's antitrust \nlaws and does not change the Justice Department's role in policing \nunfair competition and predatory pricing.\n  Mr. President, most importantly this legislation illustrates that a \nCongress can make revolutionary change when it puts party labels aside \nand works together not as Democrats and Republicans but as Americans. I \ncongratulate Senators Hollings and Pressler and all the members of both \nparties and both Houses who brought this complex piece of legislation \ntogether.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to congratulate Senator Exon and the other \nmembers of the conference on bringing this very important conference \nreport to the floor today. However, I would like to bring their \nattention to one section that is very troubling to me.\n  Section 507 amends a preexisting section of the Criminal Code, 18 \nU.S.C. 1462, and applies to the Internet. Now, it is my understanding \nthat your intent behind adopting this provision was to place reasonable \nrestrictions on obscenity on the Internet. I support this goal. \nHowever, a section of this act may be construed to curb discussions \nabout abortion. It seems to me this provision would certainly be \nunconstitutional.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate the Senator's raising the issue of this \nprovision. I certainly agree with her that any discussion about \nabortion is protected by the first amendment guarantee of free speech. \nI certainly agree that nothing in this title should be interpreted to \ninhibit free speech about the topic of abortion.\n  Further, she is quite right that our interest in adopting this \nprovision was to curb the spread of obscenity--speech that is not \nprotected by the first amendment--from the Internet in order to protect \nour children.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, with that assurance, I feel comfortable \nsupporting this bill. And I hope that my colleagues who were also \nconcerned about this provision will now feel comfortable supporting \nthis bill. Once again, I thank the Senator for clarifying this point, \nand for his hard work on this bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, those who have fought all efforts to bring \nsome level of decency to the Internet have employed all sorts of \nrhetorical devices to defeat the Communications Decency Act.\n  The latest attack comes from those who suggest that amendments \noriginally in the House bill to title 18 section 1462 somehow revive \nobsolete provisions of the Comstock Act--(related in information on \nabortion)--which courts have essentially determined to be \nunconstitutional. The amendments to title 18 merely clarify that the \ncurrent laws which prohibit the importation, transportation, or \ndistribution of obscene materials apply to computers.\n  The conference committee went to great lengths in section 507(c) to \nunderline that the changes to the Criminal Code are clarifying and do \nnot change the substantive coverage of the current law. The Congress \nlast amended section 1463 in 1994 by increasing penalties for \nviolations of this section. Nothing in this legislation prohibits \nconstitutionally protected speech and this legislation does not revive \nother-wise dead provisions of that law any more than the 1994 amendment \nrevived those very provisions.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank again those who put this act together. \nI am pleased that it is about to pass the \nU. S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are on the verge of passing the most \nimportant piece of legislation in this Congress. By unleashing \ncompetition in the communications industry, America will have more \njobs, a stronger economy, and more opportunity. It is a real economic \nstimulus package with one big difference: It relies on private-sector \nAmerica, and not big government.\n  Mr. President, this bill has been in the works for over a decade. It \nhas stumped Congress after Congress. I know that because I introduced \nthe first deregulation bill after the breakup of the old ``Ma Bell'' \nsystem back in 1986, 10 years ago.\n  There is no doubt about it. This conference report was crafted in a \nbipartisan, I think nonpartisan, manner. It could not have been \naccomplished \n\n[[Page S719]]\nwithout the hard work of Chairman Pressler and his staff. Senator \nHollings has played a key role for years on this important issue.\n  I want to say an additional word about Senator Pressler. I know the \ncommittee chairman sometimes gets a little anxious and comes to the \nleader quite often about, ``When are you going to take up my bill?'' \nAnd I can report that I did not get by one day without Senator Pressler \nasking me that at least two or three times.\n  So I want to congratulate Senator Pressler for his dogged \ndetermination. I am very proud of the work he has done and the work of \nthe other Members in the conference. We have some differences. We think \nthere are still some things that should be addressed.\n  I am satisfied with the letter which I have received from the FCC \nwith reference to spectrum. I do not have any desire to put a roadblock \nin the way of the spectrum option. But I wish to make certain the \ntaxpayers get their money's worth. If it is not worth anything, that is \nfine. Let us have public hearings. Let us get it all out in the open. \nLet us make a decision, and then let us make that determination.\n\n  I am proud of the fact that this bill willl pass in a Republican \nCongress. It is no small feat. It was only 3 years ago Congress \nreregulated the cable TV industry. That is not to say that cable TV did \nnot have its problems, because it certainly did. The difference is \nRepublicans believe competition and not Government is the best \nregulator of the marketplace. Competition also means more choices for \nthe American people. And choice provides the highest level of consumer \nprotection.\n  It has been a tough bill to put together and some issues were \nresolved and some were not resolved. Important issues like the foreign \nownership provision that were dropped, they would have helped American \ncorporations pry open foreign markets that have been closed for too \nlong. Or maybe it was the relaxation of the broadcast ownership rule \nwhich would have given the little guy access to capital and thereby be \na stronger competitor. There could have also been language included \nthat would have forbidden the FCC from regulating the Internet. At the \nsame time, we did take steps to help parents protect their children \nfrom indecent material that is prevalent on this new service.\n  I do not mean to take anything away from the bill and how it will \npropel our country into the next century. Instead, I wish to point out \nthere is still much to be done. I think everybody has agreed to that.\n  I have also been openly critical of the provision in the \ntelecommunications bill that would junk all television sets in the \ncountry and create a giant welfare program for television broadcasters. \nI have worked closely with Chairman Pressler, who has also been \ncritical of this issue for some time, Senator McCain, the Speaker, and \nmany others.\n  So we have the letter. I am satisfied with it. They said, in any \nevent, they would not be prepared until 1997, and it seems to me we are \nnot going to retard progress in any way. We are just going to find out \nwhat the facts are. If it is worth $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 \nbillion, $70 billion, or zero, the public will know after public \nhearings. We think the American taxpayers are entitled to at least that \nassurance. When we are talking about reducing the rate of growth of \ncertain programs--Medicaid, Medicare, welfare--we ought to make certain \nwe are not going at the bottom and giving somebody at the top a \nwindfall. And again maybe someday, if we live long enough, this may be \ncovered by the networks, the spectrum. I doubt it. They will be \ncovering Members of Congress who might be going overseas on important \nbusiness. But it could be that they might cover this, how much it is \nworth to them and how much it is worth to broadcasting generally.\n  I think it should happen. There should not be a double standard is \nwhat they keep telling us. I agree with them. So I expect we would have \nobjective reporting on this particular issue.\n  Today we secured a letter signed by all five Commissioners at the \nFederal Communications Commission. These Commissioners stood with me, \ndespite intense lobbying to do otherwise. That is courage and we owe \nthem our thanks.\n  In that letter, these Commissioners committed to Congress,\n\n       Any award of initial licenses or construction permits for \n     advanced television services will only be made in compliance \n     with the express intent of Congress and only pursuant to \n     additional legislation it may resolving this issue.\n\n  I am determined to turn the FCC's commitment to us into a victory for \nthe American taxpayer. But Congress will conduct hearings in the full \nlight of day on this issue. We will follow through and address this \nissue. For those who think this is an idle threat, guess again. Because \nwe will give this our utmost scrutiny.\n  Now, those may sound like tough words, but, Mr. President, taxpayers \ndeserve nothing less.\n  In closing, let me also assure those skeptics that these letters are \nnot--I repeat, are not--about saving face. It is about saving the \nAmerican taxpayer billions of dollars and stopping a give-away, a giant \ncorporate welfare program.\n  Mr. President, despite this profound flaw, which we will fix, this \nlegislation will create jobs and benefits that we yet cannot imagine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the FCC letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Federal Communications Commission,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: Thank you very much for your letter \n     this morning about the concerns expressed by Senate Majority \n     Leader Dole and others regarding the distribution of \n     additional spectrum to television broadcasters. We share the \n     determination of you, Senator Dole and others to protect \n     American taxpayers. As you know, under current law and \n     pursuant to the language of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 (should it become law), the Commission lacks authority \n     to auction, or charge broadcasters for the use of, the \n     spectrum that has been identified for the provision of these \n     broadcast services. In addition, given the many \n     administrative steps necessary to implement any assignment of \n     digital broadcast licenses, we would not be in a position to \n     issue those licenses any earlier than 1997.\n       We recognize the serious policy questions involved, and \n     that you intend to hold hearings and enact legislation \n     dealing with this issue as part of an overhaul of policies \n     governing the electromagnetic spectrum. Any award of initial \n     licenses or construction permits for Advanced Television \n     Services will only be made in compliance with the express \n     intent of Congress and only pursuant to additional \n     legislation it may adopt resolving this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Reed E. Hundt,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     James H. Quello,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n     Andrew C. Barrett,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n     Susan Ness,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n     Rachelle B. Chong,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Holling's time has expired, and the \nSenator from South Dakota has 5 minutes 58 seconds.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nWashington. I thank him very much for his work on this bill. It would \nnot have happened without him.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in dealing with highly complex and \ntechnical legislation, two requirements seem to me to be essential. The \nfirst is that those who have an interest in the legislation and have \nconflicts among themselves over what is most desirable, express their \nviews so that Members can evaluate conflicting arguments and attempt to \nreach the truth.\n  Each of these interest groups gives lip service to the consumer \ninterest and to competition, but it is only by testing the groups' \ncompeting ideas against one another that the consumer interest and \ncompetition can truly be served. That has clearly been the case in \nconnection with the many year debate over telecommunications \nlegislation. There were myriad interest groups. They had highly \nconflicting interests. I believe that we have reached good \naccommodations in connection with almost every one of those conflicts.\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n  But the second and even more important requirement for dealing with \nlegislation of this type is that the Members who deal with the issue in \nthe committees, and particularly those who are in charge, keep the \npublic interest as their objective. In this connection, I want to say \nhow much that has been the case with the junior Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings] during his leadership in this process. Most \nparticularly, however, I offer my appreciation to Senator Pressler, who \nwas willing to listen to everybody, but be the prisoner of no one, in \narriving at the right answers in connection with this bill. He did so \nin the Senate proceedings, and he did so as chairman of the conference \ncommittee. The fact that we are here today passing, nearly unanimously, \nthis important piece of legislation is a real tribute to him.\n  Personally, Mr. President, I should like to note two aspects of this \ncomprehensive legislation. I have a great interest in the competitive \nnature of the wireless industry, and I am gratified that most of my \nsuggestions in that connection, to strengthen the industry's \ncompetitive position, have been accepted. I am also delighted that we \nwere able to protect our American children and the power of our \nAmerican parents through the V-chip provisions and through other \nprovisions, which will give more authority to family members to \nsupervise what their children see.\n  Other details, obviously, cannot be gone into at the present time. \nThis is a fine piece of legislation. As a result of the great work of \nour leaders, it will create employment for many tens of thousands of \nAmericans, and ensure that telecommunications will be a cutting-edge \nindustry in this country for many years to come.\n  I would like to clarify, and express my understanding, of a somewhat \nconfusing provision in the bill regarding uniform pricing of cable \nrates. The conference report changes the uniform rate requirement in \ntwo essential ways. First, section 301(b)(2) of the legislation sunsets \nthe uniform rate structure requirement in markets where the cable \noperator faces effective competition.\n  The second change to the uniform rate requirement is the addition of \nlanguage that permits cable operators to offer bulk discounts to \nmultiple dwelling units or MDU's. The language in this section permits \ncable operators to offer bulk discounts to MDU's, ``except that a cable \noperator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition \nmay not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit.''\n  I understand that there has been concern that this somewhat awkwardly \nworded section implicitly condones predatory pricing once there is \ncompetition in a market, or for subscribers who do not live in MDU's. \nClearly it is not the intent of Congress to supersede the Sherman Act \nby allowing cable operators to engage in predatory pricing at any time \nor under any circumstances. In fact, the legislation includes a general \nantitrust savings clause in section 601(b). This clause guarantees that \nantitrust concerns still will be addressed in the telecommunications \nindustry.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I join in that praise of Senator Daschle and also \nSenator Dole.\n  Mr. President, in closing this debate, let me say that we are passing \na historic telecommunications bill that will have a sweeping impact. It \nis prospective, deregulatory, and it will affect every single American. \nIt will have a great international impact. I know that our citizens \nwill benefit greatly. There will be new devices and new technologies, \nand there will be lower prices. We are entering an era that is going to \nbe like the Oklahoma land rush. There will be an explosion of new \ntelecommunications opportunities for our citizens.\n  I thank all the Senators. I have had the privilege of visiting with \nall 100 Senators about this legislation. I also pay tribute to \nCongressman Bliley, Congressman Fields, Congressman Markey, Congressman \nDingell, and others, whom I have had a chance, as chairman of the joint \nHouse-Senate conference, to become acquainted with. I have come to \nappreciate the work of a House-Senate conference. I want to pay tribute \nto our House colleagues who worked so hard on this legislation.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that, consistent \nwith the law and the rules of the Senate Rules Committee, the maximum \namount of copies of the Senate version of this conference report be \nprinted and, if possible, that 50 copies be delivered to each Senator's \noffice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to thank everyone. I yield the \nremaining time to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport accompanying S. 652. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nconference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    conference report on s. 652, the telecommunications reform bill\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I congratulate the managers of this bill \nand the leadership of the House and Senate on bringing to the floor \nthis complex, overdue effort to bring our Nation's telecommunications \nlaws into the 21st century. Although this legislation does not receive \nthe attention in the media as do issues such as the Federal budget and \ntax cuts, its importance to our economy, to the livelihoods of all \nAmericans, and to continued technological progress cannot be \noverstated. In fact, it has been said that the telecommunications \nreform bill is the most important piece of legislation we will pass in \nthis Congress.\n  This bill recognizes that market forces and competition are the fuels \nthat drive our Nation's economy. For too long, most sectors of our \ntelecommunications industry, particularly the telephone industry, have \nbeen hamstrung by outdated laws that limit access to the marketplace. \nThe great bulk of law in this area is actually some 61 years old. It \nshould be obvious to everyone that communications technology has been \nrevolutionized during these 61 years, and our laws ought to keep up \nwith these changes in technology.\n  Since the 104th Congress began consideration of telecommunications \nreform early last year, there have been \n\n[[Page S721]]\ncountless forces pulling the authors of this legislation is many \ndifferent directions. There have been industry groups, individual \ncompanies, consumer groups, unions, think tanks, the administration, \nand many, many more all with an interest in this bill who have \nrightfully voiced their concerns as this process has gone forward. I \nadmire the long hours of hard work performed by the Commerce Committee \nand its staff in sorting through the maze of this highly complex issue \nand producing this conference report. I certainly did not envy these \nindividuals as they tackled this extraordinary difficult task.\n  While, as I have said, we all respect the ability of the free market \nto produce jobs and foster economic growth, there are many in Congress \nwho are reluctant to let the marketplace operate completely freely in \nall telecommunications industries. For example, many of my colleagues \nare concerned that the regional Bell companies will take undue \nadvantage of their ownership of local telephone networks to compete \nunfairly in the long distance market. On the other hand, many other \ncolleagues are equally adamant that we should place very few \nrestrictions on Bell companies as they are permitted to offer long \ndistance service.\n  This debate over long distance represents just one of the many, many \ndifficult balancing acts the managers of this bill struggled with. In \nshort, my colleagues had to reconcile the views of those who wanted to \nlet the marketplace more or less reign free with those who sought \nregulatory protection for industries and for consumers. And let me tell \nyou, this was no easy task for the authors of this bill; I commend them \nfor their legislative ability. No one is 100 percent happy with the \nfinal product, but I am confident that the benefits we will realize in \nenacting this bill in the way of job creation and technological \nprogress are real. We can all be proud of the job done by the authors \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks made by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. Those of \nus who have worked with the distinguished chairman and ranking member \non this bill wish to acknowledge the great credit for their leadership, \nand for our distinguished majority leader and the minority leader for \ntheir backup assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S687-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CLOTURE VOTE POSTPONED ON THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of my \ncolleagues, I ask that the cloture vote be postponed.\n  Let me indicate what we believe is in progress. We have been working \nfor the last 2 or 3 hours with a number of Members on each side of the \naisle and with Chairman Lugar and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, on \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee. I am not certain if there is an \nagreement yet, but we may be close to an agreement. We think it would \nsave a considerable amount of time if we could suspend it temporarily. \nI understand the Democrats have a conference at 5:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Assuming we have an agreement to talk about, but I was \ntold that we were close to an agreement. I felt it was important that \nwe set a time, if it were possible to do that, and then immediately go \nback to the floor and continue our work.\n  Mr. DOLE. I know a number of Members have other engagements. I will \nbe in a position, maybe by 6 o'clock, to indicate whether we have an \nagreement or do not have an agreement. If we do not have an agreement, \nwe will vote on cloture. If we do have an agreement, we will try to get \na time agreement and consider all amendments--en bloc?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Hopefully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to set aside \nthe cloture vote and to come back at 6 o'clock on this issue? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I can tell Members now that there will not \nbe any votes for a while. We will try to give an a announcement at 6 \no'clock. We hope we can have a short time agreement. If there is an \nagreement overall on the agriculture bill, we would not be here too \nlate this evening. If not, we would have to come back tomorrow or \nsometime next week.\n  So I say to my colleagues that we will let you know as soon as we \nhave any information. And I appreciate your cooperation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me commend the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota, and in particular our minority ranking member, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Hollings] for the remarkable job he has done in \nbringing us to the point we achieved today. Were it not for his \ncontribution and leadership and incredible determination over the last \nseveral months, we would simply not have achieved what we achieved this \nafternoon. Senator Hollings deserves commendation on both sides of the \naisle. I publicly want to again thank him for the effort that he put \nforth, for the remarkable teamwork that he demonstrated in allowing us \nthe opportunity to at long last achieve what we have all hoped we could \nachieve.\n  So I commend Senator Hollings and others who were involved, certainly \nthe Senator from South Dakota, and I am very pleased with the result \nthis afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S721-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S721-S722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF RONALD REAGAN'S 85TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand a resolution I am about to \noffer has been cleared on each side. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 220) in recognition of Ronald \n     Reagan's 85th birthday.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 16 years ago, America was flat on her back. \nOur economy was a disaster. The only things up were inflation, interest \nrates, and unemployment--all in or near double digits. Abroad, our \nresolve was questioned by our allies and doubted by our adversaries.\n  Many so-called experts--including some in the Government--surveyed \nthe situation, wrung their hands, shook their heads, and pronounced \nthat the United States was in decline: That our best days were far \nbehind us.\n  But one man knew better. And that man was Ronald Reagan.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that power belonged with the people, not with the \nGovernment. He knew that the best solutions to our problems came not \nfrom bureaucrats on the Potomac, but from men and women on the \nMississippi, the Colorado, and the Columbia.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that economic recovery could be achieved not \nthrough regulations and redtape, but by allowing the magic of the \nmarketplace to work its wonders.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that America was right far more often than she was \nwrong.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that military strength was not the means to war, \nbut the key to peace.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that world respect came not from appeasement, but \nfrom standing by your friends, by speaking up for freedom, and by \ndrawing the line against dictators.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that America was still a shining city on a hill, \nand that our Nation's best days were truly yet to come.\n  It was this vision that Ronald Reagan presented in 1980 and 1984.\n  It was this vision that the voters approved in overwhelming margins.\n  It was this vision that brought hope and opportunity to millions.\n  It was this vision that revitalized America, and changed the world.\n  Mr. President, next Tuesday is Ronald Reagan's 85th birthday. And the \nresolution we pass today will extend to President Reagan the greetings \nand best wishes of the U.S. Senate.\n  And I know I speak for all Members of the Senate, when I say that our \nthoughts and prayers are with the President and Nancy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise tonight to wish Ronald Reagan, one \nof this country's, indeed, one of the world's, great leaders, a happy \n85th birthday. The ``Gipper'' and his family--and friends joining \nacross the \n\n[[Page S722]]\nworld--will celebrate his birthday on Saturday.\n  As a Senator in my first term, when President Reagan came to \nWashington, I found his vision, forthrightness and high principles, to \nbe measures by which all elected officials can aspire. Ronald Reagan's \nfaith in God and his tremendous belief in the common sense of the \nAmerican people, were sources of great strength and wisdom. His courage \nand willingness to stand up for what he believed in were admired by \nfriend and foe alike.\n  I am proud to say that I consider Ronald Reagan not just a friend, \nbut a teacher and mentor to me and many other Senators back in our \nearly Senate career.\n  I fondly recall our times together, especially while we were riding \nhorses over my Atoka farm. Our conversations varied from personal \nstories to serious discussions about the threat of the former Soviet \nEmpire and America's place in the world as a protector of freedom and \nDemocracy. His humor paralleled that of Will Rogers.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of the fact that next year, in my home \nState, the Newport News Shipyard will lay the keel of the Navy's newest \naircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan. I wish to join with my good \nfriend from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, for together we sponsored the \nlegislation that designated the ship with President Reagan's name. It \nis a rightful designation for his contribution to the demise of the \nSoviet Union.\n  I am also pleased that the Reagan Presidency will be honored just a \nfew blocks from the Capitol. The Federal Triangle project under \nconstruction at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, will be \ndesignated as the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade \nCenter, thanks to legislation introduced by Majority Leader Robert \nDole. I am proud to have been a co-sponsor of this legislation, which \nhas been passed by the Congress and signed into law by the President.\n  I would like to close my remarks, Mr. President, by paying tribute to \nNancy Reagan, a truly magnificent First Lady. In the White House and \nsince President Reagan left office, Nancy Reagan has been a strong \nvoice on significant public issues. Americans everywhere owe her a debt \nof gratitude for the outstanding work she has done and continues to do \nto educate the children and youth of this Nation, particularly about \nthe tragedy of drug abuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 220) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution and its preamble are as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 220\n\n       Whereas, February 6, 1996 is the 85th Birthday of Ronald \n     Wilson Reagan;\n       And Whereas, Ronald Reagan was twice elected by \n     overwhelming margins as President of the United States;\n       And Whereas, Ronald Reagan is loved and admired by millions \n     of Americans, and by countless others around the world;\n       And Whereas, Ronald Reagan, with the leadership of his \n     wife, Nancy, led a national crusade against illegal drugs;\n       And Whereas, Ronald Reagan's eloquence united Americans in \n     times of triumph and tragedy;\n       And Whereas, the thoughts and prayers of the Senate and the \n     country are with Ronald Reagan in his courageous battle with \n     Alzheimer's Disease; Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States extends its \n     birthday greetings and best wishes to Ronald Reagan.\n       Sec. 2. That the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S721-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S722-S723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE D.C. APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with some sadness that I come to \nthe floor this evening. Those of us who have been on the District of \nColumbia conference committee have now worked some 90 days in trying to \nget a conference agreement. We have had a very difficult time. We have \nat times reached an agreement and then had those agreements disappear.\n  This Congress has placed itself in a special relationship with the \nDistrict of Columbia by recognizing the incredible problems it has, \nboth with its financing as well with education. We have taken the \nresponsibility of doing what we can to make this city proud and to give \nit the wherewithal in order to improve its educational system.\n  I think we have a conference report that certainly, although it is \nnot perfect--and that is obvious from the situation we find ourselves \nin--is nevertheless one which could bring about a resolution of the \nproblems involved with the educational system. It could also, in a \nnoncontroversial manner, provide the economic wherewithal for the \nDistrict to be able to move forward.\n  This is an appropriations bill that includes nearly $5 billion in \nspending authority for the city of Washington. We were held up by \ndisagreement over a provision of $5 million for a scholarship program, \nthat represents one-tenth of 1 percent of the money involved with this \nbill. Yet, it does reach such an emotional state with respect to those \npeople who feel one way or the other about the utilization of Federal \nfunds for scholarships to allow young people to go and seek another \nschool in order to, hopefully, advance their education. However, this \ndisagreement over the scholarship program is such a matter.\n  I had hoped very much, and had expected, that we would be able to \ntake up the D.C. appropriations conference report today. The House \npassed it yesterday. They did so with a fairly good vote. But I find \nnow, after having verified with my counterpart on the other side of the \naisle, what would happen in the event that I attempted to bring up the \nconference report this evening. There would be no time agreement at \nall, there would be a filibuster, and there would not be any desire to \nmove that conference agreement, in its present state out of this body.\n  I wish that we would stop damaging the District of Columbia's efforts \nto revitalize itself. And keeping in mind that by grabbing control as \nwe have--and I do not disagree with that--over the power to do things, \nwe have taken the responsibility, and I am only thinking of the kids. I \nhave spent many, many hours of my own time in this city by going around \nfrom school to school.\n\n  I spend every Tuesday reading to a young man in the third grade whom \nI have seen change and he has become so much more able to participate \nin class in a meaningful way through knowing English. He is a student \nto whom English is a second language, I am incredibly impressed with \nhis progress. We have 200 Senate staff members who are going every \nTuesday and reading to kids. This program is going on. We are trying to \ndo the best we can. But there is a lot that cannot be done without the \nability to reorganize what is going on in the school system.\n  So I just stand before you very, very discouraged at all the effort \nthat we have put forth to try to bring about a resolution which this \nbody could consider, and hopefully adopt, to now find that that cannot \nbe considered. So I will continue to do all I can to find the answers. \nI know that they will not be easy. But I also will do everything in my \npower to assure that we can proceed as best we can under the \ncircumstances. I will work to pass the conference report at some later \ndate, but if that cannot be done, I will do my best to work within the \nstructure we have created with the Control Board and others to see what \nwe can do while we wait for this legislation to pass.\n  I know the school board in Washington, DC, met today and had some \nconcerns. Before I learned those concerns, I had initiated a call and a \nmeeting with the chairwoman of the school board for tomorrow. I will be \nmeeting with her tomorrow and we will look toward the future.\n  I am hopeful still that we will find this matter, which is of great \nnational concern, should not be used to deprive those who want to help \nthe schools to move forward. We are nearly halfway through the school \nyear now, much needs to be done, and I hope both sides of this issue \nwill calm down and let us proceed in some manner so that we can help \nthe children of this city.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, the Senate is in session at this late \nhour--we just finished the telecom bill, a very important bill for our \ncountry--but we are in session now because we do not have a farm bill.\n  I have been on the Agriculture Committee now for 22 years, 10 in the \nHouse, 12 in the Senate. I have seen a lot of farm bills. I have worked \non a lot of farm bills. Some were contentious, some sort of passed \neasily. But in every instance--in every single instance--in the House \nand in the Senate, we worked diligently on both sides of the aisle to \ntry to reach accommodations to get a farm bill through before the end \nof the year. In most cases, we got it through long before the end of \nthe year.\n  But I remember some particular ones. I remember the 1981 farm bill \nwhen I was in the House. We passed it in the early morning hours of \nDecember 17. Why do I remember that? Because my daughter was born about \n2 hours later, and I remember being on the floor trying to get the farm \nbill passed.\n  The reason I recall that, aside from the fact my daughter was born a \ncouple of hours after we finished the farm bill, was that it was late \nin the year. It was 1981, a very contentious year in agriculture \nregarding what kind of farm policy we were going to develop under the \nleadership of the new administration that had taken over that year. But \nwe got our work done, and we got the farm bill passed and down to the \nPresident before the end of the year.\n  That was with a Democratic House and a Republican Senate and a \nRepublican President. We did not filibuster, we did not hold it up. We \ndid our work, and we got it through before the end of the year.\n  The hue and cry that came from around the country was that we had \nwaited too long. A lot of the finger pointing was at the Democrats, \nbecause we allegedly had waited too long and we did not get the bill \nthrough by the end of the year. But we got it through.\n  Now here we are in February of 1996, and we still do not have a farm \nbill for this year. I do not want to engage in finger pointing, but I \ndo want to say at least that no Democrat on this side has filibustered \na farm bill. We have not held it up.\n  We passed a farm bill out of the Ag Committee in late September. We \ncould have brought it out on the floor in the month of October. We \ncould have brought it out in the month of November. We could have \nbrought it out in the month of December. But, no, it was not brought \nup. No, instead, it was taken and put in the budget reconciliation bill \nso that we did not have an opportunity to really debate it and amend it \nand fashion a farm program for the future. The President vetoed that \nbill, as he should have.\n  So here we are in February, and once again, a farm bill was laid down \nyesterday. Immediately, a cloture motion was filed to cut off debate, \nto cut off amendments, to limit the time.\n  Well, I am not here to filibuster, but I do want some time to speak \non the bill, to lay out what it would mean to farmers and rural \ncommunities in my State. I want some time to be able to offer \namendments that I think are worthwhile. I may not win them, but at \nleast I feel an obligation to my farmers in Iowa to try to craft and \nfashion a farm bill in their best interests.\n  Now I understand that at this late hour we are being told that the \nHouse is going to go out. The Senate wants to adjourn and come back at \nthe end of February, and we have to pass a farm bill tonight, or we \nwill not be able to get it done because the Senate is going to adjourn \nfor another month. What kind of nonsense is that? We are elected to \ncome here and get the people's legislation passed. I do not know of any \ncompelling reason why we cannot bring the farm bill up, debate it \ntomorrow, or Saturday if need be. We do not need to be here Saturday; \nwe can debate it Monday and Tuesday, and probably get it done by \nTuesday night. At least everybody would have ample opportunity to \nspeak, offer amendments, and have their amendments voted on. Then we \ncan have a final vote on the passage of the bill and send it to \nconference.\n  Yet, somehow a gun is being held to our heads tonight, and we are \ntold that if we do not rubberstamp some farm bill that has been crafted \nin the back rooms--and we do not even know what is in it--that we are \ngoing to be held to blame because a farm bill was not passed here on \nFebruary 1. I am telling you, Mr. President, I find this whole process \ncontrary to everything I believe in, in terms of a democratic \nGovernment, and in terms of what I believe in, in terms of the \nprocesses here of open and free debate, with amendments, and allowing \nus to state our case and to try to make the best case we can for our \nconstituents.\n  So I am sorry, I am just not going to be a part of caving in and \nrubberstamping something simply because it is late, it is in February, \nand we have to get a farm bill passed. Our farmers need to know what to \ndo. For Heaven's sake, they need to know what to do. But it was not \nthis Senator, or any Senator on this side of the aisle, that kept the \nfarm bill from coming to the floor in October, November, or December. \nThat was not our call to make. It was not brought up on the floor. It \nshould have been brought up. It should have been brought up in October. \nThen we could have finished our work and sent it to conference. It may \nnot have been what I wanted, but at least the process would have been \nfair and open and I could not complain.\n  I am complaining now because the process is not fair and it is not \nopen. I intend to make it so. I will use whatever power I have as a \nSenator to make sure we have that kind of an open process here on the \nfarm bill and not be asked to rubberstamp something when we do not even \nknow what is in it.\n  But the people that are really suffering are our farmers, along with \nothers involved in agriculture. My farmers in Iowa and throughout the \nMidwest right now have to make decisions, and they are doing it in the \nblind--what seed to buy, what to plant, how much credit do they need, \nhow much fertilizer they need. How can they make those decisions when \nthey do not even know what kind of farm program we have? They should \nhave known this and could have known this in December or earlier. We \ncould have had a farm bill passed in December. It may not have been \nwhat I would have liked, but at least the process could have been fair \nand open.\n  We owe it, I believe, to our farmers and rural communities to act in \na deliberate manner. We have a 1990 farm bill that was crafted here in \na bipartisan fashion. I was not one of those preferring to extend the \n1990 farm bill, I must admit. But at this late hour, it seems almost \ninevitable that some type of extension is probably the most realistic \nthing we can do. We can make some changes, I believe, that both sides \nof the aisle would agree with, such as more planting flexibility and \ngetting rid of base acreage restrictions. We could do that. Then \nfarmers would at least have some idea what the rules are because they \nhave already operated under the 1990 farm bill for the past 5 years. \nThey would know what to expect, what to do, and there would be some \ncertainty out there. Perhaps we would have to come back this year, or \nmaybe even next year. Maybe we should extend it 2 years because it \nlooks like this is going to be a short year with everybody out \ncampaigning. Then maybe we can come back next year and craft a longer \nterm farm bill that would take care of us for the next 5 to 7 years. \nBut this process of saying we have to do something tonight because we \nare going to adjourn in the Senate for the next month and, therefore, \nbang, we have to do something quickly tonight--we cannot debate it, \nlook at it, or examine it--what kind of nonsense is that?\n  So I hope we do not have to adjourn tonight. I see no reason why we \ncannot be in next week. Those who want to vote to adjourn had better be \nready to go back and tell their farmers, no, we thought it was more \nimportant to take time off than to debate this farm bill fully, in an \nopen and free debate, with opportunity for amendments to it. \n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, perhaps I am just venting frustration, but I \nbelieve a lot of others share those frustrations. I hope that in some \nway I am representing the frustrations of the farmers I represent, \nbecause they are frustrated. They do not know what to expect. They \nwould like to have a little certainty, too. Right now, all we are \ngiving them is uncertainty. If we adjourn for a month tonight, they \nhave another month of uncertainty. It is unfair and unconscionable that \nwe would walk out of this place tonight and adjourn without having a \nfull, fair, and open debate on amendments to a farm bill, which cannot \ntake place in 3 hours tonight. It may take tomorrow and it might take \nMonday. That is fair. I do not know how many days the 1990 farm bill \ntook. I am informed that it took 7 days. The 1985 farm bill took about \nthe same amount of time. We had the telecom bill. How many days did \nthat take? I think a couple of weeks. The farm bill is every bit as \nimportant to our farmers as the telecom bill is to the people in \ntelecommunications. I do not think the farm bill needs 7 days, but at \nleast 2 or 3 days, to debate and amend it and have final passage. I do \nnot see why we cannot do that tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday. There is \nno reason we cannot do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished \ncolleague from the neighboring State of Iowa. I want to share with the \nSenate the fact that my frustrations run very deep, as deep as so \neloquently expressed by my colleague from the State of Iowa, Senator \nHarkin.\n  Here we are, Mr. President, 10 minutes after 7:00 on the 1st day of \nFebruary, and there is rapid talk in this body about adjourning this \nevening until sometime around February 28. Now, obviously, adjourning \nhere without taking any action whatever on a farm bill is not only \nwrong, it is not only bad policy, but it is ridiculous.\n  How do we work ourselves out of the dilemma we find ourselves in \nright now? Mr. President, it would seem to me that it would be a time \nfor cooler heads to prevail. I think we have two basic options: Either \nwe stay here and work and not adjourn, as has been contemplated, and I \nsuspect that would be the best possible course of action of all the \noptions that we have; or the second option, it seems to me, would be if \nwe are going to adjourn tonight, and if we adjourn I suspect we will \nhave a rollcall vote on adjournment so that we will all know in this \nbody and elsewhere as to who wanted to adjourn when we have important \nwork that we should remain here doing. The other option of not staying \nhere, if we are bound and determined to adjourn, which I will oppose, \nbut if that happens, we are going to leave here without any resolution \nwhatever on the farm bill, would be the worse of all possible worlds. \nIf we are not going to continue to stay here and work and hammer out a \ncompromise of some kind, then I think the next best option would be for \na simple 1-year extension of the present farm bill.\n  The only significant changes that I suggest that we should make in \nthat regard is to accept and provide a simplification of the rules, \nregulations, and red tape, and truly allow the farmers of America, for \nthe most part, to farm for the 1996 year without all of the complicated \nrestraints that they have. I simply say the simplification of the rules \nand allowing the farmers more freedom is one part of the Freedom to \nFarm Act that I generally have supported.\n  I hope that all would realize and recognize that we either have the \noption of trying to work out something tonight, which I think is going \nto be extremely difficult. If we cannot do that, I think we should \nschedule to be here tomorrow and Saturday, if necessary, and again next \nweek, in an effort to try and come to some kind of a workable \ncompromise that can get the required number of votes, and/or tonight \nstand to face reality and say it is going to be very difficult to come \nto some kind of an agreement. Probably the best thing for all sides to \ndo would simply be to recognize and realize that the best thing to do \nunder the circumstances in consideration to the farmers of America, who \nare anxiously awaiting what we are going to do here with regard to a \nfarm bill, is to have a 1-year extension of the present farm bill with \nthe caveats I have just expressed.\n\n  Mr. President, it seems to me, therefore, we once again are up \nagainst time constraints--some of them real, some of them imaginary. By \nand large, I see no reason why we should be adjourning when we should \nbe here working. If adjournment is the way we are going to go, I appeal \nfor all sides to realize and recognize, in the interests of \nagriculture, while extending the present farm bill for 1 year is not \nthe way I would like to go, it may be the only way for us to go and \nprovide a measure of assurance to the food producers of America that we \ndo, indeed, care and appreciate what they are going through.\n  Here we are in February talking about a farm bill that should have \nbeen passed no later than the beginning of the new fiscal year last \nOctober 1. Here we are, Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat on the \nBudget Committee, starting to make plans for the budget discussions in \n1996, and we have not even finished the budget from last year. We are \nsadly behind what we should be doing--doing it right or wrong.\n  I think that, by and large, most of the minority, and I hope a large \nportion of the majority, in the Senate would realize it is time to fish \nor cut bait. If we cannot come to an agreement, I suggest it would make \nsense and be reasonable for all sides to agree to an extension of 1 \nyear, with the caveats I have outlined.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL TEA TASTERS REPEAL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I hope we can continue these \nnegotiations, have an agreement that we could send out to everybody so \nin the next couple of days they could take a look at it, and then have \na vote within a very limited timeframe on Tuesday. I would like to see \nif we can finish this on Tuesday and limit the votes and try to move \nthis process along.\n  So, I share the leader's desire to come to closure and his expressed \nhope that we could do it as early as next Tuesday.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I think I and a lot of other Senators are \nvery frustrated at this moment as we have tried to move this issue over \nthe last several weeks.\n  All of us agree that the agricultural community deserves to hear a \nclear message from the Congress of the United States that relates to \nfarm policy. I am terribly disappointed that this afternoon we could \nnot gain cloture, that the other side chose to kill freedom to farm. We \nalso put up an excellent alternative to that and that--we could not \nwork with that issue.\n  Obviously, farm policy in its formation has always been bipartisan. I \nwas confident this afternoon, or at least I thought I could be, that we \nhad worked for several days to build that bipartisan compromise and \nstill maintain the kind of levels of expenditure that sent a clear \nmessage to American agriculture that there would be some safety nets \nbut, at the same time, that they were going to move toward the market \nas they have told us--week after week, month after month, as we have \nheld hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee this year--that a \nreinstatement of current policy simply would not work anymore and it \nshould not work.\n  While I know none of us at this moment are working on a reinstatement \nof current policy, I am very concerned to see us edging back toward it \nat a time when agriculture has said to us that is not where we ought to \nhead.\n  So I hope we can arrive at something over the weekend and into next \nweek. It is my understanding the House may not be able to get there, as \nwe had hoped, so we could at least show the American farm community a \ntimetable that we are all going to be sensitive to. But I am \ndisappointed, and I think we all are, that this cannot be resolved in \nthe fashion we had hoped.\n  I am going to have to, as I think others on this side are, look a \ngreat deal more closely at the deals that are being put together. We, \nin my opinion--certainly from this Senator's point of view--have gone \nas far as I know is possible to go without saying to Idaho agriculture \nwe have decided not to do what we told you we were going to do and what \nmost of you had agreed to. I presented legislation yesterday that had \nthe full endorsement of the American Farm Bureau and a variety of other \norganizations, wheat growers, corn growers and others.

Mr. President, H.R. 2924 is, in effect, a temporary \nincrease in the debt ceiling.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue Treasury \nsecurities in excess of the current $4.9 trillion ceiling in order to \npay the March 1996 Social Security benefits. Coupled with the normal \nend of month redeeming of Treasury securities held by the Social \nSecurity trust funds, this bill permits the Federal Government to meet \nall of its financial obligations on March 1.\n  The bill provides much-needed time to consider a longer and perhaps \npermanent increase in the debt ceiling. Congress may not take up this \nissue again until the week of February 26, and, without this \nlegislation, action would be required almost immediately to prevent \ndefault on February 29 or March 1. That is cutting it too close. Under \nthis bill, we will have until March 15 to work out a long-term increase \nin the debt ceiling.\n  And, importantly, this legislation commits the Congress to timely \naction. Item 1 in the bill's ``FINDINGS'' states:\n\n       (1) Congress intends to pass an increase in the public debt \n     limit before March 1, 1996.\n\n  This is a welcome statement of good faith. It will shortly pass the \nHouse of Representatives. I urge the Senate to concur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S725-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S725-S726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n GUARANTEEING THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN MARCH \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

TIMELY PAYMENT OF MARCH 1996 SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   BENEFITS GUARANTEED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Congress intends to pass an increase in the public debt \n     limit before March 1, 1996.\n       (2) In the interim, social security beneficiaries should be \n     assured that social security benefits will be paid on a \n     timely basis in March 1996.\n       (b) Assurance of Social Security Benefit Payments.--In \n     addition to any other authority provided by law, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may issue obligations of the United \n     States before March 1, 1996, in an amount equal to the \n     monthly insurance benefits payable under title II of the \n     Social Security Act in March 1996.\n       (c) Obligations Exempt From Public Debt Limit.--\n       (1) In general.--Obligations issued under subsection (b) \n     shall not be taken into account in applying the limitation in \n     section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code.\n       (2) Termination of exemption--Paragraph (1) shall cease to \n     apply on the earlier of--\n       (A) the date of the enactment of the first increase in the \n     limitation in section 3101(b) of title 31, United States \n     Code, after the date of the enactment of this Act, or\n       (B) March 15, 1996.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, during the past few weeks, we have been \nadvised in writing by the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, that \nit is unlikely that the Government can continue to meet its obligations \non or about March 1, 1996. The Secretary believes that he will not have \nany difficulty meeting the Government's obligations prior to that time. \nIn view of these circumstances, some have suggested that the March \nsocial security payments--not the current checks, for February, but \nthose for March--will not be payable. In order to allay any concerns, I \nam pleased to join the majority leader along with Senator McCain, in \nintroducing this legislation to ensure Government solvency and payment \nof all Social Security benefits on a timely basis in March.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this legislation. \nTwo important findings are stated at the beginning of this legislation. \nTwo important findings are stated at the beginning of this piece of \nlegislation which help explain our position. First, Congress intends to \npass an increase in the public debt limit before March 1, 1996. Second, \nin the interim, Social Security beneficiaries should be assured that \nsocial security benefits will be paid on a timely basis in March 1996.\n  Let me be clear, it is this Senator's intention to work toward \npassage of a debt limit extension before March 1. We will not default \non our debts. That I find unthinkable. What this legislation does is \nsimply ensure that timely payment of the March Social Security benefit \npayments and allow these checks to be mailed and cashed without any \ndelay.\n  The bill provides temporary relief from the current $4.9 trillion \ndebt limit, and creates new legal borrowing authority not subject to \nthe debt limit for a short period of time. The amount of this new legal \nborrowing authority is equal to the amount of the full Social Security \nbenefit payments for March, approximately $28 billion.\n  By creating new borrowing authority, this bill also allows full \npayment of all other U.S. Government obligations due on March 1, 1996, \nincluding veterans benefits, Medicare and SSI payments, Federal \nemployee pay, and military and civil service retirement payments.\n  Mr. DOLE. What this does do is it makes certain there will be timely \npayments made. There will not be any delay of payments of Social \nSecurity.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of H.R. 2924 and S. 1555 be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Summary of H.R. 2924, Social Security Benefit Payment Guarantee\n\n       Findings: Congress intends to pass an increase in the \n     public debt limit before March 1, 1996.\n       Bill ensures the timely payment of the March Social \n     Security benefit payments and allows these checks to be \n     mailed and cashed without any delay.\n       Bill provides temporary relief from the current $4.9 \n     trillion limit, and creates new legal borrowing authority not \n     subject to the debt limit until March 15, 1996.\n       The amount of this new legal borrowing authority is equal \n     to the amount of the full Social Security benefit payments \n     for March (approximately $28 billion).\n       By creating new borrowing authority, this bill also allows \n     full payment of all other U.S. Government obligations due on \n     March 1, 1996, including veterans benefits, Medicare payments \n     and military and civil service retirement payments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S725-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S726-S728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a moment. \nFarm bills are very difficult to pass. I can recall other years when we \nhave had this same tug of war.\n  There was a time when farm bills were bipartisan. I am not certain \nthat is the case. There is some bipartisanship now. Many years ago, we \nsat down in the Ag Committee, we worked out a bill, brought it to the \nfloor, and the committee never wavered. Now most things are done on a \nparty-line basis.\n  But I want the record to reflect that the President vetoed a farm \nbill. So, for those on the other side who say ``What is going on?'' \nthey want us here next week and next week and next week, we are \nprepared to do anything we can. But if we cannot accomplish anything--\nwe had a cloture vote today. We could have been on the farm bill right \nnow. We could have had a second cloture vote. We had a bipartisan \nagreement led by Senators Lugar and Leahy. We were advised that some of \nthe Members on the other side had been peeled off and we probably could \nnot get cloture on that vote.\n  So, as we normally try to do, we sat down in a bipartisan way. Was \nthere any progress made? I do not know. But I would share the views \nexpressed by the Senator from Idaho that I think we have gone the extra \nmile in an effort to go to conference.\n  The House has not passed a bill. We would like to pass a bill in the \nSenate. But we are not going to be torpedoed by rhetoric on the other \nside. And keep in mind, we could have had a farm bill. The President \nvetoed it. That is why the farmers are concerned. That is why there is \na lot of disarray in rural America. We could have had another farm bill \ntoday, but I think only two Democrats joined in a cloture vote. So, if \nwe want to get partisan about farm legislation, that is fine. I have \nheard some very partisan statements this afternoon. But the bottom line \nis, we ought to go back where we used to be on farm legislation, sit \ndown, work it out on a bipartisan basis.\n  Do I think that will happen by Tuesday? I do not know. I will be \nhappy to try to help. But I am not very optimistic, as I see some \npartisanship setting in around here. Maybe there is some reason for it. \nBut our farmers' winter wheat is planted. Winter wheat had to be \nplanted. We could not wait. We planted our wheat. Now we are relying on \nthe 1949 act. I assume farmers may conclude maybe that act is not so \nbad when they look at what the prices might be. But that is not how we \nought to resolve it.\n\n  So we are prepared to accommodate the Democratic leader, who I think \ncertainly in good faith will present something in writing, and see what \nhappens by next Tuesday. If we cannot agree, then we will have another \ncloture vote. I do not know what will happen with that cloture vote. \nHopefully, we will have enough support at that point to get enough \nvotes to go on to the Leahy-Lugar compromise bill.\n  So I hope my colleagues on both sides will keep in mind that farmers \nreally do not care about the politics. They do not care who stands up \nand shouts the loudest about who is at fault. All they know is that \nthere is no farm bill. They \n\n[[Page S727]]\nwould like to see us sit down and work it out. There are different \nphilosophies in agriculture like most everything else, but we are \nprepared to try to accommodate some of the requests of our colleagues \non both sides, particularly on the Democratic side, in an effort to get \na bill done as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand the frustration. I am a little \nfrustrated, too. I would like to get a farm bill out. But let me make \nan observation or two.\n  I do not know, in my 21 years, that we have ever failed to renew a \nfarm bill within the year that it expired. Now we are in the year after \nthe 1990 farm bill expired. This bill should have been completed last \nSeptember.\n  We also hear that the President vetoed a farm bill. Well, that farm \nbill that the President vetoed in reconciliation was a bill that they \ncould not pass out of the Agriculture Committee in the House. So they \ntake that bill and stick it in reconciliation. That was not passed out \nof the Agriculture Committee. Now, in the Senate, we have not passed an \nagriculture bill out of the Senate Agriculture Committee that I know \nof.\n  So here we are arguing over an agriculture bill that really has never \ngone through the process. And we are October, November, December, \nJanuary, and February later. We finally bring it to the floor without \nknowing exactly what is in it and want cloture on it so we cannot \ndebate it and so we cannot amend it.\n  The Senator from Vermont, when he was chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee in 1990, set a record. He completed the agriculture bill in 7 \ndays of debate on the floor--7 days of debate on the floor. Now we want \nto bring it up 1 day, vote cloture on it, and get it out. No wonder \nsome people are digging their heels in. What might be good for Kentucky \nmay not be good for Utah. But it is a regional bill that we have to \nbring together and satisfy generally the farmers in those areas. If I \nwere farming, I would be frustrated, too. We have been begging for a \nfarm bill; begging for a farm bill. And all of a sudden we get it on \nThursday, want to complete it on Thursday, and go out for 3 weeks.\n  I say to my friends that they can blame whoever they want to, but \nthis bill is 5 months late, at least 5 months late.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will yield for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will note that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky is absolutely right. In the 1985 farm bill--I see my good \nfriend from North Dakota here, and I think he recalls the numbers--but \nthe 1985 farm bill took something like 11 or 12 weeks to complete. \nThere were a lot of sessions, as my friend from Kentucky will recall, \nuntil midnight or later. The 1990 farm bill set a record. And with the \nHouse, the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from North Dakota, and \nothers, we passed it in 7 days with the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana--in 7 days. That was an all-time record. But that was 7 days, \nas my friends will recall, of very intensive debate on some major \npolicy issues involving tens of billions of dollars.\n  Today I know is a long day. People may be tired. I know I am. I \nfinished work in Vermont about 1:30 this morning and was on a flight \nright after 6 o'clock this morning to come down here for this.\n  The distinguished majority leader speaks of partisanship. It really \nhas not been. Farm legislation, to my recollection, has always been \nbipartisan. We have worked it today. We had one vote of which everybody \nknew the outcome, the first vote today on cloture. Everybody knew. That \nwas no surprise. The Republican leader, the Democratic leader, and all \nknew what that was going to be. We had a second one set up where there \nwas a bipartisan coalition seeking it. But then we sought to make it \nbetter and to make it more bipartisan--I say to the distinguished \npresiding officers and others--by Republicans and Democrats. The \nRepublican leader, the Democratic leader, the Republican chairman of \nthe committee, the Democratic ranking member of the committee, and \nmyself sat down and worked out at least some parameters to get us \nmoving forward. I am convinced there is a bipartisan solution here.\n  This is very complex legislation. Farmers who have to deal with it \nknow it is very complex. I wish it had been done last year. I urged \nthat it be done last year. I understand the other body had difficulty \nand could not get a bill out of committee at first. We have not had one \nout of our committee for a number of reasons. It was not done last \nyear. We can easily do it this year, but it would take a little bit of \ntime to work this out.\n  There are distinguished Members on both sides of the aisle who have \nstrong views who want to have votes. I have not heard a single one say \nthey want to delay it. But at least they want to explain their \namendments and have a vote on it. I might have some of my own. We ought \nto be able to do that. None is asking to hold it up. It takes a few \ndays.\n  Somebody raised the novel idea today about working out some kind of \ncompromise and maybe we could see it in writing and read it before we \nvoted on it. I do not think that is a bad idea. That is an idea that \nmight actually catch on around here--that we read a piece of \nlegislation and then vote on it. Who knows what the results might be?\n  So I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle that this is \nsomething where Democrats and Republicans can work together. But while \nit should have been done last year, let us not make the problem worse \nby rushing it so much this year that it does not get done right.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I yield to the \nSenator from North Dakota for a question, or a statement, without my \nlosing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas indicated that the President \nhad vetoed the farm bill. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, is not it a \nmore accurate description that the President vetoed what we call \nreconciliation which contained the farm bill and which contained a lot \nmore than the farm bill? It had $270 billion of cuts to Medicare, $182 \nbillion of cuts to Medicaid, and a $245 billion tax reduction aimed \ndisproportionately to the wealthiest among us.\n  Is it not the case that that bill had lots of things in it other than \nthe farm bill?\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend, the Senator is absolutely correct. When \nyou say just pick out one little piece--and the farm bill is a major \npiece to the farmers--that was in the overall reconciliation bill that \ncontained the massive funding of Government. There were many things in \nthere that even those--it was not bipartisan. We had some on the other \nside who objected to what was in the reconciliation bill, so voted \nhere, and the President exercised his right and vetoed the legislation. \nSo when you just single out the farm bill, there was much, much more in \nthat bill than just the farm bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. Is it not also the \ncase that the farm bill part of it was a farm bill that many in farm \ncountry did not want? It cut farm programs $12 billion; it meant a \nreduction in farm income of about 40 percent. And so I remember being \nat a meeting at the White House with people from across my State urging \nthe President to veto the whole reconciliation bill just because of the \nfarm bill provision.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator is absolutely correct. And I might say to him, \nthe President of the American Farm Bureau at that time wrote us a \nletter saying they were opposed to it also. And I think that is a \nmatter of record. The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] put it into the \nRecord. I think he and the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] had a \ncolloquy on the floor and talked about bouncing like the ping-pong \nball--the American Farm Bureau's position. I think that confused all of \nus who were trying to support our farm community. \n\n[[Page S728]]\n\n  One thing I found out a long time ago, whatever the American Farm \nBureau says I do not follow anymore because my farm bureau at home is \nautonomous and they do not support anything of the American Farm Bureau \nuntil their board approves it or they approve it at their convention. \nSo regardless of what the American Farm Bureau might say, I wait until \nmy Kentucky Farm Bureau endorses that.\n  But just the idea of representing all of the American Farm Bureau, \nthe head of that organization writing letters on both sides, bouncing \nback and forth, no wonder we are confused when last year they were \nopposed to it. That helped it not come out of the committee, I am sure, \nover there. And then they were for it. And then they want us to be for \nsomething they were against at their instructions.\n  So I think the time for debate and consideration of this bill is more \nimportant than I have ever seen it since I have been here. There are \nradical, radical changes in this bill that in the years to come--and \nnot too many short years--if the freedom to farm bill is passed, the \nAmerican people will be up in arms when you decouple.\n  If you do not understand what decoupling is, that is separating the \npayments, or the income from the commodity from the deficiency payments \nor the payments to the farmer so the farmer will continue to get the \npayments every year for 7 years up to $120,000 a year if you are in \nfour different categories, which you can be and you can still raise \nyour crop and still get big prices.\n  I think when you are doing that--and the farmers have always said \nthey were against a welfare program, just absolutely, teetotally \nagainst a welfare program, and they are absolutely, teetotally for a \nbalanced budget amendment, and to do something like that for them and \nfor them to come up here and say this is something we want, I am not \nsure the leadership is speaking the grassroots attitude of the farmers, \nparticularly of my State.\n  Now, you can come up here and say we want the money, we want you to \npay us, but then decouple that to take away the safety net, take away \nthe price stability of the marketplace, it is just something that is \ntoo radical to do immediately. Phased in, maybe. Phased out, maybe. But \nwe need to think through this one. And I think 2 years from now, if we \nare paying farmers big prices and letting them get big prices for their \nproduct, somewhere the American taxpayer who is sending them the money \nwhen they are making big money, or making good profit on their crops, \nsays that will not last very long. I think we ought to realize that and \ndo it now and do it right rather than have to come back and be fussed \nat a year or two from now for doing something that the American \ntaxpayers will not accept.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will conclude. I know my colleague, the Senator from \nIowa, is waiting patiently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S726-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GETTING A GOOD FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I conclude by saying I hope very much that we can finish \nthe farm bill matter by Tuesday of next week. I would have hoped we \ncould have gotten it done today. It was not possible. But it is better \nto wait a few days and get it right than pass a farm bill that greased \nthe skids from under farm producers and eliminate a program for the \nfuture.\n  That is precisely what this Chamber was faced with today, a plan to \neliminate a farm program over time, a plan that would have guaranteed \nthe elimination of farm programs because I believe there would have \nbeen a scandal when people discovered farmers were getting large \nGovernment payments even when they were having high income as a result \nof high prices that we are experiencing currently. The key is to have \nprotection for farmers in low price years. That is when they need \nprotection.\n  I think it is critically important we reach an agreement that \nprovides a safety net in low price years and that also recognizes many \nfarmers are hard-pressed by cash-flow this year because of the \nrequirement to pay back advance deficiencies from last year.\n  I am hopeful we can achieve an agreement between the two sides that \nbridges those differences and achieves a settlement that is fair for \nAmerican farmers, fair for the American taxpayers and that achieves a \nresult that ensures we can pass farm legislation for the future.\n  I likened earlier today the proposal we had to the Reverend Jim Jones \nwhen he handed out the Kool-Aid that was laced with poison. It tasted \ngood going down. When people drank it, they were dead.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason for us to take that kind of action. \nIt is worth it to take a few extra days to get it right.\n  I thank the Chair.

In the last hour and 15 minutes I believe, both before \nthe floor leaders talked and since, we have heard people on both sides \nof the aisle speak about not having a farm bill, why we do not have a \nfarm bill, even who is to blame for not having a farm bill. The fact is \nwe do not have one, and it looks as if we are not going to have one.\n  We heard earlier during debate how awful it was--we heard this from \nthe other side--that we were not going to be able to pass a farm bill. \nYou have heard many times this evening that the President vetoed a farm \nbill, a 7-year farm bill in December. The President vetoed it after it \npassed Congress.\n  You heard this side of the aisle blamed because we have not passed a \nfarm bill when this afternoon we had 53 votes for the Freedom to Farm \nAct. A majority of this body supported the Freedom to Farm Act.\n  Now, it is one thing to say it is too bad we do not have one, we \nought to have one, we ought to stay here and work to get one, but it \nseems to me it takes a lot of gall from the other side of the aisle to \nblame this side of the aisle that we do not have a farm bill when we \neither did pass one and the President vetoed it or we demonstrated \ntoday that we had the votes to pass another one.\n  It just does not add up. It just does not make sense. I do not think \nthe American people are going to buy that argument. They can add. They \nknow what a majority vote is. They know what it means when a President \nvetoes a bill. They know what it means when the President threatened \nthis week to veto a bill that came out of the House Agriculture \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote, the substance of which was the backbone \nfor the legislation that we had 53 votes for here today. The President \ndid not even wait until it got to his desk, a bipartisan bill. The \nPresident threatened to veto it.\n  It happens that there was a Lugar-Leahy alternative that could have \nbeen before this body. What is the Lugar-Leahy bill? It is the freedom \nto farm bill with a list of about 10 things that the Democrats wanted \nus to include in the bill, that we included. It was their language, \ntheir points. We included them. We never even got to a vote on that \ntoday. The President had already sent a letter up here--it has been put \nin the Record by the floor leader--that he was threatening to veto \nthat. And we are being admonished by the other side of the aisle that \nwe should have a bipartisan bill because we have always had farm bills \ndeveloped in a bipartisan manner?\n  The Lugar-Leahy bill had added to it just exactly what the other side \nof the aisle wanted. Well, there may be people on the other side of the \naisle who do not like what was in Lugar-Leahy, but they cannot say it \nwas not bipartisan. It seems to me they cannot blame this side of the \naisle because we do not have a farm bill, and particularly when the \nPresident said he was going to veto it before we ever got to it.\n  Then we are told that what was bad about the freedom to farm bill \nthat was in the Balanced Budget Act was that it was going to cut $13 \nbillion, three or four times what the President wanted cut, from farm \nprograms in an attempt to balance the budget. But the bill that got 53 \nvotes today only cut $4 billion, \n\n[[Page S729]]\nand that $4 billion is exactly equal to what the President had been \nsuggesting all last year what should come from programs in an effort to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I think the debate today is bigger than the debate \nabout just the farm bill. The debate today is what the last election \nwas all about, whether or not we are going to continue to do business \nas usual or whether or not there is going to be some changes. The \npeople in the last election sent a message--no longer business as \nusual.\n  It seems to me, as far as agriculture is concerned, no longer \nbusiness as usual is that we do not continue to rely on 1949 \nlegislation as backup legislation. The 1949 act was written for \nagriculture of the 1940's and 1950's, when all we were concerned about \nwas domestic consumption and production to meet that domestic demand. \nIt was all based upon allotments, a great deal of Government \nregulation, and a great deal of decisionmaking, even more than under \nthe 1990 farm bill, here in Washington, DC. That is not the farm \nenvironment, the agricultural economic environment of the 1990's, and \nit surely is not for the next century. The 1990 farm bill is not even a \nGovernment program for the next century.\n  So what we tried to develop this year was a farm program that would \nbring us around to a point where we could meet the demands for \nagriculture in the next century and the realities of the world trading \nenvironment. That is what freedom to farm is all about, to provide \ntransition payments that are certain payments that will get us from \n1996 until the year 2002, with farmers being able to make decisions on \nwhat to plant and what to market based upon the marketplace and not on \nthe decisions of faceless bureaucrats in Washington, and, lastly, not \nto set aside our productive capacity, but to produce for the demands of \nthe world marketplace and to tell our world competition that we are \ngoing to do it and compete with every market we can and meet that world \ncompetition.\n  That is what the legislation that we got 53 votes today for is \nintended to do. But ``business as usual'' are people, as the vote went \ntoday, mostly on the other side of the aisle, as I can see it, who want \nto maintain Government involvement in the decisionmaking for the \nfarmer, to have the possibility of not producing to capacity to meet \nthe world marketplace, the demands of the hungry around the world, and \nto make sure that we have a roller coaster of Government support for \nagriculture--high payments when prices are moderate and no payments \nwhen prices are higher.\n  What is wrong with that, Mr. President, is, as we transition into an \nagriculture environment that meets world competition and trade, there \nis not any certainty in that as there is in the freedom to farm bill.\n  There are some farm organizations, Mr. President, who actually \nbelieve that the Government ought to have their fingers into every \naspect of agriculture. I believe they will not be satisfied until there \nis as much regimentation of American agriculture as there is of \nEuropean agriculture by the European governments.\n  Business as usual on the farm debate is a desire to maintain the \nfingers of Government into agriculture to the greatest extent possible. \nIt is all right to do that if that is what you believe. But it is not, \nit seems to me, right in the process to blame Republicans when you \ncannot have a farm bill when the President of the other party vetoed it \nand we had 53 votes on a bipartisan bill to pass it this year or a \nbipartisan vote to get it out of the House Agriculture Committee \nearlier this week.\n  It seems to me it is OK to have that philosophy of maintaining \nGovernment's fingers in agriculture, but you should not be blaming us \nfor not passing a farm program. What the major farm organizations of \nAmerica want, it seems to me, is that we have to have a farm program \nthat meets this new economic environment. That is what freedom to farm \nis all about.\n  It seems we heard debate today, again from the other side of the \naisle, about sometimes not enough money being in agriculture because \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would have taken $13 billion out of the \nbaseline.\n  Then the next time, we are being admonished that we have a program \nthat is going to let farmers receive some payments when prices are \nhigh. We present a farm bill that has $6 billion for the year we are in \nwhen the program that we accepted from the other side of the aisle \nwould not have any payments this year in the sense that it would be \ndone away with as a result of farmers paying back last year's \ndeficiency payment.\n  With the certainty of $43 billion over the next 7 years, we have a \nchance in those parts of rural America where they did not have a good \ncrop last year to benefit from the higher prices of grain this year, \nbut yet they would be caught with writing a check back to the Federal \nGovernment for the advance deficiency payment that they got last year.\n  Our program would solve that. It would have a $6 billion investment \nin agriculture, it seems to me just exactly what we are hearing the \nother side of the aisle cry about that our farm program was taking $13 \nbillion out of the baseline.\n  I hope that we can reach an agreement. The way things developed \ntoday, when you have a situation where the Democratic and Republican \nleaders get together and we on this side of the aisle buy everything \nthat the Democratic leader asked for, and it looks like we have a \nbipartisan agreement put together, and then the other side cannot even \ngo with a sweetheart deal that we accept--as I said once before on the \nLugar-Leahy bill, there were 10 or 12 items that they put on a sheet of \npaper that they wanted, and we just accepted them. Yet, in the caucus \nfor the other side, they cannot agree to move forward tonight. And when \nthey come out of that caucus, then they come to the floor and blame us \nwhen we had 53 votes, a majority vote to pass a bill, they blame us?\n  That is what I mean when I say I think it takes a lot of gall when we \ntake almost everything they want, I guess, in these two instances, \neverything they ask for, and then eventually we cannot move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S728-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S729-S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSTRUCTING A COMPROMISE FARM PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Ogden Nash wrote a little four line poem \nabout a man who was a drunk and a spouse of his who nagged him about it \nall the time. I am reminded of that listening to what I have listened \nto in the last hour or so.\n\n       He drinks because she scolds, he thinks.\n       She scolds because he drinks, she thinks.\n       And neither will admit what is really true.\n       He's a drunk and she's a shrew.\n\n  I listened today to discussions about who is at fault for failure. I \nlistened to creative inventive discussions in which any one of several \npeople choose to say that ``It's her fault,'' or ``his fault'' or \n``their fault.''\n  It is of little use or value, it seems to me, to worry about anything \nother than how we construct a compromise farm program.\n  There is a wide range of agreement in this Chamber about a farm \nprogram. There ought to be total planting flexibility for farmers. Any \nnew farm program should provide for total planting flexibility on base \nacres. There is wide agreement on that.\n  Most of us agree that there ought to be forgiveness of advance \ndeficiency payments for those who suffered crop losses last year. Most \nof us would agree to some kind of advance deficiency payment that would \nnot have to be repayable in the next year or two. I would have no \nobjection to that.\n  I would not be pleased with providing payments for people who do not \nfarm. If the requirement for getting a payment is simply to have some \nland and a bank account, but you do not have to plant a seed and you \nstill get a generous payment, that is wrong. I have some trouble with \nthat. But I have no problem at all with providing some kind of advance \nor certain payments for farmers in order to recapitalize their farm \noperation.\n  My hope had been this evening that we would proceed during this \nperiod to have constructed some kind of a compromise. The reason that \nwe are not proceeding late tonight or tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday or \nMonday I assume has a lot to do with what a lot of people are doing \naround the country. \n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n  There is a Presidential campaign going on. We have the equivalent of \na football team in the U.S. Senate running for the Presidency. They are \noff around the country campaigning. I understand all that.\n  I have to tell you, I have enormous respect for the majority leader. \nI think the majority leader in this Chamber is a remarkable legislator, \nsomeone for whom I have had deep respect for many, many years. I had \nhoped, and I think the minority leader had hoped, and others had hoped, \nthat there would be some method found by which we could reach a \ncompromise. The talks that have been ongoing for the last number of \nhours have appeared to me to reach some significant agreement.\n  Will that agreement mean that next Tuesday there will be a \ncompromise? I do not know the answer to that, but I sure hope there \nwill be a compromise, because there is plenty of area for agreement \nbetween the aisles.\n  There is one area in which there is wide disagreement, and it seems \nto me it is the reason that we have not had a farm program to this \npoint. The freedom to farm bill presupposes that there will be no \nfurther farm program. I know some of the supporters say, ``No, that's \nnot what we are trying to do.'' Others are more candid and up front and \nsay, ``Sure, that is what we are doing. We will have a buy-out up front \nwith transition payments and we will transition you, and once you are \ntransitioned, there will not be a safety net in the event that prices \ncollapse.''\n  My concern with that is I do not think we will have family farmers in \nour country if, when prices collapse--and there are plenty of reasons \nfor grain prices to collapse from time to time--there is then not some \nkind of basic safety net.\n  The interesting thing about the farmers is they face a so-called free \nmarket with a lot of enemies in that free market. They have a big grain \ntrade that would love to knock down prices at every opportunity. They \nwould love to knock down prices the minute prices start to strengthen, \nand they do it in dozens of different ways. When farmers try to market, \nthey have to market up the narrow neck of a bottle with about a dozen \nmajor grain trading firms controlling where that market stream of \nproduct goes.\n  The fact is, they want to buy grain at lower prices, not higher \nprices, and in dozens of ways, they try to find a way to knock down \nhigher prices when prices firm up.\n  Do you think millers love to see high prices? No; no, they would like \nto find a way to knock down prices a bit. Food processors, do they like \nhigh grain prices? No, they find a way to knock them down. So every \ntime prices start to firm up--and, yes, even USDA.\n  I heard an Assistant Secretary about 5 or 6 years ago sidle up to the \ntable in the House Agriculture Committee and say, ``We had to take \naction to release grain, because we thought prices were firming up too \nmuch.'' That is a euphemism for saying, ``We over in USDA thought farm \nprices were getting too high, so we used our leverage and the \nmechanisms we have to try to trim them down a bit.''\n  The interesting thing is, family farmers never seem to be able to \ntake advantage on any continuing basis of a free market of higher \nprices, because there is always someone in there to interrupt those \nhigher prices, big grain trading firms, food processors and others. \nWell, I do not object--in fact I think we must find a much more market-\noriented, market-sensitive farm program. Those who say we should are \nabsolutely correct and they will find support from me for that. But I \ndo not believe that we ought to decide that there should be no further \nprice supports in the outyears in order that when international prices \ndrop, family farmers will be left with no ability to deal with that \nrisk.\n\n  Frankly, they cannot deal with that risk. Family farmers will not \nsurvive. Prices will drop and family farmers will fail and FAPRI, the \nresearch agency, says wheat prices will drop to $3.22 next year. USDA \npredicts a drop in 1998. I do not know the facts. I know wheat prices \ngo up and down. But they go down a lot easier than they go up.\n  When they go down, the question is, for somebody farming 800 acres of \nwheat land in the northern great plains, and wheat drops to $3 a bushel \nand their production costs are $4.50 a bushel, and there is no loan \nrate, no target price, no marketing loan, no restitution payment, no \nnothing, what happens to that family farm?\n  The family farm goes broke. Who farms it? An agrifactory buys it. \nCorporations farm in this country from California to Maine. That is \nwhat will happen if you decide this country has no interest in \nretaining a safety net for family farms.\n  Every time I hear somebody--especially somebody from Washington with \na white shirt--talking about transitioning somebody--especially a \nfarmer--I suggest you fasten the seatbelt on the tractor seat. If you \nare going to be transitioned, you better look at what is behind that \nso-called transition. It may be going to a marketing policy that says:\n\n       Let us have a buyout and make some big payments up front in \n     exchange for no further help, even some minimum safety net in \n     the long-term.\n\n  There does need to be a farm program enacted by the U.S. Senate and \nthe U.S. House, and it needs to be done soon. I do not want to revisit \nthe question of who did what and why. I can make a strong case that \nthis is the first day of the 104th Congress we have had a debate on the \nfarm bill on the floor of the Senate. I know one was put in the \nreconciliation bill, but it was not debated on the floor. I am not \ninterested in revisiting that because it is not very important.\n  What is important is the question of what do we do now, how quickly \ncan we do it, and can we do it in a way that advantages the rural \neconomies in this country. Can we do it in a way that especially tries \nto provide basic help to family-size farmers when prices drop.\n  It is my expectation and my hope that, with the leadership of Senator \nDole and Senator Daschle, and the work that has been ongoing today, in \nwhich I think there has been some fair amount of agreement, between now \nand next Tuesday, provide a proposal. We could provide to both caucuses \nan approach that provides a bridge, or deals with filling in the gaps \nbetween the divergent proposals, and come to the floor and truly, in a \nbipartisan way, join hands and say this makes sense and meets the test.\n  This does what some in this Chamber have counseled, which is to make \na more market-oriented farm program work. It provides more flexibility \nand it moves into the future with a more modernistic program that is \nmore market-sensitive. It still retains, for those concerned about \nwhether we will have family farmers in the future, a basic safety net \nof some consequence, so that when prices drop, family farmers will be \nable to ride out those times.\n  I come from a town of 300 people and from an area that is a family \nfarming area. I suppose some people can say, ``Of what importance is it \nwhether our farms are farmed by family farmers or whether they are \nfarmed by one large giant corporation that farms two counties at a \ntime?\"\n  I think there is plenty of reason for us to believe, for both social \nand economic reasons, in the retention of the opportunity to farm, and \nthat to have a network of family farms dotting these prairies in \nAmerica, dotting the northern great plains, makes a lot of sense. It \nsupports a lifestyle that I think is admired by a lot of Americans. \nTurn on the news in any major city in the country and ask yourself if \nwhat you hear there compares well with what you understand is going on \nin our small towns and out on our farms.\n  Does the news compare in terms of family values and good living, \nliving in circumstances relatively free from crime, living in \nneighborhoods and farm areas where you know all of your neighbors. The \nfact is that there are a lot of reasons to care about whether we have a \nnetwork of family farms in our future. The answer to that question \ndepends on what kind of farm program we develop here in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that it is not my intention \nto do anything other than suggest that all of us find a way to serve \nthe common interests that we have in rural America. There are farm \nfamilies who depend on us, and they depend on us to do the right thing. \nThere are mixed messages coming from different groups, commodity groups \nand farm organizations. Some like this approach and some like that \napproach. It seems to me that there is a basis for compromise.\n  I hope that between now and next Tuesday, we will reach out and find \n\n[[Page S731]]\n  that basis and, on Tuesday, move to a conference committee, a piece of \nfarm legislation passed by the U.S. Senate in a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I just say, in answer to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, I feel confident that Senators on both sides of the \naisle want to reach an agreement on a substantial, constructive farm \nbill. Nothing is more important, and it is prime legislation. I feel \nsure that I can speak on behalf of Senators on my side of the aisle \nthat would say we are going to reach that agreement, and we will all \nwork together in good faith to achieve what is very important, coming \nfrom a farm State, as I do myself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S729-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, during this National Appreciation Week \nfor Catholic Schools I would like to take a few moments to recognize \nthe high quality and the hard work of the Catholic School System.\n  Our thanks and praise should go to the Catholic Schools for their \nspecial efforts to put children first. In the midst of increased school \ndrop-outs, illiteracy, teenage pregnancy, drug-abuse, youth violence \nand growing pressures on teenagers and children--Catholic Schools \nprovide their students a safe and healthy environment for learning. \nThese schools give pupils an advantage by helping them develop a solid \nmoral foundation.\n  In today's challenging society, mere words and good intentions are \nnot enough. Catholic Schools' actions demonstrate their commitment to \nchildren. With a 99.98 percent graduation rate and 85 percent college \nmatriculation rate, South Dakota Catholic Schools are proving that a \nsolid combination of educational and spiritual guidance is the key to \nhealthy living. In assisting pupils to build better lives, Catholic \nSchools reaffirm the value of life.\n  Catholic Schools extend the lessons we try to teach children at home: \nrespect and love of our fellow neighbors, respect of the individual, \npersonal discipline, individual responsibility and concern for the \nlarger community. Catholic schools reinforce these family values which \nare the key to strong communities. We want the best for our families, \nour communities, and South Dakota. We must work to put the best tools \nin the hands of the future--our children. The Catholic schools give \nstudents the tools to be responsible adults and concerned citizens.\n  I want to thank all the individuals who have contributed to Catholic \nSchool Systems' continued success and growth--the teachers, \nadministrators, and of course the parents, many being graduates of \nCatholic schools themselves. One special week each year is a modest way \nto pay special tribute and thanks to the Catholic Schools across our \ncountry for the service they provide to our communities and our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S731-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN MALTA, MONTANA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at a time when we hear so much about what \nis wrong with America, I want to take a moment to talk about a place \nwhere good things are happening. That place is Malta, Montana.\n  Malta is a small community in Northern Montana, up along what we in \nMontana call the ``Hi-Line''. Like any small Montana town, it is a \nplace where people work hard and don't think twice about helping out a \nneighbor or a friend in need.\n  This past Christmas Eve, a fire destroyed Malta's high school and \njunior high school. But folks in Malta pitched right in to get a \ntemporary school up and running.\n  Students, teachers, and others from the community have spent the past \nmonth salvaging lost items and fixing up temporary school sites. Almost \nevery Montana community has helped by sending items to start up the new \nschools. Also, Federal and State Agencies, Veterans groups, private as \nwell as small businesses and many other organizations have contributed \nto this effort.\n  And I was privileged to spend a day working as part of this effort. \nWhile the entire community deserves credit, I would like to recognize \nthree individuals who have taken a leading role in this undertaking. \nFirst, I would like to acknowledge the Principal of Malta High, Marty \nTyler, who quickly took control of the situation and led the students \nand the community in the effort to rebuild the schools. For example, \nPrincipal Tyler and members of the student council collected about \n4,000 bricks to construct an entrance sign when the new school is \nbuilt. During my work day at the Malta schools I participated in \nbuilding windbreaks in front of doors and collecting bricks with \nSchoolboard Chairman Doug Ost and School Superintendent Bill Parker. \nBoth of whom deserve a big thanks for the commitment and support they \nhave given to the Malta School District.\n  Finally, this fire also prompted the creation of PRIDE, People \nRebuilding Investing and Developing Education, a local group to offer \nadvice and manpower to the school district. I would like to extend my \nsincere thanks for their community involvement.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege for me to recognize the \nachievements of the students, teachers, administrators, and citizens of \nthe Malta community and all others who have helped to get this project \noff to a great start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S731-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S731-S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A STRONG NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, over the last month I've traveled to \nevery county in South Carolina. And one of the things that I heard from \npeople was that they want America to keep a strong National Guard.\n  As a veteran, I know that a strong National Guard is vital to \nnational security. Time and again, National Guard troops proved \nthemselves to be as competent--if not more so--as regular troops in the \nactive military. Air National Guard troops from South Carolina \nroutinely are rated among the best in the service. They flew countless \nmissions in the Persian Gulf War and flew them with skill, accuracy and \nexpertise. Army National Guard troops from South Carolina proved \nthemselves to be ready to mobilize and fight almost at the drop of a \nhat.\n  Mr. President, a strong National Guard also makes common sense. In \nthese days where dollars are stretched thin, we can get three qualified \nand highly trained guardsmen for the cost of one active-duty soldier. \nPerhaps more importantly, however, having a strong Guard builds \ncommunity support for the military. Think about it--the men and women \nwho serve in the National Guard work in towns and counties every day \nacross the country. They work in stores, construction sites, mills, \nfactories and offices. And they set the example of public service for \neveryone. When their units are called up, their co-workers all turn out \nto support their efforts.\n  Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago when I was in Laurens, South \nCarolina, Rich Browne, the local newspaper editor, and I discussed the \nvalue of a strong Guard. His comments in a recent column are to-the-\npoint. I hope every Senator would read this wise column and resist \nefforts to reduce the size of our National Guard units.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Rich Browne's column from the January 4 \nedition of the Laurens County Advertiser be reprinted in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n\n                      Avoiding military adventures\n\n          [From the Laurens County Advertiser by Rich Browne]\n\n       This should be an interesting year for the U.S. military.\n       With the active duty services once again calling on \n     reserves to support the efforts to police the peace in \n     Bosnia, according to news reports, the Department of Defense \n     once again is leading a charge to reduce the role of National \n     Guard units in preparing for the defense of the nation.\n       Well, the truth be known, the Department of the Army would \n     like for all the combat arms units in the National Guard to \n     just go away--they are a threat to the active Army's jobs. I \n     saw this first-hand in Desert Storm \n\n[[Page S732]]\n     and despite the Pentagon's contention that it would save the military a \n     billion dollars per year to shift the focus of reserve units \n     from fighting units to support units, the Army wants to deny \n     that it would be cheaper and more effective to reduce the \n     active component even further while increasing the number of \n     troops in the reserve components.\n       However, don't look for this to happen and I'll tell you \n     why.\n       First, it drastically would cut the number of active duty \n     staff officer positions at the Pentagon and they are the ones \n     who are drawing up the plans to downsize the military. No \n     one, and I mean no one, is willingly going to say ``Eliminate \n     me and destroy my career,'' when an option can be made to \n     eliminate someone else's job (even if they do it at less than \n     half the cost).\n       Second, it is a matter of control. Because of its dual \n     state-federal role, the National Guard is not totally under \n     the control of federal army, something senior staff members \n     resent and dream up ways to eliminate. Even though, again \n     speaking from personal experience, Guard and reserve units \n     often meet or exceed the standards set for active duty units, \n     despite the fact they don't practice at the job 270 days a \n     year.\n       Third, it limits the options of the executive branch to use \n     the military in questionable operations. Note that the hue \n     and cry about the use of U.S. forces in the Balkans and \n     places like Somalia and Haiti are muted when the troops used \n     are professional, full-time volunteers when compared to the \n     times when the political leadership has to bite the bullet to \n     tap into every village and hamlet to send forces in harm's \n     way.\n       The civilian and military leadership in the Pentagon knows \n     these things full well and, hence, would rather keep their \n     jobs and control of careers, while keeping open the options \n     for ticket-punching operations that are so vital to career \n     progression.\n       The argument is that the combat units in the National Guard \n     won't go to war and are ill-prepared to fight if they are \n     sent, which--to borrow a phrase from retired Gen. H. Norman \n     ``Stormin' Norman'' Schwarzkopf--is just so much bovine \n     scatology.\n       When the Arm went to war in the Persian Gulf, its units \n     were no more prepared than many National Guard units. Most \n     used the months preceding the ground attack to ``train up'' \n     in the desert and bring their troops up to the needed \n     ``combat readiness.''\n       The three National Guard armored brigades that were \n     mobilized during Desert Storm where held in the U.S. not so \n     much because their training was not up to snuff but because \n     if they had gone to the desert and acquitted themselves well \n     . . . well, it would have disproved the myth that reserve \n     soldiers can't perform up to the same standards as active \n     duty soldiers.\n       Imagine what Congress and the budget cutters would have \n     thought then. Gee, for 40 cents on the dollar, we can field a \n     capable force that doesn't need all the full-time auxiliary \n     services like housing, medical care and other benefits that \n     we have to give the active duty force. We might be able to \n     get a lot more bang for our buck.\n       Lay aside those arguments, and the arguments about all the \n     support and benefits to national defense that come from a \n     truly citizen army, and there is one vital reason why the \n     political leadership in Washington and the Pentagon should \n     not be allowed to reduce the Army to just professional \n     soldiers: It removes the political cost on military \n     adventures overseas.\n       If the civilian leadership has to go to every hamlet and \n     village to draw men (and now women) to carry rifles and man \n     tanks and artillery pieces, then it has to be able to justify \n     the mission to the American people. This can be a tough sell \n     and can be avoided if it is just a matter of sending in the \n     professionals that have slipped under the radar of the folks \n     back home. Hey, they volunteered for the job and it goes with \n     the territory.\n       But don't look for that argument to be made. Even though we \n     learned that lesson in Vietnam, when we didn't have large \n     scale mobilizations of the reserve components and paid the \n     price in 58,000 lives, we have forgotten it again. Gone, now, \n     is the leadership that created the ``Total Force'', the Army \n     that was built so that the civilian leadership couldn't \n     commit U.S. forces in substantial numbers without paying the \n     political price of getting the American people on board.\n       The new leadership wants to be able to go anywhere, anytime \n     and not worry about support back home. It saves their \n     careers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S731-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the fine work \nSouth Carolina Educational Television is doing to promote Black History \nMonth. On Wednesday, February 21, SC ETV will feature the ninth annual \nBlack History Teleconference live from the campus of Benedict College \nin Columbia, S.C.\n  ``The Struggle Continues: African-American Women as Nurturing and \nContributing Forces in America'' will feature eight South Carolina high \nschool seniors who will question a panel of nationally acclaimed \nAfrican-American leaders. The 90-minute teleconference will be \nbroadcast live via satellite to more than 500 school districts \nnationwide, colleges, and universities.\n  The eight high school panelists for South Carolina are Dion Alexander \nof Woodruff High School, LaShonda R. Davis of Bishopville High School, \nFelicia DuRante of Mauldin High School, Latasha Johnson of Baptist High \nSchool, Tahnee Johnson of Walterboro High School, Juontonio Pinckney of \nBattery Creek High School, Lemekia Stewart of Lockhart High School, and \nJoey Walker of Silver Bluff High School. I send my congratulations to \neach of them for their academic and civic achievements.\n  Also, I would like to commend Dr. Marianna Davis of Keenan High \nSchool in Columbia. She has been the driving force behind this annual \nevent. She is an inspiring role model for our youth because she \nencourages them to set high goals and to work hard to reach them.\n  Mr. President, I also commend Henry Cauthen, president of South \nCarolina ETV; Dr. Davis; the students; and the panelists of ``The \nStruggle Continues'' for their continuing devotion to cultural \nexcellence in broadcasting. We are very proud of our fine educational \nnetwork in South Carolina.

If the American people don't \nbecome concerned perhaps they had better ponder the economic calamity \nthat will occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our \nsupply, or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing \ninto the United States--now 6,895,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S732-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S732-S733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES-GERMANY AVIATION RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a critically \nimportant international aviation matter I have raised in this body on \nnumerous occasions. I refer to the significant opportunity that has \npresented itself to fully liberalize our aviation relations with the \nFederal Republic of Germany.\n  I am delighted to inform my colleagues that this morning the United \nStates and Germany agreed on a framework for an open skies agreement. \nThis is a major step in liberalizing aviation relations with one of our \nmost important trading partners. A United States-Germany open skies \nagreement would produce significant new air service opportunities for \nall U.S. passenger carriers. Now that the mutually agreed upon \nstructure for a liberalized air service agreement is in place, a round \nof formal talks has been scheduled for February 22 in Washington to \nfinalize any remaining details.\n  Mr. President, I would like to praise both the Department of \nTransportation \n\n[[Page S733]]\nand the State Department for the excellent work they are doing in \npursuing this opportunity. Also, I would be remiss if I failed to \nrecognize the outstanding leadership German Transport Minister Matthias \nWissmann has provided. I appreciate fully that Germany's membership in \nthe European Union creates an added challenge in accomplishing our \nshared goal of securing an open skies agreement. For that reason, I \ncommend Minister Wissmann for the great political courage he and the \nGerman Government have shown in pursuing this initiative.\n  An open skies agreement with Germany is tremendously significant \nsince it would benefit the U.S. economy, our airline industry and \nconsumers. Let me briefly expand on each point.\n  First, both immediately and from a long-term perspective, a United \nStates-Germany open skies agreement would produce significant economic \nbenefits for the United States. Due to the competitiveness of U.S. \npassenger and cargo carriers, they consistently generate for the United \nStates significant net trade surpluses. I fully expect the same will \ncontinue to be true under a fully liberalized aviation regime with \nGermany. In fact, the performance of our cargo carriers under the \nliberalized air cargo agreement we signed with Germany in 1993 has been \nvery impressive.\n  Germany also would benefit greatly from such an agreement. To confirm \nthis point, one need only look to the Netherlands which continues to \nreap enormous economic benefits from the open skies agreement we signed \nwith the Dutch several years ago. Unquestionably, the economic benefits \nof open skies agreements are a two-way street. I believe a United \nStates-Germany open skies agreement is an excellent long-term economic \ninvestment for both countries.\n  Second, an open skies agreement with Germany would create tremendous \nnew international air service opportunities for the U.S. airline \nindustry. As I have previously explained to this body, such an \nagreement would generate both direct and indirect benefits for all U.S. \npassenger carriers.\n  In terms of direct benefits, an open skies agreement with Germany \nwould immediately produce new air service opportunities between the \nUnited States and Germany. Is there pent-up demand among U.S. passenger \ncarriers to serve Germany? Absolutely. Recently, eight U.S. passenger \ncarriers sought to offer 316 roundtrip flights between the United \nStates and Germany each week during the 1996 summer season. Under the \ncurrent bilateral aviation agreement, however, U.S. passenger carriers \ncan only offer 276 weekly roundtrip flights to Germany. Under an open \nskies agreement, there would be no such limit and the number of \nroundtrip frequencies would be set by market demand, not governments.\n  Equally important, German airports would provide well-situated \ngateway opportunities for our carriers to serve points throughout \nEurope, the Middle East, Africa and the booming Asia-Pacific market. Is \nit realistic to think that German airports will provide key gateways to \nthe rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific market? Absolutely. In fact, Japan \nAirlines recently announced it intends to initiate new service between \nOsaka and Frankfurt. Non-stop service is presently available from \nFrankfurt-Main Airport to cities throughout the Asia-Pacific market \nincluding Hong Kong, Seoul, Bangkok and Singapore. Moreover, non-stop \nservice to the Asia-Pacific market also is currently available from \nMunich Airport. These examples illustrate my point well.\n  With respect to indirect benefits, an open skies agreement with \nGermany would be an important catalyst for further liberalization of \nair service opportunities throughout Europe. Since it is such a \ncritical fact, let me reiterate a point I have made in this body \nbefore. An open skies agreement with Germany --in combination with \nliberalized air service agreements we already secured with the \nNetherlands in 1992 and with nine other European countries last year--\nwould mean nearly half of all passengers traveling between the United \nStates and Europe would be flying to or from European countries with \nopen skies regimes. Under such a scenario, competition would be our \nbest ally in opening the remaining restrictive air service markets in \nEurope.\n  Will an open skies agreement with Germany, or any other country for \nthat matter, benefit all U.S. passenger carriers equally? Of course \nnot. A market-oriented framework only guarantees carriers the \nopportunity to compete. As should be the case, the market will \ndetermine which carriers will benefit most under an open skies \nagreement with Germany. Overall, however, I do predict with confidence \nthat the U.S. aviation industry as a whole will benefit immensely from \nunrestricted opportunities to serve Germany.\n  Third, undoubtedly consumers in the United States and Germany would \nbe the biggest winners. Due to enhanced service options as well as the \nassurance of competitive air fares, consumers always benefit most under \nopen skies agreements.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased that we are well on our way to an \nopen skies agreement with Germany. Such an agreement would be in the \nbest economic interest of the United States and it would create \nconsiderable new international air service opportunities for all U.S. \npassenger carriers. Of great importance to me, consumers would reap \nsignificant benefits as well. I hope an open skies agreement with \nGermany will soon be in hand.\n  Let me add that I know some of my colleagues are frustrated that we \nhave not made more progress liberalizing air service opportunities with \nseveral other major trading partners. I share this frustration but do \nnot believe it results from a lack of effort on the part of our \nnegotiators. In fact, our successful talks with the Germans illustrate \na critical element which has been lacking in those other negotiations. \nI refer to the keen vision the Germans have shown in recognizing that \nthe economic benefits of an open skies agreement with the United States \nare a two-way street.\n  In this regard, I believe my colleagues who are frustrated about the \ncontinued reluctance of the British to permit U.S. carriers greater \naccess to London Heathrow Airport should be very pleased by this \ndevelopment with Germany. As I said earlier, competition will be our \nbest ally in expanding air service opportunities with European \ncountries such as the United Kingdom that continue to restrict the \naccess of U.S. carriers. An open skies agreement with Germany will add \ngreat force to this market dynamic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S732-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S733-S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LOWELL KRASSNER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the late Lowell \nKrassner of Burlington, VT, who passed away unexpectedly on January 15, \n1996. As a longtime activist with the Vermont chapter of the Sierra \nClub, Lowell dedicated much of his life and energy to the conservation \nand stewardship of our natural resources--both in Vermont and \nnationally.\n  Lowell, together with his wife and partner Diane Geerken, worked \ntirelessly to protect the Vermont they loved, making major \ncontributions to the eventual passage of the Vermont Wilderness Act of \n1983 and the Green Mountain National Forest Management Plan of 1986.\n  Lowell and Diane functioned as a two-person citizen oversight \ncommittee, making sure that the actions of State and Federal public \nlands and natural resource managers were carefully reviewed. Indeed, \nfriends and colleagues have often remarked how their South Burlington \nhome served as both a hub of environmental activism and a Vermont \nconservation archive for so many years.\n  Lowell stood as a staunch defender of the Long/Appalachian Trail. He \ncould also be both a strong supporter and sharp critic of the U.S. \nForest Service, depending on the issue at hand.\n  In his commitment to the environment, Lowell Krassner also looked \nwell beyond the Green Mountains, Lake Champlain, and the Connecticut \nRiver. He was well read on the various national environmental debates \nof the day--clean water, clean air, endangered species, wetlands, ANWR, \nForest Service timber policy--and readily shared his views with his \ncongressional representatives.\n  Lowell was particularly concerned with the recent attacks on our \nNation's environmental laws represented by such actions as the timber \nsalvage rider on the fiscal 1995 rescission legislation. \n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n  Over the last few years, Lowell immersed himself in the work of the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council and strongly supported legislation to \nimplement the council's recommendations.\n  Lowell Krassner will be truly missed, not only by his family and the \nVermont chapter of the Sierra Club, but also by those many of us who \ncounted on his unswerving commitment and honesty in furthering the \ncause we share--the wise stewardship of our public lands and natural \nresources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S733-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOYCE ROUILLE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to let the entire Senate know \nhow proud I am of Joyce Rouille, a wonderful person and someone who I \nam fortunate enough to call my friend. Joyce was recently named the \nVolunteer of the Week by the Burlington Free Press for her work at the \nCommunity Health Center in Burlington, VT. While Joyce may technically \nbe retired, anyone who knows her will attest to her constant devotion \nto her family, church, and community. The time and love she spends each \nday on other people would exhaust any normal person. Joyce and Jack \nhave shown all of us how to be good parents and good citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article appearing in the Burlington \nFree Press be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 22, 1996]\n\n                         Volunteer of the Week\n\n                          (By Beth Gillespie)\n\n       Joyce Rouille is enhancing her retirement by helping \n     parents at the Community Health Center of Burlington.\n       As coordinator of the CHC library, Rouille helps ensure \n     that patients have easy access to the hundreds of parenting \n     books and other materials.\n       She keeps track of the books patients take out, sends \n     notices for overdue items and generally keeps library \n     materials organized. She also helps with filing, billing, \n     mailing and other clerical work in the center's main office.\n       ``Joyce does anything we ask her to,'' says CHC director \n     Alison Calderara. ``She's totally committed and always here \n     when we need her. It's been really nice to have her around.''\n       Rouille lives in Burlington with her husband, John. She \n     enjoys sewing, seasonal crafts, gardening and quilting.\n       ``After you stop working, you don't want to just sit in a \n     chair and do nothing.

Mr. President, each year we celebrate in the Nation's \nCapital a National Prayer Breakfast. It was my privilege to attend \ntoday, the 44th consecutive gathering. The President of the United \nStates and the First Lady, together with the Vice President and his \nwife are, as they were today, regular attendees. Leaders from many \ncountries, leaders from every State join with members of the judiciary, \nexecutive, and legislative branches of our government. It is invariably \nan inspirational, memorable event.\n  As is customary, Members of Congress preside and today Senator Robert \nBennett, Utah, whose father likewise was a distinguished U.S. Senator, \ncontributed masterfully as a master of ceremonies. Senators and House \nMembers share in the program.\n  Strong messages were given by all, especially President Clinton and \nVice President Gore. The Senate participants were Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun, Illinois, who read beautifully from the scriptures and \nSenator Alan Simpson who spoke with deep sincerity and humility.\n  But the most memorable contribution of all was from the principal \nspeaker, Senator Sam Nunn, Georgia. The audience, at the breakfast and \nwatching television, all across America, were given a stirring, \nuplifting message. Remarks that are deserving to be recorded for \npresent and future generations the world over.\n  It is with pride and humility that I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the remarks of my two valued friends, Senator \nSimpson and Senator Nunn.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by Senator Simpson, National Prayer Breakfast, February 1, 1996\n\n       Mr. President, First Lady Hillary, Mr. Vice President and \n     President of our Senate and Tipper Gore, Distinguished \n     guests. Greetings, my fellow seekers, discoverers, and \n     wanderers (not necessarily in that order!) always a grand \n     morning.\n       One of the great honors of my life was to give the \n     principle address at this national prayer breakfast in 1989. \n     I was filled with trepidation that a seeker like me would be \n     asked.\n       The night before, the Reverend Billy Graham, one of the \n     most loving, inspirational, caring men in this world, called \n     and said, ``Alan, we are praying for you.'' I said, ``You're \n     praying for me! I'm doing plenty of that for myself!'' So \n     typical of Billy Graham.\n       Long ago in public life I learned where to turn when I \n     didn't know where to turn. One source.\n       The Senate prayer breakfast group gathers every Wednesday \n     morning for a convivial half hour between 8 and 9:00. Our \n     leaders are Bob Bennett, the Republican from Utah and Dan \n     Akaka a Democrat from Hawaii. Rare gentlemen both.\n       The presentor of the day--after an opening prayer--shares \n     much of himself or herself with us for fifteen or twenty \n     minutes and then a time of discussion and fellowship. \n     Promptly at the hour of nine we close with a prayer as we \n     stand with hands joined around the tables. Sometimes the \n     theme is the Bible. Sometimes it's public life. Sometimes \n     it's about family and our jobs but always it's about \n     ourselves and the impact of that greater force in our lives--\n     a higher being. All faiths. All philosophies. All believers.\n       These are always very moving times. We share much with each \n     other and we gain much from each other.\n       It helps us endure in the partisan and political world in \n     which we have chosen to labor. Kindness, civility, tolerance \n     and forgiveness all are part of the essence of our \n     gatherings. We try to put aside harsh judgment and \n     criticism.\n       I remember the words of a wonderful couplet my mother used \n     to share.\n\n     There is so much good in the worst of us.\n     And so much bad in the best of us.\n     That it ill behooves any of us\n     To find fault with the rest of us.\n\n       I like that one. I knew you would!\n       We also talk about our human frailties. We talk about how \n     easy it is to fall for the blandishments of flattery and be \n     overcome by ego.\n       I have often said that those who travel the high road of \n     humility in Washington DC are not really troubled by heavy \n     traffic!\n       It is always a very uplifting time. Yes, actually too a \n     time of sharing of our own vulnerabilities. It was Will \n     Rogers, our great American humorist, who said, ``It's great \n     to be great but it is greater to be human.''\n       We are very privileged to be able to serve in the United \n     States Senate. A special obligation. People do observe us. We \n     are scrutinized. (Indeed we are!) We hope to do more than \n     just talk a good game. We need to live the things we learn \n     and share.\n       Let me close with a poem that is something we try to take \n     from the weekly Senate prayer breakfast group and something \n     we might hope to remember from this marvelous convocation \n     today. That little poem.\n\n     We'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day,\n     We'd rather you would walk with us than merely show the way.\n     The eye is a better pupil and more willing than the ear.\n     Fine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear.\n     We can soon learn how to do it if you'll let us see it done,\n     We can watch you well in action, but your tongue too fast may \n           run\n     And the lecture you deliver may be very wise and true,\n     But we'd rather get our lessons by observing what you do.\n\n       Now there's ``the word'' for the day!\n       God bless you all.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Remarks of Senator Nunn\n\n       Thank you Bob Bennett, President and Mrs. Clinton, Vice \n     President and Mrs. Gore, fellow sinners. Have I left anyone \n     out? I say to my good friend, Alan Simpson, Billy Graham \n     called me also, Alan. He said, as he did in his message, that \n     he was praying for us all. But, he felt particularly \n     compelled to pray for Alan Simpson and for me. Alan, I don't \n     know what he meant by that, but you and I appreciate it.\n       A few years ago during the Bresznev era, Dr. Billy Graham \n     returned from a highly publicized trip to Moscow and was \n     confronted when he returned by one of his critics with these \n     words, ``Dr. Graham, you have set the church back 50 years.'' \n     Billy Graham lowered his head and replied, ``I am deeply \n     ashamed. I have been trying very hard to set the church back \n     2,000 years.''\n       Today we represent different political parties, different \n     religions and different nations, but as your invitation \n     states, we gather as brothers and sisters in the spirit of \n     Jesus who lived 2,000 years ago, and who lives in our hearts \n     and minds today.\n       The first prayer breakfast was held in 1953 in a world of \n     great danger. President Eisenhower was newly inaugurated and \n     had just returned from Korea where our young soldiers were \n     fighting desperately. World Communism was on the move. \n     Eastern Europe \n\n[[Page S735]]\n     and the Baltics were locked behind the Iron Curtain. All across the \n     globe, the lights of religious freedom and individual rights \n     were going out, and the specter of nuclear destruction loomed \n     over our planet.\n       I wonder this morning how those who attended that first \n     national prayer breakfast 43 years ago would have reacted if \n     God had given them a window to see the world of the 1980's \n     and 1990's.\n       They would have seen truly amazing things: Catholic nuns \n     kneeling to pray in the path of 50-ton tanks--the power of \n     their faith bringing down the Philippine dictatorship; the \n     Iron Curtain being smashed, not by tanks of war, but by the \n     hands of those who built it and those who were oppressed by \n     it; the Cold War ending, not in a nuclear inferno, but in a \n     blaze of candles in the churches of Eastern Europe, in the \n     singing of hymns and the opening of long-closed synagogues. I \n     believe that God gave Joseph Stalin the answer to his \n     question, ``How many divisions does the Pope have?''\n       They also would have seen a black man in South Africa \n     emerge from prison after 26 years and become the President of \n     his nation, personifying forgiveness and reconciliation; the \n     first hesitant but hopeful steps toward peace between Jews \n     and Arabs in the Middle East, and between Protestants and \n     Catholics in Northern Ireland. They would see that in 1996 we \n     are blessed to live in a world where more people enjoy \n     religious freedom than at any other time in history. Can we \n     doubt this morning that a loving God has watched over us and \n     guided us through this dangerous and challenging period?\n       During the early days of the Russian parliament, the Duma, \n     I joined several other Senators in attending a meeting with a \n     number of newly elected members of that body. The second day, \n     a few of us were invited to a very small ``prayer breakfast'' \n     with a group of Duma members who were just forming a \n     fellowship, no doubt stimulated by Doug Coe. As in the larger \n     meeting the day before, the breakfast discussion started with \n     a degree of coldness and tension. One of the Russians, in \n     obvious sadness and a little embarrassment, remarked that \n     Russia was in great economic distress and that the United \n     States was the only remaining superpower. It was clear that \n     this was a very sensitive point for them. It had been \n     abundantly clear the day before.\n       Senator Dirk Kempthorne and I then pointed out that in the \n     real sense there is only one superpower in the world, our \n     heavenly Father who watches over us all. The tension \n     immediately eased and the spirit of fellowship was built, and \n     we prayed together to that superpower, the God who loves us \n     all.\n       Our world is a strange and tragic place. It is very ironic \n     in many ways. The Cold War is now over, but in a tragic \n     sense, the world has now been made safer for ethnic, tribal, \n     and religious vengeance and savagery. Such tragedy has come \n     to the people of Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, \n     Haiti and others.\n       At home, the pillar of our national strength, the American \n     family, is crumbling. Television and movies saturate our \n     children with sex and violence. We have watered down our \n     moral standards to the point where many of our youth are \n     confused, discouraged and in deep trouble. We are reaping the \n     harvest of parental neglect, divorce, child abuse, teen \n     pregnancy, school dropouts, illegal drugs, and streets full \n     of violence.\n       It's as if our house, having survived the great earthquake \n     we call the Cold War, is now being eaten away by termites. \n     Where should we turn this morning and in the days ahead?\n       Our problems in America today are primarily problems of the \n     heart. The soul of our nation is the sum of our \n     individual characters. Yes, we must balance the federal \n     budget and there are a lot of other things we need to do \n     at the Federal level, but unless we change our hearts we \n     will still have a deficit of the soul.\n       The human inclination to seek political solutions for \n     problems of the heart is nothing new. It is natural. Two \n     thousand years ago, another society found itself in deeper \n     trouble than our own. An oppressive empire strangled \n     liberties. Violence and corruption were pervasive.\n       Many of the people of the day hoped for the triumphant \n     coming of a political savior, a long-expected king to \n     establish a new, righteous government. Instead, God sent his \n     son, a baby, born in a stable. Jesus grew up to become a \n     peasant carpenter in a backwater town called Nazareth. He \n     condemned sin but made it clear that he loved the sinner. He \n     befriended beggars and prostitutes and even tax collectors \n     while condemning the hypocrisy of those in power. He treated \n     every individual with love and dignity and taught that we \n     should do the same. He died like a common criminal, on a \n     cross, and gave us the opportunity for redemption and the \n     hope of eternal life.\n       He also put the role of government in proper perspective \n     when he said, ``Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and \n     unto God that which is God's.''\n       Shortly after I announced that I would not seek reelection, \n     a reporter asked me, ``You've been in the Congress for 24 \n     years; what do you consider to be your greatest \n     accomplishment?'' I paused for a moment and replied, \n     ``Keeping my family together for 24 years and helping my wife \n     Colleen raise two wonderful children, Michelle and Brian.'' \n     Upon hearing this, the reporter scoffed, ``Don't give me that \n     soft sound-bite stuff. What laws did you get passed?''\n       When he said that, I had several thoughts--only a couple of \n     them I can share with you this morning. Four years ago, my \n     daughter, Michelle, and a few of her friends started an \n     organization in Atlanta called Hands on Atlanta, making it \n     exciting, efficient and fun for young people to volunteer \n     their time to help those in need. Now, about 5 years later, \n     10,000 volunteers each month render about 20,000 hours of \n     personal, one-on-one service. What laws have I passed that \n     have had this impact?\n       I also thought about the difference between being a Senator \n     and being a father. When we in the Senate make a mistake, we \n     have checks and balances--99 other Senate colleagues, plus \n     the House of Representatives, plus the President, plus a \n     final review by the Supreme Court. But, when we as parents \n     make a mistake with our children, where are the checks and \n     where are the balances?\n       Congress can pass laws cracking down on those who refuse to \n     support their children. But we cannot force husbands to honor \n     their wives, wives to love their husbands, and both parents \n     to nurture their children. Congress can pass laws on civil \n     rights and equal rights, but we cannot force people of \n     different races to love each other as brothers. Congress can \n     promote fairness and efficiency in our tax code, but we \n     cannot force the rich to show compassion toward the poor. We \n     can join with our NATO allies to separate the warring \n     factions in Bosnia, as we are doing, and give them a \n     breathing space, but we cannot force Muslims, Croats and \n     Serbs to live together as brothers in peace.\n       I recently heard a story on the radio. It happened in \n     Bosnia, but I think it has meaning for all of us. A reporter \n     was covering that tragic conflict in the middle of Sarajevo, \n     and he saw a little girl shot by a sniper. The back of her \n     head had been torn away by the bullet. The reporter threw \n     down his pad and pencil, and stopped being a reporter for a \n     few minutes. He rushed to the man who was holding the child, \n     and helped them both into his car.\n       As the reporter stepped on the accelerator, racing to the \n     hospital, the man holding the bleeding child said, ``Hurry, \n     my friend, my child is still alive.''\n       A moment or two later, ``Hurry, my friend, my child is \n     still breathing.''\n       A moment later, ``Hurry, my friend, my child is still \n     warm.''\n       Finally, ``Hurry. Oh my God, my child is getting cold.''\n       When they got to the hospital, the little girl had died. As \n     the two men were in the lavatory, washing the blood off their \n     hands and their clothes, the man turned to the reporter and \n     said, ``This is a terrible task for me. I must go tell her \n     father that his child is dead. He will be heartbroken.''\n       The reporter was amazed. He looked at the grieving man and \n     said, ``I though she was your child.''\n       The man looked back and said, ``No, but aren't they all our \n     children?''\n       Aren't they all our children?\n       Yes, they are all our children. They are also God's \n     children as well, and he has entrusted us with their care in \n     Sarajevo, in Somalia, in New York City, in Los Angeles, in my \n     hometown of Perry, Georgia and here in Washington, D.C.\n       In the book of Micah, the prophet asks, ``Shall I give my \n     firstborn for my transgressions, the fruit of my body for the \n     sin of my soul?''\n       The cruelest aspect of our wars and our sins is what they \n     do to our children. Jesus said, ``Suffer the little children \n     to come unto me * * * For of such is the kingdom of God.'' \n     Too often today we shorten this commandment to--suffer--\n     little children.\n       Mrs. Clinton, thank you for the emphasis you have put on \n     children and the spotlight you have shined on our challenges. \n     You are great.\n       The world is watching America today. People around the \n     world are watching not just our President or our Congress or \n     our economy or even our military deployments. They are \n     watching our cities, our towns, and our families to see how \n     much we value our children, and whether we care enough to \n     stop America's moral and cultural erosion. Do we in America \n     in 1996 love our neighbors as ourselves as explained by Bob \n     Bennett as our theme for the morning and by Tom Lantos and \n     his personal example?\n       I do not have the answer to these questions this morning, \n     and I don't pretend to. These problems can be solved only in \n     the hearts and minds of our people and one child at a time. I \n     do, however, have a few observations.\n       The Cold War provided us with a clarity of purpose and a \n     sense of unity as a people. Our survival as a nation was at \n     stake. We came together often in fear. The challenges that \n     confront us today are far different, but the stakes are the \n     same. I pray that our children, all of our children, will be \n     the bridge that brings us together, not in fear, but in love.\n       Each year millions of our children are abused, abandoned \n     and aborted. Millions more receive little care, discipline \n     and almost no love. While we continue to debate our deeply-\n     held beliefs as to which of these sins should also be \n     violations of our criminal code, I pray that we as parents, \n     as extended families, and as communities, will come together \n     to provide love and spiritual care to every mother and to \n     every child, born or unborn.\n       Government at every level must play a role in these \n     challenges, but I do not believe that it will be the decisive \n     role. What, then, \n\n[[Page S736]]\n     are our duties as leaders, not just in the world of politics and \n     government, but in every field represented here this morning \n     and throughout our land? Like basketball stars Charles \n     Barkley and Dennis Rodman, we are role models whether we like \n     it or not.\n       I believe that the example we set, particularly for \n     our young people, may be the most important responsibility \n     of public service. We must demonstrate with our daily \n     lives that it is possible to be involved in politics and \n     still retain intellectual honesty and moral and ethical \n     behavior.\n       We are all sinners, so we will slip and we will fall. But I \n     have felt God's sustaining hand through every phase of my \n     life--growing up in Perry, Georgia, raising a family, my \n     relationship with my wife Colleen, in Senate floor debates, \n     in committee meetings, visiting our troops in war, or being \n     part of a mission for peace.\n       In the years ahead, when I think back on my public service, \n     I am certain that my most cherished memories will be those \n     moments spent with my colleagues in the Senate prayer \n     breakfasts and in my meetings with leaders from around the \n     world, usually arranged by Doug Coe, in the spirit of Jesus.\n       I have also been blessed by many friends in the Senate and \n     also a small fellowship with a group of Senate brothers like \n     the late Dewey Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma; Lawton \n     Chiles, Democrat of Florida; Pete Domenici, Republican of New \n     Mexico; Harold Hughes, Democrat of Iowa; and Mark Hatfield, \n     Republican of Oregon. No one can accuse that group of being \n     of like minds politically.\n       Yet, these brothers have listened to my problems, shared in \n     my joys, held me accountable and upheld me in their prayers. \n     Fellowship in the spirit of Jesus does amazing things. It \n     puts political and philosophical differences, even profound \n     differences, in a totally different perspective.\n       I believe that 2,000 years ago Jesus was speaking to each \n     of us when he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. And, my \n     prayer this morning for our leaders and our nation is in the \n     spirit of his words then.\n       May we who would be leaders always be aware that we must \n     first be servants. May we who compete in the arena of \n     government and politics remember that we are commanded to \n     love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. I can't \n     find any exception for the news media or our opponents. May \n     we who seek to be admired by others remember that when we \n     practice our piety before men in order to be seen by them, we \n     will have no reward in heaven. May we who have large egos and \n     great ambitions recall that the Kingdom of Heaven is promised \n     to those who are humble and poor in spirit. May we who depend \n     on publicity as our daily bread recall that when we do a \n     secret kindness to others, our Father, who knows all secrets, \n     will reward us. May the citizens whom we serve as stewards of \n     government be sensitive to the fact that we are human beings \n     subject to error and that while we need their critiques, we \n     also desperately need their prayers. May we never forget that \n     the final judgment of our tenure here on earth will not be \n     decided by a majority vote, and that an election is not \n     required to bring us home.\n       May God bless each of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S734-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S736-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S736-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2036.

A bill to improve regulation of the purchase and sale of \nmunicipal securities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        the municipal securities investor protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a bill to protect municipal \nsecurities investors.\n  The Securities Act of 1933, and the Exchange Act of 1934 were drafted \nin response to the stock market crash of 1929. Congress passed the 1933 \nand 1934 acts to prevent fraud in the securities markets and ensure \nuniform and reliable information for investors. At that time however, \nCongress decided to exempt the relatively insignificant municipal \nsecurities market from new laws, because unlike corporations, the \nStates, cities, and counties issuing bonds could back their obligations \nwith their power to raise taxes.\n  Now, with over 52,000 municipal issuers, and $1.2 trillion in \noutstanding debt obligations, the municipal securities market in one of \nthe largest unregulated markets in the world. Complex financing \narrangements are created behind the shelter of the municipal securities \nexemption. Over 70 percent of all municipal bonds are revenue bonds, \nbacked not by tax revenues, but the isolated revenues of special \nprojects like toll roads, powerplants and airports. Revenue bonds for \nmajor projects can exceed $1 billion, and are often bought and sold \ninternationally by individuals, corporations, banks, and governments. \nThese revenue bonds present many of the same investment risks as \ncorporate enterprises, but because they are municipal securities, they \nare subject only to voluntary market guidelines and the SEC's authority \nto prevent fraud.\n  Since its inception, people have questioned whether the Security and \nExchange Commission's lack of authority over the municipal securities \nmarket was adequate to protect investors. A 1993 staff report of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission examined that question and commented \non the shortcomings of the SEC's authority: ``Because of the voluntary \nnature of municipal issuers disclosure, there is a marked variance in \nthe quality of disclosure, during both the primary offering stage and \nin the secondary market.'' Other groups have echoed the SEC's \nsentiment. The Public Securities Association testified that, \n``secondary market information is difficult to come by even for \nprofessional municipal credit analysts, to say nothing of retail \ninvestors.'' The SEC staff concluded that while the SEC could take \nsteps to improve disclosure, any comprehensive changes to the existing \nsystem would require congressional action.\n  The SEC took an indirect step toward improving municipal securities \ndisclosure when it began enforcing 15c2-12 last summer. That rule \nrequires municipal securities dealers to contract with issuers for the \nprovision of disclosure documents and annual reports. These regulations \nhowever, fall short of the protections offered investors in the 1933 \nand 1934 acts because they do not give the SEC the authority to review \nmunicipal disclosures, regulate content, or require continuing \ndisclosure of financial information.\n  This bill would take additional steps toward full disclosure. Under \nmy proposal, a municipal security issuer who offers more than $1 \nbillion in related securities, but does not pledge its taxing authority \ntoward repayment of the obligations, must conform to the registration \nand continuous reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and \nthe Exchange Act of 1934. In other words, when a municipal issuer acts \nlike a corporation by pledging the revenues of a particular project \ntoward repayment of debt, it should be treated like a corporation.\n  Recent collapses in the municipal securities market underline the \nneed for congressional action:\n  New York: After issuing record levels of debt from 1974 through 1975, \nNew York City was unable to issue additional debt to cover maturing \nobligations. As a result, $4 billion of the city's short-term bonds \nlost over 45 percent of their value by December 1975, and interest \nrates for municipalities across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions \nrose 0.05 percent. The subsequent SEC investigation uncovered distorted \nfinancial information including a systematic overstatement of revenues.\n  Washington Public Power Supply System: With an initial cost estimate \nof $2.25 billion to build nuclear reactors, the Washington Public Power \nSupply System issued bonds between 1977 and 1981. By the time the final \nbond sale was issued, the project's estimated cost exceeded $12 \nbillion. Construction was halted, the WPPSS went into default, and the \nSEC began investigating the WPPSS's disclosure practices.\n  The SEC found that the WPPSS had mislead investors by not releasing \nreports about cost overruns, that underwriters failed to critically \nanalyze the information provided by the WPPSS, that bond rating \nagencies failed to conduct due diligence to confirm WPPSS information, \nand that attorneys provided unqualified legal opinions as to the \nvalidity of the financing agreements. Ultimately no enforcement action \nwas taken because several class action civil suits concluded with the \nFederal district court approving a $580 million global settlement.\n\n  Orange County: In 1994, a lack of disclosure led many investors of \nOrange County bonds to be surprised when the Orange County investment \nfund declared bankruptcy. The fund's risky investments in derivatives \nled to a loss of over $1.7 billion and put every debt obligation of the \ncounty at risk.\n  Denver International Airport: Original plans called for Denver to \nfinance its new $1.3 billion international airport with bonds backed by \noperation revenues following its October 1993 opening. The actual cost \nof the Denver International Airport [DIA] exceeded \n\n[[Page S738]]\n$4.8 billion and construction delays postponed its opening to February \n28, 1995. Questions regarding contracting practices, construction \nproblems, and delays caused by its high-technology baggage system led \nto several Federal and State investigations and class action lawsuits, \nincluding an investigation by the SEC to review Denver's knowledge and \ndisclosure of delays with the baggage system.\n  These examples demonstrate how the voluntary nature of the municipal \nmarket is failing to adequately inform investors. Whereas updated, \naccurate information is readily available to investors of corporate \nsecurities, municipal securities investors are often caught offguard \nand unaware of the risks associated with their investment. Current law \nonly encourages municipalities to comply with the voluntary guidelines \nof the Government Finance Officers Association, and only requires \ndisclosure of facts so as not to violate the antifraud provisions of \nthe 1933 and 1934 acts. In other words, municipal issuers are under no \nobligation to provide annual financial information, conform to \ngenerally accepted accounting principals, or report conflicts of \ninterest. In addition, disclosure is only necessary to avoid making a \nmaterial misstatements of fact, a standard which some commentators \nargue is met by remaining silent even as material events and facts \nchange. The end result can be uniformed investors who suffer losses \nfrom undisclosed risks.\n  This legislation is designed to protect investors by requiring \nmunicipal issuers who act like corporations to meet the same \nrequirements as corporations. Instead of receiving guidance from \nvoluntary standards, municipalities and investors would have the \nbenefit of mandatory guidelines and requirements for judging what \ninformation needs to be disclosed and what form it needs to take. \nInstead of relying on documents which can be outdated and unaudited, \ninvestors would be able to review the latest numbers when analyzing \nrisk. The end result would be greater information for investors, more \nsecurity for issuers, and lower cost for consumers.\n  In Denver's case, the requirements of the 1933 and 1934 acts could \nhave eliminated some of the problems the city now faces. Since issuers \nunder the 1933 act are strictly liable for misinformation in their \ndocuments, the city would have taken extra precautions to accurately \ndisclose information in a timely manner--a practice which could have \nprevented the facts driving the current SEC investigation. Investors \nwould be more willing to invest because they would be able to easily \nobtain current, audited financial information similar in form and \ncontent to other offerings. Finally, without the specter of pending \nlawsuits and investigations, the cost of borrowing would go down saving \nmillions of dollars for the city and allowing it to lower rents to \nairlines. Lower rents in turn would allow the airlines to pass savings \non to consumers in the form of lower ticket prices.\n  As the Denver example shows, everyone can benefit from the accurate \nand continuous disclosure required of corporations by the securities \nacts. If municipalities are going to operate like corporations, and \nback securities with revenues from specific projects, then the \ninvesting public deserves to receive complete and updated information \nregarding those revenues. This bill takes the commonsense approach of \nbringing municipalities who offer revenue bonds totaling more than $1 \nbillion, under the same rules and regulations as faced by private \ncompanies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to \nprevent the canceling of annuities to certain divorced spouses of \nworkers whose widows elect to receive lump sum payments; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the railroad retirement amendment act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf \n\n[[Page S739]]\nof Valoris Carlson of Aberdeen, SD, and the handful of others like her \nwhose lives have been terribly disrupted. This legislation will right a \nwrong that was not due to any error or deception on Valoris' part, but \ndue to an administrative error by the Railroad Retirement Board [RRB].\n  In 1984 Valoris, as the divorced spouse of a deceased railroad \nemployee, applied for a survivor's pension. The RRB failed to check if \na lump sum withdrawal had previously been made on the account at the \ntime of her former spouse's death--even though Valoris clearly stated \non her application that there was a surviving widow. In fact, a lump \nsum payment had been made, but not identified. The RRB began paying \nValoris $587 per month in 1984 and continued to pay her benefits for 11 \nyears. Only recently did they discover that an error had been made over \na decade ago.\n  Not until 1995 was Valoris told she was not eligible for the pension \nshe was awarded in 1984. Had the RRB reviewed their records, they would \nhave seen that a lump-sum payment had been made on that account. \nValoris, who was married for 26 years, lost her eligibility to the \nwidow of the railroad worker who had been married to him for only 3 \nyears. Valoris made an honest application for benefits. The RRB failed \nto do their job properly, resulting in 11 years of ``overpayments'' to \nValoris.\n  These payments affected Valoris' planning for the future. Valoris \nplanned her retirement on that modest sum of $587. Had she been told \nshe was not eligible for benefits, she would have worked longer to \nbuild up her own Social Security benefits. Her railroad divorced \nwidow's pension has been her only steady income. She has picked up a \nfew dollars here and there by renting out rooms in her home, but \nwithout her pension income, Valoris does not know how she will live.\n  The bill I am introducing today will address the errors made by the \nRRB that have disrupted the life of Valoris Carlson and others like \nher. The RRB advises that 17 other widows are similarly situated, and \ntheir pensions would also be restored by this bill.\n  The bill, which was developed with technical assistance from the RRB, \nwould allow the 18 women impacted by the RRB's administrative error to \nbegin receiving their monthly benefits again. It requires them to repay \nthe lump sum, but they are allowed to do so through a marginal \nwithholding from their monthly benefit. The monthly withholding can be \nwaived if it would cause excessive hardship for a widow.\n  Mr. President, I will work to enact this legislation as quickly as \npossible to restore the benefits to those women who are now suffering \nas a result of the Government's mistakes. There is no excuse for \nfurther delay in providing these Americans with benefits they were led \nto expect by the RRB.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Retirement \n     Amendment Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF DIVORCED SPOUSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6(c) of the Railroad Retirement \n     Act of 1974 is amended--\n       (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (1), by inserting \n     ``(other then to a survivor in the circumstances described in \n     paragraph (3))'' after ``no further benefits shall be paid''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), \n     benefits shall be paid to a survivor who--\n       ``(A) is a divorced wife; and\n       ``(B) through administrative error received benefits \n     otherwise precluded by the making of a lump sum payment under \n     this section to widow;\n\n     if that divorced wife makes an election to repay to the Board \n     the lump sum payment. The Board may withhold up to 10 percent \n     of each benefit amount paid after the date of the enactment \n     of this paragraph toward such reimbursement. The Board may \n     waive such repayment to the extent the Board determines it \n     would cause an unjust financial hardship for the \n     beneficiary.''.\n       (b) Application of Amendment.--The amendment made by this \n     section shall apply with respect to any benefits paid before \n     the date of enactment of this Act as well as to benefits \n     payable on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1553. A bill to provide that members of the Armed Forces \nperforming services for the peacekeeping effort in the Republic of \nBosnia and Herzegovina shall be entitled to certain tax benefits in the \nsame manner as if such services were performed in a combat zone; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                         tax relief legislation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we continue to debate a balanced \nbudget, 20,000 of our service men and women are participating in \nOperation Joint Endeavor in war torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The bill I am introducing today is designed to provide some peace of \nmind to our troops and their families. This bill is identical to H.R. \n2778 introduced earlier this month by Congressman Bunning from \nKentucky. Specifically, this bill would provide a tax exemption and \nadditional benefits for our service men and women serving in Bosnia, \nwhich is but a small gesture showing our support.\n  I hope and pray that this operation will remain a peaceful \ndeployment, but the fact remains that the lives of our military \npersonnel are continually at risk from landmines, sniper fire, or \naccident in this peacekeeping operation.\n  I know personally the character of the Americans who take up arms to \ndefend our Nation's interests and to advance our democratic values. I \nknow of all the battles, all the grim tests of courage and character, \nthat have made our Armed Forces the envy of our allies and enemies \nalike.\n  Our people are our greatest asset. They make sacrifices day after \nday, and are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Without the ``can \ndo'' attitude our military personnel persistently display, we would not \nhave the finest military force in the world today. As our troops carry \nout their assigned duties in Bosnia, we must do our part to let them \nknow how much their dedication and efforts are appreciated by the \nAmerican people.\n  Because it is a peacekeeping mission, Bosnia has not been declared a \n``combat zone'' by the Department of Defense. Had the designation been \nmade, tax exemptions and other benefits, as well as hazardous duty pay, \nwould automatically be invoked without this bill. This bill would \nensure that tax and certain other benefits are provided. I want to \npoint out, however, that it does not authorize hazardous duty pay which \nwould entail a very significant cost. In these times of fiscal \nconstraint, we must take a conscientious look at the financial impact \non the Federal budget of this initiative and how this standard may be \napplied to future peacekeeping or other non-combat missions.\n  I hope that the potential danger to our troops remains low. If, \nhowever, any U.S. soldiers were to be fatally injured while serving in \nthis peacekeeping operation, this bill would provide additional \nbenefits to their families.\n  Mr. President, the men and women participating in Operation Restore \nHope in Somalia did not receive these benefits, and unfortunately some \nof those men lost their lives in a mission gone tragically awry. This \nbill is intended to help relieve some of the financial burdens on our \nservice men and women caused by their deployment and allay the economic \nconcerns of their families. I believe this measure deserves our careful \nand full review, and I intend to seek expeditious consideration of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  s. 1554. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nclarify the exemption for houseparents from the minimum wage and \nmaximum hours requirements of that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       the fair labor standards act of 1938 amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto provide a specific exemption for houseparents from the minimum wage \nand overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This bill \nwill provide significant relief to orphanages and group homes \nthroughout the United States.\n  Houseparents are men and women who work and live in a group home \nsetting to care for, nurture, and supervise children. These children \nmay live at \n\n[[Page S740]]\nthe home for any number of reasons. They may be abused, neglected, \norphaned, or homeless. The importance of houseparents in providing a \nfamily-like, healthy environment for these children cannot be \noverstated. It is the love, hard-work, and dedication of these people \nthat enables the children at the home to enjoy a caring and stable \nenvironment.\n  As compensation for their services, houseparents receive a very \nunconventional package of benefits, including a fixed annual salary, \nfood, housing, and transportation. The Department of Labor, however, \nhas determined that these men and women are also entitled to overtime \nwages.\n  For example, in Mississippi, the Department of Labor determined that \nsince houseparents at a particular home answered long-distance calls, \nopened out-of-State mail, and took the children on trips across the \nState line that houseparents were engaged in commerce and therefore \ncovered by the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. This interpretation has threatened the houseparent \nsystem by placing an unbearable burden on the extremely limited \nresources of non-profit group homes.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will remedy this situation by \nproviding nonprofit group homes with a specific exemption for \nhouseparents from minimum wage and overtime requirements. Without such \nan exemption, these homes would be forced to use a shift model of \nemployment where quasi-houseparents work 8 hour shifts to care for the \nchildren. This alternative would not furnish the same family-like \nsetting for these children that the houseparent system provides.\n  It is important to note that this measure creates only a very narrow \nexemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act. This bill would only \nexempt those houseparents who meet the following criteria: First, the \nhouseparents must be employed by nonprofit homes; second, the group \nhome in question must be the children's primary residence; third, the \nhouseparents must reside with the children at the home for a minimum of \n72 hours per week; and fourth, the houseparent must receive board and \nlodging from the home, free of charge, and be compensated, on a crash \nbasis, at an annual rate of not less than $8,000.\n  This legislation will allow nonprofit group homes to continue to \nprovide the best possible care for children. I hope my colleagues will \ncarefully consider it and join me in support of its enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1556. A bill to prohibit economic espionage, to provide for the \nprotection of United States proprietary economic information in \ninterstate and foreign commerce, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the economic espionage act of 1996\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have a problem in America today: \nThe systematic pilfering of our country's economic secrets by our \ntrading partners which undermines our economic security. It would not \nbe unfair to say that America has become a full-service shopping mall \nfor foreign governments and companies who want to jump start their \nbusinesses with stolen trade secrets.\n  Sadly, we are under-unequipped to fight this new war. Our laws have \nglaring gaps, allowing people to steal our economic information with \nvitual impunity.\n  So I introduce the Industrial Espionage Act of 1996 with Senator \nSpecter. I am also pleased to cosponsor with Senator Specter the \nEconomic Security Act of 1996. Together these laws will enable Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies to catch and vigorously prosecute anyone who \ntries to steal proprietary information from American companies. Our two \nmeasures should be read together as a unified approach to the problem. \nThey are not panaceas, but they are an effort to deal with this problem \nsystematically and comprehensively. The Department of Justice and the \nFBI have also been extremely helpful in drafting these pieces of \nlegislation, and we look forward to working with them as we move these \nmeasures forward.\n  Mr. President, businesses spend huge amounts of money, time, and \nthought developing proprietary economic information--their customer \nlists, pricing schedules, business agreements, manufacturing processes. \nThis information is literally a business's lifeblood. And stealing it \nis the equivalent of shooting a company in the head. But these thefts \nhave a far broader impact than on the American company that falls \nvictim to an economic spy. The economic strength, competitiveness, and \nsecurity of our country relies upon the ability of industry to compete \nwithout unfair interference from foreign governments and from their own \ndomestic competitors. Without freedom from economic sabotage, our \ncompanies loose their hard-earned advantages and their competitive \nedge.\n  The problem is not new. But with expanding technology and a growing \nglobal economy, economic espionage is entering its boom years. American \ncompanies have estimated that in 1992, they lost $1.8 billion from the \ntheft of their trade secrets. A 1993 study by the American Society for \nIndustrial Security found a 260-percent increase in the theft of \nproprietary information since 1985. And the theft of these secrets is \nnot random and disorganized. The press has reported that one government \nstudy of 173 nations discovered that 57 of them were trying to get \nadvanced technologies from American companies. The French intelligence \nservice has even admitted to forming a special unit devoted to \nobtaining confidential information from American companies.\n  Let me give you a few examples. Just last year, a former employee of \ntwo major computer companies admitted to stealing vital information on \nthe manufacture of microchips and selling it to China, Cuba, and Iran. \nFor almost a decade, he copied manufacturing specifications--\ninformation worth millions of dollars. And armed with it, the Chinese, \nCubans, and Iranians have been able to close the gap on our technology \nleads. Late last year, the FBI arrested this man and charged him with \nthe interstate transportation of stolen property and mail fraud. It \nappears that the charges may be a bit of a stretch because he did not \nactually steal tangible property. He only stole ideas.\n  Not all of the theft is sponsored by foreign governments. Domestic \ntheft is as reprehensible and as threatening as theft by foreign \ngovernments. For example, in Arizona, an engineer for an automobile air \nbag manufacturer was arrested in 1993 for selling manufacturing \ndesigns, strategies, and plans. He asked the company's competition for \nmore than half a million dollars--to be paid in small bills. And he \nsent potential buyers a laundry list of information they could buy: \n$500 for the company's capital budget plan; $1,000 for a piece of \nequipment; $6,000 for planning and product documents.\n  Sadly, current civil remedies are inadequate to deal with these \nproblems. Although many companies can privately sue those who have \nstolen from them, these private remedies are too little, too late. A \nprivate suit against a foreign company or government often just goes \nnowhere, and the company continues to use the stolen information \nwithout pause.\n  Similarly, our current criminal laws are not specifically targeted at \nprotection of proprietary economic information. Most of our Federal \ntheft statutes deal with tangible property and not intellectual \nproperty. Federal prosecutors have done a valiant job finding laws they \ncan use against these people, but they need something stronger and more \ncoherent than what they have gerry-rigged.\n  Mr. President, the Industrial Espionage Act and the Economic Security \nAct provide the solution we need. These measures are simple, \nstraightforward, and effective. They carefully define proprietary \neconomic information--the data that corporations privately develop and \nneed to maintain in secrecy. People who steal that information in order \nto harm the business that rightfully owns and developed it are subject \nto criminal penalties. They can serve up to 15 years in jail. And if \nthe theft is sponsored by a foreign government, the penalties are even \nharsher. Moreover, the bills include forfeiture provisions, so that \npeople will not benefit from their illegal acts. They authorize the \nPresident to impose sanctions on countries that engage in these \nactivities. And they assure companies that their proprietary \ninformation will \n\n[[Page S741]]\nnot seep out during a criminal persecution.\n  We need to take steps to stem the flow of information out of our \ncountry. We need a new law that definitively and harshly punishes \nanyone who steals information from American companies. Over the coming \nmonths, these measures will provide a framework for our discussions \nabout the best way to solve this problem, and we plan to hold hearings \non them in both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl \nas a cosponsor of this bill to make theft of proprietary information a \ncrime. Senator Kohl is also a cosponsor of a bill I have introduced to \ncover economic espionage by foreign governments or those acting on \ntheir behalf and this bill is designed to protect that same vital \neconomic information from theft by nongovernmental entities and \nindividuals.\n  While economic espionage by foreign governments presents a clear \nissue of national concern, the economic cost of industrial espionage by \ndomestic and nongovernment-owned foreign corporations may be even \ngreater. Federal law already provides some sanctions to protect \ntechnology and innovation within the United States. For example, we \naccord protection to patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The Federal \nGovernment will not enter into a contract with a bidder who has inside \ninformation of another bidder's price. There are also laws in some \nStates that specifically address the theft of proprietary information.\n  These laws may not, however, be adequate. Thus, I am also joining \nSenator Kohl in cosponsoring legislation to provide criminal penalties \nin title 18 of the United States Code for cases in which corporations \nand individuals, foreign or domestic, steal proprietary information \nfrom U.S. entities. While the bill I have introduced amending the \nNational Security Act of 1947 focuses on our Nation's economic security \nagainst foreign governments, similar arguments can be made that \nprotection is also needed for domestic economic interests from theft by \nnongovernmental sources. Moreover, even where there are strong \nindications that a foreign government is behind the theft of \nproprietary information, it may not be possible in all cases to prove \nsuch government involvement.\n  The normal recourse for protecting proprietary information from theft \nby private sector sources is through civil remedies governed by State \nlaw. Some businesses and Federal law enforcement agencies, however, \nbelieve that current State laws are inadequate and fail to provide \nremedies, particularly with respect to the kind of intangible \nproprietary information that is typical in today's computer age. They \nargue that comprehensive federal criminal sanctions are needed at this \ntime to provide an adequate deterrent.\n  While I believe there are legitimate questions about the need for \nfederal criminal penalties in this context, I am also convinced the \nissue needs to be considered. It may be that after thorough review, \ncriminal penalties are the best means of deterring the misappropriation \nof proprietary information by individuals or business competitors. On \nthe other hand, we may determine that a more efficient response would \nbe to create a federal civil cause of action or to leave it to State \nlaw to develop sanctions against such theft if not committed by, or \ndone on behalf of, a foreign government.\n  As part of this effort to address the economic threat from the theft \nof proprietary information from U.S. businesses, I therefore believe we \nneed to consider how to address such thefts when carried out by the \nprivate sector. As a result, I am cosponsoring this second bill, with \nthe expectation that it will generate discussion and debate and assist \nus in developing the best approach to this problem. I look forward to \nworking with all interested parties to reach such a result.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1557. A bill to prohibit economic espionage, to provide for the \nprotection of United States vital proprietary economic information, and \nfor other purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n\n                   THE ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Kohl, entitled the ``Economic Security \nAct of 1996,'' which amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \nprotect against the theft of vital proprietary economic information by \nor for foreign governments.\n  The bill would punish those who steal vital proprietary economic \ninformation from a U.S. owner for the benefit of a foreign government \nor a corporation, institution, instrumentality, or agent that is owned \nor guided by a foreign government. It provides penalties of up to \n$500,000 in fines or 25 years in prison, except that corporations \nworking on behalf of a foreign government can be fined up to \n$10,000,000. The law would ensure that fruits of the espionage would be \nforfeited, and that victims would receive some restitution from funds \nrecovered. This bill also provides for a ban for up to 5 years on the \nimportation into, or export from, the United States of any product \nproduced, made, assembled, or manufactured by a person convicted under \nthis provision.\n  To address concerns by industry that criminal proceedings might \nresult in the disclosure of the very trade secret the prosecution is \naimed at protecting, the bill also gives courts authority to enter \nprotective orders and take any other such measures as may be necessary, \nconsistent with the applicable rules and laws. It also provides for an \ninterlocutory appeal by the United States from a decision or order of a \ndistrict court authorizing the disclosure of vital proprietary economic \ninformation.\n  The bill provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction where the \noffender is a U.S. person or the victim of the offense is a U.S. owner \nand the offense was intended to have, or had, a direct or substantial \neffect in the United States. In addition, the bill adds this newly \ncreated crime to the list of offenses in title 18, chapter 119, of the \nUnited States Code--Wire and Electronic Communications Interception and \nInterception of Oral Communications--so that it may be investigated \nwith authorized wire, oral, or electronic intercepts.\n  We have drafted this new provision as an amendment to the National \nSecurity Act of 1947 to emphasize the importance of this issue to the \nnational security of our Nation. Anyone who doubts that this is a \nnational security issue need only stop to consider why foreign \ngovernments would devote so much effort to obtaining this information \nfrom U.S. companies. The reality is that U.S. economic and \ntechnological information may be far more valuable to a foreign \ngovernment than most of the information that is classified in the \nUnited States today. The March 1990 and February 1995 national security \nstrategies published by the White House focus on economic security as \nan integral part not only of U.S. national interest but also of \nnational security.\n  Economic espionage by foreign governments targeting U.S. industry and \ninnovation is an issue the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has \nbeen examining for some time. The Committee has held a number of \nhearings which addressed this issue and has met extensively with the \nintelligence and law enforcement communities. In 1992, then-Director of \nCentral Intelligence Robert M. Gates told the Committee:\n\n       We know that some foreign intelligence services have turned \n     from politics to economics and that the United States is \n     their prime target. We have cases of moles being planted in \n     U.S. high-tech companies. We have cases of U.S. businessmen \n     abroad being subjected to bugging, to room searches, and the \n     like * * * [W]e are giving a very high priority to fighting \n     it.\n\n  This reflects a shift from the traditional counterintelligence \nefforts directed at military, ideological, or subversive threats to \nnational security. Beginning as early as 1990, the Intelligence and \nCounterintelligence Communities have been directed to detect and deter \nforeign intelligence targeting of U.S. economic and technological \ninterests, including efforts to obtain U.S. proprietary information \nfrom companies and research institutions that form our strategic \nindustrial base. These counterintelligence efforts, however, must be \ncomplemented by, and carefully coordinated with, a coherent and \nrigorous law enforcement effort. It is to strengthen this aspect of the \nfight against economic espionage that I introduce this bill today. \n\n[[Page S742]]\n\n\n  Some foreign governments have been quite open about the importance \nthey attach to obtaining U.S. commercial secrets. Former French \nIntelligence Director Pierre Marion, for example, was quoted in a \nrecent Foreign Affairs article as saying about the French-United States \nrelationship: ``In economics, we are competitors, not allies. America \nhas the most technical information of relevance. It is easily \naccessible. So naturally your country will receive the most attention \nfrom the intelligence services.''\n  It is important to emphasize that no one country can be singled out \nfor engaging in economic espionage. While there are a handful of well-\npublicized incidents involving a few countries, the problem is actually \nmuch more widespread. FBI tells us that 23 countries are being actively \ninvestigated and that there has been a 100 percent increase in the \nnumber of investigative matters relating to economic espionage in the \nUnited States during the past year--from 400 to 800. Thus, this bill is \nnot aimed at any one country, or even a handful of countries. It is \ndesigned to address a widespread threat from a broad spectrum of \ncountries, including traditional counterintelligence adversaries and \ntraditional allies.\n  Last year, the Congress included in the Intelligence Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 1995 a requirement that the President submit an \nannual report on the activities of foreign governments to obtain \ncommercial secrets from U.S. companies and how the U.S. Government \ncounters this threat. The Intelligence Committee received the first \nreport in July 1995, accompanied by a classified annex.\n  According to the report, prepared by the National Counterintelligence \nCenter in coordination with relevant agencies, ``economic and \ntechnological information is often not specifically protected by \nFederal laws, making it difficult to prosecute thefts of propriety \ntechnology or intellectual property. Law enforcement efforts instead \nmust rely on less specific criminal laws--such as espionage, fraud and \nstolen property, and export statutes--to build prosecutable cases.'' At \nour request, the FBI has provided some examples of the difficulties \ncaused by this patchwork of laws.\n  According to the Bureau, there have been three specific declinations \nof prosecution over the past year. In the first, passage to a foreign \npower of proprietary economic information was declined for lack of a \nspecific statute. In the second case, the unauthorized disclosure of a \nconfidential U.S. Trade Representative document was not prosecuted \nbecause the document was not considered to contain ``national defense \ninformation'' as required by the espionage statute. In a third case, a \nforeign government-owned corporation attempted to use its position of \npower after a merger to gain access to proprietary economic information \ndespite a specific prohibition in the sales agreement which would have \nprovided for a ``Chinese wall'' between the foreign government \ncorporation and the information. Again, the U.S. Attorney declined to \nprosecute because of the lack of a specific statutory basis. These \nexamples do not include cases that were not fully investigated because \nof the lack of adequate statutory basis.\n  A legal review by the Administration has shown that there is \ncurrently no specific criminal statute that would apply to many of the \n800 cases involving 22 foreign countries currently being investigated.\n  The National Counterintelligence Center Report states that ``the \naggregate losses that can mount as a result of [Foreign economic \nespionage] efforts can reach billions of dollars per year constituting \na serious national security concern.'' Determining the full qualitative \nand quantitative scope and impact of economic espionage is difficult. \nIndustry victims have reported the loss of hundreds of millions of \ndollars, lost jobs, and lost market share. However, U.S. industry may \nin fact be under-reporting these occurrences because of the negative \nimpact publicity of a loss could have on stock values and customers' \nconfidence, as well as the risk of broader exposure of the trade secret \nitself.\n  The industries that have been the targets in most cases of economic \nespionage, according to this report, include those ``of strategic \ninterest to the Untied States because they produce classified products \nfor the Government, produce dual use technology used in both the public \nand private sectors, and are responsible for leading-edge technologies, \ncritical to maintaining U.S. economic security.''\n  Mr. President, these are complex issues and I do not assume that this \nbill represents the prefect solution. However, I believe this bill \nrepresents a reasonable and carefully tailored approach to addressing \nan issue of tremendous importance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 219\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was invested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of \n     America drew heavily upon the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the founders of the modern Greek state modeled \n     their government after that of the United States in an effort \n     to best imitate their ancient democracy;\n       Whereas Greece is one of only three nations in the world, \n     beyond the former British Empire, that has been allied with \n     the United States in every major international conflict this \n     century;;\n       Whereas 1996 will mark the historic first official state \n     visit to the United States of an elected head of state of \n     Greece;\n       Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our two nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 1996 marks the 175th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our two great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That March 25, 1996 is designated as ``Greek \n     Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and \n     American Democracy''. The President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nto designate March 25, 1996, as ``Greek Independence Day: A Celebration \nof Greek and American Democracy.''\n  One hundred and seventy-five years ago, the Greeks began the \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient \nGreeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme \npower to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew \nheavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient \nGreece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson \nproclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for \nthe light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, \nthen, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of \ntheir efforts to return to that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in all areas of art, philosophy, science, \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, \nwith overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S743-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 220--IN RECOGNITION OF RONALD REAGAN'S 85TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Warner) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

A health plan issuer, agent, \n     broker or any other individual or entity engaged in the sale \n     of insurance may not underwrite a cooperative.\n       (b) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--If a group described in subsection (a), \n     desires to form a health plan purchasing cooperative in \n     accordance with this section and such group appropriately \n     notifies the State and the Secretary of such desire, the \n     State, upon a determination that such group meets the \n     requirements of this section, shall certify the group as a \n     health plan purchasing cooperative. The State shall make a \n     determination of whether such group meets the requirements of \n     this section in a timely fashion. Each such cooperative shall \n     also be registered with the Secretary.\n       (2) State refusal to certify.--If a State fails to \n     implement a program for certifying health plan purchasing \n     cooperatives in accordance with the standards under this \n     title, the Secretary shall certify and oversee the operations \n     of such cooperatives in such State.\n       (3) Interstate cooperatives.--For purposes of this section, \n     a health plan purchasing cooperative operating in more than \n     one State shall be certified by the State in which the \n     cooperative is domiciled.

For purposes of this \n     subsection, a cooperative shall be considered to be domiciled \n     in the State in which most of the members of the cooperative \n     reside.\n       (c) Board of Directors.--\n       (1) In general.--Each health plan purchasing cooperative \n     shall be governed by a Board of Directors that shall be \n     responsible for ensuring the performance of the duties of the \n     cooperative under this section. The Board shall be composed \n     of a broad cross-section of representatives of employers, \n     employees, and individuals participating in the cooperative. \n     A health plan issuer, agent, broker or any other individual \n     or entity engaged in the sale of individual health plans or \n     group health plans may not hold or control any right to vote \n     with respect to a cooperative.\n       (2) Limitation on compensation.--A health plan purchasing \n     cooperative may not provide compensation to members of the \n     Board of Directors. The cooperative may provide \n     reimbursements to such members for the reasonable and \n     necessary expenses incurred by the members in the performance \n     of their duties as members of the Board.\n       (3) Conflict of interest.--No member of the Board of \n     Directors (or family members of such members) nor any \n     management personnel of the cooperative may be employed by, \n     be a consultant for, be a member of the board of directors \n     of, be affiliated with an agent of, or otherwise be a \n     representative of any health plan issuer, health care \n     provider, or agent or broker. Nothing in the preceding \n     sentence shall limit a member of the Board from purchasing \n     coverage offered through the cooperative. This paragraph \n     shall not apply to any management personnel who is not \n     employed by, or getting any remuneration from, a health plan \n     issuer offering a group health or individual health plan, but \n     who, as a result of performing marketing functions as \n     required under subsection (e)(1)(E), is mandated by State law \n     to be licensed as an agent or broker.\n       (d) Membership and Marketing Area.--\n       (1) Membership.--A health plan purchasing cooperative may \n     establish limits on the maximum size of employers who may \n     become members of the cooperative, and may determine whether \n     to permit individuals to become members.

CONSERVATION OF PRIVATE GRAZING LAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) privately owned grazing land constitutes nearly \\1/2\\ \n     of the non-Federal land of the United States and is basic to \n     the environmental, social, and economic stability of rural \n     communities;\n       (2) privately owned grazing land contains a complex set of \n     interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;\n       (3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed \n     cover type in the United States and contributes significantly \n     to the quality and quantity of water available for all of the \n     many uses of the land;\n       (4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive \n     wildlife habitat in the United States;\n       (5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for \n     improved nutrient management from land application of animal \n     manures and other by-product nutrient resources;\n       (6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to \n     continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems \n     arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or \n     conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and \n     economic demands;\n       (7) new science and technology must continually be made \n     available in a practical manner so owners and managers of \n     private grazing land may make informed decisions concerning \n     vital grazing land resources;\n       (8) agencies of the Department of Agriculture with private \n     grazing land responsibilities are the agencies that have the \n     expertise and experience to provide technical assistance, \n     education, and research to owners and managers of private \n     grazing land for the long-term productivity and ecological \n     health of grazing land;\n       (9) although competing demands on private grazing land \n     resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private \n     owners and managers of private grazing land is currently \n     limited and does not meet the demand and basic need for \n     adequately sustaining or enhancing the private grazing lands \n     resources; and\n       (10) privately owned grazing land can be enhanced to \n     provide many benefits to all Americans through voluntary \n     cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local \n     conservation districts, and the agencies of the Department of \n     Agriculture responsible for providing assistance to owners \n     and managers of land and to conservation districts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a \n     coordinated technical, educational, and related assistance \n     program to conserve and enhance private grazing land \n     resources and provide related benefits to all citizens of the \n     United States by--\n       (1) establishing a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local grazing conservation program for management \n     of private grazing land;\n       (2) strengthening technical, educational, and related \n     assistance programs that provide assistance to owners and \n     managers of private grazing land;\n       (3) conserving and improving wildlife habitat on private \n     grazing land;\n       (4) conserving and improving fish habitat and aquatic \n     systems through grazing land conservation treatment;\n       (5) protecting and improving water quality;\n       (6) improving the dependability and consistency of water \n     supplies;\n       (7) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush \n     encroachment problems on private grazing land; and\n       (8) integrating conservation planning and management \n     decisions by owners and managers of private grazing land, on \n     a voluntary basis.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Private grazing land.--The term ``private grazing \n     land'' means privately owned, State-owned, tribally-owned, \n     and any other non-federally owned rangeland, pastureland, \n     grazed forest land, and hay land.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, acting through the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service.\n       (d) Private Grazing Land Conservation Assistance.--\n       (1) Assistance to grazing landowners and others.--Subject \n     to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall \n     establish a voluntary program to provide technical, \n     educational, and related assistance to owners and managers of \n     private grazing land and public agencies, through local \n     conservation districts, to enable the landowners, managers, \n     and public agencies to voluntarily carry out activities that \n     are consistent with this section, including--\n       (A) maintaining and improving private grazing land and the \n     multiple values and uses that depend on private grazing land;\n       (B) implementing grazing land management technologies;\n       (C) managing resources on private grazing land, including--\n       (i) planning, managing, and treating private grazing land \n     resources;\n       (ii) ensuring the long-term sustainability of private \n     grazing land resources;\n       (iii) harvesting, processing, and marketing private grazing \n     land resources; and\n       (iv) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush \n     encroachment problems;\n       (D) protecting and improving the quality and quantity of \n     water yields from private grazing land;\n       (E) maintaining and improving wildlife and fish habitat on \n     private grazing land;\n       (F) enhancing recreational opportunities on private grazing \n     land;\n       (G) maintaining and improving the aesthetic character of \n     private grazing lands; and\n       (H) identifying the opportunities and encouraging the \n     diversification of private grazing land enterprises.\n       (2) Program elements.--\n       (A) Funding.--The program under paragraph (1) shall be \n     funded through a specific line-item in the annual \n     appropriations for the Natural Resources Conservation \n     Service.\n       (B) Technical assistance and education.--Personnel of the \n     Department of Agriculture trained in pasture and range \n     management shall be made available under the \n\n[[Page S784]]\n     program to deliver and coordinate technical assistance and education to \n     owners and managers of private grazing land, at the request \n     of the owners and managers.\n       (e) Grazing Technical Assistance Self-Help.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) there is a severe lack of technical assistance for \n     grazing producers;\n       (B) the Federal budget precludes any significant expansion, \n     and may force a reduction of, current levels of technical \n     support; and\n       (C) farmers and ranchers have a history of cooperatively \n     working together to address common needs in the promotion of \n     their products and in the drainage of wet areas through \n     drainage districts.\n       (2) Establishment of grazing demonstration.--The Secretary \n     may establish 2 grazing management demonstration districts at \n     the recommendation of the Grazing Lands Conservation \n     Initiative Steering Committee.\n       (3) Procedure.--\n       (A) Proposal.--Within a reasonable time after the \n     submission of a request of an organization of farmers or \n     ranchers engaged in grazing, the Secretary shall propose that \n     a grazing management district be established.\n       (B) Funding.--The terms and conditions of the funding and \n     operation of the grazing management district shall be \n     proposed by the producers.\n       (C) Approval.--The Secretary shall approve the proposal if \n     the Secretary determines that the proposal--\n       (i) is reasonable;\n       (ii) will promote sound grazing practices; and\n       (iii) contains provisions similar to the provisions \n     contained in the promotion orders in effect on the effective \n     date of this section.\n       (D) Area included.--The area proposed to be included in a \n     grazing management district shall be determined by the \n     Secretary on the basis of a petition by farmers or ranchers.\n       (E) Authorization.--The Secretary may use authority under \n     the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), \n     reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing \n     Agreement Act of 1937, to operate, on a demonstration basis, \n     a grazing management district.\n       (F) Activities.--The activities of a grazing management \n     district shall be scientifically sound activities, as \n     determined by the Secretary in consultation with a technical \n     advisory committee composed of ranchers, farmers, and \n     technical experts.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section--\n       (1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1996;\n       (2) $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1997;

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of \n     the human diet;\n       (2) the production and processing of popcorn plays a \n     significant role in the economy of the United States in that \n     popcorn is processed by several popcorn processors, \n     distributed through wholesale and retail outlets, and \n     consumed by millions of people throughout the United States \n     and foreign countries;\n       (3) popcorn must be of high quality, readily available, \n     handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the \n     benefits of popcorn are available to the people of the United \n     States;\n       (4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and \n     uses and the development of new markets and uses for popcorn \n     are vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned \n     with marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, \n     as well as to the agricultural economy of the United States;\n       (5) the cooperative development, financing, and \n     implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, \n     research, consumer information, and industry information is \n     necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and\n       (6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and \n     popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce \n     directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in the \n     public interest to authorize the establishment, through the \n     exercise of the powers provided in this subtitle, of an \n     orderly procedure for developing, financing (through adequate \n     assessments on unpopped popcorn processed domestically), and \n     carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated \n     program of promotion, research, consumer information, and \n     industry information designed to--\n       (1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the \n     marketplace; and\n       (2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and \n     uses for popcorn.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--\n       (1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn \n     products in a manner that--\n       (A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual \n     share of a producer or processor of the market;\n       (B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising \n     or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand \n     name or trade name popcorn products; and\n       (C) authorizes and funds programs that result in government \n     speech promoting government objectives; and\n       (2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn \n     promotion, research, consumer information, and industry \n     information.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--This subtitle treats \n     processors equitably. Nothing in this subtitle--\n       (1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the \n     entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the \n     domestic market; or\n       (2) provides for the control of production or otherwise \n     limits the right of any individual processor to produce \n     popcorn.\n\n     SEC. 703.

COMMODITY PROMOTION AND EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the national public interest and vital to the \n     welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to \n     expand and develop markets for agricultural commodities \n     through generic, industry-funded promotion programs;\n       (2) the programs play a unique role in advancing the demand \n     for agricultural commodities, since the programs increase the \n     total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and \n     all producers;\n       (3) the programs complement branded advertising \n     initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the market share \n     of individual competitors;\n       (4) the programs are of particular benefit to small \n     producers, who may lack the resources or market power to \n     advertise on their own;\n       (5) the programs do not impede the branded advertising \n     efforts of individual firms but instead increase market \n     demand by methods that each individual entity would not have \n     the incentive to employ;\n       (6) the programs, paid for by the producers who directly \n     reap the benefits of the programs, provide a unique \n     opportunity for agricultural producers to inform consumers \n     about their products;\n       (7) it is important to ensure that the programs be carried \n     out in an effective and coordinated manner that is designed \n     to strengthen the position of the commodities in the \n     marketplace and to maintain and expand the markets and uses \n     of the commodities; and\n       (8) independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the \n     programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs \n     are met.\n       (b) Independent Evaluations.--Except as otherwise provided \n     by law, and at such intervals as the Secretary of Agriculture \n     may determine, but not more frequently than every 3 years or \n     3 years after the establishment of a program, the Secretary \n     shall require that each industry-funded generic promotion \n     program authorized by Federal law for an agricultural \n     commodity shall provide for an independent evaluation of the \n     program and the effectiveness of the program. The evaluation \n     may include an analysis of benefits, costs, and the efficacy \n     of promotional and research efforts under the program. The \n     evaluation shall be funded from industry assessments and made \n     available to the public.\n       (c) Administrative Costs.--The Secretary shall provide to \n     Congress annually information on administrative expenses on \n     programs referred to in subsection (b).\n                       TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS\n    Subtitle A--Options Pilot Programs and Risk Management Education\n\n     SEC. 801.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill \nand would like to clarify that the language contained in the proposed \nlegislation adds to the types of retirement income eligible for \nexemption. This language clearly intends to exempt from tax \nnonqualified deferred compensation that constitutes legitimate \nretirement income. Because it affects retirement income, only income \nform qualified retirement plans and nonqualified retirement plans that \nare paid out over at least 10 years, or from a mirror-type nonqualified \nplan after termination of employment, is exempt from State taxation.\n  The language does not prohibit states from imposing an income tax on \nnon-residents' regular wages or compensation. Cash bonuses or other \ncompensation arrangements that defer the receipt of salary, bonuses, \nand other types of wage-related compensation that are not paid out over \nat least 10 years or from a mirror-type nonqualified retirement plan \nare not exempt from State taxation. One example would be if a salary is \nearned in a State by an individual, whether a resident or nonresident, \nbut is voluntarily deferred for a few years until the individual exits \nthe State, and then is paid over in a lump-sum, even while the \nindividual is still employed by the company, that kind of payment \nshould not qualify for exemption from nonresident taxation of pensions. \nIt is the intent of this bill to permit the States to continue to tax \nthis income, while protecting from taxation those deferred payments \nthat are for retirement income, paid from plans designed for that \npurpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S859-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\nMrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on \nthe need to address an issue that continues to haunt the inner core of \nour political system: campaign financing laws.\n  Mr. President, we debate many issues in the U.S. Senate. We debate \neverything from national security to local roads and bridges. We spent \na lot of time the past 12 months debating the need to balance the \nFederal budget and maintain access to health care services.\n  During these times, it always strikes me as I sit in the Senate \nChamber that we do not debate these issues by ourselves. In fact, far \nmore than just 100 Senators participate in these debates. We are joined \nby the thoughts and opinions of people representing special interests--\nsome good, some not so good, in my opinion--who far too often today \nmake large financial contributions in hopes of tilting the scales of \nSenate deliberations in their favor.\n  Mr. President, this is big a problem, and I'll tell you why. I urge \nmy colleagues to look around their States and listen to the people. \nVoters in this country are angry, frustrated, and in general less than \nconfident about the future. A series of articles has run in the \nWashington Post the past few days documenting this angst. But we don't \nneed to read about it in the Post; we can see it and hear it in every \ntown meeting, editorial board, and public event we attend.\n  I believe a lack of faith in Government lays at the root of peoples' \nconcerns about the future. If people don't trust the politicians, how \ncan they have faith in congressional decisions? When the agencies are \nforced to shut down, with absolutely no meaningful result, how can \npeople have any other reaction than greater disaffection?\n  I firmly believe the Senate is filled with honorable, dedicated \npublic servants. This Senate has been as passionate and principled as \nany in memory. But we could have 100 Jimmy Stewarts here in 1996, and \nthe public would still question their character. Until we do something \ndramatic to address public confidence, we can expect the gap between \nthe people and their government to widen.\n  There is nothing I can think of that would be worse for this country; \nfor alienation breeds apathy, and apathy erodes accountability. America \nis the greatest democracy the world has ever known, and it was built on \nthe principle of accountability: government of the people, by the \npeople, for the people. We simply must restore peoples' faith in their \ngovernment.\n  At the core of the problem is money in politics. Right now the system \nis designed to favor the rich, at the expense of the middle class. It \nbenefits the incumbents, at the expense of challengers. And most of \nall, it fuels Washington, DC, Inc., at the expense of the average \nperson on Main Street, U.S.A.\n  The average person feels like they can no longer make a difference in \nthis system. Just the other day my campaign received a $15 donation \nfrom a woman in Washington State. She included a note to me that said, \n``Senator Murray, please make sure my $15 has as much impact as people \nwho give thousands.'' She knows what she is up against, but she is \nstill willing to make the effort. Unfortunately people like her are \nfewer and farther between, and less able than ever to make that \ndifference.\n  We see her problem when people like Malcolm Forbes, Jr., are able to \nuse inherited personal wealth to buy their way into the national \nspotlight. Ninety-nine percent of the people in America could never \neven imagine making that kind of splash in politics. Are we to rely \nsolely on the benevolence of the wealthy to ensure strong democracy in \nthis country? I don't think that is what the Founding Fathers had in \nmind.\n  All of this occurs against the backdrop of a campaign finance system \nthat hasn't been reformed since Watergate, over 20 years ago. I would \neven say \n\n[[Page S860]]\npublic faith in Government today has sunk below what it was in 1974. I \nshould know; this lack of faith is what inspired me to seek this office \nin 1992. If I've learned anything in my brief career, it's this: If you \ngive any good set of political lawyers 20 years, they will find a way \nto exploit even the best system to maximum personal advantage. We have \nto reform the campaign financing laws, and we have to do it soon.\n  Given the voters' unambiguous message in the 1992 election, we tried \nto enact significant reform in the 103d Congress. The Senate \noverwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill in 1993, and the House followed \nsuit later. As a newly elected Senator at the time, I was proud to \nsupport that bill. Unfortunately, this effort fell prey to partisan \nrancor in 1994, and ultimately died in a Republican filibuster in the \nSenate.\n  So here we are again, considering various reform proposals in the \n104th Congress. There are two bills currently pending in the Senate \nthat reflect my concerns about campaign reform: S. 1219, introduced by \nSenators McCain and Feingold, and S. 1389, introduced by Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill is very broad, and treats nearly every \naspect of the system. It restricts Political Action Committee \ncontributions; it imposes voluntary spending limits; it provides \ndiscounted access to broadcast media for advertising; it provides \nreduced rates for postage; it prohibits taxpayer-financed mass mailings \non behalf of incumbents during an election year; it discourages \nnegative advertising; it requires full disclosure of independent \nexpenditures; and it reforms the process of soft money contributions \nmade through political parties.\n  Mr. President, these are very strong, positive steps. If enacted as a \npackage, they would make our system of electing Federal officials more \nopen, competitive, and fair. I feel strongly that we must take such \nsteps to reinvigorate peoples' interest in the electoral process, and \nin turn to restore their confidence in the system.\n  There are some provisions in S. 1219 that could be problematic, \nhowever. For example, the bill would require a candidate to raise 60 \npercent of his or her funds within the State. This might work fine for \nsomeone from New York or California. However, it could put small State \ncandidates at a real disadvantage, particularly if their opponent is \nindependently wealthy. The fact remains that modern Federal elections \nare very expensive. Therefore, I think we should review this provision \nof S. 1219 very carefully before making a final decision.\n  Mr. President, the Feinstein bill, S. 1389 is slightly different. It \nproposes some similar reforms, such as voluntary spending limits, free \nbroadcast access under specified conditions, discounted media in \ngeneral, and reduced postage rates. The bill also discourages the use \nof personal wealth for election campaigns, and takes a hard line \nagainst negative advertising. Like the McCain-Feingold bill, these are \npositive steps which, as a package, could significantly improve the \nquality of our elections.\n  S. 1239 differs from S. 1219 in one respect: It does not restrict \nPolitical Action Committees. In taking this approach, the bill suggests \nthat PAC's have a legitimate role in the process, and I am inclined to \nagree for two reasons. First, PAC's are fully disclosed, and subject to \nstrict contribution limits. That means we have a very detailed paper \ntrail from donor to candidate for everyone to see. Second, they give a \nvoice to individual citizens like women and workers and teacher who, if \nnot organized as a group, might not be able to make a difference in the \nprocess.\n  A serious question about PAC's remains, however: Do they unfairly \nbenefit incumbents at the expense of challengers? This is a legitimate \nquestion, and one I think we should address in any final reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, these are not the only two bills on campaign reform \npending in the Senate, but they are the two that most closely reflect \nmy thinking. We need to reduce, or at a minimum control, the amount of \ncampaign spending. We need to make campaigns more civil. Most of all, \nwe need to make campaigns more fair, more competitive, and more \ninclusive of all citizens. I think these two bills would move us \nsubstantially in that direction.\n  Therefore, I am happy to announce today that I have become a \ncosponsor of both S. 1219 and S. 1389. S. 1219 in particular is the \nproduct of the strongest bipartisan reform effort in many years, and I \ncommend senators McCain and Feingold for moving the issue forward. I \nalso commend Senator Feinstein for bringing her personal experience and \nideas to this issue. After two California campaigns in 2 years, she \nknows the flaws in the current system as well as anyone.\n  Mr. President, I hope real reform is enacted in 1996. The President \nof the United States made it very clear in his State of the Union \nAddress the other night: This is a high personal priority for him, and \nhe will sign a bill if we send him one. It may not be exactly these two \nbills, and I know there are several others on this issue currently \npending. For example, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has a \nbill that is very similar to the one filibustered in 1994. It will be \nour responsibility as legislators to find the best elements among these \nbills and refine them into a workable reform package.\n  The people in this country want to feel ownership over their \nelections; they want to feel like they, as individuals, have a role to \nplay that can make a positive difference. Right now, for better or \nworse, not many people feel that way, and the trend is in the wrong \ndirection. Campaign reform isn't the silver bullet; but it is very \nimportant. I believe real campaign reform efforts by Congress would be \none of the strongest, easiest steps we could take to begin restoring \npeoples' faith in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S859-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S860-S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as part of its strategic \nrealignment and downsizing proposal, the Department of Energy has \ntransmitted proposed legislation to transfer the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission outside of the Department of Energy. Presently, \nalthough FERC is part of DOE, it functions as a hybrid agency, neither \ntruly independent, nor quite a part of the executive branch.\n  In 1977, President Carter, in response to continuing repercussions \nfrom the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo and wintertime shortages of natural \ngas, proposed a reorganization of the disjointed Federal energy \nestablishment. The purpose of the reorganization was the creation of a \nsingle agency that would possess the responsibility for coordinating \nall national energy matters and policy. To this end, the Carter \nadministration proposed legislation that was to assign all of the \nGovernment's energy regulatory and policy functions to one cabinet-\nlevel Department of Energy.\n  Although the Carter administration's goal of creating a unitary \nenergy agency was, to a certain extent, shared by Congress, Congress \nalso wished to preclude executive branch control of various regulatory \nfunctions formerly performed by the Federal Power Commission, including \nthe establishment of rates for the transportation and sale of wholesale \nnatural gas and electricity. These two conflicting objectives resulted \nin the anomaly of an independent agency being established within an \nexecutive department.\n  Thus, although FERC is part of the Department of Energy, the power of \nthe Secretary of Energy to influence the policies of the FERC is \ncircumscribed. Specifically, the Department of Energy Organization Act \ngives the Secretary the authority to propose rules, regulations, and \nstatements of policy of general applicability with respect to any \nfunction under the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Secretary may \nset reasonable time limits for action by the Commission, but the \nCommission has exclusive jurisdiction over, and takes final action, if \nany, upon, such proposals. Although limited, this authority has proven \nto be valuable to past administrations as they attempt to implement a \ncoherent energy policy.\n  Thus, although DOE claims that its proposed legislation would make \nthe FERC a fully independent agency, the proposed legislation retains \nthe special authority given to the President by existing law. As a \nresult, the proposed legislation has no practical effect. By taking the \nFERC off of DOE's books, \n\n[[Page S861]]\nthe bill would make the DOE budget appear to be smaller, but would not \nchange the substantive relationship between DOE and FERC or save the \nGovernment money.\n  Because I believe the proposed legislation achieves no substantive \npurpose, I will not introduce this legislation. However, I acknowledge \nreceipt of the proposed legislation and ask that its text be printed in \nthe Record as part of this statement.\n  The text follows:\n\n                             Proposed Bill\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is my sad duty to advise my \ndistinguished colleagues of the passing of a great friend of our Nation \nand a great leader of the people of American Samoa. On January 30, \n1996, Paramount Chief Punefu-ole-motu Letuli Toloa peacefully passed \naway at his home after over four decades of public service.\n  Since 1989 until his untimely death, Chief Letuli Toloa served as \npresident of the senate of American Samoa. He was a retired U.S. Coast \nGuardsman, after more than 20 years of service. He served as governor \nof his district from 1974 to 1977 and was appointed commissioner of \npublic safety for American Samoa in 1978. In 1981, Chief Letuli Toloa \nbecame a senator from his district and 8 years later was elected by his \npeers to be senate president.\n  As a cultural and government leader, Chief Letuli Toloa did his \nutmost to protect the culture of American Samoa from the negative \naspects of western influence and culture. This difficult task was \ncarried out with great diplomacy. The fa'aSamoa continues to survive \nbecause of great leaders like Chief Letuli Toloa.\n  In addition to his distinguished government service, Chief Letuli \nserved for many years as deacon elder for his church. He will be \nremembered as a kind and gentle man who was noted for his great skill \nas a peacemaker in his extended family, in government, in his village \nand in his district. Though endowed with great power, he was always \nhumble, and never succumbed to arrogance or vanity.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with the son of Chief Letuli, who \nmirrors the many virtues and strengths of his great father.\n  Paramount Chief Letuli Toloa is survived by his wife, Saolotoga \nSavali Letuli, 6 children, and 10 grandchildren. American Samoa has \nlost a great leader, and America has lost a good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S861-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S861-S862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RURAL MANAGED CARE COOPERATIVES\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, real health care reform has \neluded us the past several years and there are sectors of our \npopulation that are suffering. Today I speak of a particular segment of \nour society that, at least in discussions of health care, is too often \noverlooked--rural America. Rural communities face the unique challenge \nof obtaining health care in isolated areas. Economic depression, \ngeographic isolation, an inability to retain qualified providers, and a \nlack of primary care facilities are a few of the barriers to quality \nhealth care in our rural and agricultural sectors. To meet this \nchallenge, I have filed an amendment to support the development of \nrural managed care cooperatives--a small investment in the health of \nour farmers, their families and all those who make up the communities \nwe call rural America.\n  There is no dispute that the economic base and the economic vitality \nof a given community is directly correlated to the health of the \nindividuals who serve it. As we discuss the farm bill, under whatever \nguise it may be considered, we must not forget this important fact. The \nhealth of our farm industry is of the utmost importance, but it must \nnot be separated from the health of the men and women who support it.\n  Cooperatives, in one form or another, have been second nature to \nfarming communities for over a century. Whether farmers join together \nto form a purchasing cooperative, one of the most common types, or a \nmarketing cooperative, the style of business has proven itself fair, \nefficient, and effective. Furthermore, its laws of operation translate \nremarkably well to sectors such as housing, service, and even rural \nhealth care.\n  Make no mistake. This idea of a rural health care cooperative is not \nnew. In 1929, Elk City, OK, became home to the first health maintenance \norganization run by the farmers cooperative. Since then, several \nattempts to create rural health cooperatives have failed as a result of \nbeing unable to meet the necessary startup costs. My amendment provides \nthis startup support.\n  It would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \nthrough the Health Resources and Services Administration and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, acting through the Rural Business and \nCooperative Development Service, to award competitive grants to those \ncommunities which wish to form a rural managed care cooperative. The \npurpose of the cooperative is to establish a structure and approach \nthat will keep rural hospitals and health care systems financially \nsound and competitive with urban health care systems.\n  Especially in recent years, rural areas have found it increasingly \ndifficult to attract the physicians and other health care providers \nnecessary \n\n[[Page S862]]\nto meet even minimum community health standards. This shortage of \nproviders results from the inability of rural communities to compete \nwith comparatively rich urban markets. The resources of these larger \nmarkets are alluring incentives for health care providers to avoid or \nstray away from their rural practices. By establishing a systematic \ncase management and reimbursement system designed to support the \ncommunities' needs, a cooperative will provide an effective framework \nfor negotiating contracts with payers and a framework for assuring a \ndefined level of quality.\n  Through the combination of medical resources, streamlined managerial \nand reimbursement responsibilities, and shared liability, rural managed \ncare cooperatives have proven themselves able to attract health care \nproviders, thus improving access to and quality of rural care and \nenhancing the economic vitality of rural health care systems and, \ncommensurately, the economic vitality of surrounding rural industries.\n  Of concern to participants in such cooperatives is the threat of \nantitrust lawsuits. Such a threat serves to undermine the goal of rural \nmanaged care cooperatives. While the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 \nrecognized farmers' rights to form cooperatives without violating \nantitrust laws, these rights have not transferred to rural health care \nproviders. Therefore, language in my amendment would protect those \nproviders who participate in cooperatives from antitrust laws. This \nantitrust law exemption is necessary to facilitate the development of \nrural networks and developments.\n  More than once, I have expressed my concern for the crisis in rural \nhealth care. Between 1989 and 1993, 141 rural community hospitals have \nclosed. In my State alone, five rural hospitals have closed since 1986 \nand several others face the threat of closure. Rural health care \ncooperatives are not the panacea to this crisis, but it is a dose \npotent enough to make a difference. As we consider the health of our \nNations' farm industry, I would urge us to remember the health of the \nrural communities which house it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S861-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING MILWAUKEE'S SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican city, Milwaukee, WI, on its birthday.\n  Yesterday, Milwaukee celebrated the 150th anniversary of its \nincorporation.\n  The residents of that small trading center of 1846 would be \nastonished if they walked the streets of the lively, diverse city of \nmore than 625,000 people today.\n  Milwaukee was born as a city during a very important year in \nWisconsin history. Congress passed enabling legislation admitting \nWisconsin to the Union in 1846, and delegates gathered that year in \nMadison for the State's constitutional convention.\n  Milwaukee sits astride the Milwaukee, Menomonee, and Kinnickinnic \nRivers on Lake Michigan at the site of three former settlements--\nJuneautown, Kilbourntown and Walker's Point--that themselves grew up in \nthe area that had been camping grounds of the indigenous Native \nAmerican population, including members of the Potawatomi, Ottawa, \nChippewa, and Menomonee nations. French explorers, including, notably, \nFather Jacques Marquette, began visiting the area in the late 1600's, \nand by the mid-1700's, a trading post had been established.\n  Mr. President, vigorous commerce has been central to Milwaukee's \nexistence from its beginning. What was to become Milwaukee began as \nthree competing commercial ventures by Byron Kilbourn, a surveyor; \nGeorge Walker, a trader and land speculator; and a fur trader, Solomon \nJuneau, who brought along a partner, Morgan Martin. By the late 1830's, \neach venture had spawned individually incorporated settlements whose \ninhabitants competed fiercely, even coming to blows during local \nhostilities that flared up into the Great Bridge War of 1845.\n  Realizing that conflict was not the handmaiden to progress, all three \nsettlements eventually agreed to form one city, Milwaukee.\n  Mr. President, Milwaukee, once incorporated, grew quickly; its \npopulation soaring from about 20,000 in 1850 to more than 285,000 by \nthe turn of the century and to more than 575,000 by 1930.\n  Immigrants came in several waves, each group establishing its unique \nimprimatur on the city. In the early 1800's, they were mostly New \nEnglanders and New Yorkers whose roots reached back to England. The \nfirst African-American settler, a man named Joe Oliver, arrived in 1835 \nand worked for Solomon Juneau. By the middle of the 1840's, German \nimmigrants were arriving at the rate of more than 1,000 per week. Irish \nimmigrants arrived, too, settling largely in the city's third ward, on \nthe southeast side of the downtown. The Polish community grew quickly \nin the late 19th century, giving the South Side its character. The city \nwas eventually populated with settlers from Italy, Hungary, the \nBalkans, Mexico, nearly every point on the compass. In terms of the \ndiversity of ethnic backgrounds of its residents, Milwaukee is as \ncosmopolitan a city as one can find.\n  By the arrival of the Civil War, Milwaukee had become a busy center \nfor the quintessential Midwestern hog and wheat industries. In 1868, an \niron and steel mill was built south of the Milwaukee River, kicking off \na vigorous industrialization. By 1890, the leading industry was the one \nfor which Milwaukee is probably best-known throughout the world--\nbrewing.\n  Nowadays, the city is the home to companies like Harley-Davidson, \nMiller Brewing, Master Lock and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. \nArea firms annually create goods with an aggregate value of \napproximately $19 billion.\n  Mr. President, Milwaukee also has had a lively political history, not \njust limited to Democrats and Republicans. Israeli Prime Minister Golda \nMeier grew up and was educated in Milwaukee before leaving to later \nmake her mark in history. From 1910 through 1960, several socialists \nwere elected mayor, running the city for 38 of those 50 years. One of \nthem, Frank Zeidler, was the city's chief executive from 1948 until \n1960. Elected to office on a public enterprise program, he doubled the \ncity's size from about 48 square miles to about 96 square miles with an \nenergetic annexation program.\n  Stability has been one hallmark of Milwaukee government, earning the \ncity a reputation for efficiency, honesty and fiscal responsibility, \ntraits that would serve any government well. Three men--Daniel Webster \nHoan, Frank Zeidler, and Henry Maier --served as mayor for a total of \n64 years.\n  Milwaukee is the home of some wonderful architecture, from some of \nthe impressive homes along Lake Drive to city hall. The city boasts an \narray of cultural opportunities, including its symphony, a zoological \npark, the Pabst Theatre and big-league basketball and baseball \nfranchises, as well as other sports teams.\n  Like all modern cities, Milwaukee faces challenges in a rapidly-\nchanging, ever-more-complex world, but, given what I know of the \ncharacter of the people who live there, I am confident Milwaukee will \nrise to those challenges.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say, happy anniversary, Milwaukee, and my \nbest wishes for many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S862-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S862-S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GRACE SOOTHES MOTHER NATURE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last month the people of the \nCatskills region suffered some of the worst floods of their history. \nThe waters swept away homes and property, roadways and bridges, \nschools, and businesses. There was injury and death. But the people \nendured with grace and courage and, as a recent editorial by Paul Smart \nin the Mountain Eagle attests, they have harnessed that same spirit to \nbegin rebuilding their dreams.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this editorial be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n              [From the Mountain Eagle, Tannersville, NY]\n\n                          The Force of Nature\n\n       The past week has been a wearying one for us here in the \n     Catskills. Friday saw us all battling against floodwaters. \n     Saturday morning was a time of assessment and reassessment. \n     By Sunday, clean-up had begun.\n       Driving around our coverage region, which enfolds most of \n     the damaged areas, the largeness of real disaster crept up on \n     us. Snapping \n\n[[Page S863]]\n     photos and gathering stories, we went from an unconscious comparison of \n     one township's horrors to others to an almost overbearing \n     sense of tragedy.\n       The damage is everywhere. The most visible cataclysms of \n     Margaretville, Walton and the Schoharie Valley are the tip to \n     a sad iceberg. Roads and bridges were damaged in nearly every \n     township. Basements and yards and driveways, not to mention \n     whole first floors and entire homes, have been trashed by the \n     oft-forgotten force of nature. The damage totals, still being \n     added up as we go to press, are staggering.\n       In the midst of all this, though, were incredible moments \n     that defined man's hope, that characterized people's \n     resilience better than any example we've encountered. \n     Everyone chipped in to help each other. Battered business \n     people and homeowners laughed at their fate, then vowed \n     recovery. Outside help started pouring in. Bitterness was \n     given no toehold amongst the destruction.\n       Of course, much of this can be chalked up to the closeness \n     between invigoration and enervation. There are times when one \n     has no alternative but to look up. The call of the moment has \n     been deafening; we've had no choice but to focus on the now, \n     on the jobs at hand. It will only be later that the real pain \n     of what we've been through will hit. We must prepare for \n     then.\n       We must remember that the recent floods have proven our \n     region's cohesion, at least in nature's eyes. And we must \n     remember that it has only been through our shared efforts \n     that we've come through all this. The outside world has not \n     forsaken us, just as we have not forsaken each other.\n       Nature is a cruel mistress. We sometimes scoff at the ideas \n     of 100-year flood plains that rule our planning documents, \n     sometimes think that we've reached an age where our human \n     efforts can thwart all. But then matters fall out of our \n     hands. We are forced to realize where we live, what we must \n     deal with for our choices. And when we rebuild our dreams, we \n     must do so cogniscent of the tragedies that have preceded our \n     actions.\n       Good times still lie ahead of us, just as they occupy our \n     memories. As humans, we know how to persevere, how to rebuild \n     and fortify. The future is always ours.\n       Please let us know what we can do to help. We care for this \n     region. We know its days of glory have yet to come.\n       And we bless all our angels for helping us through this \n     past week: our local officials, our emergency volunteers, our \n     neighbors and saviors. We even thank dear Mother Nature for \n     having dropped our temperatures below freezing last Friday \n     night so the waters would abate and we could get on with the \n     hard business of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S862-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARY M. STEFON\n\n   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it was once said: ``Leadership is \nnot bestowed. It is only yours for as long as it is continually \nearned.'' Today, I rise to pay tribute to Mary M. Stefon, a leader and \npublic servant who truly personifies this adage.\n  Mary recently retired from her post as town clerk of the Town of \nSprague, CT--the town she served in various elective capacities for 34 \nyears. Those of us in political life know it is rare to be continually \nreturned to office by one's fellow citizens for so many years, and for \nMary Stefon to be so honored by her constituents is a testament to the \ngreat respect and faith she has earned from them.\n  Mary's service to her hometown grew out of her firmly planted roots \nthere. She has lived in Sprague since 1927, graduating from school and \nraising her family there. She took an active role in many community \naffairs, serving in official positions on the Board of Education of St. \nJoseph School, the Sprague Housing Authority, and the Sprague Grist \nMill Committee. She was active in Democratic politics, serving as \nchairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer of the Democratic Town \nCommittee. And in elective office, Mary served not only as town clerk \nuntil last year, but also as town treasurer until 1977 and agent of \ntown deposit fund until 1982. As if serving in all three elected posts \nis not impressive enough, consider that for 16 years, she occupied them \nsimultaneously.\n  But Mary Stefon's schedule was apparently not busy enough, and she \nparticipated in many volunteer activities in addition to her other \nduties. After serving in the U.S. Navy Waves during World War II, her \nlater volunteer activities included speaking to elementary school \nchildren as part of the Northeast Utilities Career Motivation Program, \nworking as a volunteer bookkeeper for a Youth Employment Program, and \nvolunteering at St. Mary's Church in Baltic.\n  Fine people like Mary M. Stefon--wife, mother, grandmother, \nvolunteer, mentor, leader, and public official--are indeed the people \nwho create the sense of community in Connecticut's and America's towns. \nAnd it is people like her, who always find time to give of themselves \nto others, who are role models for us all.\n  Mr. President, this year, sadly, many of the best public servants \nthis country has ever known have made the decision to retire from \npublic life. Mary M. Stefon is without question among them. I wish her \nwell, and join the citizens of Connecticut and the Town of Sprague in \nthanking her for her dedicated and outstanding public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S863-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S863-S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AUTHOR WILLIAM MAXWELL HONORED WITH PEN-MALAMUD AWARD\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just over a half century ago, as \na young sailor, Harry Hall, also in the Navy at that time, sent me a \ncopy of ``The Folded Leaf,'' a novel by William Maxwell. It may have \nbeen the first novel I ever read seriously, or at least the first that \nseemed seriously addressed to my own experience as a young man. \nWhatever, it has remained with me ever since, not least the lines from \nTennyson,\n\n       Lo! In the middle of the wood,\n       The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud\n\n  I am happy to report that William Maxwell has just received the PEN-\nMalamud Award. It was given to him at the Folger Shakespeare Library, a \nmere two blocks from the Capitol, and I know the Senate would wish to \njoin in congratulations.\n  William Maxwell spent nearly 40 years as a staff writer and fiction \neditor at the New Yorker. ``Talk of the Town'' celebrated his award. \nMr. President, I ask that this article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the New Yorker, Dec. 25, 1995 and Jan. 1, 1996]\n\n                            Maxwell's Smarts\n\n       ``The lights are so bright I can't see your faces,'' \n     William Maxwell said, stepping up to the podium at the Folger \n     Shakespeare Library, in Washington, D.C. ``Being here makes \n     me think of ghosts,'' he went on. ``I had a dear friend who \n     spent many days and weeks here, researching to write a book \n     on Shakespeare. And I had another who worked in the library \n     for a time. I hope they are both present tonight.'' He was \n     standing on the stage of the Folger theatre, an antique-\n     feeling space with high galleries, square columns, and a \n     wood-and-plaster Elizabethan stage house, all of which give \n     it a ponderous elegance. The occasion was the eighth annual \n     PEN/Malamud Award reading, and Maxwell was being honored, \n     along with Stuart Dybek, for excellence in the practice of \n     the short story. A large, warmly appreciative audience was \n     present, including Maxwell's wife, Emily; members of Bernard \n     Malamud's family, and the writers Charles Baxter, Nicholas \n     Delbanco, Alan Cheuse, Maxine Clair, Michael Collier, \n     Patricia Browning Griffith, Howard Norman, Susan Richards \n     Shreve, William Warner, and Mary Helen Washington.\n       A few minutes earlier, Dybek had spoken of how privileged \n     he felt to be on the same stage with William Maxwell. He then \n     honored the elder writer in the best way one writer can honor \n     another: by being terribly good. He read a densely lyrical \n     and dramatic story called ``We Didn't.'' It charmed the house \n     and made everyone glad of the short story, this superior form \n     of entertainment.\n       And now Maxwell was standing on the podium. Well into his \n     eighties, with the slightest hesitation in his movements, he \n     still seemed wonderfully calm, a man spending a little time \n     with friends. He wore a dark suit and looked very trim; \n     his dark eyes were animated with the same humor and \n     interest one finds in his stories. As a staff writer and \n     fiction editor at The New Yorker for nearly forty years, \n     Maxwell worked with such writers as John Cheever, Eudora \n     Welty, and Mavis Gallant. Meanwhile, he wrote stories and \n     novels that are as good as or better than those of just \n     about anyone else: ``Over by the River,'' for instance, \n     and the short novel ``So Long, See You Tomorrow,'' which \n     is set in his native Illinois and, like so much of his \n     work, evokes the simple grandeur of life in a small \n     Midwestern community in the recent past.\n       Now, opening the bound galleys of his recently published \n     collected stories, ``All the Days and Nights,'' Maxwell \n     looked into the brightness again and said, ``I'm going to \n     read a story called `The French Scarecrow.' '' There was a \n     murmur of recognition from the crowd. Very gracefully and \n     somehow confidingly, he began to read. He read softly, \n     pausing--without seeming to monitor the sound--for the \n     laughs. His precise, elegant, and quietly humorous study of \n     unease was a perfect complement of the electricity of the \n     Dybek story.\n       When Maxwell finished and the applause died down, Janna \n     Malamud Smith was introduced. In the name of her father, she \n     presented the award to both writers, and then everyone \n     adjourned to the Great Hall for wine and finger food. The \n     wine tasted as though it had been aged in a stone jar, but \n     nobody seemed to mind. Maxwell and Dybek signed their books \n     and answered questions \n\n[[Page S864]]\n     amid a general feeling of well-being and affection. If the ghosts of \n     Maxwell's friends were somewhere in the sculptured brown \n     lines of the Folger theatre and Great Hall, then they must \n     certainly have been travelling in the company of Bernard \n     Malamud, for the spirit of that marvelous writer of stories \n     was invoked by every facet of the evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S863-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleagues in welcoming to the United States, the President of France, \nJacques Chirac, who will address a joint session of the Congress this \nmorning. I look forward to his remarks and observations, not only on \nhistorically close French-American bilateral relations, but on \ndevelopments on the international scene. The political, economic, and \ncultural ties which link the French and American people go beyond mere \ntrade of goods and ideas, however important those may be. Our relations \nwith the French are almost as with brothers and sisters; more often \nthan not, France and the United States have stood as allies in the \nstruggle for freedom. The debt we owed France for its assistance during \nour Revolution, for example, was repaid on the beaches of Normandy.\n  Though we may be friends, Mr. President, it is a strength and beauty \nof the relationship that permits us to air our differences over some \nfundamental questions. One of those issues has been the French program \nof testing nuclear devices in the South Pacific, a regrettable series \nof tests which, literally and figuratively, have served only to poison \nthe environment and endangered U.S.-led efforts to conclude a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.\n  Since September 5, 1995, Mr. President, the Government of France has \nexploded six nuclear devices at underground testing sites in the South \nPacific. The most recent explosion was made only 4 days ago and came \ndespite French acknowledgement that there had been some leakage of \nradioactive material into the seabed around the Mururoa Atoll. The \nFrench Government ignored, as well, the vociferous protests of various \ngovernments of Pacific Rim nations, whose people would be affected by \nthe potentially dangerous effects of leaked radiation.\n  France justified this somewhat colonial action by claiming that its \nsovereign interest in assuring its security overrode the health and \nsafety of those affected by these tests. These should never have \nhappened.\n  But I do believe, Mr. President, that we can take some satisfaction \nin President Chirac's January 28 announcement that the testing is now \nfinally and forevermore at end. I salute, too, his claim that France \nwill now seek a lead role in working for a comprehensive test ban. I \nalso applaud President Clinton's leadership in seeking a true ``zero \nyield'' CTBT. On October 10, 1995, I wrote to the President expressing \nmy concerns about U.S. involvement in the French nuclear weapons \nprogram. President Clinton responded with a statement of regret about \nFrance's decision on testing, and a pledge to continue to press for a \nCTBT. I ask that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We want to draw your attention to \n     recent reports concerning close cooperation between the U.S. \n     and France in developing the French nuclear weapons program.\n       An article in the Washington Post September 19 suggests \n     that a decades-long period of U.S. support for technical \n     assistance to the French program not only continues, but may \n     soon reach new, unprecedented levels of cooperation. \n     Particularly disturbing are the reports that the U.S. and \n     France are currently negotiating a pact by which the two \n     sides will begin to share sensitive computer codes that \n     describe how nuclear weapons behave when exploded. Further, \n     it is reported that a senior-level American scientist will \n     also help the French government in building and designating a \n     new facility for weapons-related research.\n       These reports are deeply troubling. They serve to undermine \n     the strong political leadership you consistently exhibited in \n     successfully urging the nations of the world to extend the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty (NPT) and in your continuing \n     efforts to secure a comprehensive test ban treaty. It also \n     seems to contradict the Administration's very public \n     criticisms of recent French nuclear testing in the Pacific.\n       Moreover, we can speculate that once the French government \n     has access to computer code data generated by the U.S., and \n     designs weapons with technical assistance provided by the \n     U.S., it will seek to test the weapons in the Pacific which, \n     it could be said, will have been god-fathered by the U.S. \n     More troubling still is the possibility that the U.S. itself \n     will share in the data generated by French tests.\n       Cooperation with the French government on matters of mutual \n     security is important. But in order to continue to lead with \n     moral authority on the question of deterring nuclear non-\n     proliferation and on ending unnecessary and harmful nuclear \n     weapons testing, we urge you to carefully review these \n     policies. We believe that taking measures which discourage--\n     rather than facilitate--nuclear weapons testing should remain \n     the lodestar which guides Administration policy.\n       We thank you for your efforts to date and look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Russell D. Feingold.\n     Daniel K. Akaka.\n     Tom Harkin.\n     Byron Dorgan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               The White House\n\n                                     Washington, November 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Russ: Thank you for your recent letter regarding \n     nuclear cooperation with France.\n       The United States has had an ongoing cooperative program \n     with France in the nuclear area. My Administration recently \n     conducted a review of this program and I have concluded that \n     such a program of cooperation with France remains in the U.S. \n     national interest. I have also directed that this program \n     focus on stockpile stewardship (i.e., maintenance of existing \n     nuclear stockpiles without nuclear testing) and that it not \n     include activities that would materially aid the development \n     of new nuclear weapons.\n       Of course, such a program of cooperation can only take \n     place in the overall context of positive United States-French \n     relations. While I regret France's decision to resume nuclear \n     testing, we must also take note of France's strong commitment \n     to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) banning all \n     nuclear tests, ``regardless of level,'' no later than the \n     fall of 1996. This position is consistent with my own \n     decision to seek a true ``zero yield'' CTBT. We will continue \n     to work with France and all other states participating in the \n     CTBT negotiations to ensure that a Treaty is ready for \n     signature as early as possible next year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, only last week the Senate ratified the \nSTART II Treaty, putting us firmly back on the road to ending the \nthreat of nuclear annihilation. The next step is to bring to reality \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which would serve to put an \nend to the practice of testing weaponry which--we pray and can \nincreasingly say with confidence--will never be put to use. This effort \nwas seriously undermined by the French tests, and it has caused other \nnations to question the point and sincerity of the CTBT. While I harbor \ndeep regrets about the effect of France's unwarranted tests, I want to \nsay now to President Chirac, ``welcome aboard.'' We look forward to \nclose cooperation with France in reaching the goal of ridding the world \nof nuclear weapons, and will work to ensure that its series of tests \nwill be the last ever conducted on the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S864-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S864-S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROBERT A. BUDUSKY\n\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my \nrespects to Robert A. Budusky of Meriden, CT, who was the victim of a \nsenseless murder on Tuesday. Mr. Budusky, a letter carrier for the U.S. \nPostal Service, was delivering mail along his route in Hartford when he \nwas suddenly and fatally shot in the back of his head. His alleged \nmurderer is a man on parole for an earlier weapons conviction.\n  I did not have the honor of knowing Robert Budusky, but from what I \nhave learned, he was a dedicated public servant and a wonderful human \nbeing. ``Everybody on his route loved him. They're all telling me so,'' \nsaid Martin Torres, according to an article in today's Hartford \nCourant. Torres, also a letter carrier, volunteered to take over Mr. \nBudusky's route ``to make sure they get the service today that Bob gave \nthem every day.''\n  Robert Budusky is the first letter carrier to be killed on the job in \nNew England in more than thirty years. But his death is a reminder that \nall letter carriers brave much more than the elements every day as they \ndeliver our mail. Too often we take for granted their service, and fail \nto provide them the respect they all richly deserve.\n  Mr. Budusky reportedly had enough seniority to request mail routes in \n\n\n[[Page S865]]\nother communities, but he chose to remain on the job in Hartford, where \nhe ``loved the people on his route,'' said his supervisor, Dwight \nDavies, according to an Associated Press report. That report also \nquotes Mary Asberry, a resident along Robert Budusky's route, saying, \n``He was a friend, to me and to a lot of other people around here.''\n  Flags are at half staff in front of post offices across Connecticut \ntoday, and thousands of black ribbons are being worn by postal \nemployees in honor of their fallen colleague. At the young age of 35, \nRobert Budusky will be buried this Saturday. My prayers go out to his \nfamily and his many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S864-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S865-S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPEAL MANDATORY DISCHARGE FOR HIV-POSITIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a very important article appeared \nin today's Washington Post that I commend to all my colleagues. Its \ntitle is ``Army Sergeant with HIV Feels Deserted by Policy.'' This \narticle tells the story of a woman--a sergeant in the Army--who faces \ndischarge because of a horrible provision in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill that mandates the release of HIV positive personnel.\n  This provision is not supported by the military. It has been forced \nupon them by this Congress. In my view, it is nothing less than \nshameful.\n  The sergeant, who used the pseudonym ``Marie'' for this article, is a \ngood soldier. She exhibits no signs of illness. Were it not for this \nprovision in the DOD authorization bill, Marie would likely get a \npromotion this year.\n  Marie may not get that promotion. Instead she may get shown the door. \nI want to share with my colleagues what Marie thinks about this \nprovision, mandating the discharge of HIV positive personnel like \nherself. She says, ``no one is looking at the work I've done. No one is \nlooking at the commitment I made--I defend the Constitution. It feels \nlike the United States has turned its back on me.''\n  Mr. President, I have been in Congress for nearly 15 years. During \nthat time, I have seen a lot. But I never thought that I would see the \nday that the United States would turn its back on a soldier. The United \nStates military has a proud tradition of standing by those courageous \nenough to dedicate their lives to the defense of our Nation. And if \nthis provision becomes law, that proud tradition will end. That would \nbe a sad day for this country.\n  Supporters of this provision argue that it is needed because non-\nworldwide deployable personnel degrade the readiness of our forces.\n  But I hope all Members realize that the substance of this new policy \ncontradicts the rhetoric of its backers. They say that nonworldwide \ndeployable personnel degrade readiness, but they only target a small \nfraction of that group.\n  Military personnel are placed on non-deployable status if they have \nsevere asthma, or diabetes, or cancer. But this provision doesn't \naffect them. It targets only HIV positive personnel--only about 20 \npercent of all nondeployable personnel.\n  It is therefore perfectly clear: This provision is not about \nreadiness or about deployable status, it is about targeting people with \nHIV. It is about discrimination.\n  Mr. President, on Tuesday I was proud to stand with all \nCalifornians--and indeed all Americans--to cheer the return of \n``Magic'' Johnson to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers wanted Magic \nback neither because he was HIV positive nor in spite of it. They \nwanted Magic back because he makes their team better.\n  The Army needs sergeants like Marie because she makes their team \nbetter. She can do the job. And for as long as she can do the job, \nCongress should not intervene to mandate her discharge.\n  Mr. President, this forced discharge policy is worse than wrong; it \nis immoral.\n  As soon as the President signs the DOD authorization bill, bipartisan \nlegislation will be introduced to repeal this outrageous policy. I will \nbe an original cosponsor and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor.\n  I believe the military's existing policy is adequate. As Asst. \nSecretary of Defense Fred Pang has said:\n\n       As long as these members can perform their required duties, \n     we see no prudent reason to separate and replace them because \n     of their antibody status. However, as with any Service \n     member, if their condition affects their performance of duty, \n     then the Department initiates separation action . . . the \n     proposed provision would not improve military readiness or \n     the personnel policies of the Department.\n\n  We must repeal this provision within 6 months, or else people like \nMarie will feel the consequences for a lifetime. I ask that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1996]\n\n            Army Sergeant With HIV Feels Deserted by Policy\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       Marie, a staff sergeant who has been in the Army 10 years, \n     figures she has done what has been expected of her, and more. \n     She has worked hard, spent months away from her family on \n     assignments, ``given 110 percent'' to her job and is in line \n     for an important promotion.\n       Except now she expects to be forced out of the Army.\n       That is because last week Congress passed and President \n     Clinton agreed to sign a defense bill that includes a \n     provision to discharge service members with the AIDS virus, \n     regardless of whether they are sick or can still perform \n     their jobs.\n       Marie, who is 34 and has a daughter in elementary school, \n     was infected by her late husband before he knew he had the \n     disease.\n       ``I'm widowed from it, I have a child and now I'm going to \n     lose my job,'' she said in a three-hour interview yesterday \n     at a friend's home in Northern Virginia. ``No one's looking \n     at the work I've done. No one's looking at the commitment I \n     made. . . . I signed a contract to uphold freedom of speech, \n     freedom of religion, I defend the Constitution. It feels like \n     the United States has turned its back on me.''\n       Marie noted that she was being forced from her profession \n     for having HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, just when many \n     people this week applauded basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' \n     Johnson's return to professional play despite having the \n     virus.\n       Afraid of being stigmatized, she will not allow her full \n     name to be used in this article--Marie is her middle name. \n     She has not told her daughter or most of her co-workers she \n     is HIV-positive and only informed her mother last month, \n     although the virus was diagnosed five years ago and she \n     informed her Army supervisors.\n       ``It's my family I'm concerned about,'' she said.\n       The HIV measure in the defense bill was introduced by Rep. \n     Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.), a conservative presidential \n     aspirant and former combat pilot who has become a lightning \n     rod for anger among AIDS activists and others, including \n     Marie.\n       Dornan has attracted their criticism for comments such as \n     one he made on the House floor in November, when he defended \n     the provision by saying that AIDS ``is spread by human God-\n     given free will'' and then listing what he described as the \n     three ways service members get AIDS: ``Rolling up your white, \n     khaki or blue uniform sleeve and sticking a contaminated, \n     filthy needle in your arm . . . heterosexual sex with \n     prostitutes . . . and having unprotected [homosexual] sex \n     with strangers in some hideaway or men's room somewhere.''\n       ``I feel outraged'' at Dornan, said Marie. ``I can't go out \n     into the public and talk about my disease because the \n     American people don't understand this disease. How can I feel \n     safe if I have a leader on Capitol Hill who says things like \n     this?\n       ``Everything I worked for he's taking away from me, \n     everything I know,'' she said. ``I've left my family to go to \n     school, I've left my family to go overseas. I did it because \n     that was what the military expected of me. If I didn't want \n     to make it my career, I wouldn't have done it. I love my \n     family.''\n       There are 1,049 male and female service members who have \n     the AIDS virus. They have been allowed to continue to work \n     and to reenlist as long as they are able to perform their \n     jobs. But the military tests personnel for HIV about every \n     two years, and those with the virus are prohibited from being \n     sent to overseas posts or into combat. Marie went abroad \n     before being infected.\n       ``It sounds like a tragic case,'' Dornan said of Marie in \n     an interview yesterday. But, he added, AIDS sufferers put an \n     undue burden on other service members who have to fill in for \n     them overseas. ``She can't go to Bosnia. She can't go to \n     Haiti. She can't go to Somalia. She can't go anywhere in this \n     world . . . and she obviously had unprotected sex with \n     someone whose entire background she didn't know. . . . She \n     should be a good patriot and take her honorable discharge.''\n       Defense Department statistics show that half of the service \n     members with the AIDS virus are married.\n       Several high-ranking military officials and military \n     organizations have supported Dornan's provision because they \n     believe HIV-positive service members are a drain on military \n     readiness. In 1993, Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, then chief of \n     naval operations, wrote Dornan to say that retaining HIV-\n     positive service members ``imposes significant problems for \n     all services, especially the Navy. Assignment limitations \n     cause significant disruption in the sea/shore rotation for \n     all our personnel.''\n     \n[[Page S866]]\n\n       Clinton is set to sign the defense bill early next week. \n     After he does, Marie, who works on personnel issues at the \n     Pentagon, will be discharged within six months. She will \n     retain her medical benefits but will not be entitled to \n     retirement benefits or the kind of substantial disability pay \n     she could have gotten had she remained in the Army until she \n     became too sick to work. She will also lose the health \n     insurance she has for her daughter.\n       White House officials said they hope to have some \n     alternative to the provision ready when Clinton signs the \n     bill. Among the options under consideration is to have \n     Clinton sign an executive order that would allow service \n     members to retain health insurance for their dependents or to \n     support legislation to repeal the provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S865-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY BY FORMER SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

The purpose \nof the referral was to obtain a report from the court about allegations \nthat the Department of Justice appropriated computer software developed \nby the INSLAW firm without paying for it and whether INSLAW has \nlegitimate legal or equitable claims against the government arising out \nof its contractual relations with the government.\n  Some of the matters at issue in this congressional referral case were \nearlier the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. As part of the civil discovery plan that the parties \nare undertaking under the court's supervision in this case, the \nplaintiffs' counsel has written to the leadership of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations seeking access to evidence obtained by \nthe subcommittee in the course of its inquiry on subjects covered by \nthe congressional referral.\n  In Senate Resolution 302 of the 102d Congress, the Senate authorized \nthe Investigations Subcommittee to provide evidence from its inquiry to \na Justice Department special counsel conducting an earlier \ninvestigation into these matters.\n  The leadership of the Subcommittee would like to assist the court by \nresponding to the plaintiffs' request for relevant evidence from its \ninvestigation. Such assistance appears particularly warranted in this \nmatter inasmuch as this litigation results from a referral initiated by \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, this resolution would authorize the Investigations \nSubcommittee, acting through its chairman and ranking member, to \nprovide copies of relevant investigative records to the plaintiffs, \nwith copies to the Justice Department, in response to this request.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

This \nresolution is almost identical to one passed by the Texas State \nLegislature on March 7, 1995.\n  Just last month, on December 29, 1995, Texans celebrated the \nsesquicentennial of their statehood. Unlike all other states ever \nadmitted, we gave up the sovereignty of an independent republic to join \nthe Union.\n  On March 1, 1845, Congress passed a resolution inviting the Republic \nof Texas to join the Union, and a special convention of Texans met to \nconsider it, under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson Rusk. The \nconvention accepted the offer on July 4, and its decision was ratified \nby the people in October. We submitted a constitution, which Congress \naccepted on December 29.\n  Rusk went on to become the first United States Senator from Texas, \nand I, the great granddaughter of his law partner, now hold his seat. \nTaylor and Rush had signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from \nMexico in 1836.\n  Texans mark the 29th, quietly, as the commencement of our statehood, \nalthough we didn't lower the Lone Star and post the Stars and Stripes \nuntil February 19, 1846. We must have been happy with statehood in \n1955, because we expressly renounced the right to fly the flag of our \nold Republic at the same level as that of our Union. Our legislature \nmandated that it fly in a subordinate position, in a manner followed by \nall other states.\n  Although independence remains the signal day in Texas history, Texans \nlook upon their statehood with pride, as a means of ``conferring \nblessings upon the people of all the States.'' When Old Glory was \nraised for the first time in Austin, Anson Jones, the last President of \nthe Republic of Texas, stated with eloquence:\n\n       The lone star of Texas, which ten years since arose amid \n     cloud, over fields of carnage, and obscurely shone for a \n     while, and following an inscrutable destiny has passed on and \n     become fixed forever in that glorious constellation which all \n     . . . lovers of freedom in the world must . . . adore--the \n     American Union. Blending its rays with its sister stars, long \n     may it continue to shine, and may a gracious heaven smile \n     upon this consummation with the wishes of the two republics, \n     now joined together in one.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be considered and agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear at appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 223) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 223\n\n       Whereas 1995 marks 150 years since the United States of \n     America admitted Texas as the 28th State in the Union;\n       Whereas the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood is a truly \n     momentous occasion that allows all Texans to reflect on their \n     State's proud heritage and bright future;\n       Whereas acting on the advice of President John Tyler, the \n     United States Congress adopted a joint resolution on February \n     28, 1845, inviting the Republic of Texas to enter the Union \n     as a State with full retention of its public lands; today, a \n     century and a half later, Texas enjoys the distinction of \n     being the only State admitted with such extensive rights;\n       Whereas the citizens of the Republic of Texas were deeply \n     committed to the goals and ideals embodied in the United \n     States Constitution, and, on June 16, 1845, the Congress of \n     the Republic of Texas was convened by President Anson Jones \n     to consider the proposal of statehood;\n       Whereas Texas took advantage of the offer, choosing to \n     unite with a large and prosperous Nation that could more \n     effectively defend the borders of Texas and expand its \n     flourishing trade with European countries; by October 1845, \n     the Congress of the Republic of Texas had approved a State \n     constitution, charting a bold new destiny for the Lone Star \n     State;\n       Whereas the proposed State constitution was sent to \n     Washington, D.C., and on December 29, 1845, the United States \n     of America formally welcomed Texas as a new State; the \n     transfer of governmental authority, however, was not complete \n     until February 19, 1846, when Anson Jones lowered the flag \n     that had flown above the Capitol for nearly 10 years and \n     stepped down from his position as president of the Republic \n     of Texas; and\n       Whereas with the poignant retirement of the flag of the \n     Republic, Texas emerged as a blazing Lone Star in America's \n     firmament, taking its place as the 28th State admitted into \n     the Union: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorate the sesquicentennial of Texas statehood; \n     and\n       (2) encourage all Texans to observe such day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities on this historic \n     occasion.\n\n     The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to the Texas Congressional Delegation, to the \n     Governor of Texas, to the National Archives, and to the Texas \n     Archives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S866-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S867-S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

I commend her for her effort and \nlook forward to working with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S868-5", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S868-S869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just briefly want to make a couple of \nfinal remarks with regard to the debate on the farm legislation. I do \nnot want to belabor what has already been said. I know that there are \nmany who want to retire.\n  Let me say three things. First, I do not think there is a person in \nthe Senate Chamber who does not want to get farm legislation passed at \nthe earliest possible date. Frankly, many of us hoped we would not have \nhad to see the delays that we have already experienced, for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. There have been scheduling delays. I do not believe \nwe have put the efforts in at the committee level that we should have.\n  Others have noted this bill has never been reported out of committee. \nFor a piece of legislation of this magnitude not to be reported out of \ncommittee, not to come to the floor in the entire first session of the \n104th Congress, is some indication, in my view, of the priority the \nmajority has placed on farm legislation. Certainly we could have found \ntime somewhere during the summer months or at some time during the fall \nor perhaps during the winter during many of these long breaks we have \ntaken to take up this legislation, to recognize how pressing a problem \nit is, to deal with it, as complex as it is, in a meaningful way--over \na long period of time, if necessary, to accommodate the many different \ndecisions that any farm legislation reflects.\n  That is the first point, Mr. President. We really have to recognize \nthat there have been delays, unnecessary ones, in our view, that have \nbrought us to this point.\n  This legislation was never subject to a vote on the Senate floor. It \nwas buried in a budget resolution that the President, for a lot of \nreasons, was required to veto. So it is not accurate to \n\n[[Page S869]]\nsay that the farm bill was vetoed. The budget resolution was vetoed; \nburied within that budget resolution we found farm legislation which \nhad not been considered prior to that time.\n  The second issue over which there ought not be any concern or \nconfusion is our mutual desire to provide the maximum degree of \nflexibility to farmers. Let there be no mistake: Recognizing as late as \nit is, we simply cannot constrain farmers in any way as they begin to \nput their management plans together. Farmers have to be given \nflexibility. Farmers have to be given the assurance that they can make \ntheir decisions, unencumbered by farm policy at this late date.\n  It is our desire every bit as much as it is the desire of many \nRepublicans to ensure that farmers are given flexibility, that they \nhave the latitude to go farm as we want them to farm. Flexibility is \nnot the issue. No one ought to be using that argument as a reason for \nthe fact that we have not reached an agreement today. We want \nflexibility. We want simplicity. We want to give farmers the chance to \nfarm.\n  The third issue, and the one that I think will divide us perhaps in \nperpetuity--the reason we have not yet come to a resolution--is that in \nthe name of some change, in the name of bringing about this so-called \nflexibility, what many on the other side are prepared to say is, ``We \nwill be so flexible that we will give you the payment whether you farm \nor not. We do not care whether you farm. We do not care what you farm. \nWe do not care what the prices are. We are going to give you a huge \nlump-sum payment upfront, regardless of price, regardless of your \nmanagement, regardless of your circumstances, regardless of how big you \nare, regardless of whether or not you are even on the farm. You will \nhave an opportunity to get this huge payment.''\n  Mr. President, as others have said today, I do not think it will take \nlong for this army of investigative journalists we have in Washington \nand elsewhere to call attention to the fact that while we are cutting \nevery single aspect of the Federal budget, there will be people out \nthere getting not $100,000, not $200,000, but perhaps $300,000 in lump-\nsum payments for doing absolutely nothing at all. That is how some \nwould view this so-called concept of ``freedom to farm.'' It is the \nfreedom not to farm. It is the freedom not to do anything. It is the \nfreedom not to be responsible.\n\n  So that is the fundamental disagreement we have today. We have had it \nfor a long time. We will have it tomorrow. The question is, can we \nbridge that difference? Can we say we are not adverse to providing the \nadvance deficiency payments or the advance payments that we provided \nagriculture in the past, but you have to farm to get a farm payment; \nyou have to be responsible if you expect us to be responsive?\n  So, let us hope that over the course of the next couple of days we \ncan bridge that. We know we want simplicity and flexibility. We know we \nwant a decision as quickly as we can get it. What I hope we can also \nagree upon is that we also must recognize the need for farmers to be \nresponsible--to have the freedom to farm, but to be responsible with \ntaxpayer dollars. If we can do that, then, indeed, I am optimistic that \nwe will reach an agreement. We will be able to send the farm community \na clear message that, indeed, we have done what we should have done a \nlong time ago--pass a farm bill that will take us well into the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the Nation's Capital today hosted the 44th \nAnnual National Prayer Breakfast, and I take note that the Presiding \nOfficer was likewise the presiding officer at this historic moment, \nattended by the President and the First Lady, the Vice President and \nhis lady and a number of Members of the House of Representatives and \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I say to my good friend, the Presiding Officer, the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, that he mastered a unique and challenging situation, \ngiven the number of speakers and knowing that the President would \nconclude, as he did, with very moving remarks.\n  I think the Presiding Officer would agree with me that above all, the \nremarks of the principal speaker, that of the distinguished senior \nSenator from Georgia, Sam Nunn, were of such merit that they deserve \npreservation for posterity for future generations. Likewise, our other \ncolleague, Senator Simpson, made a very valued contribution. Of course, \nthe Scripture was read by a third distinguished Senator, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun. I had the privilege earlier today \nto place into the Record the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] and the distinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nNunn].\n  But as I watched the proceedings of the Senate tonight, it occurred \nto me that the hour is late, and knowing that the Presiding Officer, in \npreparation to meet today's challenge, probably arose at around 5 in \nthe morning, I think it most appropriate that he be relieved of his \nofficial duties, and I propose to do so at this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/01/senate-section/article/S869-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 141\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

It will be up to them. We have tried it for an hour and a half. \nMy view is that it should not be our concern what the House does. They \nare a separate body and they wish to adjourn until the 26th of \nFebruary.
