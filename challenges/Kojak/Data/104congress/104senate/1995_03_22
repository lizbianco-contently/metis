Mr. President, under the order, the freshmen have an hour \nreserved this morning to talk about the line-item veto. I am happy to \njoin in that.\n  The first to present views will be the president of the class, the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  I yield him as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding this time \non this very significant subject.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening attentively to the discussion \nthat has been taking place in the Chamber on the line-item veto. I \nthink there may be some misconceptions floating around as to who really \nwants a line-item veto and how much they want it, and who perhaps does \nnot want it.\n  I have heard over and over again, as I was sitting in the chair where \nthe President pro tempore is presiding, Senators standing up and \nsaying, ``Our President, President Clinton, wants the line-item veto. \nWe need to give it to him so he will have the ability to veto those \nitems and spending bills that are out of line.''\n  I suggest that, even though the President has made the statement, ``I \nwant a strong line-item veto bill and I want it very soon,'' that that \nis the same thing he said about a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. And we were to find out later that he was the one who led \nthe opposition to the balanced budget amendment on the telephone, \nlobbying those Democrats who had previously committed themselves to a \nbalanced budget amendment. I suggest this may even be happening today.\n  The reason I say that, Mr. President, is not to make an attack on \nPresident Clinton or to question anything that he has said. But the \nidea of the President having the ability to use this new device, a \nline-item veto, to take top spending things, pork items, out of a bill \ndoes not seem to make any sense to me.\n  If you look back to 1993, when President Clinton came up with his \nbudget and tax hike, it was characterized by many people, including \nPatrick Moynihan, as the largest tax increase in the history of public \nfinance or anyplace in the world. It was a $267 billion tax increase, \nwith all kinds of spending increases. The taxes went back retroactively \nto January of 1993, and that is the first time I can remember that \nhappening. It increased the top rate to 36 percent. Then it went in and \nstarted taxing Social Security recipients.\n  Now, this was kind of interesting because in arguing against the \nbalanced budget amendment, they were trying to use Social Security as \nthe argument against the balanced budget amendment when in fact this \nPresident in 1993 increased dramatically the taxes on Americans' Social \nSecurity. Of course, it was not a good argument anyway, because if we \ndo not do something to get the budget under control, \n[[Page S4296]]  whether we use the balanced budget amendment or line-\nitem veto or anything else, there will not be anything left in Social \nSecurity anyway in another 15 years.\n  In that same bill, he increased the taxes on gasoline by 4.3 percent. \nHe increased the corporate rate up to 36 percent. And in spite of all \nthe increases in taxes, 267 billion dollars' worth, it would increase \nthe debt by $1.4 trillion over a 5-year period.\n  My question would be: Would he have line-item vetoed any of those \nitems? No, because this was his bill.\n  Then he came out with the stimulus plan. This was a $16.3 billion \nincrease in spending, with all kinds of pork. I was very happy that a \nfilibuster, led by Senator Dole, was successful in giving him his first \ndefeat.\n  But if you look at what he tried to pass--a $1 billion summer jobs \nprogram; $1.1 billion for a variety of items, such as AIDS and food \ndistribution; a $1.2 billion subsidy to Amtrak and to subways and light \nrail packages that are located in the districts of certain friendly \npeople, I suspect; a $2.5 billion pork-barrel bunch of items--swimming \npools, parking lots, ice rink warming huts, an Alpine ski lift, and \nother pork-barrel projects.\n  Now, the question is, if this had passed and he had the ability to \nuse a line-item veto, would he have done it? No. The answer is a \nresounding no, because this is what he was promoting.\n  So, I think that we need to look at this in a little different \ncontext, and that is, we are going to have one of two different kinds \nof Presidents of the United States. Either we are going to have one \nlike President Clinton, who is the biggest tax-and-spend President in \ncontemporary history, or in a couple of years, when this agony is over, \nwe are going to have a conservative President.\n  Now, regardless of whether we have a Democrat or Republican, or a \nconservative or liberal, a line-item veto is very helpful to us. \nBecause if it is a liberal President who is for taxing and spending, \nsuch as our current President, then this takes away his excuse for \nsigning big spending bills.\n  What have we seen historically in this country? We have seen bills \ncoming in with 25, 30, or 50 items unrelated to each other, all this \npork, such as that which was included in his stimulus bill, and he \nsays--\n\n       I have to sign it, because if I do not, we will not get the \n     veterans' cost-of-living adjustments or we will not get a \n     Social Security adjustment, or something that people want, \n     and that is good and is consistent with the philosophy and \n     the desires of a majority serving in both bodies.\n\n  So this would take away the ability of someone who is trying to use \nthat for an excuse to pass pork-barrel legislation so that he could not \ndo it, and would make him accountable.\n  Let us say we have a conservative President. It would work equally \nwell there, because a conservative President could go through and he \ncould line out this pork stuff and could send it back for an override.\n  I will conclude by saying that we often overlook the real reason for \na line-item veto. It is not that it is going to be the cure-all. It is \nnot going to balance the budget. It is not going to do all these \nthings.\n  It is a vehicle to be helpful. However, what it does do is make the \nPresident and the House and the Senate accountable. If we have a \nliberal President or a conservative President, that President will have \nto be accountable for his acts, because with this ability to line out \nitems and veto specific items, a President can no longer say that he \nhas to do it.\n  Then the glorious thing about it is it goes to the House or the \nSenate and there is a veto attempt to override, and that way we have to \ngo on record--Members of the House, Members of the Senate, and the \nPresident.\n  None of those now have to be accountable to the people back home. I \nhave often said, none of this silliness, the foolishness that goes on \nin Washington would happen if people were held accountable for their \nacts. That is exactly what the line-item veto would do. So regardless \nof what kind of President we have, regardless of the philosophy of \nCongress, a line-item veto does make Congress accountable. And that \nserves the American people best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me simply say I endorse this notion of \naccountability. If there is anything that is necessary in this \nGovernment and something that this bill will help to do, it is \naccountability.\n  I yield now to the Senator from Pennsylvania for as much time as he \nmay consume.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Wyoming, and I appreciate the \nindulgence of my friend, Senator Grams, from Minnesota, who has let me \njump ahead to speak.\n  I have just two major points to make here this morning. One of the \nreasons I wanted to come down here, one of the reasons the freshmen \nwere so excited about talking about this line-item veto bill, because \nthis is actually a bill where the Senate version of the Contract With \nAmerica bill is actually stronger than the House version. The Senate \nbill is actually a tougher bill, is actually a bill that goes after \nmore spending, that provides more power, in fact, to the President, to \nkeep Congress in check here of providing pork or other kinds of \npreferential treatment to selected individuals or institutions in this \ncountry.\n  That is an exciting thing to stand here on the Senate floor and argue \nfor. I am very pleased with the work that was done by the folks here, \nSenator Domenici, Senator McCain, Senator Coats, and Senator Stevens, \nin putting this bill together. It is a stronger bill.\n  It does not just go after appropriations or annual appropriations, \nwhich all the traditional line-item veto bills have done. But it goes \nafter what are called tax expenditures, or tax provisions that are \ntargeted at specific individuals or specific companies. It does not go \nafter tax cuts. It allows tax cuts to go into place without threat of \nPresidential lining out, but it does go after sort of those favored \ntreatment things, those little goodies that have slipped into tax bills \nthat heretofore have never been included in any line-item veto \nproposal.\n  It goes after entitlement spending. New entitlement spending is now \nseparated out so we can have an opportunity to go after that which has \nnever before been done. This is a much better bill, one that I think \neveryone can be supportive of, and I think we will get strong support.\n  My final comment is I just hope that this institution does not \ndisintegrate, as it did on the balanced budget amendment, into playing \npartisan politics on things that people in the past have agreed to. I \nhave a list of Members on the Democratic side of the aisle who, in the \nlast 4 or 5 years, have voted consistently in many cases for line-item \nveto bills, for bills similar to this one--like the Bradley bill a few \nyears ago, which got, I think, 16 Democratic supporters.\n  This is a bill that should and was drafted to attract bipartisan \nsupport. If this bill does not succeed on cloture today--if we have a \ncloture vote today, which I anticipate, I guess we will--if it does not \nsucceed, it is not because the other side does not agree with what we \nare doing. It is because the other side does not agree to do anything \nand they want to play partisan politics and put partisanship above \npolicy and the better future for our children and for this country.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would just like to say briefly, I think \nit is significant that the freshmen have joined together in the Senate \nto come to speak again on this issue. Most have indicated our support. \nI think this is a demonstration of those who are newly elected who are \ntaking a look, first, at what the voters said in November; and second, \nare not encumbered by the debates that have gone on here before, but \nrather are interested in making some changes in process so that there \ncan be changes in results.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments during this \nvery important debate over the line-item veto to remind my colleagues \nhere in the Senate of the revolution that is taking place next door.\n  In the House Chamber, our colleagues are making history. They are \nthrowing out 40 years of bloated, irresponsible government and \nreplacing it with new \n[[Page S4297]]  ideas, a new spirit, a new partnership with the \nAmerican people.\n  They have passed the balanced budget amendment in the House. They \nhave passed regulatory relief and legal reform. They have voted to \nstrengthen our national defense, to crack down on crime, and to rein in \nGovernment spending.\n  In fact, so far, they have passed every piece of legislation they \npromised to pass in the Contract With America. At the breakneck pace \nthe House is keeping, our colleagues there will meet their self-imposed \n100-day deadline and still have a week to spare.\n  People back home ask me what it is like to be part of this \nrevolution. I say, ``I don't know, because I am in the Senate.'' The \nHouse is passing history, and too often all we seem to be passing is \ntime.\n  We would like to tell ourselves we are the more deliberative body, \nthat here in the Senate, passion is tempered by prudence. Nobody is \ngoing to ride roughshod over the Senate, we boast. But not meeting our \nresponsibilities is not a new definition of being deliberative. Maybe \nwhat we are doing is exactly what our Founding Fathers intended \nCongress to do. But maybe, though, some just did not hear the message \nin November, when Americans took the promises of the Contract With \nAmerica with them to the polls, and there they cast their ballots for \nchange.\n  ``But I did not sign any contracts. I haven't even read it,'' I heard \nsome of my Senate colleagues protest. Maybe not. But he might just as \nwell have, Mr. President, because when the American people think about \nthe U.S. Congress, there is no thick, black curtain separating the \nHouse from the Senate. They just see Congress, and it is Congress as a \nwhole--not just the House of Representatives, not just House \nRepublicans--that will be held to the promises in the contract.\n  Of course, if the American people seem a little suspicious when it \ncomes to our promises, well, maybe they have a right to be. We have \nalready let them down once this year. The first plank in the contract, \nthe Fiscal Responsibility Act, calls for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. The House passed it, but the Senate voted it down. \nEven though 85 percent of the American people said they wanted it, and \nsaid our financial future may depend on it, we voted it down.\n  The voters have a right to be furious. They thought we had promised a \nbalanced budget amendment. Now, how can we possibly explain that it was \nreally the House, not the Senate, without sounding a lot like political \ntrickery?\n  Try to explain that Congress as a whole does not have to balance its \nbudget, that somehow Congress is special, or it can act irresponsibly \nand it does not affect the taxpayers of this country.\n  The Fiscal Responsibility Act now also calls for a line-item veto. \nAgain, a vast majority of Americans, 64 percent of them, consider the \npassage of a line-item veto as a high or a top priority. It is one of \nthe bold print provisions of the Contract With America--a \nnonretractable promise--and it, too, has already passed in the House. \nBut like the balanced budget amendment, it may also face trouble here \nin the Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, whether they like it or not, Senate Republicans \nare tied to the legislative coattails of the Contract With America \nright alongside our House colleagues, because it is what Americans want \nCongress to do.\n  Senate Democrats will be held accountable as well, because for the \nmost part, the American people do not care whether a certain piece of \nlegislation is a Republican bill or whether it is a Democratic bill. \nThey care about legislation that is going to help their families and \nprotect the future for their children and their grandchildren.\n  Now, the line-item veto is one of those bills, a bill that is not \nabout politics, a bill that is simply about doing the right thing. If \nwe do our job right, young people will someday hear stories about how \nthe revolution of November 8, 1994, transformed the Nation. Old timers \nwill look back to this Congress and wonder at the courage that it took \nto effect such a tremendous change. Or maybe the 104th Congress will go \ndown in history as one-termers who promised change but failed to \ndeliver.\n  If the line-item veto and the $500 per child tax credit go the way of \nthe balanced budget amendment, you can guess what the history books \nwill be saying about us.\n  Mr. President, this is your contract, this is my contract, this is \nAmerica's contract, and whether my Senate colleagues signed it or not, \nthis is their contract, too.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the tree of liberty is nourished by \nelections, which water and grow the process of good government. Last \nNovember, we got a real shower. The people of the United States of \nAmerica said that they wanted us to change the way we do business in \nWashington, DC. They wanted us to live by the laws that we established \nfor others, and so we provide for congressional accountability. They \nwanted us to stop telling State governments and city councils how to \nspend their money. Soon, S. 1 will be signed into law by the President. \nBut there is another very important aspect of what the people told us. \nThey said they wanted us to live within our means, like every household \nmust live within its means.\n  Last month, we failed to pass the balanced budget amendment. It was a \ntragedy, but that was the loss of a battle, not the war. Now, the \nAmerican people are waiting--and the world community is waiting--to see \nwhether or not we, as a government, will live within our means, as well \nas embrace the kind of tools which will allow us to get the job done.\n  Every kitchen table in America has a line-item veto, Mr. President. \nWe sit down with the resources we have and we look at the list of \nthings we would like to buy, and we scratch off the things we can't \nafford. That is the line-item veto. It is that simple.\n  It means nothing more than saying that we will not spend money we do \nnot have, and we will mark through things which we cannot afford. \nUnfortunately, the U.S. Congress has never seen it that way. We send \nthe President a great big wish list and indicate that he has to either \nthrow away the entire list or else sign it into law. Ridiculous. Few \nAmericans would approach the kitchen table and say, ``If we can't have \nthe frills, we don't want the food.'' We all know that there are \nthings, both good and bad, that we can't always afford.\n  So it is important for us to respond to the voters' desire to change \nthe way Washington works. The American people have spoken. They have \nspoken clearly. It is time now for us to act.\n  Now, there are a variety of voices being raised against the line-item \nveto. While these voices are loud, they are also misleading. They have \nbeen saying that if we have the line-item veto or the balanced budget \namendment, we will hurt Social Security.\n  Mr. President, the biggest threat to Social Security is a Nation \nwhich does not have the fiscal and financial integrity to address and \ndeal with its national debt. When we force the President to have an \nall-or-nothing approach to the budgets we forward, we increase the \nlikelihood of fiscal mismanagement.\n  This has several negative effects. First, it increases the interest \nthat we pay to service the debt. A 1-percent rise in interest rates on \nthe national debt costs us $35 billion a year. Second, it decreases \nconfidence in the dollar. We saw what happened when we failed to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment. When people are insecure about America's \neconomy and about our fiscal discipline, they are less likely to \nfinance our debt. In the end, it is our inability to meet these fiscal \nobligations that is the single greatest threat to Social Security.\n  Another argument against the line-item veto, Mr. President, is that \nit would impair the rights of children; that somehow, if we have fiscal \nintegrity and financial management, we will hurt our children. The \ntruth of the matter is that we are spending the yet unearned wages of \nthe next generation today. We are destroying their future. \n[[Page S4298]]  We are eroding the financial foundation of the country \nthat they will ultimately lead. We are mortgaging their future, and it \nis wrong. We need a strong country that will provide a foundation and \nframework in which those children can be prosperous. The line-item veto \nwould help do just that.\n  Mr. President, others have argued that we are eroding the \nConstitution. I, however, would argue that the Constitution came into \nexistence as a protest against the improper taxation of Americans \nwithout representation. If we do not control spending, we are taxing \nthe next generation. If we have a balanced budget and if we move toward \nit with a line-item veto, we are acting in a way that is entirely \nconsistent with the actions and the intent of the Framers.\n  This is the U.S. Senate. It is not a packing house. This debate is \nnot about the Constitution, it is a debate about whether we are a \npacking house, or a place of public policy.\n  So, we must recognize the voice of the people in their call for \nchange. We must provide the President an opportunity to knock out \ninappropriate spending without vetoing an entire bill. We must protect \nSocial Security with financial integrity. We must protect our children \nby not mortgaging their future. We must protect the idea of the \nConstitution by not taxing the next generation without representation. \nWe must eliminate pork. We must, in the end, serve all the people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from Ohio for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the legislative line-item veto. The line-item veto will be a very \neffective tool in helping this country achieve a balanced budget.\n  Let us be clear, though, Mr. President. This is not some sort of \nmagic potion that is going to solve all of our problems. We are going \nto be faced with very, very difficult choices that we as Members of the \nSenate and House will have to make in the upcoming months in regard to \nour budget. But while it is not a magic potion or magic wand, it is a \nreasonable, rational tool, a tool that will help us achieve this very \nimportant fiscal goal. This legislation will give the President the \npower most Governors already have, the power to cut wasteful spending \nitems and special tax breaks out of the budget.\n  I believe, though, that this power which most Governors have today \nand which I hope the President will have after we pass this bill is \nvaluable not because of what the Chief Executive actually vetoes. \nRather, the true importance of the line-item veto lies in its value as \na deterrent. I believe the passage of this bill will change the climate \nin which Congress operates just as it has affected the climate in which \nmost of our State legislators operate.\n  Think of all the wasteful taxing and spending provisions that will \nnever be included in legislation, never be included simply because \nCongress knows that the provision will not stand up to public scrutiny, \nwill not stand up to scrutiny in the light of day.\n  This I believe is the real value of the line-item veto at the State \nlevel, and it would be equally valuable at the Federal level.\n  Talk to the Governors. My colleague from Missouri, who just sat down, \nwas a Governor, and he outlined for us several days ago some of the \nprovisions that he had to veto as a Governor and why he made those \ndecisions and how he felt that was an effective tool. Governors I have \ntalked to say the same thing.\n  When you really pin the Governors down, what they will tell you \nusually--it is what Governor Voinovich has told me--is that the value \nof the line-item veto is not so much in what they do veto but, rather, \nin the fact that the legislature does not put certain items in the bill \nbecause they know the Governor has that veto, and so that is really the \ntrue value, it is the value of the deterrent.\n  Frankly, I do not expect to see a huge number of vetoed items when we \npass this legislation. We may, but I do not think so. The very \nexistence of the line-item veto will prevent these items from ever \nbeing included in these bills in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I know there are some of our colleagues who are \nconcerned that any form of a line-item veto would effectively transfer \npower from this body and from the House to the executive branch, to the \nPresident. I understand those concerns. But I think if we look at this \nfrom a historical point of view, what we will really find is that the \npassage of this legislation is merely restoring the balance of power to \nwhere it was many, many years ago.\n  As a practical matter, I believe passage of this bill will return us \nto the situation that originally existed in Congress when Presidents in \nthe early days of this country were presented with simpler and shorter \nbills. I believe the Framers of the Constitution had that in mind when \nthey wrote the Constitution, and when the original provision about the \nveto was put into law.\n  Over the last several decades, the Federal legislative process has \nreally gotten out of hand. For too long the process has been distorted \nand perverted by the practice of enacting huge omnibus bills which the \nPresident is forced to accept or reject in their entirety. This \nhistoric change I believe has been for the worse.\n  Appropriations bills, tax bills, entitlement bills, the passage of \nthese bills is followed, many times within a week or two, by a story in \nthe paper outlining all the hidden projects, all the hidden provisions \nthat somehow were put in a bill at the last moment, maybe in a \nconference committee. If these special projects or special tax breaks \nhad to stand alone in the clear light of day, they simply would not \nwithstand public scrutiny and, quite frankly, would never be included \nat all.\n  The line-item veto will help take us back to the original legislative \nprocess, an original legislative process in which we can count on the \nPresident to represent the national interest in deciding on the value \nof legislation. Today the President is hindered in this important \nconstitutional duty. He must either accept or reject outright these \nhuge taxing and spending bills that contain literally thousands of \nseparate line items. Some of the line items, Mr. President, are \nnecessary. Some are desirable but not necessary. Some are questionable, \nand some are downright indefensible. Congress regularly says to the \nPresident take it or leave it. If you think the national interest \nrequires the passage of some of what is in the bill, you have to sign \nall of the bill.\n  By now we are all familiar with thousands of examples of Federal \nspending items, special tax breaks that would never have been approved \nif those responsible for them were truly held accountable to the \nAmerican people. The line-item veto is tailor-made to solve this \nproblem. Eleven former Presidents have endorsed it. Forty-three of our \nNation's Governors have it, and it works. In 1992, the Cato Institute \nsurveyed current and former Governors, and 92 percent of them believed \nthat the line-item veto would help restrain Federal spending.\n  I think they are right. That is why I will be voting for the \nlegislative line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  I think it is interesting and important that the newer Members of the \nSenate have come here today to talk about the line-item veto. They have \ntalked about accountability, accountability in Government. Nothing can \nbe more important than that.\n  They have talked about change, change based on issues, not change \nbased on partisan political things.\n  They talked as well about responsibility of the President to take a \nlook at these items as they are returned from Congress. They talked \nabout the fact that families do this every day. Families have to set \npriorities. Families have to go through their budget and say here are \nsome things that are less important than others, we cannot afford them \nall, and we have to line-item veto.\n  They have talked about business as usual, which I guess is a \nreasonable thing and predictable thing for new Members of the Senate to \ntalk about because they have not been a part of business as usual. \nIndeed, they came here--having talked about these issues at home, \nhaving talked about them \n[[Page S4299]]  with the voters--with a dedication to change. They \ntalked about items that appear in large budgets that are passed because \nthey are in large budgets, that would not pass on their own merits, \nthat would not even be considered if they were to stand alone.\n  So I think it is important that this point of view be stressed. I \nthink it is important this group of Senators who come with a little \ndifferent view of the world, perhaps, in terms of not having been here, \nexpress their views in these particular areas.\n  We have the Senator from Michigan, who will be here shortly.\n  This is one of the items that does speak to change, one of the items \nthat we have been considering and we are hopeful there will be passage \nof this week. We are hopeful that some accommodation will be made.\n  Let me talk a little bit, however, about the broader context, it \nseems to me, that line-item veto fits into. We have talked about it for \na week. I suspect we will talk about it for much of this week. It has \nbeen talked about last year. It has been talked about in previous \nyears. It is not a new item, not a new issue. We have talked about the \ndetails. Maybe it is useful to talk a little bit about how it fits into \na broader context, and to understand that it does have something to do \nwith the overall role of Government, the overall size of Government, \nthe overall impact of Government on people's lives.\n  There is a legitimate difference. There is a legitimate reason to \nhave debates about the things that go on here. There are those who \nbelieve more Government is better; that the Government should be \nexpanded; that there should be more spending; that the Government \nshould have more programs. There is another point of view, the one that \nI share, the one that I think was the message of this November's \nelection. That is the Federal Government is too big and that it costs \ntoo much and that it is overly intrusive into all aspects of our lives.\n  That is a legitimate debate. In fact, that is the core of much of the \ndebate that goes on here, what you perceive to be the role of \nGovernment and what, indeed, then, goes with that. If you see more \nGovernment, then there are going to be more regulations. If you see \nmore Government there are going to be more taxes, or more debt, or \nboth. But, in fact, if you see the role of Government as one of a \nreferee, one whose primary responsibility is defense, and ensuring \nfairness, ensuring opportunity, then you see the Government as somewhat \nsmaller, as something less intrusive. And that is really the underlying \ndebate in much of what we talk about, the role of Government--and, of \ncourse, who pays for it.\n  That has been true in the procedural issues that we have talked \nabout, the issues that have to do with changing the process, with \nchanging the structure of the way decisions are made. Frankly, if you \nexpect to have a different result you are going to have to do something \ndifferent. If you want to continue to do everything in the same way as \nyou have in the past, then the expectation is the results are going to \nbe the same. If we continue to use the same process there is no reason \nto expect that the debt or the deficit is going to be smaller.\n  We will be voting this summer on a new debt limit. That new debt \nlimit will be $5 trillion or more--$5 trillion debt. Each of us as \ncitizens shares in that debt. The interest payment on that debt will \nsoon be the second largest item, line item in the Federal budget. This \nyear I think it is somewhere in the neighborhood of $260 to $265 \nbillion interest on the debt. So the procedural things we have talked \nabout have to do with changing the results.\n  The balanced budget amendment is a procedural change, one that in my \nview needs to be made. Line-item veto, another of those--not to balance \nthe budget, it will not balance the budget--but it changes the \ncharacter of budget considerations; it changes how you look; it changes \nsome of the responsibilities.\n  We have to change budgeting, change it so we start from a base that \nis the same as last year's spending, not a baseline that goes up. That \nis what has caused much of the discussion around the country, that \neverything is being cut. The fact is it is not being cut. There was a \ngroup in my office yesterday talking about an educational program, \nabout the cuts. The fact is the cut is 25 percent of the increase. It \nis not a cut. But based on budgeting it seems to be a cut. So we \ncontinue to spend more with the sort of notion that we have had a cut, \nand indeed we have not had a cut at all, we have had an increase.\n  These are the kinds of changes that do need to be made. Line-item \nveto needs to be there because things are done differently. Someone the \nother day on the floor showed an early--150 years ago--bill on \nappropriations: On one page. On the other hand, we looked at one that \nis 2\\1/2\\ pounds now.\n  My favorite story, of course, is always the Lawrence Welk Museum that \nis in the highway bill. In the House we had no opportunity to talk \nabout the Lawrence Welk Museum. We did not want to vote against the \nhighway bill. The Lawrence Welk Museum would have never gotten any \nattention at all had it had to stand on its own merit, but it was there \nand line-item veto is what that is all about.\n  So we do have big bills. We have big deficits. And the fact of the \nmatter is it is difficult. All of us have a certain parochial interest. \nThat is the way it is. I represent Wyoming. The President represents \nVermont. We all have a parochial interest, and should. So we are for \nthings that are for our State. It is very difficult to be against \nsomebody else's proposal, because you want their help. That is a fact \nof life. It is a fact of life. So we do need a line-item veto. And \nthere are pork-barrel activities.\n  So, Mr. President, it begins to be increasingly important that we do \ntake a look at these structural changes. The argument that we do not \nneed to change things, we can just change them because they should be \nchanged--the evidence does not support that. How many years has it been \nsince we balanced the budget--25? Maybe five times in 50 years? So that \ndoes not work.\n  Now is the time to make that tough decision. And we have an \nopportunity here to do that. We have an opportunity to pass a bill that \nhas had support in this Chamber, more than enough to pass it, and now \nis the time.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from Arizona for as much \ntime as he may consume.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding \nthis time to me. I appreciate his work on trying to finally get this \nline-item veto passed.\n  Mr. President, I think most people agree that the top priority of the \nFederal Government today is to reduce the size of the budget deficit. \nNot to do so is to relegate all of us--especially our children--to a \nlower standard of living.\n  Balancing the Federal budget will not be easy. Some popular programs \nwill have to be cut. Others will have to be eliminated as Congress \nfinally begins to set priorities--to distinguish between needs and \nwants--just like families across America must do every day.\n  When a family runs short of money, it does not sacrifice food from \nthe table or the roof overhead to go to the movies every weekend, to \nbuy new furniture, or put a new stereo in the car. The choices that a \nfamily has to make are often far more difficult--whether to buy new \nclothes for the kids or supplies for school; whether to buy food or \nmedicine; whether to fix the roof or repair the car. When resources are \nlimited, the family eliminates the extras and then tries its best to \nmeet its basic needs. Even that can be trying. The head of the \nhousehold has to make tough choices that will not necessarily be very \npopular with the rest of the family, but that is what it takes to try \nto make sure the family can survive and prosper.\n  Like the family, the Federal Government cannot satisfy every want; it \ncannot even answer every need. With interest payments on the national \ndebt eating up a substantial part of the Federal budget--about $300 \nbillion this year alone--we are finding ourselves with less and less \nevery year for many basic Government programs. Hurt most are those who \nare dependent upon Government services--the poor and the elderly--and \nour children and grandchildren whose future will be marked by a lower \nstandard of living as they struggle to pay off the debts we are \naccumulating today.\n  [[Page S4300]] The line-item veto is no panacea, but it is an \nimportant first step in gaining control over the budget.\n  Mr. President, this is the ``1995 Congressional Pig Book Summary,'' a \nlist of 88 projects that will cost taxpayers more than $1 billion. \nCompiled by the nonpartisan organization, Citizens Against Government \nWaste, it represents just a fraction of more than $10 billion in pork-\nbarrel spending that the group identified in last year's appropriations \nbills. These are the kinds of projects that are likely to be the target \nof a line-item veto: Russian wheat aphid and swine research; highway \ndemonstration projects; civilian sporting events funded out of the \ndefense budget; and a program that has used funds in the past for a \ngolf video and pony trekking centers in Ireland.\n  These are the kinds of projects that are typically hidden away in \nannual spending bills. They are enough to demonstrate legislators' \nability to bring home the bacon and curry favor with special interest \ngroups back home. But, they usually don't amount to enough to prompt \nthe President to veto an entire bill bringing large parts of the \nGovernment to a standstill in the process. The result, as Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste put it, is that it all adds up to a raw deal \nfor taxpayers.\n  The line-item veto is designed to bring accountability to the budget \nprocess. Instead of forcing the President to accept wasteful and \nunnecessary spending in order to protect important programs, it puts \nthe onus on special interests and their congressional patrons. It \nsubjects projects with narrow special interests to a more stringent \nstandard than programs of national interest. After a Presidential veto, \nthe special interests would have to win a two-thirds majority in each \nHouse.\n  That is the shift in the balance of power which the line-item veto \nrepresents. It is a shift in favor of taxpayers, and it is long \noverdue. If the government were running a surplus, the taxpayers might \nbe willing to tolerate some extra projects. But the Government is \nrunning annual deficits in the range of $200 billion for as far as the \neye can see. There is no extra money to go around. There is not even \nenough to fund more basic needs.\n  Mr. President, when you find yourself in a hole, the first rule of \nthumb is to stop digging. Our Presidents have indicated a willingness \nto use the line-item veto--begin climbing out of the hole we have dug \nfor ourselves and future generations. Let us pass the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by complimenting my colleague from \nthe State of Arizona, Senator John McCain. He has worked for about 10 \nyears in opposition to pork-barrel spending on the floor of the Senate. \nHe accumulated what he calls an enviable record of defeat. Frequently, \nhis efforts to cut out pork are defeated by almost 2 to 1. But he keeps \nat it, and over the years he figures that, while he may not have won \nevery vote, his efforts to bring to light some of these projects may at \nleast have prevented some Members from inserting this pork in the \nappropriations bill in the first instance because of the fear that they \nmight be embarrassed if their special-interest projects are brought to \nlight.\n  That is what the line-item veto would do. It not only gives the \nPresident the ability to line out projects that have been inserted, but \nit provides a disincentive for Members to put those projects in the \nbill in the first instance because now, with the President being \ncapable of lining them out and bringing them to public attention, \nMembers know that they had better be able to defend everything that \nthey ask to be inserted into these bills.\n  So it has a good effect on Members and their constituents, who come \nto them asking for special interest projects to say, ``Maybe in the \npast, I would have been able to do this, and I would like to do it to \nbe of help to you, but you know that if we do it, all of the world will \nknow that the President could line it out, and then I would have to get \ntwo-thirds of my colleagues to override the veto. Do you really want \nthat much public attention paid to this special project?''\n  So there is a deterrent effect, if you will, in the line-item veto. \nThat is one of the things that John McCain has talked about when he has \nstumped for this proposal in the last 10 years. I think a great deal of \ncredit goes to Senator Coats, Senator McCain, and most recently, \nSenators Stevens and Domenici, who had different points of view but got \ntogether with the supporters of this basic version of the line-item \nveto proposal to work out a compromise that is acceptable to virtually \nall.\n  The President is supportive of the line-item veto. All of the \nRepublicans are ready to call an end to the debate at the appropriate \ntime, and have a vote on the line-item veto. We certainly call on our \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle who support frugality in \nGovernment and understand we need to balance the budget and want to end \npork-barrel spending to support us in this effort to vote for the line-\nitem veto.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, \nis here. I am sure he has some comments on the subject, as well. If the \nSenator from Wyoming is agreeable, I will yield at this time to the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nArizona and say that I have observed him in his work in the House. He \nhas been a real supporter of change with the line-item veto and with \nthe balanced budget amendment, and has been a leader in the House, and \ncontinues to be that.\n  I now yield for 4 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to commend Senator \nThomas and Senator Santorum for leading the charge of the 11 freshmen \nSenators in support of the line-item veto. It is important that the \nnewest Members of this body continue to voice the message from \nAmericans on November 8.\n  Mr. President, no single measure would do more to restore fiscal \nsanity to our budget process than the line-item veto. We, like our \nRepublican colleagues in the House, must continue to push for reforms \nthat will bring real change to the way business is done in Washington. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the press and defenders of the status \nquo will think of all kinds of reasons why the line-item veto is not a \ngood idea. But the truth of the matter is, the President must be \nprovided with precise tools to control Congress' insatiable appetite \nfor spending the taxpayer's money.\n  Mr. President, I understand that in years past, Democrat opponents of \nthe line-item veto charged that the Republican support of the concept \nwas a partisan power grab. The thought was that the Republicans in \nCongress, then in the minority, wanted to transfer power to their \nRepublican President. And now, a Democrat President supports the \nmeasure, but there is still staunch opposition.\n  Now the opponents claim that enactment of the line-item veto would be \nan unprecedented power shift. In fact, the President had the power to \nstop unnecessary spending, through a process called impoundment, until \nthe Congress stripped the Presidency of this power in 1974. Granting a \nline-item veto is not unprecedented. Rather, supporters of the line-\nitem veto want to restore the rightful budgetary powers of the \nPresident.\n  Opponents also claim that the line-item veto will not work. Well, Mr. \nPresident, that is just not true. Forty-three of our Nation's Governors \nhave this power, and they have shown over and over again that they can \nand do save money with this tool.\n  Mr. President, again, I strongly support this measure, and I urge the \nMembers of this body to join the 11 freshmen in our strong support for \nthe Dole substitute.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, thank you very much for the time for this \ngroup to express its support of this issue.\n  It seems to me that we have an opportunity to make some decisions \nhere. We are here as trustees for the American people, as trustees who \nhave a responsibility to be financially responsible, fiscally \nresponsible, and morally responsible for spending. The easier thing to \ndo is to continue as we have. Now is the chance, however, to change.\n  To borrow from Robert Frost who said, ``Two roads diverged in the \nwoods \n[[Page S4301]]  and I chose the one less traveled by, and that has made \nall the difference.''\n  This may be the road less traveled by, but it will indeed make all \nthe difference.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4295-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4301-S4312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Robb, Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 403 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, strike lines 13 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       (5) the term ``targeted tax benefit'' means any provision \n     which has the practical effect of providing a benefit in the \n     form of a different treatment to a particular taxpayer or a \n     limited class of taxpayers, whether or not such provision is \n     limited by its terms to a particular taxpayer or a class of \n     taxpayers but such term does not include any benefit provided \n     to a class of taxpayers distinguished on the basis of general \n     demographic conditions such as income, number of dependents, \n     or marital status.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we begin this Congress with, I think, two obligations. \nThe first is to change the way we do business, and the second is to cut \nGovernment spending. I think reform has been bottled up for years.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe now is the time to adopt a line-item \nveto and have the line-item veto applied both to tax expenditures and \nto appropriations. Two years ago, I introduced legislation that would \ngive the President the authority to veto wasteful spending in both \nappropriations and tax bills. I reintroduced this line-item veto the \nvery first day of this Congress, and its passage has been one of my \nhighest legislative priorities. The separate enrollment approach that I \nadopted was modeled on the bill offered by Senator Hollings and \nintroduced several Congresses ago. I want to thank and commend Senator \nHollings for his leadership on that issue.\n  Therefore, I am pleased to see that our Republican colleagues have \ncome to recognize the wisdom of the separate enrollment approach that \nSenator Hollings and I have been championing for years. I also want to \ncomment our colleagues across the aisle for taking steps to include tax \nexpenditures in the line-item veto bill they introduced yesterday. The \napproach our Senate colleagues have taken toward tax expenditures is a \nsignificant improvement over the approach adopted by the House.\n  We need to be honest with the American public about the fact that for \neach example of unnecessary, pork-barrel spending through an \nappropriations bill, there are numerous, similar examples of such \nspending buried in tax bills. The Tax Code provides special exceptions \nfrom taxes that will total over $450 billion this year, more than \ndouble the entire Federal deficit and nearly one-quarter of total \nFederal spending. Because many of these Tax Code provisions single out \nnarrow subclasses for benefit, the rest of us must pay more in taxes. \nHow serious can we be about balancing the budget if we let billions in \ntax pork go virtually unchallenged each year?\n  Mr. President, I believe that our fellow Americans would be shocked \nif they knew some of the ways we spend money through the Tax Code. My \nfavorite special-interest tax loophole is the roughly $100 million we \nwill give away over the next 5 years to allow homeowners to rent their \nhomes for up to 2 weeks without having to report any income. Word has \nit the provision was put in the Tax Code to benefit a rich homeowner \nwho lived near the Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta, GA. The lucky \nman hit the jackpot every year by renting his house to tournament \nspectators for a small fortune, without having to declare any of this \nmoney as income.\n  Then there is the $12 million in tax subsidies that go to help \nproducers offset the costs they incur to mine lead, asbestos, and \nuranium--deadly poisons we spend millions more to clean up. We also \ngive away a cool $60 million a year to corporations that make \nelectricity using plants and windmills. In addition, we generously \nallow U.S. citizens who work overseas to exclude $70,000 per year from \ntheir income taxes. Over the next 5 years, this loophole will cost the \nrest of us $8.6 billion.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I have seen an almost endless \nstream of requests for preferential treatment through the Tax Code. For \nexample, the 1992 tax bill was littered with special exemptions. In \nthat bill, we included a special accelerated depreciation schedule for \nrental tuxedos at a 5-year cost of $44 million to the rest of us. We \nalso provided special accounting rules for the owners of cotton \nwarehouses and created an special tax exemption for custom firearms \nmanufacturers and importers. Over the years, I have been presented with \nhundreds of other requests, including exemptions from fuel excise taxes \nfor crop-dusters and tax credits for clean-fuel vehicles.\n  There are obvious reasons why the American public knows so little \nabout these loopholes. They are often written in complicated language \nand buried deep in the Tax Code. In addition, unlike appropriated \nspending, which is reviewed every year, once a tax loophole becomes \nlaw, it rarely sees the light of day. In fact, according to a recent \nGAO study, almost 85 percent of the 1993 tax expenditure losses were \nattributable to tax\n expenditures that were enacted before 1950, and almost 50 percent of \nthese losses stem from tax expenditures enacted before 1920.\n\n  Reducing the deficit will require leadership, not gimmicks. In \npassing a line-item veto bill, we must demonstrate this same type of \nleadership. Sadly, I note that the line-item veto proposal passed by \nthe House resorts to what I would describe as a mere gimmick. By \ndefining ``targeted tax benefits'' to include only those loopholes that \nbenefit ``100 or fewer taxpayers,'' the House has forfeited an \nopportunity to address the impact that tax loopholes have on our \nNation's continuing budget crisis.\n  Mr. President, obviously, there are plenty examples of the so-called \nrifle shot tax giveaways. In 1988, the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a \nseries of articles which identified billions of dollars worth of tax \nloopholes in the 1986 and 1988 tax bills. As stated in that series, \nthese loopholes included special provisions for some trucking companies \nbut not others, for some insurance companies but not others, for some \nutilities but not others, for some universities but not others. Of \ncourse these special provisions should be subject to a potential veto. \nHowever, these rifle shots are not the only examples of wasteful \nspending through the Tax Code; there \n[[Page S4302]]  are plenty of other examples which benefit more than \n100 taxpayers.\n  In fact, of all of the loopholes that I described earlier, not even \none could be determined to benefit 100 or fewer taxpayers. The income \nexclusion for home rentals at the Masters Golf Tournament could benefit \nmore than 100 taxpayers. The tax subsidies given to corporations that \nmine lead, asbestos, and uranium could benefit more than 100 taxpayers. \nThe tax subsidies for electricity production from windmills and plants \ncould benefit more than 100 taxpayers. And, the tax giveaways to \ncitizens who work overseas benefit more than 100 people. Therefore, \nunder the House version of this bill, none of these tax loopholes would \nbe subject to a potential line-item veto if they were created today.\n  In addition to the fact that the House definition of a targeted tax \nbenefit would allow billions of dollar in tax expenditures to go \nunchecked, that definition leads to a number of practical problems. \nUnder the House version of the line-item veto, in order to veto pork in \na tax bill, the President would first have to determine that the \nloophole would benefit 100 or fewer taxpayers. No one knows how the \nPresident would make such a determination. As far as I am aware, no \nFederal agency keeps track of how many taxpayers benefit from \nindividual tax expenditures. Although this may seem surprising, it is \nunderstandable given that many tax expenditures consist of exclusions \nfrom income, rather than simple deductions. As a result, information on \nthe number of beneficiaries is not readily available. In fact, of the \n25 largest tax expenditures, 14 provide exclusions from income rather \nthan deductions. Although these are large and well known examples, \nthere are other examples of income exclusions for which the information \nwould not be readily available. Therefore, there is no easy way to \ndetermine how many taxpayers would benefit from a proposed tax \nexpenditure. In addition, what would happen if the President vetoed a \ntax loophole only to find out later that he did not have such authority \nbecause the provision would have benefited more than 100 taxpayers?\n  Even if one could determine how many taxpayers would benefit from a \nparticular loophole, it would be easy enough for any of the big dollar \nlobbyists that prowl the Halls of Congress to rework the loophole to \nmake it vetoproof. Clearly, if lobbyists are sophisticated enough to \ninsert a loophole into a tax bill in the first place, they will be more \nthan sophisticated enough to ensure that the language is sufficiently \nbroad that it escape a possible veto. Therefore, the ``100 or fewer'' \ndefinition will create a perverse incentive to make bigger and even \nmore expensive loopholes just to avoid the veto.\n  I am pleased to note that the version of line-item veto offered in \nthe Senate does not resort to the same gimmicks that the House used. \nThe language in the line-item veto before us today would make subject \nto a potential Presidential veto all new and expanded tax expenditures \nwhich both lose revenue during the\n any period of the budget window and have ``the practical effect of \nproviding more favorable tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or \nlimited group of taxpayers when compared to other similarly situated \ntaxpayers.''\n\n  Yesterday, Senator Domenici stated that this language would subject \nto a potential veto all tax expenditures which particular companies, \nbusinesses, or taxpayers relative to other taxpayers. I agree that this \nprovision would allow the President to veto new tax subsidies for \nindividual companies and industries such as the ethanol industry, small \noil and gas producers, dairy farmers, owners of cotton warehouses, and \nthe like. However, I am concerned that the version offered by our \nRepublican colleagues may lead to confusion and gaming. Although I \nbelieve that the language offered as part of the Republican substitute \nto S. 4 is very broad, a few of our colleagues have indicated that it \nmight be narrower than the language itself would suggest. In my mind, \nthe term ``when compared to other similarly situated taxpayers'' simply \nmakes explicit a comparison that was implicit in similar language in S. \n14.\n  Therefore, in order to clear up any confusion and to ensure that all \nnew tax loopholes are subject to the same scrutiny as other types of \nspending, I have sent to the desk an amendment that would authorize the \nPresident to veto wasteful spending in future tax bills.\n  Mr. President, the language in the amendment that I have offered is \nnot new, nor should it be particularly controversial. This language \nuses the exact same definition of ``targeted tax break'' as was \nincluded in S. 14, introduced by Senator Domenici and originally \ncosponsor by Senators Exon, Craig, Cohen, Dole, and me. Furthermore, \nthe amendment I have introduced uses the exact same language that our \nRepublican colleagues promised the Nation they would use when they \nintroduced their Contract With America. The language in this amendment, \nwhich was introduced in the House by then-Minority Leader Michel, \nsimply states that the President may veto those tax loopholes which \nhave ``the practical effect of providing a benefit in the form of a \ndifferent treatment to a particular taxpayer or a limited class of \ntaxpayers, whether or not such provision is limited by its terms to a \nparticular taxpayer or a class of taxpayers. Such term does not include \nany benefit provided to a class of taxpayers distinguished on the basis \nof general demographic conditions such as income, number of dependents, \nor marital status.''\n  By its very terms, this language does not cover those types of tax \nprovisions that provide general benefits. It would not subject a \nreduction in tax rates to a veto. Obviously, that would be a benefit \nfor all Americans. Similarly, it would not subject an expansion in the \nstandard deduction or the elimination of the marriage penalty to a \nveto. At the same time, the amendment that I have offered would not \neffect any of the provisions currently in the Tax Code. My amendment \nwould not allow the President to touch such provisions as the home \nmortgage interest deduction, the deduction for State and local taxes, \nor the deduction for charitable contributions. Instead, this amendment \nwould only effect new or expanded tax provisions.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to insert into the Record \ncopies of two letters, one from Dr. Rivlin at OMB and the other from \nDr. Reischauer at CBO, interpreting the language that I have \nintroduced. As our colleagues will note, these letters make clear that \nthe amendment that I have offered simply places spending through the \nTax Code on par with other types of spending. Adoption of my amendment \nwill prevent additional loopholes from creeping into the Tax Code at \nthe same time we are cutting assistance for the poorest and neediest in \nour society.\n  My amendment would also reduce the danger of gaming the revenue \nestimating process to avoid a potential veto. Under the current version \nof the line-item veto, a tax loophole cannot be vetoed unless it is \nscored as losing money during any part of relevant budget window. \nHowever, as we have seen with some proposals such as the backloaded \nIRA's and neutral cost recovery provision in the House's tax package, \nby slowly phasing in tax expenditures, they can be estimated to raise \nrevenue during the first 5 years even though they lose billions of \ndollars over the 10-year budget period. My amendment would eliminate \nthis\n gaming process.\n\n  If the President had the power to excise special interest spending, \nbut only in appropriations bills, we would simply find the special \ninterest lobbyists who work appropriations turning themselves into tax \nlobbyists, pushing for the same spending in the Tax Code. Spending is \nspending whether it comes in the form of a Government check, or in the \nform of a special exception from the tax rates that apply to everyone \nelse. Tax spending does not, as some pretend, simply allow people to \nkeep more of what they have earned. It gives them a special exception \nfrom the rules that oblige everyone to share in the responsibility of \nour national defense and protecting the young, the aged, and the \ninfirm. The only way to let everyone keep more of what they have earned \nis to minimize these tax expenditures along with appropriated spending \nand the burden of the national debt so that we can bring down tax rates \nfairly, for everyone.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I encourage all of our colleagues to pass a \nline-item veto bill that includes both appropriations and real tax \nexpenditures. In \n[[Page S4303]]  their so-called Contract With America, the Republicans \npromised that they would subject wasteful spending to a potential line-\nitem veto whether this spending occurred in an appropriations or tax \nbill. I believe that the definition that the Republicans promised in \ntheir contract, the same definition that was included in S. 14 when it \nwas introduced in this Chamber, is an appropriate way to prevent new \nwasteful spending projects from creeping into the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, the line-item veto is not in itself deficit reduction. \nBut if the President is willing to use it, it is the appropriate tool \nto cut a certain kind of wasteful spending--the pork-barrel projects \nthat tend to crop up in appropriations and tax bills. Although this \ntype of spending is only one of the types of spending that drive up the \ndeficit, until we control these expenditures for the few, we cannot \nasked for the shared sacrifice from the many that will be necessary to \nsignificantly reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the side of the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n           tax loopholes should be covered by line-item veto\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \namendment to subject a host of special interest tax breaks and \nloopholes to the President's expedited rescission, or line-item veto \nauthority provided for in this bill. This amendment would give the \nPresident the same authority to rescind new special interest tax breaks \nthat he would have under the bill to cancel new direct spending. The \nlogic of the amendment is simple, and straightforward: We should treat \ntax breaks just as we treat direct spending in the Federal budget.\n  In all of our debates on budget priorities, there has been too little \ndiscussion about a particular kind of spending that enjoys a special \nstatus within the Federal budget: tax breaks for special classes or \ncategories of taxpayers. Many of the benefits from these breaks and \nloopholes go to corporate or other wealthy interests in our society. If \nwe are going to give the President line-item veto authority over direct \nspending programs, then we should give him the same power to veto \nspecial interest tax breaks and tax loopholes. That is what this \namendment would do; it would cover all new tax breaks, hold them up to \nscrutiny, and subject them to potential rescission, or cancellation.\n  This is not the first time in this session of Congress that I have \nraised the issue of closing special interest tax loopholes as a part of \nour deficit reduction efforts. A couple of weeks ago my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, Senator Bradley, and I offered a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution as an amendment to the proposed balanced budget \namendment which said that tax expenditures ``should be subjected to the \nsame level of scrutiny in the budget as direct spending programs'' in \nour efforts to balance the budget. That proposal received 40 votes from \nmy colleagues on our side of the aisle. We have argued for months, and \nwill continue to argue, that savings from restricting special interest \ntax breaks must be a key part of our efforts to further reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Let me make a simple point here that is often overlooked. We can \nspend money just as easily through the Tax Code, through what are \ncalled ``tax expenditures,'' as we can through the normal \nappropriations process. Spending is spending, whether it comes in the \nform of a government check or in the form of a tax break for some \nspecial purpose, like a subsidy, a credit, a deduction, or accelerated \ndepreciation for this type of investment or that. Some tax expenditures \nare justified, and should be retained. But some are special interest \ntax breaks that should be eliminated, or loopholes that should be \nplugged.\n  These special tax breaks allow some taxpayers to escape paying their \nfair share, and thus make everyone else pay higher taxes. They are\n simply special exceptions to the normal rules, rules that oblige all \nof us to share the burdens of citizenship by paying our taxes. They \nalso limit State revenues because many State income taxes are tied to \nthe Federal tax rules. It seems only fair that if the President can use \nthe line-item veto authority to cut special-interest spending programs, \nthen he should also be able to cut special-interest tax breaks which \nwill cost the Treasury billions of dollars in lost revenues.\n\n  Special-interest tax breaks are simply a subcategory of the larger \ngroup of tax provisions called tax expenditures. The Congressional \nJoint Tax Committee has estimated that tax expenditures cost the U.S. \nTreasury over $420 billion every single year. And they also estimate \nthat if we do not hold them in check, that amount will grow by $60 \nbillion to over $485 billion by 1999. That is why tax breaks must be on \nthe table along with other spending as we look for places to cut the \ndeficit.\n  Now, not all tax expenditures are bad. Not all should be eliminated. \nSome serve a real public purpose, such as providing incentives to \ninvestment, bolstering the nonprofit sector, encouraging charitable \ncontributions, and helping people to be able to afford to buy a home. \nBut some of them are simply tax dodges that can no longer be justified. \nAt the very least, all of these should undergo the same scrutiny as \nother Federal spending. If we are going to allow the President to line-\nitem veto specific spending programs, then we should also allow him to \nveto specific tax breaks that subsidize a targeted class of taxpayers.\n  The particular language of this amendment has a long history, and has \noften been supported in the past by Members on the other side of the \naisle. This language is taken directly from the so-called Contract With \nAmerica about which we have heard so much recently. On pages 32-33 of \nthe commercially available version of the contract, when discussing the \nline-item veto, it says, ``Under this procedure, the President could \nstrike any appropriation or targeted tax provision in any bill.'' Thus \nwe are offering an amendment first outlined in the provisions in the \nContract With America.\n  In addition to being part of the contract, a similar amendment was \noffered on the House floor by Representative Michel, the former House \nminority leader, to a previous version of the line-item veto \nlegislation. Gaining bipartisan support, this amendment was adopted in \n1993 in the House during consideration of a version of the line-item \nveto bill. The language of this amendment also appeared in the original \nversion of Senator Domenici's expedited rescission bill which he \nintroduced in January of this year. Therefore this language simply \nfulfills a promise made by many of those on the other side of the \naisle, including those who wrote the Contract With America.\n  Although there are many things in that Republican so-called Contract \nWith America which I oppose, I agree completely with the contract when \nit says that we should give the President the power to veto all new \nspecial tax breaks and loopholes, and not just those new tax\n breaks that affect fewer than 100 taxpayers, as included in the bill \nthe committee reported. Tax attorneys will have a field day if we adopt \nthat arbitrary 100 taxpayers limit on the President's authority to \nline-item veto tax expenditures. This is a sham, which some have \nestimated would cover only a tiny percentage of all tax breaks \ncurrently in the Code if it had been in law when they were established.\n\n  How would we decide which special tax breaks will benefit fewer than \n100 taxpayers? Even if a specific provision is intended to benefit only \na small group of people or corporations, crafty tax attorneys will \nalways find ways to expand the group of intended beneficiaries. In \naddition, as I understand the situation, no Federal agency currently \nkeeps track of how many taxpayers benefit from individual tax \nexpenditures. This is perfectly understandable, because many tax \nexpenditures are exclusions from income, rather than deductions which \nmust be reported to the IRS. How do we calculate how many people \nexclude income from taxation, when of course those taxpayers do not \neven report this excluded \n[[Page S4304]]  income? Thus the arbitrary 100 taxpayers limit is \nabsurdly narrow.\n  But the language of the Dole substitute is even more unclear on tax \nexpenditures than the 100 taxpayer language used by the committee. The \nbackers of the Dole substitute claim that their bill would allow the \nPresident to veto special interest tax breaks and loopholes. But the \nlanguage of the Dole substitute uses a very confusing and vague \ndefinition of ``targeted tax benefits'' subject to the President's \nline-item veto. The substitute defines ``targeted tax benefits'' as \nthose provisions which are estimated as ``losing revenue within the \nperiods specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on \nthe budget'' and which have ``the practical effect of providing more \nfavorable tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or limited group of \ntaxpayers when compared with other similarly situated taxpayers.''\n  What does this definition mean? What does a similarly situated \ntaxpayer mean in this context? Should we bring in high-priced tax \nattorneys to help us understand the effects of this language? Under \nthis definition, could Congress give special tax breaks to a specific \nindustry such as the oil and gas industry, and shield these tax give-\naways from the President's line-item veto because all companies within \nthe favored industry would be allowed to claim the same special \ninterest tax break? Under current law, U.S. citizens working overseas \ncan exclude $70,000 per year from their U.S. income taxes. If Congress \nwere to foolishly increase this exclusion to $80,000 per year, would \nthat change be subject to the President's line-item veto authority \nunder the substitute? Of if Congress were to give new special tax \nbreaks to American companies operating overseas, such as we already do \nunder current law, would that change be covered by the language in the \nsubstitute? How would this language affect companies doing business in \nPuerto Rico, who enjoy special tax breaks under current law? The \nexisting Tax Code is riddled with numerous special tax give-aways to an \nentire industry. Would the President be allowed to line-item veto new \nspecial interest tax loopholes for any given powerful industry under \nthis language? We need to clarify this\n confusing provision in the Dole substitute, because on its face it \nonly applies to a very limited number of these tax breaks.\n\n  If the President is to be given the power to veto spending \nprovisions, then he should also be given the power to veto certain \nespecially egregious special interest tax breaks, especially those \nwhich favor an entire protected industry such as the oil and gas \nindustry. The writers of the Republican Contract With America \nunderstood this point, even if the majority party in the other body \nvoted to abandon this section of the contract. We should restore the \noriginal contract language, as our amendment would do.\n  By giving the President the power to line-item veto any new tax \nexpenditure provisions, we could save billions of dollars. For example, \ndo we really need special tax breaks for Mount Rushmore coins, or tax \nrules that allow people to rent out their homes for 2 weeks each year \nwithout paying tax on that income? Both of these tax breaks have been \nproposed in the past, and the latter actually became law. A line-item \nveto which at least covers new tax breaks might prevent measures like \nthese from slipping into the Tax Code in the future, where they could \ngo unexamined for years or even for decades.\n  Our amendment is the latest in a series of legislative initiatives \ndesigned to call attention to this problem and to prompt Congress to \nreexamine tax loopholes. There are many existing special loopholes \nburied in the current Tax Code which need to be reconsidered. While \nthis measure only subjects new tax breaks to Presidential veto \nauthority, many of us will certainly want to revisit specific tax \nloopholes that are already in the Tax Code during the reconciliation \nprocess. But for now, our amendment provides for a mechanism to cover \nall new tax breaks in the same way that it covers only new spending. I \nthink we ought to signal today that the standard of fairness we will be \napplying will include closer scrutiny of these tax breaks.\n  It is only fair, since these special tax breaks for certain companies \nand industries force other companies and individuals to pay higher \ntaxes to make up the difference. Some of these tax breaks allow \nprivileged industries such as the oil and gas industry to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of taxes. All distort, to one degree or another, \neconomic investment decisions, usually in favor of companies with the \nhighest paid lobbyists in Washington. In many cases, doing away with \nthese special tax breaks for certain industries would allow a more \nefficient allocation of economic resources.\n  I think it is a simple question of fairness. If Congress is really \ngoing to make the $1.48 trillion in spending cuts and other policy \nchanges that would have to be made to balance the Federal budget by \n2002, then those on the other side of the aisle should make sure that \nwealthy interests in our society, those who have political clout, those \nwho can hire high-priced lobbyists to make their case every day here in \nWashington, are asked to sacrifice at least as much as regular middle-\nclass folks whom you and I represent. We should represent those who \nreceive Social Security or Medicare or Veterans' benefits, and not just \nthose special interests who can afford to pay\n high-priced hired guns to lobby for them.\n\n  I am amazed to learn that many in the majority party in the other \nbody are proposing expanding corporate welfare tax loopholes at the \nvery same time that they are slashing Government spending on programs \nfor the poor, for children, for education, and for the most vulnerable \nin our society. They have proposed tax cuts for the wealthy which, \naccording to the Treasury Department, total over $700 billion, and at \nthe same time they refuse to subject a broad range of new tax breaks to \npotential cancellation by the President. And these are the ones who \ncall themselves deficit hawks?\n  By refusing to extend the line-item veto authority given to the \nPresident under this bill to industry-wide tax breaks and loopholes, \nmembers of the majority party are trying to protect their wealthy and \nwell-connected friends. And they are doing so at the expense of \nprinciples that they often espouse: economic efficiency and market-\nbased allocations of capital. As I have observed, often these special \ntax loopholes and tax breaks distort economic decision-making, causing \ncorporations and individuals to shift their resources in order to take \nadvantage of these loopholes.\n  I think now is the time to put a stop to further massive spending on \nspecial interest tax loopholes. We should allow the President to be \nable to line-item veto these costly special interest tax breaks. A \nbasic standard of fairness requires that we examine special interest \ntax breaks along with the one-third of all Federal spending which is \ncurrently covered by the legislation before us.\n  Some will charge that by closing tax loopholes and restricting \nspecial interest tax breaks we are somehow proposing to raise taxes. \nBut the opponents of covering these tax breaks in the line-item veto \nlegislation need to understand that the current system forces middle \nclass and working people to pay more in taxes than they otherwise would \nhave to pay. While some are paying less than their fair share in taxes \nbecause of these special tax subsidies, others are being forced to pay \nmore in taxes to make up the difference. Closing tax loopholes is not \nraising taxes. Allowing these tax breaks to continue forever without \nclose scrutiny is part of the reason why taxes on the regular middle \nclass taxpayer are higher than they otherwise could be. Of course, \nthese subsidies are hidden in the Tax Code because it would be too hard \nto get the votes in Congress, in the full light of day, to directly \nsubsidize these industries--especially under current budget \nconstraints.\n  It is a simple matter of fairness. In our attempts to reduce the \nFederal deficit, all sectors of our society must make some sacrifices. \nSpecific industries and the wealthy are the ones who often benefit most \nfrom the special interest tax breaks and loopholes. If we do not treat \ntax expenditures the same as direct spending provisions, the wealthy \nwill avoid making any sacrifices as we cut spending programs for the \nmiddle class and the poor. Just because some special interest has the \nmeans to hire a high-priced tax lobbyist to get a special tax break \nwritten into legislation does not\ngive them the [[Page S4305]]  right to avoid sharing in whatever \nsacrifices are necessary to reduce the budget deficit.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report last year, and have \nissued several others on tax expenditures. It was titled, ``Tax Policy: \nTax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny.'' I commend it to my \ncolleagues' attention. It makes a compelling case for subjecting these \ntax expenditures to greater congressional and administration scrutiny, \njust as direct spending is scrutinized. The GAO report reminds us that \nspending through special provisions in the Tax Code should be treated \nin the same way as other spending provisions.\n  The GAO noted that most of these tax expenditures currently in the \nTax Code are not subject to any annual reauthorization or other kind of \nsystematic periodic review. They observed that many of these special \ntax breaks were enacted in response to economic conditions that no \nlonger exist. In fact, they found that of the 124 tax expenditures \nidentified by the Budget Committee in 1993, about half were enacted \nbefore 1950. Now that does not automatically call them into question. \nIt just illustrates the problem that once enacted, special tax breaks \nare not looked at in any systematic way. Many of these industry-\nspecific breaks get embedded in the Tax Code, and are not looked at \nagain for years. Giving the President the authority to cancel special \ninterest tax breaks would prevent egregious ones from creeping into the \nTax Code in the first place.\n  This amendment simply says that new tax expenditures should be \ntreated the same as new spending programs for purposes of the line-item \nveto. It might prompt us to rethink some of our spending priorities. \nWhen we begin to weigh, for example, scaling back the special treatment \nfor percentage depletion allowances for the oil and gas industry \nagainst cutting food and nutrition programs for hungry children, we may \ncome out with quite different answers than we have in the past about \nwhether we can still afford to subsidize this industry through the Tax \nCode. CBO estimates that eliminating this tax break would save $4.9 \nbillion in Federal revenues over 5 years.\n  We must allow the President to veto new special interest tax \nexpenditures, despite the vague and confusing language in the Dole \nsubstitute. It looks to me like those who oppose our amendment are \nsaying that they will not ask for much, if any, sacrifice from wealthy \ncorporate and other special interests in our society who have enjoyed \ncertain tax breaks, benefits, preferences, deductions, and credits that \nmost regular middle-class taxpayers do not enjoy.\n  The Republican contract promised to give the President the authority \nto line-item veto all these special tax breaks, but that language was \ndeleted by the Senate Budget Committee. That language has also been \ndeleted from the Dole substitute. I think we need to restore the \noriginal language of the expedited rescission bill.\n  At a time when we are talking about potentially huge spending cuts in \nmeat inspections designed to insure against outbreaks of disease; or in \nhigher education aid for middle class families; or in protection for \nour air, our lakes, and our land; or in highways; or in community \ndevelopment programs for States and localities; or in sewer and water \nprojects for our big cities; or in safety net programs for vulnerable \nchildren; or to eliminate the School Lunch Program, we should be \nwilling to weigh these cuts against special tax loopholes that could \ncost hundreds of billions each year.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the side of the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 26 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to go off the \namendment for approximately 5 minutes to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Nebraska about the bill.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nsubject matter is unrelated to the pending amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Unrelated to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to yield to my colleague from \nArizona. We have had some very brief preliminary discussion to try to \nexpedite and move things along just a little bit.\n  I propose to him that in order to move things along, I will be a \ncosponsor of the Bradley amendment. If the Bradley amendment is \nsuccessful, then there is a backup amendment that I would like to \nwithdraw, but I would like to have it pending in case the Bradley \namendment should not prevail.\n  My amendment simply says--and I will debate it briefly if I may have \n5 minutes--basically that if the Bradley amendment fails, I would like \nto have a backup provision that simply says we should take a look at \nnot just a 5-year but a 10 year-period with regard to what effect any \nkind of taxation would have on the overall budget proposition. There \nmay be some pros and cons on that. It might be acceptable.\n  I would simply like to suggest at this time that after we finish \ndebate under the allotted time under the Bradley amendment, if I may \nhave 5 minutes and my colleague maybe 5 minutes, we could make an \nagreement that we would have a vote on my backup amendment that would \nbe withdrawn if the Bradley amendment prevails.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would also like to find out if your \namendment would be acceptable by both sides, to prevent a----\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will not insist on a rollcall vote. If \nthat is possible, we could maybe voice vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to take the remaining minute or 2 to discuss \nthe parliamentary situation as it exists with my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator reserving his right to object?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, Mr. President. I am now on the 5-minute request to \ndiscuss the parliamentary situation, not related to the pending \namendment.\n  It is my understanding from my conversations with my colleague from \nNebraska that we are in the process of reducing the number of \namendments and getting time agreements on those so that we could \nprobably be able to--hopefully, within an hour or 2, or 2 or 3 hours--\nget some kind of final agreement so that a cloture vote would not be \nnecessary.\n  Under those circumstances, I urge all of our colleagues to consider \ntheir amendments, consider how much time they would require, and \nhopefully we could move forward so that we do not have to go through a \ncloture vote and reach cloture on this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to avoid the cloture vote, along \nwith my friend from Nebraska. I think we are now reaching a point where \nwe could get time agreements and perhaps even a time certain for \npassage.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I may for a moment, I thank my friend \nfrom Arizona.\n  I simply use this opportunity to appeal to all Senators on both sides \nof the aisle to please come to the floor at this time, or sometime \nwithin the next hour, to consult with us. It is important, if we are \ngoing to expedite matters as I would like to do, and hopefully not have \na cloture vote unless that becomes necessary--but I suspect we are \ngoing to have to go through the cloture vote unless we can come to some \nreasonable agreement on the number of amendments--how serious the \nSenators are in offering them.\n  I place an appeal at this time to Members on both sides of the aisle \nwho have amendments to please consult with the managers now so that \nmaybe we can have a sense and eliminate some of the amendments that are \nduplicates, or duplicates to some degree, and maybe have an agreement \nby 2 o'clock this afternoon that would set a course of as definitive \naction as is possible with the conflicting debate that still might take \nplace on some of these amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is not clear yet--a pending vote on a \nFeingold amendment; a possible pending vote on \n[[Page S4306]]  a Feingold amendment, that is possible; along with a \npending vote at the expiration on the previously agreed to time on the \nBradley amendment. It is not clear to me yet when those votes will take \nplace.\n  There is, I understand, a signing ceremony down at the White House on \nthe unfunded mandates bill sometime later this morning. I hope within \nthe next minutes we will get some indication as to when the votes, both \non the Feingold amendments and the Bradley amendment, will take place.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to return to the pending \namendment, which is the Bradley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 403 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say to my \nfriend from New Jersey, I know of no one who is more aware, more \nknowledgeable, and more articulate on tax issues--along with many \nothers, but especially tax issues--than the Senator from New Jersey. We \nknow of his exemplary record, including the key role he played in the \nlast major tax bill passed by Congress in the 1986 tax reform bill.\n  It is with some trepidation that I oppose this amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey. I certainly understand the target and the aim \nand intent of this amendment. I believe that the amendment sets a \ndifferent standard for a targeted tax benefit for purposes that are \ncontained in the Dole substitute.\n  His definition of the targeted tax benefit in this amendment is \nbroader. The amendment defines a targeted tax benefit, I quote from the \namendment, as any provision that applies different tax treatment to a \nlimited class of taxpayers. The amendment does exempt from the \ntaxpayers in a limited class, defined by general demographic conditions \nsuch as income, number of dependents, or marital status.\n  By the terms of the amendment as we understand it, it pulls into the \ndefinition of targeted tax benefit, any tax benefit that goes to any \nother limited class of taxpayers, such as retirees, Americans with \nphysical disabilities such as blindness, survivors of a deceased parent \nor spouse, disabled veterans, foster parents, farmers, fishermen, \nstudents, and homeowners.\n  A few examples, Mr. President, of potential tax benefits that would \nbe a targeted tax benefit under this amendment and subject to the line-\nitem veto would be, for example: President Clinton's 1996 budget \nproposal to create a special tax deduction for college education \nexpenses, the reason being, where it would fall under the Bradley \namendment, is that students or their parents who pay for college \nexpenses are a limited class of taxpayers.\n  Proposals in most of the major health care reform bills proposed last \nyear to clarify the tax treatment of long-term care insurance would \nfall under this amendment because taxpayers who choose to purchase \nlong-term care insurance are a limited class of taxpayers.\n  The proposal in the Contract With America to increase the amount of \nmoney a small business can deduct, expenses for equipment purchases \nfrom $17,000 up to $35,000 per year, because the contract proposal is \nlimited to small businesses, which are also a limited class of \ntaxpayers.\n  The proposal to extend the 25-percent deduction for health insurance \ncosts paid by self-employed persons, and the reason for this is that \nthis proposal is limited to self-employed taxpayers, who are also a \nlimited class of taxpayers.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has a bill that \nprovides tax relief for farmers who have suffered from the 1993 Midwest \nfloods. This proposal is limited to farmers, a limited class of \ntaxpayers.\n  Unlike the pending amendment, the Dole substitute definition of a \ntargeted tax benefit looks to a limited group of taxpayers, and whether \nwithin the limited group, one taxpayer or group of taxpayers is treated \nmore favorably than other similarly situated taxpayers.\n  Under the Dole substitute, none of the examples mentioned would be a \ntargeted tax benefit, and under the Dole substitute none of the \nexamples mentioned would be subject to the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent agreement, at the \nexpiration of the time, I will be making a motion to table as was \nprovided for in the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to speak on \nthis amendment and allow Senator Bradley to use the remaining minutes \nof his time for his own purposes.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending is one that \nvirtually every Member of the Senate ought to be able to support.\n  Senator Bradley's amendment on tax breaks is identical--it is \nidentical--to that contained in the Domenici-Exon bill. It is the very \nsame language that has been cosponsored by many people on both sides of \nthe aisle, including both leaders at this point. Its intent is to make \nclear what we all say we want: To give the President a strong bill.\n  We want to allow the President to weed out special interest breaks, \nwhether they are buried in an appropriations bill or buried in a tax \nbill. We have said that our view of a strong bill is a bill that \nbroadens the scope, that gives the President the greatest opportunity \nfor review of legislative issues, of questions that may arise as he \nconsiders the viability of any piece of legislation, giving the \nPresident the opportunity, whether it is in taxes or appropriations, is \nour definition of strength.\n  Senator Bradley's amendment puts tax breaks on an equal footing with \nwasteful spending. It allows the President to select out and veto \nprovisions that might favor one group over another at the expense of \nthe American taxpayer.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a bill that certainly Senator Domenici, and \nmany of us who cosponsored his legislation, feel is important, and I am \nvery pleased that we have, again, an opportunity to support what we all \nhave indicated we want, and that is a bill that is, indeed, as strong \nas it can be.\n  I am gratified that our Republican colleagues agree with Democrats \nthat tax breaks should be on the table and open to review. The current \nlanguage in the Dole substitute is very broad. Under any reasonable \ncommonsense interpretation of this language, tax breaks are on the \ntable, and that is as it should be.\n  I am supporting Senator Bradley's effort in order to remove any \nambiguity in interpretation. I think Senators Domenici and Exon had it \nexactly right the first time, and I hope they will return to their \nroots and support this amendment when we have the vote later on today.\n  Senator Bradley's amendment is also important because it has another \ncrucial component. It eliminates the incentive that exists under the \nDole substitute to shift tax breaks out of the budget window and escape \nPresidential scrutiny. For example, the House has a provision in the \nContract With America called neutral cost recovery. Although this tax \nprovision loses billions of dollars and is a huge drain on the \nTreasury, it would not come under the President's scrutiny. That is \nbecause it does not lose money until after the 5-year budget window.\n  Instead of inviting budget games, we should allow any tax break that \nloses money to be subject to Presidential review, and Senator Bradley's \namendment does that. That is a gimmick. We want to avoid gimmicks. We \ntruly want truth in budgeting. We want the President to have an \nopportunity to review all budgetary implications, provisions that may \nbe in the law, and that is really what this amendment does.\n  This amendment would ensure that the President looks beyond 5 years \nand not be constrained simply to examine a piece of legislation only \nbecause it has a 5-year budget estimation. There is widespread \nagreement in the Senate about the need of Presidential review of \nwasteful spending. This amendment puts wasteful tax breaks on the \ntable, and I certainly urge my colleagues to support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  [[Page S4307]] Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on \neach respective side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Twelve minutes 46 seconds for \nthe Senator from New Jersey, and 11 minutes for the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I think \nthis is an extremely important amendment. Frankly, this line-item veto \nis not in ideal shape, from my perspective. But what happens when we \nhave a one-time appropriation is we have a one-time wound. If we vote \n$500,000 to save Bill Bradley's birthplace--and I know Bill Bradley \nwould oppose such an appropriation--that is a one-time appropriation. \nBut when we put in these little tax favors for people, these little \nthings that provide tax breaks, that is a wound that bleeds year after \nyear after year. I think it is extremely important that we adopt this \namendment.\n  I would like to see a line-item veto that also would give the \nPresident, frankly, the authority to reduce appropriations. Apparently, \nwe cannot do that under the present Constitution. I wish we could. I \nprefer that. But I think if we are going to deal with appropriations in \na line-item veto, we also have to deal with tax expenditures in a \nmeaningful way.\n  The Dole amendment deals with it but in a very narrow sense. This is \neven more narrowly crafted than I would like to see, but it at least \ngives us the ability to stop a running wound, and we have created too \nmany running wounds.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Bradley amendment.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, again, I would like to, if I can, having \nlistened to some of the comments, try to take a few minutes to clarify \nwhat I believe the language means.\n  Before any tax loophole would be subject to a line-item veto, under \nthe language of the pending bill, it would have to meet two criteria: \nFirst, the loophole would have to be estimated by the Joint Tax \nCommittee to lose revenue within the period specified in the most \nrecently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, although this provision is subject to budgetary \ngimmicks, I believe it is clear. It says that if a tax expenditure \nloses money in the next 5 years, it would be included. What my \namendment seeks to do is to broaden this to a 10-year period; to say \nthat you cannot put a tax expenditure in the code and make it effective \nin year 6, 7, and 8. You cannot put a tax expenditure in the code \nclaiming that it will raise revenue, as some inevitably will in the \nfirst couple of years, when in fact it will lose enormous amounts of \nrevenue in the second 5 years.\n  So I am concerned--and seek to rectify with this amendment--that the \nbudget window here creates a possibility for gaming.\n  For each tax bill, we receive estimates from the Joint Tax Committee, \nthe detailed revenue gains and losses for each fiscal year covered by \nthe current budget resolution. If a given tax loophole was estimated to \nlose revenue during any of these years, it would meet this first part \nof the definition. If it loses revenue in the first 5 years under the \nbill, it would be included as an item that could be vetoed.\n  The second criterion is, the loophole would have to have ``the \npractical effect of providing more favorable tax treatment to a \nparticular taxpayer or limited group of taxpayers when compared with \nother similarly situated taxpayers.''\n  While the first part of this part of the test is fairly clear, I \nthink some Members of the Senate have questioned what the phrase ``when \ncompared with other similarly situated taxpayers'' means. My view is \nthat this language makes explicit what was implicit in the earlier \nversions of this phrase. All tax expenditures are judged relative to a \ngiven baseline that applies to all other taxpayers, and this language \nsimply makes this comparison clear.\n  So, for example, if tomorrow we pass the $10,000 tax credit for all \nMembers of Congress, that loophole would be subject to a Presidential \nveto.\n  First, because it would lose revenue in the next 5-year period. And, \nsecond, the loophole would provide a limited group of taxpayers; that \nis, Members of the Congress, more favorable tax treatment; that is, the \n$10,000 tax credit, when compared to other similarly situated \ntaxpayers; that is, all taxpayers that are not Members of Congress.\n  As a real example, a few years ago Congress approved a loophole that \nprovided that\n\n       Neither the United States nor the Virgin Islands shall \n     impose an income tax on non-Virgin Islands source income \n     derived by one or more corporations which were formed in \n     Delaware on or about March 6, 1981, and which have owned one \n     or more office buildings in St. Thomas, United States Virgin \n     Islands.\n\n  There it is, a tax expenditure. Word has it that this loophole was \ndesigned to benefit a single, well-connected, millionaire and his \nVirgin Islands company. That was his loophole.\n  Again, this loophole under the bill before us would be subject to a \npotential line-item veto. First, it would lose revenue in the next 5 \nyears. Second, the loophole would provide a particular taxpayer; that \nis, the single Virgin Islands company, with more favorable tax credit; \nthat is, forgiveness of tax on all non-Virgin Islands source income, \nwhen compared to other similarly situated taxpayers; that is, other \ntaxpayers that either were nonincorporated in Delaware on March 6, \n1981, or do not own an office building in the Virgin Islands.\n  Now, Mr. President, a few Members have suggested--incorrectly, I \nbelieve--that the term ``when compared to similarly situated \ntaxpayers'' will cause the definition of ``targeted tax break'' to be \ninterpreted narrowly. This suggestion is based on I think the flawed \nreasoning that ``similarly situated'' means ``identical.'' Such \ninterpretation would mean that no tax loophole would ever be subject to \nveto. Instead, loopholes for Members of Congress, loopholes for \nindividual companies in the Virgin Islands, and numerous other \nloopholes would all be free from a potential veto because all identical \ntaxpayers would get the same benefit.\n  The debate on this floor evidences the clear intent of the supporters \nof this bill to subject tax loopholes to a Presidential veto, and \ntherefore it includes the tax loophole for the Members of Congress, it \nincludes the tax loophole for the Virgin Islands corporation, and it \nincludes other new and expanded tax loopholes.\n  I think that is, frankly, what the bill says. That is what this \namendment says. The disagreement is not over that. The disagreement is \nthe budget window. And in the bill before us, there is a big \npossibility for gaming by saying if there is a tax loophole that will \nnot lose revenue until the second 5 years, it is not subject to veto, \nand that is what this amendment attempts to correct.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 13 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, if my friend from New Jersey will \nyield, I would be glad to yield 5 minutes of my time to him, if he so \nwants to use it.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I am fine with 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine [Mr. Cohen].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding. I would \nlike to offer a couple of comments to put this line-item veto proposal \nin perspective.\n  The Constitution clearly gives Congress the ``power of the purse.'' \nBut, every President since Thomas Jefferson has asserted the executive \nbranch's discretion and right to hold back moneys appropriated by \nCongress. This tug- \n[[Page S4308]] of-war goes to the most basic facet of our democratic \nsystem of government: The balance of powers between the executive and \nthe legislative branches of government.\n  The conflict between the power of the purse and the power of \nimpoundment dates back to the earliest days of our Republic. The first \nsignificant impoundment of appropriated funds was made by Thomas \nJefferson who, back in 1803, refused to spend $50,000 appropriated by \nCongress to provide gunboats to operate on the Mississippi River.\n  The conflict between the legislative and executive branches has been \ngoing on now for over 150 years. You may recall, Mr. President, it was \nback in the early 1970's when this really came to a head. President \nNixon challenged Congress' power and withheld over $12 billion in \nhighway funds. This resulted in an attempt to impeach President Nixon \nbecause he had trespassed upon the powers of Congress. Congress did not \nimpeach the President--appropriately so--but it did pass the Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act back in 1974. This act imposed many new \nrestrictions on the President's ability to impound budget authority.\n  Twenty years have transpired since this act was passed and the tenor \nof the debate has shifted dramatically. We have gone from a sense of \nurgency to restrict an imperial President to a sense that the President \nneeds to restrict, if not an imperial Congress, at least a spendthrift \none.\n  I support strengthening the President's ability to veto wasteful \nspending. In fact, I introduced legislation along with Senator Domenici \nto accomplish this last Congress and did so again this year.\n  But, I think we ought to be clear about one thing. No matter what \ntype of line-item veto authority is given to the President, assuming it \nwill be given, the overall impact on the deficit is not going to live \nup to the high expectations of the American people.\n  Giving the President more power to rescind or veto spending can \nachieve some positive results. To be able to surgically remove wasteful \nspending items would be a service to the taxpayers and, in turn, \nimprove the public image of Congress. Every report about a $700 toilet \nseat or a Lawrence Welk Museum sends the message that Congress is \neither intoxicated with power or powerless to overcome its spending \naddiction.\n  But there should be no expectation that the line-item veto authority \ncan do the heavy lifting in terms of reducing the deficit. Many of the \nitems listed by various watchdog groups in their annual so-called pork \nlists are astonishing, and would never be supported if they were not \nembedded in large appropriations bills that are presented to the \nPresident on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n  I do not suggest that any amount of waste ought to be tolerated, but \npurging these items, while important, will not alone take us far in \nreducing the deficit. I support giving the President more authority to \nline out wasteful spending. But, it should be clear that we have not \nyet been able to confront the much more difficult task, and more \ndifficult challenge, of getting our deficit under control.\n  At this point it is not clear, Mr. President, whether there is going \nto be a filibuster on this measure or whether we will be able to \novercome that filibuster. I hope that we can. In the meantime, if this \nmeasure is not approved and sent to the President for his signature, \nthere is another way to achieve our goal. Every request made of the \nAppropriations Committee ought to be made public. Those of us who \nrequest that specific items be included in the appropriations bills \nought to have those requests published in the Congressional Record. \nThat would bring some light to this process. If we are unable or \nunwilling to stand behind the requests that we make to the \nAppropriations Committee, then obviously we would be unwilling to take \nto the floor to try to defend them.\n  Unfortunately, I think we have reached the point of ``Stop us before \nwe spend again.'' The power of the purse is already ours. It is a power \nwe have abused too often, and too often, I might add, to the applause \nof our constituents. For too long, we have been rewarded for bringing \nhome the bacon while condemning the presence and prevalence of \ntrichinosis in the Congress. We cannot continue to have it both ways.\n  This measure will indeed force us to defend our requests in the \nbright light of day. It will make us more responsible if we may be \ncalled upon to defend here on the Senate floor what we demand. This \nmeasure leads us to a sense of congressional responsibility.\n  I support the efforts of my colleagues, Senator McCain of Arizona and \nSenator Coats of Indiana. I support the measure we have brought to the \nfloor.\n  But, I again want to reemphasize the point that, assuming it passes \nand the President signs it, this measure will not do the heavy lifting \nrequired to reduce the deficit. But, it will be a step forward. It is a \nmeasure that has become necessary by virtue of the fact that we have \nengaged in wasteful spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. May I have an additional 30 seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield as much time as he may consume to the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, once again, let me say we could have \navoided all of this had we not indulged ourselves in the notion that we \ncan bring home the bacon to our constituents and they will applaud us. \nWe know one person's bacon is someone else's pork. It all depends on \nwho is looking at it. It seems to me we should at least be willing to \nstand on the Senate floor and identify and defend those requests we \nhave made of the appropriations or authorization committees. If we \ncannot bring ourselves to do that, the projects are not worthy of \nsupport by our colleagues and should not be in the appropriations \nprocess.\n  In closing, I hope this measure does in fact receive the endorsement \nof enough of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to cut \noff any filibuster. Absent that, one way we can accomplish the same \nresult is to have these requests published as a matter of record in the \nCongressional Record.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleague from \nArizona two brief questions.\n  One is: The language that is embodied in this amendment, does the \nSenator intend to fight for this language in the conference?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend from New Jersey, I believe not \nonly will we fight for it but I believe the House's intentions were \nexactly the language of this amendment rather than, as the Senator from \nNew Jersey has pointed out, the rather nebulous and amorphous \ndefinitions that were in the House-passed bill.\n  I believe from my conversations with Members in the other body, they \nwould be agreeable to this language as opposed to the present language \nin the bill.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. And the language in question does, according to the \nSenator's own reading, yield some tax expenditures being subject to the \nline-item veto?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, absolutely. I believe, again, \nthe egregious examples of the advantages that have been accrued to a \nfew are addressed.\n  I also concede to my friend from New Jersey that there are other \nareas, such as was pointed out in the remarks of the Senator from New \nJersey, which are not covered but which should be covered. I just do \nnot know exactly how we do that. If we expand in order to cover that, \nwhat goes along with that I think is something we cannot support at \nthis time.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 seconds.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I think this amendment is about the \nbudget window. I think the underlying bill, plus the amendment that is \noffered, really means the same thing when it comes to similarly \nsituated. I \n[[Page S4309]]  think to argue it is a narrow interpretation would mean \nthat no tax loophole would ever be subject to veto because similarly \nsituated would have to be identical. Instead, new loopholes for Members \nof Congress, loopholes for individual companies--such as in the Virgin \nIslands, as in the example I gave--or numerous other loopholes would \nall be free from potential veto. I know that is not the intent of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona nor of the proponents of this bill.\n  I thank the Senator. I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 4 minutes and 2 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask if the Senator from New Jersey would like to make \nany additional remarks out of my time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. No. I do not think so. I am prepared to yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of my \ntime. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my colleague from Arizona. Briefly, for the benefit \nof the Senator from Arizona--and we have talked about this, and other \nparties--I clearly state I am a cosponsor of the Bradley amendment \nwhich I think is a very good one, a very timely one. But, as is well \nknown, I have a backup amendment at the desk.\n  The Bradley amendment would ensure that the tax loopholes covered by \nthe bill would be a broad class of tax loopholes. His amendment will \nalso allow the item veto to apply to tax loopholes that lose money \nafter 5 years, and that portion of his amendment and only that is what \nmy backup amendment, that I have just referenced that is being held at \nthe desk, would address. My amendment would apply to the line-item veto \nto a 10-year window rather than 5.\n  As I stated earlier, if Senator Bradley's amendment succeeds I will \nnot call up my amendment, as his amendment would already have addressed \nthe issue. But if the Bradley amendment fails, then I think the least \nwe should do is to proceed with the consideration of the backup \namendment that is at the desk, that I think has probably a pretty \nbroad-based support on both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona. I reserve the remainder of my time \nif any and yield it back to him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would add as cosponsors Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, \nSenator Exon of Nebraska, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, and \nSenator Simon of Illinois.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under the previous unanimous consent agreement I move to \ntable the amendment at this time.\n  In accordance with the wishes of the Senator from New Jersey, I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to stack this \nalong with other votes until the hour of 5 p.m. today.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to that, there \nhas been no clearance of that on this side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I modify that request? I ask unanimous consent to \ndelay the vote for a short period of time, until there is some \nagreement on both sides as to when votes will take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for recognition to make a suggestion \nto my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend from Nebraska, since--if, in the case of \nthe defeat of the Bradley amendment he is going to have another \namendment, perhaps he and I might debate that amendment now in the \nevent the Bradley amendment does go down?\n  Mr. EXON. That might be in order. I would not hesitate to do that if \nthe Senator thinks this is the right time to do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Nebraska wishes to do that now I \nthink it would be appropriate.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to debate the amendment without calling up \nthe amendment now.\n  I would simply say I think most of the debate has been covered on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I heard the Senator say he was going to propose this if \nthe Bradley amendment was defeated. I, frankly, think we need this 10-\nyear thing, whether the Bradley amendment carries or not because the \nBradley amendment does exempt certain types of tax breaks.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the Senator will yield, the amendment that is before \nthe Senate at this time includes the 10-year window. So, if you are \nvoting for the Bradley amendment you are voting for what would be the \nExon amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. The time is from the Senator--I do not see that in the \namendment from the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The amendment is not time limited. It would apply to a \ntax expenditure whenever--it could be 15 years. There is no 10-year \nlimit. It is forever.\n  Mr. SIMON. But, if I may, what the Bradley amendment says is:\n\n       . . . but such term does not include any benefit provided \n     to a class of taxpayers distinguished on the basis of general \n     demographic conditions such as income, number of dependents, \n     or marital status.\n\n  Why I favor the idea of the 10-year projection is, even if the \nBradley amendment is accepted, if someone wants to get a tax break for \ndivorcees, just as one example, we ought to know what that is going to \ncost, not just for 5 years but for 10 years.\n  So I think the Exon amendment still makes sense even though we accept \nthe Bradley amendment. I am strongly for the Bradley amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I simply respond to the question posed by my \ncolleague from Illinois--as I said just before I yielded to him, I \nstrongly support the Bradley amendment and most of the arguments that \nhave been made for the Bradley amendment, and I am a cosponsor--that \nwould be taken care of if the Bradley amendment prevailed. Basically \nthe thrust of this--and I will be glad to talk individually with my \ncolleague from Illinois--the Bradley amendment strikes not just a 5-\nyear reference. It strikes any reference whatsoever. That would simply \nmean that forever we would have to do this. It probably is the right \nway to go.\n  My backup proposal would be to extend the 5-year provision to 10 \nyears, and that is what we have been talking about. Therefore, it is a \ncompromise that might be accepted on the other side and, I think, would \nbe much better than the 5-year amendment, not as good as what I think \nis implied in the Bradley amendment. But mine is a compromise.\n  I would be very glad to listen to further statements or reasoning on \nwhat I am sure are well-intentioned remarks made by my friend from \nIllinois.\n  If I might very briefly, I would simply say, as I have talked with my \ncolleague from Arizona, the floor manager on this on the other side of \nthe aisle, it seems to me that all of the basic thrust for doing this \nhas been covered very well on the Bradley amendment. I think it would \nbe repetitious for me to go through a whole new argument on this. I am \nsure this is fully understood by my colleague from Arizona.\n  I would simply say that I would incorporate in the support of my \namendment all of the arguments that have been made in a very articulate \nfashion by my colleague from New Jersey on his amendment, and at an \nappropriate time today, after the majority leader decides after \nconsultation with the minority leader when we should begin voting, my \nintention is to call up the Exon backup amendment only until a decision \nis made by the body on disposition of the Bradley amendment, \n[[Page S4310]]  which would be the first item voted in this area, as I \nunderstand it, and we will be glad to take it up at that time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on this side we are in agreement with the \nExon amendment. I believe that it would be accepted if, in the case of \nthe Bradley amendment, there is rejection by this body of the Bradley \namendment.\n  The problem with the Bradley amendment is not the time we are talking \nabout, but it is the broadening of the scope of the targeted tax \nbenefits.\n  So I want to assure my colleague from Nebraska that unless something \nunusual happens between now and the time we vote on the Bradley \namendment--around here anything can happen--at least speaking, I \nbelieve, with some confidence, we would accept by voice vote the Exon \namendment and thereby eliminate the requirement for another recorded \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my friend from Nebraska while \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order to conserve time and move briskly \nahead, I would like to make a few brief remarks on an amendment that \nSenator Hollings of South Carolina will be offering very shortly. I \nwould like to address the Hollings amendment which incorporates the \npay-as-you-go system on the Budget Act.\n  The amendment to be offered by my friend and colleague from South \nCarolina was offered in the Budget Committee during markup on the \nmeasure we are now addressing on the floor of the Senate.\n  This amendment would codify and strengthen one of the most important \nprovisions of the budget process law--the pay-as-you-go rule. It simply \ncodifies into the Budget Act section 23 of the 1995 budget resolution, \nwhich sets forth the 10-year pay-as-you-go rule. This rule has been a \nresounding success.\n  The amendment also makes two worthwhile additions to the provisions \nthat exist in the current law. First, it applies the pay-as-you-go rule \nto budget resolutions. This is a position that the Budget Committee \nchairman, Senator Domenici, advocated in his substitute budget \nresolution in prior years.\n  Second, the amendment would require Congress to use a CBO baseline in \ncalculating whether the pay-as-you-go rule has been violated or not. \nCurrent law requires us to measure against the budget resolution \nbaseline.\n  Most years, these two are one and the same thing. However, this year, \nthere is much talk about pumping up the numbers for reasons of the so-\ncalled dynamic scorekeeping, or some rosy scenarios regarding the \nchanges in the Consumer Price Index. This amendment would help to \nensure that we cannot play games with the baseline, which I think is \nabsolutely critical if we are going to be up front and honest.\n  The bottom line is that the pay-as-you-go rule has worked extremely \nwell. Under the pay-as-you-go rule, Congress has restrained its \nappetite for new entitlement programs and has gone without wasteful \ndeficit-increasing tax cuts. Congress can still create entitlements or \ncut taxes. This rule simply requires that we pay for what we do. This \nis the essence of sound budget policy.\n  Mr. President, while awaiting the return to the floor of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and, hopefully, the appearance on the floor very shortly \nof Senator Hollings of South Carolina to offer the amendment I \nreferenced, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table the Bradley amendment has \nbeen set aside. Therefore, amendments are in order.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 404 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that entitlement and tax legislation shall not \n                          worsen the deficit)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 404 to Amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.  . PAY-AS-YOU-GO.\n\n       ``At the end of title III of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974, inert the following new section:\n\n\n                      ```enforcing pay-as-you-go.\n\n       ```Sec. 314.

Mr. President, this amendment pertains to budget \nresolutions. In the budget resolution passed last year, there is a \nprovision that states that:\n       . . . for the purposes of this applicable time period--\n\n  Referring to whether certain legislation is deficit neutral.\n\n     and under section 23, on a point of order, 23 (b)(2): For the \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``applicable time \n     period'' means any one of the following periods: The period \n     of the 5 fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted \n     concurrent resolution on the budget, or, (c), the period of \n     the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 years covered by the \n     most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget. \n     And for the purposes of that particular definition, the term \n     ``direct spending,'' or ``receipts,'' shall include any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, to which \n     this subsection otherwise applies, (b) excluding concurrent \n     resolutions on the budget.\n\n  Now, we have a 10-year rule for all legislation save the budget \nresolution. Specifically, Mr. President, on the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, we had a 10-year rule. In fact, it so happened that \nthe President of the United States got this Senator personally on the \ntelephone and asked if we would waive that rule, and I said ``no''. I \nhad gone along with my distinguished chairman, Senator Domenici, of the \nBudget Committee. It was a fundamental issue that we look at revenue \nlosses over a 10-year period.\n  The reason for that is very apparent once we focus on certain \nprovisions in the Contract With America. I am not just talking \npolitically, because politically, I favor some of the items in the \ncontract. I favor, for example, a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, if Republicans would only put in there what they say, \nthat it is against the law to use Social Security funds for the \ndeficit. If they would only put that provision in there, they have \nmyself and four other Senators. We can pass the balanced budget \namendment this afternoon, or any time. We are ready to go.\n  But I want to talk about the line-item veto. I support the line-item \nveto and have established a record in my efforts over the last 10-\nyears.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my record be printed in the \nRecord at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Hollings Record: Line-Item Veto\n\n       Since 1985, U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings has pushed for a \n     separate enrollment line-item veto to give the president \n     power to cut wasteful spending. Here is his record:\n       1995: On Jan. 18, Hollings introduced his separate \n     enrollment line-item veto bill (S. 238) and co-sponsored a \n     similar measure introduced by Bradley (S. 137).\n       1994: On Oct. 5, Hollings submitted testimony to the Senate \n     Budget Committee that strongly pushed a separate enrollment \n     line-item veto.\n       1993: On Jan. 24, Hollings introduced his separate \n     enrollment line-item veto bill (S. 92).\n       On June 24, Hollings and Bradley offered an amendment to \n     the Omnibus Reconciliation Bill that would have extended \n     separate enrollment authority to tax expenditures and \n     appropriations. The amendment failed (53-45) to get the 60 \n     votes needed to bypass a budget point-of-order.\n       1991: On Jan. 14, Hollings introduced a separate enrollment \n     line-item veto bill (S. 165).\n       On July 24, Hollings testified before the Senate Rules \n     Committee to support his separate enrollment line-item veto \n     bill (S. 165).\n       1990: On Oct. 10, Hollings fought to have a separate \n     enrollment line-item veto favorably reported out of the \n     Senate Budget Committee. For the first time ever--and on a \n     bi-partisan basis--the proposal passed in the committee by a \n     13-6 vote.\n       1987: On Jan. 28, Hollings was an original co-sponsor of \n     separate enrollment legislation (S. 402).\n       1985: On Feb. 5, Hollings co-sponsored S. 43, a separate \n     enrollment line-item veto bill by Sen. Mack Mattingly.\n       In July, Hollings voted twice for cloture on S. 43, but the \n     motions failed twice to get the necessary 60 votes (July 18: \n     57-42; July 24: 58-40).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been in the vineyards for a long \ntime on that line-item veto. I used it 35 years ago when the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, I think, was the highway \ncommissioner for the State of North Carolina. That was back when we \nwere working in tandem, North and South Carolina, on bringing economic \nrecovery to both of our wonderful States.\n  I had to use a line-item veto in order to get the triple A credit \nrating, because I knew nobody was going to invest in Podunk. They were \nnot going to come to a State that was not paying its bills. We used it \nvery effectively then, and I have always thought it is fundamental in \nfixing responsibility and in creating accountability.\n  We can look at the Contract With America and get a good sense of what \nI'm talking about. There is the capital gains tax that we all know \nabout. That has been estimated by the Department of Treasury, of \ncourse, in the first 5 years to lose only $28.4 billion, but over the \nnext 5 years, $91.9 billion. So you can see the losses accelerate \nmarkedly and that should be considered by those who favor the capital \ngains tax. We are not talking about rich and poor and who is or isn't \ngetting a tax cut, but rather, to the contrary, whether we have truth \nin budgeting.\n  The second item, one that has been favored by the former Secretary of \nthe Treasury and former chairman of the Finance Committee, the former \nSenator from Texas, Senator Bentsen and others, is the IRA's, the \nindividual retirement accounts. What they term now as the American \ndream savings account. We are getting now like the Defense Department \nwith the Brilliant Pebbles and Sparkling Light and all these kinds of \nnonsensical designations. I wish we would cut out our dreaming up here \nand start work. The American dream savings account, well that is an \nIRA, an individual retirement account. Yes, for the year 1995 to the \nyear 2000, that would gain revenue. That is a revenue picker-upper. \nThat is income. That is increasing the revenue to the Federal \nGovernment by a tune of $3.8 billion. But then you look at the next 5 \nyears, it loses $21.8 billion.\n  And then they have one with respect to the schedule of depreciation \nallowances.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair, being a very successful \nbusinessman, understands depreciation allowances, and how you can get \naccelerated recovery.\n  They have a provision that is now before the Ways and Means Committee \nand before our Finance Committee that is called neutral cost recovery. \nWhenever they say neutral, look out. That means that it is not neutral, \nI can tell you that. You just learn from hard experience, when they get \nthese fancy words.\n  For the first 5 years, 1995 to the year 2000, that picks up revenue \nat $18.4 billion, but for the years 2000 to 2005, it is scheduled to \nlose $120 billion.\n  If we look at the total cost of the Contract With America we can see \nthat the estimated cost over the first 5 years is $188 billion, but for \nthe second 5 years, the Federal Government loses $630.2 billion.\n  This is not truth in budgeting. That has been the hard experience now \nof over 20 years of the Budget Act with respect to the measure. We \nthought last year we had done a good job and we saved money. Then we \ncome up and we say, ``Oops, instead of cutting spending, we have \nincreased it. Instead of recouping revenues, we have cut the \nrevenues.'' And we are all out of balance again. That is how you get \n$200 and $300 billion deficits on into the next century. It has to \nstop.\n  One big way and most assured way, Mr. President, of stopping that \nwould be to get truth in budgeting and adopt this 10-year rule.\n  Now, I want to refer to the 10-year rule, because I said momentarily \nthat I was not referring to it to score political points. \nUnfortunately, we have taken to partisanship in this body, and it is \nunfortunate. We do not have the comity that we used to have when I \nfirst came here to the Senate.\n  But it is important to stress where the idea for my amendment comes \nfrom. In the fiscal year 1995 Republican budget resolution that was \nsubmitted by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee just last \nMarch, I refer to their miscellaneous section No. 1 and description and \nI now read word for word.\n\n       [[Page S4312]] Strengthen the 10-year pay-as-you-go point \n     of order. While the 10-year pay-as-you-go point of order that \n     was established by last year's budget resolution is \n     permanent, it does not currently apply to budget resolutions \n     and could be repealed by a subsequent budget resolution. This \n     proposal would make future budget resolutions subject to this \n     point of order.\n\n  That was the particular provision of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that they submitted.\n  I tried to offer it in committee. The Budget Committee met and we had \ndiscussions, but we were told at the time, ``Let's not take it up on S. \n4. Let's not take it up on S. 14, but have it later.''\n  Well, we have not had a scheduled markup. And I think that this \namendment, if offered in reconciliation, would require the 60 votes \nbecause of the Byrd rule. But we need it; it would bring truth in \nbudgeting to budgets, as well as other legislation before us.\n  So I hope that they can join, as they indicated they wanted to and \nindicated in various sessions that I have been with them. And I know \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is dedicated to \ntruth in budgeting. This would be a perfect way to make it permanent \nfor all budget resolutions. In the upcoming budget resolution, we are \ngoing to need spending cuts, we are going to have to have spending \nfreezes, and we are going to have to close particular loopholes. And in \nthis particular Senator's opinion, it is going to require additional \nrevenues in order to do what we all say we are going to do; namely, in \na 7-year period bring us back into the black and put us on a pay-as-\nyou-go basis. It is going to be quite a task.\n  And do not underestimate the power of Congress to be creative. We can \ndo away with departments, get into capital budgets, get into sale of \ncapital assets, the power grid out west and everything else. But that \nis just a one-time savings; it does not really bringing us into \nbalance.\n  They can get into using Social Security. They say they do not want to \nuse Social Security, but, very interestingly, very interestingly, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said on Tuesday, March \n21--and I will quote from page 4 of an article.\n  Senator Packwood said:\n\n       Nothing is sacred including Social Security and other \n     entitlement programs.\n\n  If the chairman of the Finance Committee is thinking in terms of \nusing Social Security then we really are in a pickle.\n  We hear of plans to reestimate the CPI, but if that is to occur, it \nshould be reestimated in a technical fashion and not a political \nfashion. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reviews the CPI every 10 years. \nIt is my understanding that we are due for another recomputation of the \nConsumer Price Index in 1998. We can do it in 1995. Suits me, as long \nas it is done in the same technical fashion, and not done in a \npolitical fashion.\n  The reason I refer to that ``in a political fashion,'' is simply that \nI have a quote from the distinguished Speaker of the House, Newt \nGingrich. I refer to a release on January 16, 1995, and I quote:\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich threatened Saturday to withhold \n     funding from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nwhich prepares the CPI each month, unless it changed its approach, at a \ntown meeting in Kennesaw, GA. The Reuters News Service reported that \nGingrich said:\n\n       We had a handful of bureaucrats who all professional \n     economists agree, have an error in their calculations. If \n     they can't get it right in the next 30 days or so, we zero \n     them out. We transfer the responsibility to either the \n     Federal Reserve or the Treasury and tell them to get it \n     right.\n  If I was over in Treasury, or wherever, and he transferred it to me \nbecause they had not gotten it right, I think I could get it right \nbecause, if not, I might get zeroed out.\n  So let Congress go along with an accurate estimation, a statistical \nestimation, a professionally done estimation and not a political \nestimation.\n  Therein is some of the creativity, whether using the CPI, or the $636 \nbillion from Social Security that they can pick up by using Social \nSecurity under the language of House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  They are just absolutely determined to repeal section 13301 of the \nBudget Act, that law that was signed into law by President George Bush \non November 5, 1990.\n  If we all sing from the same hymnal and the same sheet music we will \nget truth in budgeting with this particular amendment.\n  What we will do is apply the same law that we have applied toward \neveryone else in the Government. If you are on the Agriculture \nCommittee, you are subject to the 10-year rule. If you are on the \nFinance Committee with GATT, you are subject to the 10-year rule. If \nyou are a member of the Appropriations Committee, you are subject to \nthe 10-year rule. Interior, Commerce, go right on down the list.\n  But the very crowd that put in this 10-year rule for everybody else \nsays, ``By the way, not for us.'' I just do not think that is right. I \ndo not think it is honest in that regard. I think we ought to get \nhonesty, get truth in budgeting and put it in there with respect to the \nbudget resolutions, as well as all the other permanent provisions, that \n10-year rule was so eloquently endorsed by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican alternative just a year ago.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4301-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4312-S4313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTEGRITY OF DEFENSE BUDGET NUMBERS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to resume my discussion of the \naccuracy of defense budget numbers. I have been speaking on the subject \nof the Defense Department and the issue of our appropriations for the \nsucceeding fiscal years so far this week on two other occasions. I will \nhave two other speeches to make on this subject.\n  Yesterday, I started discussing the mismatches in the DOD's budget \nand its accounting books. I want to pick up where I left off yesterday. \nI want to tick off some of the most glaring disconnects and mismatches \nthat we have in the accounting books.\n  First, the General Accounting Office says that our Defense Department \nhas at least $33 billion of problem disbursements. That is the latest \nfigure, $33 billion. Just June 30, last year, the Defense Department \nquantified this problem that they call problem disbursements to be only \n$25 billion. We have an $8 billion increase in that figure called \nproblem disbursements.\n  Every time I check, the estimate seems to be higher. It just keeps \nclimbing. Now it is $33 billion. A person might ask, what is a problem \ndisbursement? That is their language. It is primarily a disbursement \nthat cannot be matched with an obligation.\n  Secretary Perry has $33 billion in unmatched disbursements. He thus \nhas $33 billion in costs that cannot be tracked. I cannot say that we \nsay that that is spent illegally. It is just that we have not matched \nit up at this point.\n  But that is a major problem when you consider the fact that there are \npeople in this Congress who want to increase defense expenditures by \n$55 billion or more over the next 5 years.\n  Secretary Perry knows that the $33 billion was spent, but he does not \nknow how the $33 billion was spent. He does not know what it bought. \nAll he knows for sure is that the $33 billion went out the door.\n  Some of it could have been stolen, and I can show you a couple cases \nof real fraud in a moment.\n  We are never really going to know how the money was used until all \nthe matches are made. If we cannot make hookups on the $33 billion, \nthen what does that say about the other outlay numbers in the budget? \nAre they hooked up to the right accounts?\n  There is a second major disconnect in the accounting books. This is \nthe one between the check writers and the accountants who are supposed \nto make sure that the work, services, or product was performed and \ngoods or services delivered before payment is made.\n   [[Page S4313]] A recent spot-check audit by the General Accounting \nOffice produced some very disturbing results: $1.4 billion of \noverpayments. Contractors, in some instances, voluntarily returned \nmoney. It was not earned. It was not due. But we tried to pay it. And \nthey wanted to return it.\n  The result of a new General Accounting Office audit is just as bad: \n$820 million in erroneous payments to the top 100 contractors. How many \nother faulty payments remain undetected or unreturned? I do not think \nanybody knows. Even the news media and a Pentagon official spoke about \nit, in reaction to my comments yesterday. People high up say, yes, they \nknow they have major problems.\n  The Pentagon check-writing machine is stuck on full power. It is on \nautomatic pilot, and the accounting department has gone on a long \nvacation. In some cases, the Defense Department tells the contractors, \n``Don't worry, just hold on to the overpayment until your contracts are \nreconciled.''\n  That brings me then to the third big financial disconnect at the \nPentagon.\n  Reconciliation is a detailed examination of contracts with known or \nsuspected problems and is a primary tool of detecting duplicate, \nerroneous, or illegal payments. Unreconciled contracts--that is another \nbottomless accounting pit.\n  The problem has been identified by both the GAO and the DOD inspector \ngeneral. One of the Pentagon's main contract paying operations, the \ncenter in Columbus, OH, has 13,600 unreconciled contracts, including \n2,707 contracts that are overdisbursed by $1.2 billion.\n  The checking account on those 2,707 contracts is overdrawn by $1.2 \nbillion then. Since the records are in such bad shape, the DOD IG and \nthe GAO think it will take 5 million to 10 million man-hours to \nreconcile these contracts. At $58 an hour charged by a firm like \nCoopers & Lybrand, it could cost $550 million to make all the fiscal \nconnections and to clean up the accounting mess. And that is the \ncleanup cost for just one location, Columbus, OH. And there are many \nothers.\n  At those rates, the total cost of the bookkeeping cleanup operation \ncould approach the cost of the DOD's environmental cleanup operation.\n  There is a fourth gaping hole in the accounting books. This one may \neven be worse. This one involves DBOF, which is short for the Defense \nBusiness Operations Fund.\n  DBOF is a $77 billion-a-year operation. DBOF purchases everything \nfrom fuel to repair parts to toilet paper and light bulbs. Much of what \nis bought by DBOF is needed to train the Armed Forces and keep them \nready for combat. Unfortunately, DBOF's books are a mess. DBOF's books \nare in such bad shape that the inspector general had to issue a \ndisclaimer of opinion for the second year in a row.\n  In the language of accountants, that means the IG could not audit \nDBOF's books. If you cannot audit the books, you do not know how much \nmoney is being spent. We know how much money is being pumped into DBOF, \nbut we do not have any idea what is coming out the other end.\n  The breakdown of controls within DBOF could help to explain why the \nPentagon still cannot relate resources to readiness. DBOF should help \nus answer this question: If we add $1 billion to the budget to increase \nreadiness, how much more readiness do we get? DBOF cannot answer that \nissue.\n  The breakdown of fiscal connections within DBOF alone means that \nthere are no controls or accountability over about 30 percent of the \ndefense budget.\n  Mr. President, I know that these are harsh judgments on the condition \nof the Department of Defense's books, but they are based on many years \nof watchdogging, plus the carefully documented work of the General \nAccounting Office and the DOD inspector general.\n  We have a breakdown in the financial controls in four key areas of \nthe defense budget. Unless this mess gets cleaned up, we will not know \nhow DOD is spending the people's money. The breakdown of internal \ncontrols makes it easy to steal money from defense accounts. The \nimplications of the defense accounting breakdown were brought home hard \nrecently in two cases: The cases of a Mr. James Lugas and a Mr. James \nEdward McGill. Both men are in jail for stealing from the taxpayers. \nBoth were able to tap into the DOD money pipe with ease and steal \nmillions of dollars.\n  They operated undetected for a number of years, and they were not \ndetected because of internal audits or tight controls. They were caught \nby pure chance. They were caught because of their own outrageous \nbehavior.\n  One was a low level GS-8 accountant. He was literally living like a \nking. His neighbors thought he was dealing in drugs, so they turned him \nin.\n  The other submitted 32 invoices for payment on a phantom ship that \nthe Navy supposedly had. All he needed to set up shop and do business \nwith the Navy were a rubber stamp, blank invoices, and a mailbox. And \nthe checks just started rolling in. He never did any work. Nor did he \never perform any services.\n  If the DOD was matching disbursements with obligations as they \noccurred, then Mr. Lugas and Mr. McGill would have been caught \nimmediately. And that is what worries me, Mr. President. How many \nothers like McGill and Lugas have tapped into the DOD money pipe \nundetected?\n  This situation is a disgrace. It tells me we cannot meet our \nconstitutional obligations to the taxpayers of our country to make sure \ntheir money is honestly and legally spent. We cannot give the taxpayers \nan accurate and complete report on how the Pentagon is spending their \nmoney.\n  This is a serious breach of responsibility to the American people. \nThat is over the long haul. But immediately, Mr. President, as we go \ninto the budget process over the next 2 months, both Houses of Congress \nneed to be cognizant of the unmatched disbursements, the stealing of \nmoney, before we put $55 billion more in the defense budget.\n  How can you make that determination in good conscience if you do not \nhave a good accounting system and know from where you are starting?\n  So I end these remarks on the disconnect between the accounting and \nbudget books.\n  Tomorrow, I want to turn to the program budget mismatch, which is \nalso a major problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4312-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4313-S4322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \npending amendment, the line-item veto substitute amendment that is \nbefore the body, and in the course of doing that to express some \nthoughts on the line-item veto issue more broadly.\n  I am very much concerned that any proposal, unless very carefully \ndeveloped and worked out, could result in a fundamental reordering of \nthe separation of powers and check and balance arrangements between the \nlegislative and the executive branches.\n  Unfortunately, there is a tendency to dismiss these kinds of \nquestions, although they were very much at the forefront of the \nthinking of the Founding Fathers when they devised the Constitution \nthat summer in Philadelphia. A Constitution which has served us well \nover two centuries of the Republic's history. A very careful balanced \narrangement was put together then, and I think when it comes to \nchanging it, we need to be very cautious and very prudent.\n  It does not take a great deal of skill or vision to have a strong \nexecutive. Many countries throughout history \n[[Page S4314]]  have had very strong executives. In fact, if they are \ntoo strong, we refer to them as dictatorships. One of the hallmarks of \na free society is having a legislative branch and a judicial branch \nwith some independence and with some decisionmaking authority which can \noperate as a check and balance upon the executive. I repeat, many \ncountries have had strong executives, but they have not been the \nexamples that we want to follow or to emulate.\n  The great achievement of the American constitutional system is to \nhave established a National Government with independent branches that \ncheck and balance one another, to have not only an Executive but \nlegislative branch with some power and authority. I think we have to be \nvery careful that the proposals which come before us with respect to \nline-item veto not erode the balance and the arrangement that has \nserved the Republic well for over 205 years.\n  The danger, of course, is that these line-item veto proposals open up \nthe opportunity for the Executive branch, for the President, to bring \nto bear enormous pressure upon Members of Congress and, therefore, \nmarkedly affect the dynamics between the two branches. What the various \nforms of the line-item veto would do, unless very carefully restrained, \nis enable a President to link votes on matters unrelated to the \nappropriation bill to a specific item in the appropriation measure.\n  Members may well be confronted with a situation in which the \nExecutive says, ``I see this item in this bill, and it is a good item; \neveryone has justified it; it makes a lot of sense; it is obviously \nvery important to your State or to your district; and I certainly do \nnot want to exercise my veto over it; but I am very concerned about the \nposition you are taking''--and then he mentions some totally unrelated \nissue, perhaps a nomination to the Supreme Court, perhaps a foreign \npolicy matter involving very important issues of war and peace, or \nother issues on the domestic front.\n  Of course, the Executive then is in position to bring enormous \npressure to bear. So the line-item veto tool becomes used not as many \nhave suggested, as a way to delete spending items and address through \nthat deletion the deficit problem, it becomes a tool and a legislative \nstrategy by the White House and by the Executive branch to sway Members \nin terms of the positions they take on unrelated items. It becomes a \nheavy weapon of pressure.\n  Now, the particular provision that is before us was not the subject \nof any committee hearings or any report. There is no report with \nrespect to this provision. It was a substitute that was simply \npresented on the floor. It would require individual items in an \nappropriation bill to be separately enrolled and presented to the \nPresident. And as the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nthe former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, demonstrated \nyesterday, a single appropriations bill could end up as thousands of \nindividual enrolled bills that would be sent to the President to be \nsigned or vetoed.\n  Senator Byrd indicated yesterday that this dramatic change in our \nsystem for enacting legislation raises many significant constitutional \nissues. First, you have important questions about the role of the \nenrolling clerk in carrying this forward. What will be sent to the \nPresident is not identical with what was passed by the Congress. It \nwill be what we pass subsequently broken up by the enrolling clerk. It \nis not as though the Senate and the House were asked to pass each of \nthese items and then that was sent to the President. That at least I \nthink would be consistent with existing constitutional arrangements.\n  With the proposal before us, you will be passing a bill, and then the \nenrollment clerk is going to divide it up into lots of little bills. I \nthink Senator Byrd referred to them as ``billettes.'' And those would \nbe sent to the President. In fact, I think there is a very strong \nargument that this scheme would violate the presentment clause in \narticle I, section 7 of the Constitution, which provides:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     law, be presented to the President of the United States.\n       If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return \n     it.\n\n  It seems clear to me that what would be presented to the President is \nnot what has passed the House and the Senate. In fact, I understand \nthat the Assistant Attorney General from the Office of Legal Counsel \nhas raised serious concerns about the separate enrollment approach \ncontained in this substitute amendment with the observation:\n\n       On what seems to us to be the best reading of the \n     Presentment Clause, what must be presented to the President \n     is the bill in exactly the form in which it was voted on and \n     passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     rather than a measure or a series of measures that \n     subsequently have been abstracted from that bill by the clerk \n     of the relevant House.\n\n  Obviously, this raises a serious constitutional issue, and I hope \nMembers will stop and deliberate about it very carefully as we consider \nthe substitute proposal that is before us.\n  Under this substitute, the separate enrollment of each item would be \nthe responsibility of the enrollment clerk after the larger bill has \npassed the Congress. The Congress would never actually vote on the \nindividual so-called bills that would go to the President. Therefore, \nit represents a dramatic and drastic departure from our constitutional \narrangements.\n  Only this morning there was an editorial in the paper, which I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. This editorial said in part:\n\n       The ``compromise'' line-item veto bill that Republicans \n     have put on the Senate floor is as bad as the bill it would \n     replace, and not a compromise at all. It is sloppily drawn, \n     would greatly complicate the legislative process, invite \n     evasions, and likely do little to accomplish its ostensible \n     purpose of reducing excess spending and the deficit. The main \n     effect would be to disturb the traditional balance of powers \n     by strengthening the President and congressional minorities \n     at the majority's expense.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reflect on the history of the \nexisting scheme for Presidential rescission of spending items.\n  Congress enacted the Budget Impoundment and Control Act in 1974 in \nresponse to Executive excesses by a President who impounded funds duly \nenacted into law. I supported that act--as a Member of the House--to \nrestore balance between the executive and legislative branches. And it \nis quite possible, of course, to further refine the rescissions scheme \nfirst put forth in the 1974 act. In fact, there has been legislation \nwhich Senators Domenici and Exon had been recommending to do exactly \nthat. I understand that the minority leader will be making proposals \nwith respect to so-called expedited rescission that would enable us to \nmove forward on this issue. That would ensure the President that items \nhe picked out of an appropriation bill and said should be rescinded \nwould come to the Congress and would have to be voted on by the \nCongress.\n  That is not now the case. The President can pick the items out for \nrescission, but a vote on them is not actually required. This proposal, \nthe so-called expedited rescission proposal, would ensure that a vote \nhad to be taken. And it provides, of course, that if a majority in both \nHouses does not agree that the item should be rescinded, then it would \nnot be rescinded.\n  But, it does provide a way to put a spotlight on the item, if that is \nwhat the President wishes to do, and it does require the Members of the \nCongress to address the issue and to address it directly.\n  I understand, also, that the proposal that the minority leader may \nmake would include within it so-called tax expenditures as an item also \nover which the President would have that particular rescission \nauthority, and then would be able to require a direct vote by both \nHouses of the Congress on that item.\n  That is a change in procedure, but it is one that I think is worthy \nof consideration and it does not fundamentally alter the arrangements \nbetween the Executive and the legislative branch that are currently \ncontained in the Constitution of the United States.\n  It is a more restrained and balanced approach, I think, to try to \naddress this issue. It does not represent the \n[[Page S4315]]  drastic departure from past constitutional practice \nwhich is contained in the amendment before us, or indeed in other more \nsweeping proposals. And it does not shift the balance between the \nExecutive and the legislative branches in a drastic way. It addresses \nthe concerns that have been raised without creating even larger \nproblems--problems which would flow from a fundamental altering of the \nbasic relationship which has existed for more than two centuries \nbetween the Executive and legislative branches.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope this amendment will be defeated when \nwe finally vote on it. I am hopeful that an appropriate alternative can \nbe worked out along the lines of what is called the expedited \nrescission approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 22, 1995]\n\n                         Another in the Senate\n\n       The ``compromise'' line-item veto bill that Republicans \n     have put on the Senate floor is as bad as the bill it would \n     replace, and not a compromise at all. It is sloppily drawn, \n     would greatly complicate the legislative process, invite \n     evasions and likely do little to accomplish its ostensible \n     purpose of reducing excess spending and the deficit. The main \n     effect would be to disturb the traditional balance of powers \n     by strengthening the president and congressional minorities \n     at the majority's expense.\n       The problem, if there is one, is that presidents now can't \n     pick and choose among the items in appropriations and other \n     money bills. They can only sign or veto them in their \n     entirety. In the Reagan and Bush years, the myth grew up that \n     this was one of the reasons the deficit was so large--not \n     presidential policy, but the inability of (Republican) \n     presidents to curb the (Democratic) congressional proclivity \n     to spend.\n       Unfortunately, the myth has survived the election returns. \n     The Republicans remain committed to giving the president \n     greater power to single out and block line items, and \n     President Clinton has unwisely said he wants as much such \n     power as Congress is willing to confer. The House passed \n     legislation under which he could sign an appropriations bill, \n     then propose to kill or reduce any item in it. Congress would \n     then have to pass a second bill to block such a proposal, and \n     that could be vetoed, so that two-thirds votes of both houses \n     would be required to sustain even the smallest spending \n     detail to which a president might object.\n       Some Senators of both parties rightly thought that was too \n     great a cession of power. They proposed instead a system in \n     which Congress would have to reaffirm its support for line \n     items to which a president objected, but majority votes would \n     be enough to prevail. But the Republicans in this group came \n     under party pressure to back off and support the present \n     ``compromise'' instead.\n       Congress would pass appropriations and other money bills as \n     now, then split them into line items or other designated \n     parts--perhaps thousands per bill--and send each part to the \n     president to be signed or vetoed separately. It's a recipe \n     for writer's cramp. The president plus a minority of one-\n     third plus one of either house would be enough to govern. The \n     rule would also apply to any increase in entitlements and any \n     revenue-losing tax provision ``having the practical effect of \n     providing more favorable tax treatment to a particular \n     taxpayer or limited group of taxpayers when compared with \n     other similary situated taxpayers.'' To what might that not \n     apply?\n       The line-item veto has become a political symbol. The \n     members of both parties who are so blithely supporting it, \n     including Bill Clinton, need to ask themselves what it means. \n     If the next president doesn't like a particular program for \n     whatever reason--it needn't be the cost--he and a minority of \n     either house can flick it out of the budget and out of \n     existence. It could happen as easily to a new weapons system \n     as it could to the likes of the national service corps. For \n     lack of political will, the legislative branch votes to make \n     itself that much weaker. Who wins from that?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as all know, the Senate is debating a \ntruly fundamental change to our system of Government. We have before us \nlegislation which proposes to reconsider some of the most basic \nprinciples of our democracy. For over 200 years the Federal Government \nhas maintained a careful balance between the powers of the legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches. That balance has stood the test of \ntime and has helped sustain our Nation's cherished liberties for \ngenerations. Given that remarkable record, I think we need to be very \ncautious before altering this historic balance of powers. And it is not \nsomething we should do lightly. It is not something we should rush \nthrough.\n  We do, however, have to be prepared to respond to changing conditions \nand to make needed changes in the way we do business. Despite all that \nis good about our democratic system we also face some real problems and \none of the most important is Government waste and the deep public anger \nthat it provokes.\n  Almost more than any time in our history, it is critical to reduce \nwaste in Government. We are continuing to load debt on our children and \ngrandchildren. The tax burden is heavy. Americans are losing faith in \nGovernment as they are repeatedly bombarded with examples of \nunnecessary spending from fraud in Government programs to the Lawrence \nWelk center.\n  Taxpayers are infuriated, and they have a right to be. They also have \na right to demand that we do something about it. And there is broad \npublic support for trying some form of line-item veto. Yet we ought not \nto exaggerate what a line-item veto can accomplish. It will not \neliminate all Government waste nor will it balance the budget. It may \nresult in eliminating unnecessary pork-barrel projects and special-\ninterest loopholes. That is not to say that all narrowly targeted \nspending or tax provisions are wasteful. We all know that many are. And \nthe most egregious examples get the most publicity and erode public \nconfidence in the Congress and in our Government. Surely that is one \nreason why the public is so angry with Washington. We need to look for \nways to address this problem and the line-item veto might help by \ngiving the President power to eliminate items that are truly \nindefensible.\n  Under current law, when the Congress sends the President a broad \nspending or tax bill, the President's options are pretty limited. He \ncan sign the whole bill into law or he can veto the entire package. \nOnce an appropriation bill is enacted, the President can propose to \nrescind specific items of spending and send Congress a rescission, a \nreduction in the original proposal--specifically eliminating one \nrecommendation. But this rescission power is extremely limited.\n  First of all, it does not apply to tax breaks, those breaks that are \ngiven to special interests that cost us money because we lose those \nrevenues. And, in the case of proposed rescissions to appropriations, \nCongress presently can simply ignore them.\n  It seems to me that it is worth trying to give the President of the \nUnited States additional powers to eliminate waste. But as we move into \nthese uncharted waters, fundamentally changing our form of government, \nwe should build in certain protections against abuse of Executive \npower. Restraint of Executive power has been the hallmark of our \nConstitution and has guided our Founding Fathers in its creation.\n  We can strengthen the President's rescission power by making sure \nthat Congress considers all Presidential rescission proposals and does \nso on an expedited basis. Once again, that Congress reviews and \nconsiders all Presidential rescission proposals would be a significant \nstep forward in the fight against waste.\n  Currently, if the President sends rescissions to us to eliminate \nwasteful spending we can simply ignore them, and we often do. Forcing \nreview of wasteful projects is not something that is taken up very \nreadily. And in the glare of public debate, it would be a healthy \nantidote to our current way of doing business.\n  We can also build in protections against abuse of this expanded \nExecutive power by retaining the democratic process of majority rule. \nThe pending legislation would permit the President to kill any \nincreases in spending or changes to entitlement programs if he can \nconvince just one-third of one House of the Congress to support him. \nThat is an enormous expansion of Executive power. It would permit the \nPresident to nullify what a majority of the people's representatives \nhave already approved.\n  Finally, we would guard against abuse of power by the executive by \nrequiring the Congress to review the line-item veto of a proscribed \ntrial period. Initially, I think the shorter this trial the better. If \nthe line-item veto works as its authors intend, it will have a salutary \naffect on our Government, and there will be no problem in extending it.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the proposal before us fails to protect \nagainst Executive branch abuses. It \n[[Page S4316]]  also puts power in the hands of a small minority \nundermining majority rule by demanding a two-thirds vote to override \nthe President's rescission recommendation. It lets one-third of \nCongress rule and the President controlling Federal policy on virtually \nall new spending and entitlement programs. Our Constitution was not \nwritten that way. It was not intended that way.\n  Legislation could also unintentionally hurt smaller States with \nsmaller congressional delegations like mine, like the State of New \nJersey. The proposal would lower the deck in favor of bigger States \nwhich have a leg up on building the necessary two-thirds vote to \noverride a Presidential line-item veto. In my view, it is unwise. Mr. \nPresident, the case for a line-item veto rests largely on the need to \neliminate narrowly targeted pork-barrel spending. But the majority \nleader's amendment goes much further than that. It would allow the \nPresident to unilaterally eliminate funding for entire programs. This \nwould give a single individual the power to kill major initiatives in \neducation, law enforcement, health care, veterans programs, mass \ntransit, immigration enforcement, housing, and you name it. All could \nbe at risk.\n  It would also put Medicare, veterans benefits, and other entitlement \nprograms under the control of a small minority of Congress aligned with \nthe President. I am not suggesting, Mr. President, that President \nClinton or any future President would abuse this new power. But we do \nnot really know and we have to guard against it. That is not a \nDemocratic concern or a Republican concern. It is a nonpartisan \nconcern. It is not a liberal concern. It is not a conservative concern. \nIt is a democratic with a small ``d'' concern. It has nothing to do \nwith party or ideology. It has everything to do with the potential for \nabuse of power and rule by a congressional minority.\n  Let us take one example of a President of my own party, President \nLyndon Baines Johnson. President Johnson was a strong leader who \nexcelled at cajoling and pressing Members of Congress into voting with \nhim. I never experienced it. But the Johnson treatment was something \nthat is legendary. Lyndon Johnson used every tool in his arsenal to \nmake his case, to win his recommendation.\n  Looking to future, a President with strong leadership skills and \nstrong convictions he could gain enormously in power. With just one-\nthird of one House of Congress he could wipe out essential benefits for \nordinary Americans, and a majority in Congress could do nothing to stop \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I urge against giving a President that unbridled \npower. I am not willing to risk that. A future President would be able \nto override a majority in the Congress, and perhaps eliminate all \nschool lunches, or deny middle-class students the opportunity to go to \ncollege, or deny working families a chance for child care, or take \npolice officers off the street, or force young children to go hungry, \nor increase the number of homeless on our streets, or deny veterans the \nbenefits they earned while serving our country, or deny senior citizens \nneeded benefits required under Medicare.\n  Mr. President, these expenditures and these benefits are not pork. \nBut they would all be vulnerable to the line-item veto under the \nproposed majority leader's amendment. A President bent on eliminating \nthem could wield a new tool like a meat ax against ordinary Americans. \nThere needs to be some real protections against that, if we are to have \na line-item veto.\n  I am also concerned that a line-item veto could open the door to what \nsome have called political extortion. I use that term to convey how a \nPresident would be able in effect hold the gun to the heads of the \nMembers of Congress. This could happen. A President could go to a \nMember of Congress and say, ``I need support for my favorite new \ninitiative, and, if you do not agree to support it, it is goodbye for \nthat new highway or special program that is so important in your \ndistrict.'' Mr. President, that kind of political pressure occurs in \nmany States that have a line-item veto, and it can lead to more \nwasteful spending--not less.\n  Mr. President, to limit the possibility that a line-item veto will be \nabused, it is important to keep the Executive on a relatively short \nleash. One way is to require Congress to reauthorize the line-item veto \non a routine basis. Another is to allow a majority in the Congress to \noverrule the President.\n  These protections would preserve the constitutional principle of a \nbalance of power and avoid shifting power, extraordinary power, to the \nexecutive branch or to larger States at the expense of the medium-sized \nor smaller States. It would make it less likely that a future occupant \nof the White House would ride roughshod over the people in the \nCongress. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the pending proposal does not \ninclude adequate protections. It is a serious flaw in the legislation.\n  I am also concerned about the provisions in the pending amendment \nrelated to tax instructions. Those provisions, though drafted \nambiguously apparently are intended to provide a loophole that will \nprotect many special interest tax breaks from rescission.\n  Mr. President, we all know that many special tax breaks that have \nbeen included in tax bills over the years exist. There are special \nrules for the timber industry, for the oil and gas industry, even for \ncruise liners. In fact, a few years ago we tried to enact a special \nloophole for the tuxedo industry. Once enacted, most tax breaks enjoy a \nspecial status that even the most popular spending programs would \nemulate. They never have to be appropriated. They never have to be \nreauthorized. They never have to compete for scarce budgetary \nresources. Instead, they simply nestle quietly and unobtrusively in the \nnooks and the crannies of the Tax Code never to be seen nor heard from \nagain. But they cost us substantial revenues, and their costs are made \nup by imposing extra burdens on ordinary taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, unwarranted tax loopholes go to the heart of what \nbothers so many Americans today. Loopholes generally are provided only \nto special interests and wealthy individuals who have either special \nconnections or enough money to hire a high-priced lobbyist with access \nto Members of Congress. We have seen a lot of stories on lobbying \ninfluence in these recent days and weeks.\n Meanwhile, ordinary Americans do not have those things. They do not \nhave personal relationships with powerful Senators, and they do not \nhave the lobbyists working for them. So when an ordinary American sees \nclients of lobbyists getting special treatment in the Tax Code, they \nreally resent it. They resent it very, very deeply.\n\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment of the majority leader includes \nambiguous language on targeted tax benefits. But according to \nstatements made on this floor, that language is intended to be very \nnarrow. Apparently, if a tax break benefits a particular company, it \nmay be subject to a rescission. But if the loophole benefits two \ncompanies or an entire industry, it will get special protection.\n  Mr. President, that is a loophole law that I cannot support.\n  In conclusion, let me again emphasize that we are talking about the \nbasic structure of Government that was established over 200 years ago, \nand we ought to proceed with caution. To help eliminate waste in \nGovernment, it is worth trying a line-item veto. But we should not \nsupport proposals that are vulnerable to abuse, that fail to adequately \nprotect the public interest and our constituents or that provide for \nspecial interest tax loopholes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in light of the remarks of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, I think it is very interesting that in the chair we \nhave a former Governor of a State and the author of the amendment that \nis under consideration. The Senator from South Carolina is also a \nformer Governor. Both of them are strongly in support of the line-item \nveto. Both of them may have differing opinions on many issues because \nthey are of different party affiliation, but both of them have had the \nunique experience of being responsible for governing a State and having \nto balance the budget of that State.\n  The Senator from South Carolina just related how he took his State \nfrom a situation of near fiscal crisis to one of fiscal solvency. He \nstates that with the line-item veto--and I am not trying to parrot the \nwords of the Senator from South Carolina, who is far more eloquent than \nI--he was able to govern \n[[Page S4317]]  his State effectively with that very valuable tool.\n  The Senator from Missouri, a former Governor of his State, who has \nspoken on the floor here on several occasions--both have talked and \ntalked about the absolute criticality of the ability to exercise a \nline-item veto; not only exercise it, but having that tool in shaping \nthe budget of their States.\n  You know, it is interesting, I do not detect in either one of these \nindividuals and other former Governors who are Members of this body \nthis desire to twist arms, threaten, blackmail--and ``extortion'' I \nhave heard used a couple of times--and I cannot believe that the \nAmerican people would sit by and watch a President of the United States \npractice extortion or blackmail on Members of the Senate or Members of \nCongress.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator believe that the only ones who know \nhow to manage an enterprise are Governors? Or does the Senator believe \nthat business experience is of value as well, business experience that \ndeveloped an entire industry known as the computing industry, which I \nmodestly had a hand in and am a member of the Hall of Fame of \nInformation and Processing. I ran a terrific company with an excellent \nrecord, one of the best in the country. I assume the Senator would \nyield to the fact that someone who has other experience besides \nGovernors can make a contribution; is that not so?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest, I say to my friend from New Jersey, not only \nis it a very important and valuable credential to address any issue--\nespecially where the free enterprise system is concerned--I, along with \nmy colleagues, share admiration for the enormous contributions the \nSenator from New Jersey made to the primary generator of business and \nemployment and commerce not only nationally but throughout the world.\n  But I do suggest there is some difference in that, as Governors of \nStates, they were required--and I might say a fairly significant size--\nto administer those States. In fact, they had oversight of the \nbusinesses that resided in their States, in a regulatory and other \nfashion, working in partnership with the legislature.\n  I suggest that, as the head of a very successful corporation, the \nSenator from New Jersey had more than a line-item veto. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey had a total veto, and there was no chance of his being \noverridden, except by his board of directors or his stockholders. I \nview this situation--and I am sure, knowing how gentle the Senator from \nNew Jersey is, from time to time he had to exercise that veto; \notherwise, he would not have achieved the pinnacle of success that he \nreached.\n  So I do think there is a certain comparability, and I believe that, \nif there were outrageous expenditures in his company and corporation \nand if the Senator from New Jersey, then a president and CEO, felt \nhelpless to bring into check those extravagances, I think it would have \nharmed his ability to achieve the enormous and very laudable degree of \nsuccess that he achieved.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his question. I \nalso would like to again state that it is of interest that in 43 States \nin America out of 50, those Governors do exercise the line-item veto.\n  Again, in response to a very legitimate question from the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, when there is a military issue, I try to get the \nopinion of people who are military experts. When there is an issue of \naviation, I try to go to those experts. I try to consult with--due to \nmy narrow experience and knowledge and background--those people who are \nexperts and have had experience in areas where, frankly, I am not as \nwell informed as others. And so it seems to me that it would be logical \nto consult the Senator from South Carolina, who was judged by many as \nthe most successful Governor in the history of that State. He literally \nbrought it into the 20th century in more ways than one. And there is \nthe Senator from Missouri, who presently occupies the chair, as well as \nmany other Senators who were Governors. Another example is the present \nGovernor of California, who was a Member of this body before he became \nGovernor, who has stated unequivocally, as Governor of the State of \nCalifornia, that without the capacity to exercise the line-item veto, \nhe would have enormous and indeed insurmountable difficulties.\n  So I have to rely on the judgment and experience of Members of this \nbody and people who are not Members of this body that have actually had \nthe experience of governing. And governing, I think, is a unique \nchallenge and experience. I am very pleased to have the input and the \nbenefit and knowledge and experience of the Senator from South \nCarolina, as well as the Senator from Missouri, as well as many other \nSenators.\n  I read a few days ago, Mr. President, a survey done by the Cato \nInstitute, where approximately 88 percent of the former Governors--it \nwas a very large number of former Governors, of both the Democratic \nParty and Republican Party--when asked, stated that the line-item veto \nwas a ``very useful tool.'' Those are the people whose judgment I think \nwe not necessarily rely on, but certainly the benefit of their \nexperience cannot be ignored.\n  I would like to address the issue of the Hollings amendment. \nObviously, what the Senator from South Carolina is trying to achieve \nhere is laudable. I just find, however, that it is not germane. This \nbill is about process reform; it is about separate enrollment--a \nconcept long advocated by the Senator from South Carolina. \nAdditionally, the chairman of the Budget Committee announced that he is \ngoing to have a hearing on this amendment in the Budget Committee. We \nhave announced that we are prepared to accept the Exon amendment which \naffects this bill. The Hollings amendment raises many valid issues, but \nI believe it would be better offered on more appropriate legislation. I \nnote that the Hollings amendment was defeated in the Budget Committee \nby a 12-to-10 vote. So the Budget Committee has spoken on this issue,\n which, by the way, by no means precludes the Senator from South \nCarolina from bringing this to the floor, as we all know. But I would, \nat the proper time, make a motion to table the Hollings amendment. I \nbelieve that the time for a vote will be established very soon.\n\n  Mr. President, I paid attention to the remarks of the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from New Jersey. Their concerns have been \nraised many times in the past and they will be raised again before we \nfinally enact this bill, which I now am feeling some optimism about, \nalthough we have a number of wickets to go through before we reach that \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, in all due respect to my colleagues, I do believe that \nit is an argument for pretty much the status quo. I do not think that \nthe American people are satisfied with the status quo. I do not believe \nthey are satisfied with a debt that will accumulate to $5.2 trillion. I \ndo not believe they will be satisfied with $200 billion-plus annual \ndeficits.\n  Mr. President, I do believe that it is important again to restate, as \nI have over and over and over again, that from 1801 when Thomas \nJefferson--which is becoming a famous anecdote, probably far more \nfamous than Thomas Jefferson ever envisioned--in 1801, when Thomas \nJefferson impounded the $50,000 that Congress appropriated to purchase \ngunboats, that a practice for the next 174 years was continued by Chief \nExecutives of this country and that was impounding funds that they did \nnot wish to spend.\n  Now we all know our history, and that is, in 1974, with a weakened \nPresident, who had, in the view of many, and probably accurately, \nabused the impoundment powers by impounding enormous sums of money for \nentire programs that had been authorized and appropriated by the \nCongress, the Congress repealed the Budget Impoundment Act. And we know \nwhat has happened since.\n  I have quoted for the record before rescissions that come over from \nthe President of the United States. They are either ignored or other \nrescissions are substituted for them so that basically the Chief \nExecutive, the President of the United States, is at the mercy of the \nwhim or the desires, which is more accurate, the desires of the \nCongress as related to a rescission. \n[[Page S4318]]  And more and more often since 1974, rescission requests \non the part of Presidents of the United States, both Republican and \nDemocrat, have been ignored by the legislative branch.\n  So when my colleagues argue, as the Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from New Jersey did, that this is an enormous shift of power, I \nwill agree that it is a shift of power. I also argue that it is a much \nneeded shift of power, but it is not new. It is not new. It is a \nrestoration of, basically, the powers that the Executive had from 1801 \nto 1974.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also know, Mr. President, that almost everything that \nwe and the executive branch do is under the scrutiny of the media. The \nmedia pay attention and report on almost everything we do. In fact, \nthere is a cottage industry now, as we all know, that describe private \nconversations that the President had with another individual, that \ndescribe the innermost counsels, both in the executive branch, the \nPresident of the United States and the White House, and in the Congress \nof the United States.\n  If it became known to the people of the United States that the \nPresident of the United States was calling the Senator from South \nCarolina over and said, ``I want you to support my effort to provide \nhousing for Russian officers or I am going to kill a project in South \nCarolina,'' it would be over. In a New York minute, it would be over. \nBecause the Senator from South Carolina or the Senator from Arizona or \nthe Senator from Ohio would walk out to that group of microphones and \ncameras in front of the White House and say, ``I have just been \nblackmailed by the President of the United States.''\n  And if there is one thing that I think would reassure my reelection, \nif I sought reelection, it would be to go out and tell the people of \nArizona that I stood up to a threat of blackmail by the President of \nthe United States.\n  So, yes, I admired in many ways the persuasive powers of President \nLyndon Johnson, which was referred to in the remarks by the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. I admire the persuasive powers of President Reagan. \nBut I do not believe that any President of the United States is going \nto engage in political blackmail.\n  And in these 43 out of 50 States where Governors have line-item \nvetoes, I have yet to hear of a single instance where a Governor--\nalthough it may have happened on a rare occasion or two, I just have \nnot heard of it, nor have I ever read or heard it reported--has \nexercised this kind of extortion or blackmail, as it is described.\n  Now, I saw a little item today that ever child born in America now \nhas a $13,000 debt. I am not sure how that is computed, Mr. President. \nI would be interested in knowing how you figure that out.\n  But I do know this: That with a $5.2 trillion debt, which is the \nestimate of what this Nation will carry next year, I believe that every \nchild in America is now inflicted with a huge debt burden that they are \ngoing to have to pay off sooner or later.\n  We could, Mr. President, turn down the line-item veto. We could \ncontinue these unending debts and annual deficits, I think, for some \nyears. But there is going to come a time where the bill is going to \nbecome due.\n  Some experts attribute the fall of the dollar to the failure of the \nbalanced budget amendment. I do not know if that is the case or not. I \ndo not claim to have that kind of expertise.\n  But if I were a foreign investor and I was looking around the world \nwhere to invest my money and I saw a country that is growing more and \nmore dependent upon foreign investment in order to have the Treasury \nbills, which are floated quite frequently, in order to secure funds \nbecause of the annual deficit we are running, I think I would be less \nthan confident not only in the economy of this country but I would lose \nsome confidence in the validity of its currency.\n  Now maybe that is too dire a picture. Maybe the strong American \neconomy and the overall strength and economic strength of this country \nwould override that. But I cannot believe, at the end of the day, that \nit is attractive to invest or hold the currency of a country that \nforever, forever, which is the case now, is going to be running annual \ndeficits and accumulating an ever larger and larger debt.\n  And I want to add, again, Mr. President, the line-item veto does not \nbalance the budget. We all admit to that. But I do not see a balanced \nbudget without the line-item veto. I think that is the important part \nof this discourse.\n  I have displayed a chart here on several occasions that shows that in \n1974, when the President of the United States lost the impoundment \npower, revenues and expenditures began to diverge and they have \ncontinued almost unendingly to diverge for a very long period of time, \nfor the last 21 years, with no end in sight.\n  I will say that we have had a short period--and I think it is due to \nthe leadership of the President of the United States and efforts that \nwere made--where we have had a temporary reduction in the annual \ndeficit. That is the good news. The bad news is there is no place that \nanyone envisions where that deficit is zero or that we even begin to \npay off the debt we have accumulated.\n  Mr. President, sooner or later, we are going to have to do that. We \nare now paying nearly as much on interest on the national debt as we \nare on national defense. People born a generation ago would find that \nan incredible and bizarre situation.\n  I see the Senator from South Carolina on his feet, Mr. President. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona, and \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerrey of Nebraska be added as a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask the sincere reconsideration by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona on his motion to table our \namendment.\n  What happened, Mr. President, is that we brought it up dutifully \nbefore the Budget Committee. It was not approved, as has been pointed \nout. But, having done that, now is the time.\n  If we do not do this now, which is relevant to the budget resolution, \nif we do not do it now, then what we really are going to do is avoid \ntruth in budgeting because the next time we really sit down to consider \nthe budget, we will be considering it under the old rules.\n  So it is very appropriate and, incidentally, more so than perhaps the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona said, ``Wait a minute, now; he \nhad his vote and he lost.'' He did not refer to the other vote I lost, \nnamely, the line-item veto. The present bill under consideration is the \nsubstitute measure.\n  On the rationale of my distinguished colleague, we ought to table the \nwhole bloomin' line-item veto.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Another testimony to the incredible clairvoyance of the \nSenator from South Carolina. I thank him.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I hope he will stick with me on the line-item veto and \nnot table it under that same logic.\n  Now, with respect to germaneness, I happen to have a record that was \ngenerally respected as the presiding officer at the State level, and \nhaving come to the U.S. Senate, I spent my 28 going on 29 years trying \nto forget parliamentary procedure.\n  I will never forget when I first presided and I got two Golden Gavel \nAwards--200 hours. We used to start the Presiding Officer about 5 \no'clock in the afternoon. The distinguished Senator from Oregon, Wayne \nMorse, would get up and characterize the President of the United \nStates, who had just been lauded with respect for his muscle power in \ngetting things done, President Lyndon Johnson. He would refer to him as \na murderer, and that would go on from about 5 o'clock until about 9:30 \nor 10 o'clock each evening, with respect to the war in Vietnam.\n  But I immediately recognized someone who first rose to be recognized. \nThat is the fundamental parliamentary rule in all bodies in the world, \nsave this one. Here you recognize the majority leader. You could have \nbeen out here for 3 hours or 2 days, whatever it is, sitting in your \nseat, and stand to be \n[[Page S4319]]  recognized, but the majority leader at that particular \ntime comes to the door, forget about you. Under the rules of the \nSenate, you recognize him.\n  In that light, I had the duty of trying to forget rules, but I never \nforgot the one of germaneness. I refer specifically here to the short \ntitle ``The Separate Enrollment and Line-item Veto Act of 1995,'' which \nI hope to amend.\n  Under the section 5 subsection (a) I refer, the term ``targeted tax \nbenefit'' means any provision estimated by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation as losing revenue within the period specified in the most \nrecently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget pursuant to \nsection 301 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n1974.\n  Now, that is amending section 301 of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act 1974 and specifically the title with respect to \nwithin the periods specified.\n  So, it is a limited one with respect to the overall subject--namely, \na line-item veto for the President--but with respect to the general \nsubject of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, it is \ndefinitely germane. With respect to ``within the period specified in \nthe most recently adopted concurrent resolution'', that is what my \namendment is amending so that budgets hereafter will be subject to that \n10-year rule.\n  So on both points, I will ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nto reconsider and rejoin his Republican leadership of approximately a \nyear ago.\n  I again read from the document ``Fiscal Year 1995 Senate Budget \nCommittee Republican Alternative'', prepared by the Republican staff of \nthe U.S. Senate Budget Committee and presented last year by none other \nthan the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico.\n  If we turn to the second-to-last page, it has ``Miscellaneous \nprovisions.'' Fiscal year 1995 Republican budget resolution, \n``miscellaneous provisions,'' description and the first bullet there, \n``Strengthens the 10-year pay-as-you-go point of order while the 10-\nyear pay-as-you-go point of order that was established by last year's \nbudget resolution is determined does not currently apply to budget \nresolutions and could be repealed by a subsequent budget resolution. \nThis proposal would make future budget resolutions subject to this \npoint of order.''\n  They talk about partisanship. I am delighted to get bipartisan here \ntoday on not only the line-item veto, which I have been trying for 10 \nyears. It was a bipartisan initiative back in 1985, and was rightly \nquoted as such by the distinguished majority leader said earlier this \nweek. He referred to the Hollings-Mattingly line-item veto, that we had \na pretty good healthy vote on in 1985.\n  Mr. President, let me also ask that the distinguished ranking member \nof our Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Exon, also be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with him being a cosponsor, I go back to \nthat vote.\n  We had the line-item veto up in the Budget Committee. My particular \nintroduction of the line-item veto already in this session is now \nresting in the Rules Committee. I have had it before in the Budget \nCommittee. In fact, I had a successful vote in 1990 of the line-item \nveto out of the Budget Committee by a vote of 13 to 6.\n  Now, I want to one more time elaborate so it is clearly understood \nwhat is happening here with respect not only to the line-item veto and \nreferring to future generations as the Senator from Arizona just \npreviously did, but what we have done in order to try and secure the \nSocial Security of future generations.\n  Along this line, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted at this point a very short title of ``Off-Budget Status of \nOASDI Trust Funds,'' section 13301(b). I want to print this in the \nRecord at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any\n      other surplus or deficit totals required by this \n     title.''.\\1831\\\n\n\n                                footnote\n\n       \\1831\\The statement of managers accompanying the conference \n     report on the Budget Enforcement Act explains generally the \n     amendments made by subtitle C:\n\n\n                    vi. treatment of social security\n\n     Current law\n       Under current law, the Social Security trust funds are off-\n     budget but are included in deficit estimates and calculations \n     made for purposes of the sequestration process. However, \n     Social Security benefit payments are exempt from any \n     sequestration order.\n       Section 310(g) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     prohibits the consideration of reconciliation legislation \n     ``that contains recommendations'' with respect to Social \n     Security. (A motion to waive this point of order requires 60 \n     votes in the Senate and a simple majority in the House.)\n     House bill\n       The House bill reaffirms the off-budget status of Social \n     Security and removes the trust funds--excluding interest \n     receipts--from the deficit estimates and calculations made in \n     the sequestration process. The House bill retains the current \n     law exemption of Social Security benefit payments from any \n     sequestration order.\n       The House bill creates a ``fire wall'' point of order (as \n     free-standing legislation) to prohibit the consideration of \n     legislation that would change the actuarial balance of the \n     Social Security trust funds over a 5-year or 75-year period. \n     In the case of legislation decreasing Social Security \n     revenues, the prohibition would not apply if the legislation \n     also included an equivalent increase in Medicare taxes for \n     the period covered by the legislation.\n     Senate amendment\n       The Senate amendment also reaffirms the off-budget status \n     of Social Security and removes the trust funds from the \n     deficit estimates and calculations made in the sequestration \n     process. However, unlike the House bill, the Senate amendment \n     removes the gross trust fund transactions--including interest \n     receipts--from the sequestration deficit calculations. The \n     Senate amendment also retains the current law exemption of \n     Social Security benefit payments from any sequestration \n     order.\n       The Senate amendment also creates a procedural fire wall to \n     protect Social Security financing, but does so by expanding \n     certain budget enforcement provisions of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974. The Senate amendment expands the \n     prohibition in Section 310(g) of the Budget Act to\n      specifically protect Social Security financing, prohibits \n     the consideration of a reported budget resolution calling \n     for a reduction in Social Security surplus, and includes \n     Social Security in the enforcement procedures under \n     Sections 302 and 311 of the Budget Act. The Senate \n     amendment also requires the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to provide an actuarial analysis of any \n     legislation affecting Social Security, and generally \n     prohibits the consideration of legislation lacking such an \n     analysis.\n       For more on the budgetary treatment of Social Security \n     under current law and historically, see Senate Comm. on the \n     Budget, Social Security Preservation Act, S.

Res. \n     Serv. rep. no. 93-23 EPW).\n       Some have argued that section 13301 conflicts with the \n     listing of discretionary accounts set forth in the joint \n     statement of managers accompanying the conference report on \n     the Budget Enforcement Act. See supra p. 466. In a letter to \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the \n     Chairman of the Budget Committee argued that the \n     congressional intent is plain:\n       ``I am writing to express my concern regarding a possible \n     interpretation of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 with \n     respect to the budgetary treatment of Social Security. I \n     understand that your Office is considering whether the \n     administrative expenses of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund shall be counted in the deficit and as part of the \n     domestic discretionary caps for purposes of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings). I wish to express in the strongest terms my \n     view that these administrative expenses should not be \n     included in either the deficit or the domestic discretionary \n     cap for purposes of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n       ``Section 13301(a) of the Budget Enforcement Act states:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``The all-inclusive breadth of this language could not be \n     more clear. The subsection heading speaks of `exclusion . . . \n     from all budgets.' The operative language is unambiguous: \n     `the receipts and disbursements . . . shall not be counted.' \n     Paragraph (3) specifically mentions the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \n     law as one of the purposes for which Social Security must be \n     excluded.\n       ``The joint statement of managers accompanying the \n     conference report\n      on the legislation that includes the Budget Enforcement Act \n     similarly makes clear the intent of section 13301:\n       ```The conference agreement incorporates the Senate \n     position on the budgetary treatment of the Social Security \n     trust funds, reaffirming their off-budget status and removing \n     all their transactions from the deficit estimates and \n     calculations made in the sequestration process.'\n\n     H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1161 \n     (1990)[,reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2017, 2865-66] \n     (emphasis added).\n       ``I understand that it may be argued that statement of \n     managers language specifically includes references to the \n     Social Security trust funds as two account items in a 39-page \n     listing of accounts incorporated by reference in the \n     definition of the term `category' for purposes of the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings law. It would strain credulity to argue that \n     this reference overcomes the plain language of section \n     13301(a). Although I conceded that some conflict between \n     these two provisions may exist, that conflict must be \n     resolved in favor of implementing the intent of Congress as \n     evident in section 13301(a).\n       ``The legislative intent to remove Social Security \n     completely from all budgets is clear. The language of section \n     13301 indicates that it must apply `[n]otwithstanding any \n     other provisions of law.' The Senate debated the removal of \n     Social Security at length. The Senate voted 98-2 in favor of \n     the amendment--sponsored by Senators Hollings, Heinz, and \n     Moynihan, among others--that specifically took Social \n     Security out of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings process. (See 136 \n     Cong. Rec. 15,777-81 (Oct. 18, 1990).) Congressional \n     examination of the 39-page listing in the statement of \n     managers is nowhere evident in the debates.\n       ``I urge you to follow section 13301(a) of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act and remove the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds \n     from the budget in their entirety. I recommend that the \n     President use his authority under section 251(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law to recognize any adjustments to the \n     discretionary spending limits that such a position would \n     require as a change in a concept or definition. I believe \n     that this is the approach needed to ensure that all of Social \n     Security is taken off budget.''\n     Letter from Sen. Jim Sesser to Richard G. Darman (Jan. 4, \n     1991).\n       The acting general counsel of the Office of Management and \n     Budget replied to Chairman Sasser as follows:\n       ``You expressed the view that the administrative costs of \n     the social security\n      program should be excluded from the domestic discretionary \n     spending category.\n       We recognize that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     (OBRA) contains a provision generally excluding the social \n     security trust funds from the budget as well as the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings Act. Social security was previously excluded \n     from the budget, but not from the deficit calculations under \n     the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act (GRH).\n       However, other provisions of OBRA specifically address \n     whether social security administrative expenses are included \n     in the domestic discretionary spending category. The portion \n     of the social security trust funds that are annually \n     appropriated as administrative expenses are specifically \n     identified in the list of domestic discretionary programs \n     that is part of the Joint Statement of Managers Accompanying \n     the Conference Report on OBRA. OBRA expressly provides that \n     discretionary appropriations in each of the three categories \n     ``shall be those so designated in the joint statement of \n     managers.'' Section 250(c)(4)(A) of GRH, as amended by OBRA. \n     Because of this express designation of social security \n     administrative expenses in the list of accounts that are \n     required to be included in the domestic discretionary \n     category identified in the law, we have concluded that the \n     expenses must be so included.\n       While the OBRA provision excluding Social Security (section \n     13301(1)) applies as a general matter, it does not directly \n     conflict with the specific OBRA provisions directing the \n     treatment of one element of social security only for certain \n     purposes. For example, Section 13303 of OBRA specifically \n     requires that the congressional budget include social \n     security revenue and outlays for purposes of enforcement of \n     the Senate social security firewall points of order. This \n     specific provision should not be disregarded simply because \n     the general social security exclusion provision states that \n     social security outlays and receipts ``shall not be counted'' \n     for purposes of ``the congressional budget.'' Section 13301 \n     (a). The name is true of the specific provision on \n     administrative expenses. Indeed, even if there were a direct \n     conflict between the general and specific provisions, the \n     result would be the same. It is a basic principle of \n     statutory construction that ``Where there is inescapable \n     conflict between general and specific terms or provisions of \n     a statute, the specific will prevail.'' 2A Sutherland, \n     Statutory Construction Sec. 46.05 at p. 92 (4th Ed.).\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) included social \n     security administrative expenses within the domestic \n     discretionary category in its Final Sequestration Report for \n     Fiscal Year 1991, issued on November 6, 1990. OMB did the \n     same in its Final OMB Sequester Report To The President and \n     Congress for Fiscal Year 1991, issued on November 9, 1990. \n     The Comptroller General of the United States, in his \n     statutorily required report on the extent to which the CBO \n     and OMB reports complied with law, issued December 10, 1990, \n     did not state that OMB or CBO failed to comply with OBRA or \n     committed any error by including social security \n     administrative expenses in the domestic discretionary \n     category. General Accounting Office, The Budget for Fiscal \n     Year 1991--Compliance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985'' B-221498 (December 10, 1990).\n       In view of the specific direction on the subject contained \n     in OBRA, OMB will continue to classify social security \n     program administrative expenses as within the domestic \n     discretionary spending category.''\n     Letter from Robert G. Damus to Sen. Jim Sasser (Jan. 24, \n     1991).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair.\n  I will read the opening paragraph (b) here entitled ``Exclusion of \nSocial Security From Congressional Budget.'' Let me repeat that: The \nlaw, the law itself, three readings in the House, three readings in the \nSenate, signed into law on November 5, 1990, by President George \nHerbert Walker Bush.\n   [[Page S4321]] It passed in the Senate, incidentally, by a vote of \n98 to 2. And they talk about flip-floppers. Here is the law:\n\n       Exclusion of Social Security from congressional budget. \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding the \n     following: ``The concurrent resolution shall not include the \n     outlay and revenue totals of the Old Age and Survivors \n     Disability Insurance established under title XXII of the \n     Social Security Act and related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code.''\n\n  In other words, not include as part of outlays and revenues.\n  Along comes the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, voted \non in this body just a few weeks ago, and section 7 says:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts and shall include \n     all outlays of the United States Government.\n\n  A positive, affirmative repeal of section 13301.\n  Now you go right to how this comes out in the press. In Time \nmagazine, in a summary at the conclusion of a cover article--a March 20 \ncopy, it said:\n\n       So long as the crisis is not about to burst next month, \n     Democrats will see political profits in portraying any \n     proposal to change Social Security as a Republican conspiracy \n     to starve the poor and elderly. Republicans will think the \n     only defense is to swear eternal fealty to the system as it \n     is.\n\n  They treat it as demagoguery. They treat it as just a political \nthing. Here is the cover article; never once do they cite section \n13301. They never once cite the law.\n  When we passed those Social Security taxes back in 1983, it was \ndefinitely understood that we were not just balancing the Social \nSecurity budget, but the affirmative intent was to provide surpluses to \nmake the Social Security fund fiscally sound into the middle of the \nnext century.\n  At a previous time, I inserted a letter from former Chairman Ball of \nthe Social Security Commission. His letter said the Social Security \nfund is not in any fiscal trouble, it has surpluses, as it appears by \nthe fund. But as it appears by the political treatment by the news \nmedia and by Members of this particular body and by President Clinton \nand the administration, it is a political slush fund.\n  I quote the distinguished majority whip, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, on ``Face the Nation,'' Senator Trent Lott said on \nFebruary 5:\n\n       Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget.\n\n  Do I have to invite him into the Republican caucuses so that he can \nunderstand what they are thinking because those thinkings are finally \noozing out into the Record.\n  On ``Larry King Live'' around that time, Senator Gramm said, and I \nquote:\n\n       I think we ought to balance the budget counting Social \n     Security first, and then if we want to balance it without \n     counting it, do it second.\n\n  So they are thinking about using it either first or second, according \nto the Senator from Texas.\n  I quote again the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici:\n\n       You can't leave the biggest American program off budget.\n\n  It is off budget. The law says it is off budget. Here is the leader \nof fiscal responsibility in the U.S. Senate in contradiction to the law \nsaying you cannot leave it off budget when the law requires it be off \nbudget.\n  And then, of course, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley:\n\n       The leadership of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate have promised not to touch the Social Security \n     retirement program for at least 5 years.\n\n  Well, 5 years; that means maybe after that then, but they are \nthinking about Social Security.\n  Or the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, and I quote:\n\n       Without access to the Social Security surpluses, you would \n     create a much higher hurdle in trying to balance the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about hurdles, we are talking about \ntruth in budgeting. I remember the saying of Mark Twain. He said that \ntruth was such a precious thing it should be used very sparingly.\n  Is that the credo that we are going to use in the for budget laws in \nthe U.S. Senate?\n  Or the distinguished majority leader on February 5, Senator Dole:\n\n       I also believe that we can't keep Social Security off the \n     table forever.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, they are thinking about it. And, in fact, \nyesterday, Tuesday, March 21, reported on page A4 of the Washington \nPost, Senator Packwood, the chairman of the Finance Committee said:\n\n       ``But in considering budgets,'' nothing is sacred, \n     including Social Security and other entitlement programs.''\n\n  How do you do it? You can do as the Speaker of the House says: If we \ncannot get what we want out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we will \ngive it to Treasury, we will give it to Federal Reserve, we will give \nit to somebody to get it right.\n  One entity they are going to give it to get it right may be the new \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office. I do not have the exact \nquote here, but I know it is accurate. She said she could be using \ndynamic scoring when she has to. Ah, now you get in a CBO Director who \nuses dynamic scoring. Added to that, instead of a CPI of, let us say of \n4 percent, you get one of 2 percent. But what we should understand, Mr. \nPresident, is that any savings in Social Security from changing the CPI \nshould be put back into the reserves, back into the trust fund.\n  People say it is going to be difficult to really meet the target of \nreducing spending $1.2 trillion by the year 2002. But that, in and of \nitself, is an inaccurate figure because they are using Social Security \nmoneys. To really balance the budget you need $1.7 trillion; saying \notherwise means that you are contemplating using the surpluses that the \ntrust funds will take in over the next 7 years.\n  But let me get back to my amendment. You can well see that we are \ntrying to get back to truth in budgeting under this particular \nHollings-Kerrey-Exon amendment. It was endorsed last year by the \nRepublican Members of the Budget Committee under the leadership of our \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, when \nthey included that in their Republican alternative.\n  Now, it all of a sudden becomes untimely this year? I do not know \nwhat committees the distinguished Senator from Indiana is on, but you \ncan bet your boots whatever committee, it has a 10-year rule. If you \nare on Agriculture, if you are on Interior, if you are on Banking, if \nyou are on Commerce, if you are on Indian Affairs, wherever it is. The \nFinance Committee faced up to it with the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade; we had a 10-year rule that created a 60-vote point of order \nrequirement on that vote.\n  But for the budget resolution, you do not have to live under the \nrestrictions of the 10-year rule. I am trying to get truth in \nbudgeting. I am trying to get the very custodians of fiscal \nresponsibility here to come under the same rules. The very first bill \nthat we passed here in January was to make Congress comply with the \nlaws that everybody else has to follow.\n  It was a very good initiative. Well, why not follow the same logic? \nThe 10-year rule promotes fiscal responsibility. It promotes truth in \nbudgeting. Nevertheless, it was voted down in the Budget Committee on a \npartisan vote of 12 to 10 and Members come to the floor now to say, \n``Let's just go along with the Budget Committee.''\n  Well, Mr. President, if we are going by that logic I should point out \nanother amendment that I offered in the Budget Committee. In addition \nto the 10-year rule I offered a separate enrollment line-item veto, the \nvery kind of measure now under consideration, but only got 4 votes, all \nfrom Democrats, in the Budget Committee. Under that logic, we would not \nbe voting on the underlying bill.\n  Let us not table. Let us adopt this amendment. Let us send it to the \nHouse and to the President for his signature. The President of the \nUnited States favors the line-item veto. I am sure that if he were \nasked whether he favors truth in budgeting, his answer would be \n``yes.'' Then let us give it to him.\n  If you want to really get it done, let us not think and hide behind \nprocedure and process. Let us get the truth in budgeting and make sure \nthat the 10-year rule applies to the budget resolution as it applies to \nall other legislation.\n  [[Page S4322]] I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to say just a few words about \nmy good friend and colleague Senator Exon's announcement on Friday that \nhe would be retiring from the Senate.\n  As soon as Senator Exon announced his decision, the political pundits \nwere predicting who would run in his place, and which party stands to \nwin or lose the most. There will be plenty of time to survey the \npolitical fallout. Instead, today we should lament the loss of a \ndedicated public servant and the factors that led to his decision. Let \nme underscore the facts that led to his decision.\n  I believe the entire institution of the Senate loses when a devoted \npublic servant like Senator Exon chooses to leave. But more \nimportantly, his reasons for leaving signify an even greater loss than \nhis singular contributions.\n  Citing the ``ever-increasing vicious polarization of the \nelectorate,'' Senator Exon said the ``us-against-them mentality has all \nbut swept aside the former preponderance of reasonable discussions of \nthe pros and cons of the many legitimate issues,'' eroding the \n``essence of democracy'' in the process.\n  Refusing to answer the bell for another race, Senator Exon sent out a \nwarning to the citizens of this country that the democratic process has \nbecome seriously flawed--that using the ``hate level'' in attack ads as \nthe ``measurement of a successful campaign,'' can only mean the \ndeterioration of the notion of compromise ``for the ultimate good of \nall.''\n  It was a price the statesman in him was no longer willing to pay.\n  And there can be no doubt that he leaves here a statesman. President \nEisenhower once said that ``The opportunist thinks of me and today. The \nstatesman thinks of us and tomorrow.''\n  I know Senator Exon came to the Senate looking only to do what was in \nthe best interests of his State and country. He knew that his decisions \nhad to pass the test of time, not simply grab attention on the evening \nnews. He spent each day meeting that test, knowing, as he said last \nweek, that he ``never reached a decision that (he) didn't believe to be \nin the best interests of Nebraska and the United States of America.''\n  So perhaps the pundits will put aside their political score cards for \na moment, and will consider that in his decision to leave, Senator Exon \nthe statesman was again thinking of ``us and tomorrow.''\n  I certainly hope so, because his intellect, legislative skills, and \ncommitment to service will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4322-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the \njunior Senator from Wisconsin. I am unhappy that I have to do so \nbecause I have the greatest respect for Senator Feingold and for his \ndedication to deficit reduction. And though I agree with 99 percent of \nthe substance of this sense-of-the-Senate, I cannot agree with the \nfinal statement that ``enacting a * * * so-called middle-class tax cut \nduring the 104th Congress would hinder efforts to reduce the Federal \ndeficit.''\n  I would like to state for the Record that I do believe that deficit \nreduction is this Congress highest priority. If proposals for tax \nbreaks--such as the $200 billion in tax breaks moving through the \nHouse--get in the way of further progress in reducing the deficit, I \nwill oppose them. However, I believe it is possible to both make the \nTax Code fairer to low- and middle-income working families and \nsignificantly reduce the deficit.\n  For example, Congress could engage in wholesale tax reform, lowering \nrates for middle and lower income taxpayers while eliminating wasteful \ntax loopholes that benefit the rich. Such reform could be designed to \nreduce the deficit and make the Tax Code more equitable. I do not think \nthe Senate should go on record right now with a sense-of-the-Senate \nthat implies such reform is out of the question.\n  Though this Congress has discussed in great detail the problems with \nour Federal budget, we have yet to start the debate on the fiscal year \n1996 budget plan. At this early point in the debate, I do not believe \nit wise to start ruling out options--such as providing some tax relief \nto working families. Therefore, I will reluctantly oppose the pending \nsense-of-the-Senate.\n                           amendment no. 403\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague from New Jersey. If adopted, the Bradley \namendment will allow the President to eliminate tax loopholes that \nbenefit special interests at the expense of the American people. And \nwhile the tax expenditure language in the Dole substitute is a good \nfirst step in the right direction, the amendment offered by Senator \nBradley offers definitive protection against future wasteful tax \nspending.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to creative spending, the Federal \nGovernment is second to none. And one of the most creative ways that \nWashington spends money is through special breaks and hidden \nexpenditures in the Tax Code. The Tax Code contains loopholes large and \nsmall that benefit every type of special interest, including, among \nothers, an exclusion of income for rentals of 2 weeks or less and \ndeferrals of income of foreign-controlled corporations.\n  Mr. President, there is not enough time this morning to go through \nthe entire list of loopholes that permeates our tax laws, but you may \nbe assured that there is a credit, break, or writeoff for every \nconceivable purpose. There may have been a time when our country could \nafford these expenditures, but that time is over. Today, we have the \nopportunity to begin the process of eliminating this hidden spending if \nwe adopt the clear and unambiguous language offered by my colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n  [[Page S4323]] Mr. President, we are at a critical time in our \nNation's history: We can act now to balance our Federal budget or we \ncan pass the buck to our children and leave them a legacy of debt, \ndepression, and continued economic decline. In order to regain control \nof our financial situation, we need to make tough choices, and the time \nhas arrived for the special interests to pay their dues along with the \nrest of us. Mr. President, at a time when we are asking the American \npeople to accept sacrifices in the areas of housing, school lunches, \nand education, I believe we in Congress need to subject tax spending to \nthe same level of scrutiny. So I urge my colleagues to support the \nBradley amendment and I yield the floor.\n               vote on motion to table amendment no. 403\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have debated this amendment already so I \nwill be very, very brief.

Mr. President, I wish to inquire of the distinguished \nmajority manager if he is ready to proceed with the Feingold amendment \nregarding emergency spending that I understand has been cleared on both \nsides. Is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, we are just \nabout there. I think in about 1 or 2 more minutes. I think the Senator \nfrom South Carolina was waiting to make remarks and I think we will be \nready by the time he is finished with his remarks.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \namendment. I think it helps the bill. I am glad we were able to agree \non it.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Arizona. I appreciate his \ncooperation.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the able Senators, and the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Line-Item Veto Act, which is \npresently before this body. For many years, I have been a supporter of \ngiving authority to the President to disapprove specific items of \nappropriation presented to him. On the first legislative day of this \nCongress, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 2, proposing a \nconstitutional amendment to give the President line-item veto \nauthority.\n  Presidential authority for a line-item veto is a significant fiscal \ntool which would provide a valuable means to reduce and restrain \nexcessive appropriations. This proposal will give the President the \nopportunity to approve or disapprove individual items of appropriation \nwhich have passed the Congress. It does not grant power to simply \nreduce the dollar amount legislated by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, 43 Governors currently have constitutional authority \nto reduce or eliminate items or provisions in appropriation measures. \nMy home State of South Carolina provides this authority, and I found it \nmost useful during my service as Governor in the late 1940's. Surely \nthe President should have authority that 43 Governors now have to check \nunbridled spending.\n  It is widely recognized that Federal spending is out of control. The \nFederal budget has been balanced only once in the last 34 years. Over \nthe past 20 years, Federal receipts, in current dollars, have grown \nfrom $279 billion to nearly $1.3 trillion, an increase of $978 billion. \nIn the meantime, Federal outlays have grown from $332 billion in 1975, \nto over $1.4 trillion last year, an increase of over $1.1 trillion. The \nannual budget deficits have risen to over $200 billion each year, with \nthe national debt growing to over $4.8 trillion.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that neither the Congress nor the \nPresident are effectively dealing with the budget crisis. The President \ncontinues to submit budgets which contain little spending reform and \nproject annual deficits of nearly $200 billion. I am hopeful that this \nyear Congress will undertake serious efforts to restrain Federal \nspending by reducing or eliminating funding of ineffective programs.\n  If we are to have sustained economic growth, Government spending must \nbe significantly reduced. A balanced budget amendment and line-item \nveto authority would do much to bring about fiscal responsibility. I \nregret that earlier this year the Senate failed to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. President, it would be a mistake to fail to pass this measure. It \nis my hope that this Congress will swiftly approve the line-item veto \nand send a clear message to the American people that we are making a \nserious effort to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. Finally, Mr. \nPresident, we must get on with the serious business of reducing \nspending. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska for \nyielding the time, and particularly the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana for interrupting the flow of the discussion, because there are \nmatters of great importance that are under review.\n  But I would like to talk for a minute about an incident that took \nplace in the last couple of days that has been across the newspapers in \nthis country and through all means of communication--television, radio, \nand so forth. It is about an incident in Montclair, NJ, which is where \nmy home has been since 1968. My children were brought up in this \ncommunity, all four of them, and there is still a Lautenberg house in \nthe town. The community is shocked by the turn of events--four people \nkilled, four innocent people, two who worked in the post office, long-\ntime employees, and two residents of the community, one I am told, 38 \nyears of age, and one 59 years of age, customers of the post office. \nThey were on an innocent piece of business, and suddenly carnage broke \nout. It is established that a 9 mm weapon was used, and the culprit has \nbeen captured and is now in custody. This afternoon, the U.S. attorney \nand other law enforcement people will be making a full statement.\n  Mr. President, we have seen violence all over this country ourselves, \ngun violence, people shot randomly. As a matter of fact, unless it gets \nto be in your neighborhood or your community, or you know someone who \nis the victim, it is almost greeted with a yawn. We watch the \nincredible spectacle of Colin Ferguson, the man who murdered and \nassaulted people on the Long Island Railroad, make a fool out of the \nsystem, and he is ready now perhaps this day for sentencing.\n  But I watched in shock as some of the victims' families addressed \nthis individual, trying to describe their pain and their anguish, \nincluding one person that I know, also from New Jersey, a man named \nJake LaCicero, who lost his daughter, Amy, on that train. She was in \nher late twenties, innocently traveling back and forth to work from \nwhere she then lived, and she died needlessly.\n  And not too long ago, at a post office in Richwood, NJ, a quiet, \nhigh-income community, principally commuters, people who took pride in \ntheir community and people who believed so deeply in America and the \nAmerican way--the town that I am talking about now, Montclair, NJ, is a \nfairly high-income \n[[Page S4325]]  community, a fully integrated community, with a \nminority African-American portion, about 30 percent, living side by \nside, house to house, and everybody getting along well.\n  Mr. President, last weekend, we heard about an incident--and I had \nthe occasion to visit the victim, a woman named Gilespie, 66 years old, \nwho had her car hijacked by two young men who, as she described it to \nme, is an incredibly courageous woman, fighting back against all odds, \nbecause she was shot right almost in the middle of her face just at the \neyebrow line. She had a black-and-blue mark. The bullet is still \napparently lodged in her head. She will have lost the sight of one eye, \nbut she is going to live. And she is remarkably strong.\n  I was there to visit a trauma unit at our University Hospital and \nMedical School in Newark. She said she cannot understand why she was \nshot. She said, ``I was ready to surrender my car.'' It was in the \nevening. She went to visit her daughter in the suburbs. She said, ``I \nwas ready to surrender my car. I was ready to surrender my \npocketbook.'' She said, ``I did not want to fight with these two \nfellows.'' She said not a word was exchanged. The only thing that was \nexchanged was a gunshot, a gun pointed at her head, and the trigger \npulled. And she had enough strength and enough courage to get to a \ntelephone and the police, in quick response, from Montclair, NJ, were \nable to capture two young men.\n These men, by the way, Mr. President, had no previous record of \ncriminality--young men; one was 17, one was 19. One already finished \nwith high school; the other was in high school. These were not the \ntraditional criminals. These were not the people who we talk about when \nwe say, ``Guns do not kill people; people kill people.''\n\n  Mr. President, we are hearing ruminations on this floor about \nremoving the ban that exists on assault weapons--a ban that was fought \nover day after day, hour after hour before it became essentially a part \nof the crime bill that was passed and signed last year by the President \nof the United States. We hear now that that bill is being reviewed, \nperhaps, with the purpose of removing the ban on assault weapons. It \nalmost is shocking beyond belief that we, at this point in time, could \nbe talking about removal, repeal of a ban on weapons that were designed \nto kill people, to be used by military and law enforcement people. And \nwe are discussing it because the NRA has a gun at the head of this \nCongress. The NRA has a gun at the head of this Senate. The gun reaches \ninto the pocketbook, Mr. President. That is where the power comes from. \nIt is the power of the purse used to pervert and to twist the \nintentions of the American people, and to analyze the second amendment \nin such a way that it permits every loony in the world, in the States, \nand in this country of ours to get their hands on a gun. The Brady bill \nwas fought against so hard here. I read in the paper recently, it \nstopped 45,000 applications for gun ownership from being executed. And \nwe fought tooth and nail here. It was like a battle over whether or not \nwe continue to operate as a democratic society. We fought over that, \nand--how many escaped we do not know, but 45,000 people were denied \napplications for gun ownership.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what it is going to take to stop this \ngun mad necessary. I hope it does not visit families here. Though, we \nhave had it. The Senator from North Dakota watched his wife being taken \naway by a man with a gun at her head, not far from the Capitol, where \nwe have multiple police departments. He was powerless because the man \nhad a gun and was able to blow his wife's head off. What is it going to \ntake for our society to respond and say ``no'' to the NRA, that we are \nnot going to let you own this country, we are not going to let you own \nthis Congress. We ought to turn out every Congressman and Senator who \nsupports the NRA, unless there is a change in their attitude.\n  Mr. President, it is a terrible day, terrible occasion when we have \nto reminisce about those who lost their lives. Anybody who saw the \nvictims talking to Colin Ferguson this morning, where one woman who \nlost her husband and her son was shot, to be permanently disabled, this \nyoung man weeping uncontrollably because his life had been torn apart. \nI hope that we do not have to recite in the years ahead those who are \nvictims of gunfire--random gunfire, in many cases, and botched \nburglaries.\n  Mr. President, people say that it is not guns, that it is people who \ndo the killing. But if you look at the United Kingdom, look at Japan, \ncountries westernized in their customs like ours, and you see that in \nour country 13.5 thousand people died from gunshots, and in the other \ncountries just mentioned, the numbers are less than 100. One of those \npopulations is two-thirds of ours--Japan. I believe they had less than \n100 people die by gunshot. In the United Kingdom the numbers were less \nthan 100. In Canada they were less than 50. But we here in the United \nStates, who want to protect the rights under the second amendment for \npeople to own guns, are not standing up for people to be able to live \nfreely, to walk down the street. In Los Angeles, it is said that most \nof the gunshot damage done is done by drive-by, random shootings. If \nthere are no guns around, I assure you that we would not see the \ndamage, because it is awful hard to have a drive-by clubbing or a \ndrive-by stabbing.\n  It is time that we woke up to the problem that we have here and get \nrid of this menace for the safety and well-being of our children, our \nfamilies, our homes, our stores, and our businesses, and get on with \nletting this democracy perform as it should.\n  I thank the Senators from Nebraska and Indiana for giving me these \nfew minutes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4324-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         A TRAGEDY IN MONTCLAIR\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY.

It is my \nunderstanding that the managers have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Please proceed. I was not aware that this had been cleared \nnow. I have no objection.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will reiterate that there is no objection on either \nside to this. It has to do with changing the rules for emergency \nspending bills. It is making sure that extraneous matters are not \nattached to them, as has happened in the past. I understand both sides \nhave agreed to voice vote on that.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator from Wisconsin will yield, I just say to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin that we think it is a meritorious amendment. \nIt is consistent with the goals and the intent of the line-item veto \nlegislation before us. We are happy to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 356) was agreed to.\n   [[Page S4326]] Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the \nvote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the \nmanagers and all the people that were involved in this amendment. It is \nan excellent example of bipartisan cooperation to, in effect, try to \nprevent the pork from getting over to the President in the first place. \nThe line-item veto is about getting rid of those items after the \nPresident has them on his desk. I think this will prove to be a useful \ntool in eliminating some of the things that have happened in Congress \nthat have been held up really to public ridicule. I am grateful to the \nSenators who helped move it along.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 402 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now before the Senate is \namendment No. 402.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank my friend \nand colleague from Wisconsin for an excellent amendment, well \npresented. I am very pleased that it has been accepted on the other \nside.\n  We are moving along very well now. As I understand it, from \nconversations I have just had with the Senator from Indiana, the \nmanager of the bill on the other side of the aisle, the lockbox \namendment that I presented last night has now been cleared on each \nside.\n  What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment No. 402.\n  Mr. EXON. With that, I would like to call up that amendment for a \nvote at this time. We have finished debate on the amendment. I believe \nit has been cleared on each side.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we have had trouble putting our fingers on \n402. I want to make sure amendment 402 is the lockbox amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I think we can assure the Senator that it is the Exon \nlockbox amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. I had just heard a minute ago that it was not. That is why \nI wanted to verify that.\n  We are satisfied, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 402) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Indiana, the floor \nmanager, for his help on this.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have made really good progress. Last \nnight and so far today, we have either adopted or tabled seven \namendments. The majority has inquired with regard to three amendments \non their side, and we are attempting to work those out.\n  Beyond that, I think that there are in the neighborhood of only 8 or \n10 amendments left that I know of here. So that is excellent progress.\n  I would simply take this opportunity to once again state what I \nstated this morning. And after my statement this morning, we had some \ngood cooperation. So I would simply alert all Senators to the fact that \nwe are now moving very, very aggressively and very, very quickly. I \nurge Senators who have amendments that are outstanding or, if there are \nany--hopefully, there are not--if there are any we do not know about, I \nthink this would be an excellent time for Senators to come to the floor \nand offer any amendments that any Senator on either side of the aisle \nhas on the measure before us so we can keep the momentum going and not \nget slowed down to where we sag back into situations that we have been \nin before on bills where we think we are moving and all at once we slow \ndown and seemingly never get started up again.\n  So I certainly urge any Senator, this is a very, very good time to \ncome forward with the 8 or 10 amendments that we believe are serious \namendments that are pending. This would be a good time to move on them. \nCertainly, it is not a time to go to third reading, but this is a time \nI think for everybody to understand that, with a little cooperation, we \ncan stay away from any consideration of a cloture vote. As far as I \nknow, the cloture vote has not been vitiated yet, has it?\n  Mr. COATS. It has not.\n  Mr. EXON. I am advised that the majority leader has not vitiated the \ncloture vote. That is currently scheduled, I believe, for 5 p.m. I \nbelieve we will not need that if the feeling of the majority leader is \nthat we are making sufficient progress. But that is a possibility.\n  So since it is now about 3:22, this would be a excellent time for \nsomeone to come over and offer an amendment. I would be very glad to \nhave someone show up.\n  I have been advised I was wrong on the 5 o'clock time. The 5 o'clock \ntime was to have been for 1 hour of debate and the vote was scheduled \nto be at 6 o'clock, as presently scheduled.\n  We hope somewhere along the line in the next hour or so we might have \na chance of going to the majority leader and having that vitiated. But \nI think it all depends. The first thing the majority leader is going to \nask is, ``Well, how are you coming along?'' I suspect my friend from \nIndiana would agree with that.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would agree with that. We obviously hope \nto be able to vitiate the cloture vote that is now scheduled for 6 p.m.\n  We are making excellent progress on these amendments. We hope that \nMembers will come to the floor and continue to offer amendments. Our \ngoal is to expedite the debate and consideration of this bill that is \nbefore us.\n  We have had considerable debate not only on this particular issue but \non similar issues for the past several years. I think Members have had \nan ample opportunity to express their thoughts and opinions.\n  We now actively encourage those amendments. Obviously, as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska said, the more amendments that we can consider before 6 \no'clock, perhaps the more favorable consideration the majority leader \ncan give to that vote which is ordered for 6 p.m.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum having been suggested, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nmotions on the majority leader's amendment be vitiated; that the \nfollowing be the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to \neither S. 4 or to Senator Dole's amendment; that they be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments following a failed tabling motion; \nthat all amendments on this list must be offered by 10 a.m., Thursday, \nMarch 23; that upon the disposition of these amendments, Senator Dole's \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to; that the \nbill be read a third time, and at that time there be 2 hours of debate \nunder Senator Byrd's control; and that upon the conclusion or yielding \nback of that time, the Senate vote on final passage of S. 4, as \namended, with the preceding all occurring without any intervening \naction or debate, and that no motion to recommit be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate the list which I will send to the desk: One \namendment by Senator Bingaman, two amendments by Senator Byrd, two by \nSenator Daschle, one amendment by Senator Murray, one amendment by \nSenator Exon, one amendment by Senator Glenn, one amendment by Senator \nLevin, one amendment by Senator Dole, one amendment by Senator Abraham, \none amendment by Senator Murkowski, one amendment by Senator Hatch, one \namendment by Senator D'Amato.\n  These are relevant amendments. One is a substitute, others relate to \nauthorized programs or exemptions, and one is a fencing amendment. We \ncan provide further details if any of our colleagues want details on \nthe amendments.\n  [[Page S4327]] Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend many of the \nSenators whose cooperation was important in receiving this agreement.\n  We started out with a large double-digit list and we are now down to \nvirtually a single-digit list with as many Republican as Democratic \namendments. I am very hopeful that we can work through these \namendments.\n  For the information of colleagues, I intend to offer our substitute \nthis evening, and hope we can have a good debate on that. I am sure we \ncan work through many of these, even with time agreements, but I do \nappreciate the accommodation by many Senators. I appreciated having the \nopportunity to work through this agreement with the majority leader.\n  I think this will allow Members to do what we have indicated we would \nlike to do, and that is reach final passage this week.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators, and I look forward to \nthe remaining debate on the amendments that have just been listed.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, for his cooperation. I think he is correct. I think it is in a \ncondition now where it can be passed, maybe late tomorrow night if not \nsometime early Friday.\n  I would hope following disposition, as I have not yet discussed it \nwith the Democratic leader, one thing we have to do is the self-\nemployed tax matter. Maybe we could start on that Friday. I will \ndiscuss that with the minority leader later. I asked Senator Packwood \nto check with Senator Moynihan to see if they would be available on \nFriday.\n  I would ask my colleagues if they have amendments, certainly, this \nwould be a good time to offer amendments because the Democratic leader \nhas indicated later today he will offer the substitute. I urge my \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle if they have amendments, I am \ncertain that the managers would be happy to engage them in debate. \nPerhaps we can dispose of four or five additional amendments before \nlate afternoon.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4325-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4327-S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ACCEPT- ANCE OF YELTSIN INVITATION\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday President Clinton announced his \nacceptance of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's invitation to \nparticipate in Moscow's anniversary of the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.\n  He has accepted this invitation, despite the fact that I--and many of \nmy colleagues concerned about the foreign policy implications--urged \nhim to seek another time for a summit.\n  I continue to believe that his participation in this commemoration \ndoes not further American interests in Europe and in our relationship \nwith Russia.\n  First, this commemorative event is morally ambiguous. I recognize the \nvalor and sacrifices of the Russian people in their defense against \nNazi aggression. However, it is equally important to remember that the \nSoviet leaders, through the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact laid the foundation \nnot only for World War II, but also for Soviet hegemony over Eastern \nEurope during the cold war.\n  Joseph Stalin unleashed Soviet forces against Poland in collusion \nwith the Nazis, and during the first 2 years of World War II the Soviet \nUnion provided the Nazi Reich with strategic war materials as well as \nwith political and propaganda support.\n  Moreover, the Soviet Union committed war crimes as brutal as those of \nthe Nazis.\n  One need only to recall the Soviet's massacre of thousands of Polish \nofficers at Katyn; the deportation to concentration camps and murder of \nthousands of civilians, including Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, \nTatars, Chechyns, and others. After World War II, the survivors in \nEastern Europe did not benefit from freedom and liberty, but were \nsubjected to the brutal hegemony of the Soviet Union.\n  If the President persists in going to celebrate the end of World War \nII in Europe with the Russians, I believe he should at least make some \nreference to the fact that the United States, as a whole, has not \nforgotten these, or any, crimes committed during the war.\n  The second reason why we encouraged the President not to accept this \ninvitation is because the commemoration in Moscow will reinforce the \ngrowing nostalgia among some Russians for the Soviet past and its \nimperial ambitions, not to mention the leader who epitomized all this, \nJoseph Stalin.\n  The presence of the President of the United States risks further \nlegitimizing such nostalgia, thereby encouraging Russians to \nconcentrate on reacquiring great power status at a time when Moscow \nshould be directing its efforts and energy inward, toward democratic \nand market reform.\n  Third, this invitation arrives in the midst of the war in Chechnya. \nPresident Clinton's participation in this celebration will convey \nAmerican indifference to the atrocities committed against the Chechyn \npeoples.\n  Indeed, Moscow's management of the Chechyn autonomy movement is \ndepressingly reminiscent of the policies that Stalin, himself, used to \nterrorize the peoples incorporated into the former Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support efforts to deepen American-Russian \nrelations. Indeed, this is especially important today as both nations \nadjust to the post-cold-war era. However, the symbolism associated with \nthe Moscow celebration makes it a poor forum through which to pursue \nthe type of relationship the United States must have with Russia.\n  But since President Clinton has made his decision, I hope he will \nemphasize the following themes in the course of his Moscow meetings:\n  The President should speak forthrightly to the Russian people, not \nhiding the fact that America condemns the brutal use of military force \nagainst Chechnya. Human rights is an international issue. If Russia \navows to be a member of the community of democracies founded upon \nrespect for inalienable human rights, it must live up to those \nstandards.\n  The President should make clear that America is more interested in \nthe future of Russian democracy than in the fate of a single leader. I \nhope that President Clinton will spend his time not only with \ngovernment officials and the leadership of the Russian Duma, but also \nwith Russia's leading supporters of democracy.\n  This must include members of Russia's beleaguered press and those \ndemocratically minded legislators--particularly Sergei Kovalyov, the \nformer Human Rights Commissioner who was most recently relieved of his \nduties because of his courageous criticism of the Russian Government's \nChechnyn policy.\n  In order for a true strategic partnership to evolve between the \nUnited States and Russia, Moscow must abandon hegemonic aspirations, \nparticularly those toward the non-Russian nations of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  In this regard, I applaud the President's decision to visit Ukraine. \nA Kiev summit will be an important signal of America's commitment to \nassist the consolidation of Ukraine's newly attained independence. In \nlight of Ukraine's intertwined history with Russia, the success of \nUkrainian independence and integration into the Western community of \nnations will be a critical determinant of Russia's evolution into a \npost-imperial state.\n  Finally, I hope that the President will emphasize that NATO \nenlargement will contribute to greater peace and stability in post-\ncold-war Europe.\n  By further ensuring stability in Central and Eastern Europe, NATO \nenlargement should allow Moscow to spend more of its energy on the \ninternal challenges of political and economic reform. I hope that our \nPresident will underscore the fact that Moscow cannot and will not have \nany veto over the future membership of NATO.\n  Mr. President, although I regret President Clinton's pilgrimage to \nMoscow, I believe that if these three \n[[Page S4328]] themes--human rights, democracy, and rejection of \nempire--prevail, they will help ensure that the Moscow summit is not an \nexercise in propitiation, but a realistically constructive undertaking.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4327-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4328-S4333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate so far on \nthe line-item veto, the proposal which is before the Senate, and I have \nread the compromise language offered by the majority leader. I would \nlike to commend the majority leader and those who worked with him, \nlong-time supporters of the proposal, and the sponsors. This proposal, \nas is my assessment at least, is much improved over the previous \nproposals. This improvement comes from the inclusion of new \nentitlements and targeted tax breaks along with appropriations spending \nitems.\n  As I have stated in the past, if the Congress is serious about \nattacking our annual deficits, it must expand its view beyond \ndiscretionary spending. Discretionary spending, Mr. President, accounts \nin 1995 for 36 percent of the total spending of our Government. The \nCongress cannot balance the budget, let alone reduce the national debt, \nby focusing on 36 percent of the total budget.\n  The proposal before us makes great strides by also including in its \npurview new entitlements and direct spending. Entitlement spending will \nmake up 49 percent of the budget in 1995.\n  This proposal also includes targeted tax benefits as being subjected \nto a Presidential line-item veto. According to the Senate Budget \nCommittee, it was projected that the Treasury will lose $453 billion in \nrevenue through tax expenditures in 1995 alone. That number is twice \nthe size of the projected budget deficit.\n  At a time when our country is fast approaching the debt ceiling limit \nof $4.9 trillion, which could occur as early as August, according to \nthe Treasury Department, it is important to send the message that, to \nattack the deficit, there must be a shared commitment from all sectors \nof the Federal budget including entitlement spending and tax \npreferences. I commend the authors of this proposal for this \nimprovement over earlier versions.\n  Now, while this proposal is greatly improved in some respects, it \ncauses me grave concern in other areas. The point which causes me the \ngreatest concern is the impact of the massive shift of power from the \nCongress to the executive branch which could occur under this bill.\n  I might say, Mr. President, it is totally contrary to historic \nRepublicanism. This is some strange new doctrine, to suggest that we \nhave to abdicate responsibility to the Chief Executive of this country. \nI do not care whether he is a Democrat or a Republican.\n  While many supporters of this legislation have attempted to address \nthis concern during the debate, I must raise this issue again as I \nbelieve it should be of grave concern to all the Members of the \nCongress, the House, the Senate, Republican and Democrat.\n  Mr. President, the legislation would actually allow the President of \nthe United States, with the support of only one-third of either body, \nto eliminate funding for myriad Federal spending, departments, and \nprograms authorized and enacted by the Congress.\n  Supporters of this proposal continually highlight it as a way to get \nat the so-called pet projects of interest to individual Members or to \nindividual States. I will point out, as I have done in the past, \nMembers can exercise their rights under the rules to raise objections, \noffer amendments, and round up votes to defeat such proposals.\n  Members should identify provisions of appropriations bills and \nreports that they find objectionable and craft amendments to resolve \nthose objections. Members should also encourage the President to come \nforward with a rescission proposal pursuant to title X of the Budget \nAct to strip that funding.\n  We have that power. We have those tools. It must also be highlighted \nthat the line-item veto can also be used to reduce funding or even \neliminate completely, funding for projects and agencies that I doubt \nfew would call congressional pork.\n  Let me remind you, a President with one-third of either Chamber--\nhardly a majority--could effectively eliminate funding for an entire \nagency such as HUD, the Interior Department, the Education Department, \nthe EPA--any Department. While some Members may argue in favor of such \na move, I doubt that many of us would call these agencies pet projects. \nDo not forget, we have had Presidents offer and express a desire to \nabolish such departments. This is not a hypothetical situation-- \nentire departments. President Reagan wanted to absolutely \neliminate the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, and \nothers. And we have heard that from other Presidents. That could \nhappen. With a one-third vote of the House and the Senate, the \nPresident would prevail to eliminate entire departments. So do not get \nthis idea that somehow what has been identified as pork here or pork \nthere is the only target we have to worry about.\n  Now, while these examples may be extreme, a similar scenario was \ndescribed by a Member during this debate. It was mentioned that on an \nissue such as ground-based missile defenses, a President may disagree \non the line of funding, and this line-item veto would allow the \nPresident, with one-third of either Chamber, to simply line out all the \nfunding for such a program.\n  At a time when many Members have raised concerns about funding levels \nof the military, are those same Members willing to defer to the \njudgment of whichever President occupies the White House regarding \ndefense spending levels? The same point can be made regarding housing \npolicy, nutrition programs, or spending to combat crime.\n  That is an awesome shift of power which some may be willing to \nrelinquish to the executive branch of Government, but I am not. I am \nnot as willing to bestow that type of power on the executive branch. \nThe Framers of the Constitution were very concerned about the abuses of \nan Executive which possesses too much power. That is why the power to \nspend was placed in the branch of Government which is most accountable \nto and representative of each citizen, the Congress of the United \nStates. The purse strings are placed here. In my opinion, the Framers \nwere right on target. There are no sound reasons why the legislative \nbranch should shift such an important constitutionally created \nresponsibility to the Chief Executive.\n  Perhaps I am burdened by history, either by generation or by being a \nhistory buff, but I recall when a President of the United States wanted \nto usurp the power of the Supreme Court, a third coequal branch of \nGovernment. It was not just a little line item in an appropriations \nbill or a tax bill. He wanted to dominate the Supreme Court. That was \ncalled the Court-packing plan of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Thank God, \nthere were enough Democrats at that time to join with the corpus guard \nof 17 Republicans to block that.\n  Nevertheless, it is illustrative of the kind of power that is a \ndesire of the Chief Executive that has taken place in our history. Now \nwe are going to say the President of the United States and one-third of \nthe membership of this Congress, you make these vital, and important \ndecisions.\n  And let us not forget when you had 17 Republicans here at one time in \nthe Senate, and they called it the Cherokee Strip because the Democrats \ncould not all sit on that side. They had a whole row, two rows of \nDemocrats on this side, and the Republicans were huddled down here \nunder Senator Charles McNary from Oregon trying to survive. You can \nimagine the kind of domination that Franklin Roosevelt had of the \nCongress that first term and part of the second term. Thank God, we had \na Supreme Court. It was the only check and balance we had in our \ngovernmental system. That is just history, but it also makes me a \nlittle leery about ever handing too much power to any branch of \nGovernment.\n  I would also like to take a moment to explain what separate \nenrollments of bills would entail. While I understand that many \nAmericans support the concept of a line-item veto, I think it is \nimportant to explain what that means in the context of separate \nenrollment.\n  Separate enrollment would take individual appropriations bills, as \npassed \n[[Page S4329]]  by the House and the Senate, and separate these bills \ninto thousands of individual bills for the President to sign or to \nveto. Apart from a reference to a bill number, these new individual \nbills would bear no resemblance to the original bill which was voted on \nby the Congress. I question the soundness of this approach based on \npractical as well as on constitutional grounds. According to the \nConstitution, article I, section 7:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated. . . .\n\n  I assume that the supporters of separate enrollment are confident \nthat the courts will uphold the constitutionality of this approach, I \nhowever have not yet been convinced that will be the courts' \nconclusion.\n  I would also like to mention that while the vast majority of States \ndo have some version of a line-item veto, none of the versions include \nthe separate enrollment language contained in the bill before us. \nPassage of this bill will send the Federal Government into uncharted \nlegislative waters.\n  Mr. President, I shall vote ``no'' on the final passage of the line-\nitem veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the senior Senator from Oregon, \nmy good friend, for his statement. I, too, have a number of serious \nconcerns and questions about the majority leader's substitute line-item \nveto amendment, the Separate Enrollment and Item Veto Act of 1995.\n  I have the same question as has just been stated here on the floor \nabout the constitutional aspects of it, whether it passes \nconstitutional muster. The presentment clause of the Constitution is \nvery clear. The distinguished Senator from Oregon read it into the \nRecord, but it is clause 2 of article I section 7. It says:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate shall, before it become a Law, \n     be presented to the President of the United States; if he \n     approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it with \n     his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal and proceed to reconsider it.\n\n  Walter Dellinger, the very well respected constitutional scholar, and \nAssistant Attorney General, says:\n\n       This language mandates a fairly straightforward procedure. \n     After both Houses of Congress have passed a ``Bill'' they \n     must present it to the President, who can either ``approve'' \n     . . . it . . . or ``not . . . .'' In either event, the bill \n     is treated as a single unit; nothing in the text permits the \n     President to approve and sign one portion while disapproving \n     and returning another portion.\n\n  I might ask, Madam President, if we have something that raises on its \nface such a constitutional issue, where is the congressional testimony \nthat explains why this legislative separate enrollment version of a \nline-item veto is constitutional? I am a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, as is the distinguished Presiding Officer. There has not \nbeen a word of testimony in our committee on that. I think if we \nadopted something like this, Congress will spend too much time in the \ncourt trying to defend separate enrollments, instead of concentrating \non reducing the deficit.\n  Even if it was not unconstitutional, which I am convinced it is, it \nis, I suspect, unworkable. The enrollment clerk would have to enroll \neach item in an appropriations or revenue measure as a separate bill. \nThen the President can either veto or sign it. But this would require \nthe enrollment clerk to enroll hundreds, if not thousands, of separate \nbills. I thought the new majority wanted to reduce Government \npaperwork.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would suggest, Madam President, that we call this \namendment the Tree Cutting and Paperwork Promotion Act. As a tree farm \nowner myself, I should probably vote for it because of all the extra \npaper and paperwork we will have around here. We do sell trees to make \npaper on my farm.\n  But then I might ask, how is the clerk going to decide what is an \nitem to be enrolled as a separate bill? The amendment defines an item \nas ``any numbered section, any unnumbered paragraph, or any allocation \nor suballocation * * * contained in a numbered section or unnumbered \npara- \ngraph .'' What if you write an appropriations bill that is just one \nparagraph? It may be 38 pages long, but it could be written as one.\n  Or I can see Members taking items, a popular and an unpopular item, \nand put them into a single numbered section or unnumbered paragraph so \nthey would be enrolled together as one item. That protects it from a \nPresidential veto.\n  And what is an allocation or suballocation? There is no definition in \nthe amendment. Is that up to the discretion of the clerk? If so, then \nthe unelected enrollment clerk becomes far more powerful than a lot of \nMembers of Congress.\n  There is no clear answer to this. We have never had hearings on it. \nThe so-called compromise agreement was dug up from the past to break a \ndeadlock that the majority has over two different line-item veto bills, \nS. 4 and S. 14.\n  These two bills were debated. They were marked up. They were reported \nby two different committees--the Budget Committee and the Government \nAffairs Committee. It would have been helpful if at least one of these \ntwo committees had seen this substitute before it hit the floor.\n  And, like S. 4, the so-called compromise amendment encourages \nminority rule. It allows a Presidential item veto to stand with the \nsupport of only 34 Senators, or 146 Representatives.\n  If you are from a State that only has a few representatives, like \nmine, only 1, I do not know how you could possibly vote for something \nlike this. Basically it says your State becomes immaterial--immaterial \nin any determination. It is not majority rule. We are back to anti-\nDemocratic supermajority requirements. I thought that was dismissed \nduring the balanced budget amendment debate.\n  By imposing a two-thirds supermajority vote to override a \nPresidential item veto, the Dole amendment undermines the fundamental \nprinciple of majority rule. Our Founders rejected such supermajority \nvoting and I oppose this. I do not care whether we have a Democratic \nPresident, as we do right now, or a Republican President. I am sure \nPresident Clinton would probably be delighted to have this. I can think \nof some times when I would probably be delighted as a Democrat that he \nwould have it. But as a principle, I do not want any President to have \nthis. The Congress might as well just pack up and go home.\n  Maybe some might like that, but I do not think that, as powerful a \ncountry as ours is, we want to see a situation where one of the three \nindependent branches of Government is put in a position where they can \nbasically override the other two branches of Government. That is not \nhow we stayed a democracy after we gained that power.\n  Alexander Hamilton talked of the supermajority requirements as a \n``poison'' that serves ``* * * to destroy the energy of the government, \nand to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an \ninsignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations \nand decisions of a respectable majority.''\n  Such a supermajority requirement not only shows a distrust of the \nCongress but the electorate. As an American, as one who believes in our \nmajority rule in our country--one who believes in our democracy and \nthat our democracy exists because of our three branches of Government, \nI reject this notion and this basic distrust.\n  I think it is overkill. Over the course of our history, in 200 years, \nsomething we overlook in this--the President has vetoed 2,513 bills.\n  Congress overrode 104 times out of 2,513. The supermajority veto is \nan extraordinarily effective executive power. It is not needed to \nstrike wasteful line items. Majority votes are enough to kill any \nwasteful line item.\n  In fact, if someone were to hear a number of the Members who stand up \nhere and say how much they want this line-item veto when so many of \nthose same Members have made sure that they have line items in \nappropriations bills or authorizing bills to help them with their \nconstituents or their State, you would think that a Senator could not \nrequire separate votes on items in a bill. But they can. All they have \nto \n[[Page S4330]] do is object to committee amendments to be considered en \nbloc and then vote on them one by one and have a rollcall vote on them. \nBut some of the same Senators who talk about such wasteful spending do \nnot do that. They do not want to call up these particular items.\n  Let us not say we are going to muddy up our constitutional form of \ngovernment by tossing the buck to the President if we are unable to do \nit, unwilling to do it, ourselves.\n  Then, of course, we have tax breaks. Now the rubber hits the road. If \nit is an item that may actually help your State, we could take that \nout. But if it is an item that might help some wealthy special interest \nand we do not want the President to ever touch that, the amendment only \nallows the President to veto a targeted tax benefit.\n  A ``targeted tax benefit'' is defined as any provision that is \nestimated to lose any revenue and has ``the practical effect of \nproviding more favorable tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or \nlimited group of taxpayers when compared with other similarly situated \ntaxpayers.''\n  I am a lawyer. I have looked at that. I have looked at it about 10 \ndifferent ways. I have asked other lawyers to look at it. Nobody seems \nto know what this means other than to say they would love to be \ninvolved in litigation on it. They could keep the clock running forever \non that. It would produce endless litigation over what is a ``practical \neffect'' and who is a ``similarly situated taxpayer.'' These terms, of \ncourse, are not defined in the bill. In fact, the definition of \n``targeted tax benefit'' sounds like a tax loophole itself.\n  Would the President also have a line-item veto authority over the \ncapital gains tax cut described in the House Republican Contract With \nAmerica? It is going to lose revenue. The bipartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated that the Contract With America's capital gains \ntax cut would lose almost $32 billion from 1995 to 2000.\n  I have a feeling that is not intended to be touched by the line-item \nveto. Why not quit this shell game? Just state in plain language that \nthe President has line-item authority over all tax expenditures.\n  So I have too many problems about this substitute. I think it is just \na fix to pick up a vote or two. We saw that during the balanced budget \namendment debate. We would pull things out on Social Security, or \nwhatnot, to try to get a vote here or there--no hearings, no discussion \nof the final effect of it.\n  I cast a procedural vote for cloture in 1985 to allow an up-or-down \nvote on a separate-enrollment line-item-veto bill. But that was because \nthere had been hearings on a bill. There was a report on it, and we \nknew when we were going to vote on it. There have been a lot of changes \nsince then.\n  There is no need to gamble on a questionable version of a line-item-\nveto bill. Thanks to the bipartisan leadership of Senators Domenici and \nExon, we have a better line-item veto--the original S. 14 bill.\n  I have already said publicly on national television that I find this \nvery appealing. I believe I could vote for it. But we ought to, if we \nare going to pass a line-item-veto bill, base it on the original \nbipartisan expedited rescission measure, one that has been carefully \nstudied.\n  That I am willing to take a chance on. I am willing to take a chance \non it with a sunset provision, but also because most of the questions \nthat have been asked have been answered. I am not willing to take a \nplunge in faith on an amendment that is out here basically just to pick \nup a few extra votes.\n  Madam President, I see no one else seeking recognition. So I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                 Amendment No. 401 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the \nconsideration of my amendment No. 401, which I submitted yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 401 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On p. 3, line 17, strike everything after word ``measure'' \n     through the word ``generally'' on p. 4, line 14 and insert \n     the following in its place: first passes both Houses of \n     Congress in the same form, the Secretary of the Senate (in \n     the case of a measure originating in the Senate) or the Clerk \n     of the House of Representatives (in the case of a measure \n     originating in the House of Representatives) shall \n     disaggregate the bill into items and assign each item a new \n     bill number. Henceforth each item shall be treated as a \n     separate bill to be considered under the following \n     subsections.\n       (2) A bill that is required to be disaggregated into \n     separate bills pursuant to subsection (a)--\n       (A) shall be disaggregated without substantive revision, \n     and\n       (B) shall bear the designation of the measure of which it \n     was an item prior to such disaggregation, together with such \n     other designation as may be necessary to distinguish such \n     measure from other measures disaggregated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) with respect to the same measure.\n       (b) The new bills resulting from the disaggregation \n     described in paragraph 1 of subsection (a) shall be \n     immediately placed on the calendar of both Houses. They shall \n     be the next order of business in each House and they shall be \n     considered en bloc and shall not be subject to amendment. A \n     motion to proceed to the bills shall be nondebatable. Debate \n     in the House of Representatives or the Senate on the bills \n     shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, which shall be \n     divided equally between the majority leader and the minority \n     leader. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. A \n     motion to recommit the bills is not in order, and it is not \n     in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the bills \n     are agreed to or disagreed to.\n                     amendment no. 401, as modified\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I send a modification to amendment No. \n401 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 401), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On p. 3, line 17, strike everything after word ``measure'' \n     through the word ``generally'' on p. 4, line 14 and insert \n     the following in its place: first passes both Houses of \n     Congress in the same form, the Secretary of the Senate (in \n     the case of a measure originating in the Senate) or the Clerk \n     of the House of Representatives (in the case of a measure \n     originating in the House of Representatives) shall \n     disaggregate the bill into items and assign each item a new \n     bill number. Henceforth each item shall be treated as a \n     separate bill to be considered under the following \n     subsections.\n       (2) A bill that is required to be disaggregated into \n     separate bills pursuant to subsection (a)--\n       (A) shall be disaggregated without substantive revision, \n     and\n       (B) shall bear the designation of the measure of which it \n     was an item prior to such disaggregation, together with such \n     other designation as may be necessary to distinguish such \n     measure from other measures disaggregated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) with respect to the same measure.\n       (b) The new bills resulting from the disaggregation \n     described in paragraph 1 of subsection (a) shall be \n     immediately placed on the appropriate calendar in the House \n     of origination, and upon passage, placed on the appropriate \n     calendar in the other House. They shall be the next order of \n     business in each House and they shall be considered en bloc \n     and shall not be subject to amendment. A motion to proceed to \n     the bills shall be nondebatable. Debate in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate on the bills shall be limited \n     to not more than 1 hour, which shall be divided equally \n     between the majority leader and the minority leader. A motion \n     further to limit debate is not debatable. A motion to \n     recommit the bills is not in order, and it is not in order to \n     move to reconsider the vote by which the bills are agreed to \n     or disagreed to.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is \nstraightforward. Rather than deeming the work product of the Clerk of \nthe House or the Secretary of the Senate to be separate bills and \ntransmitting them to the President directly, my amendment calls for one \nlast single vote on the entire package of bills by both Houses of \nCongress after the bills have been disaggregated.\n  This will not appreciably slow the work of the Congress, since it \nwill only require one vote on the whole package. In addition, the \namendment provides for highly expedited procedures that would allow \nonly one hour of debate on the entire package with no other business \nbeing in order.\n  On the other hand, in my view this amendment greatly strengthens the \nlikelihood that this legislation will be upheld by the Supreme Court. \nIndeed, although I did not know this at the \n[[Page S4331]]  time I was preparing this amendment, that is the view \nthat the Department of Justice's Assistant Attorney General for the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, Walter Dellinger, expressed in advising \nPresident Clinton regarding the constitutionality of S. 137, an earlier \nproposal containing enrollment procedures similar to those in the \nsubstitute. His letter states:\n\n       Furthermore, there appear to be ways to refine S. 137 so as \n     to avoid the objection that what must be presented to the \n     President is the ``bill'' in exactly the form voted on by \n     each House. So long as the Houses of Congress have treated \n     each bill subsequently presented to the President as a bill \n     at the time of each of their respective final votes, this \n     objection would not arise. Thus, for example,\n      internal House and Senate procedures that provided for \n     disaggregating an appropriations bill into separate bills \n     and then voting en bloc on those bills would result in the \n     President's being presented with exactly [what was] voted \n     on by each House. The chances of S. 137's being sustained \n     would be improved were the bill amended to incorporate \n     such refinements.\n\n  In short, in my view, we stand a much better chance of all the hard \nwork that has been done by our colleagues over the years on this matter \nnot being undone by the courts if my amendment is adopted.\n  I believe it would directly address, and satisfactorily address, the \nconcerns that were earlier expressed by several Senators on the floor \ntoday as to the constitutionality of this legislation with respect to \nits presentment to the President.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues who support this legislation \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan for offering \nthis amendment. While I do not believe this amendment is necessary, I \nbelieve it does address a concern that was raised yesterday relative to \nthe constitutionality of a process which would deem an appropriations \nbill which was enrolled separately to incorporate all of the provisions \nof the original bill.\n  For reasons that I outlined at length yesterday, and on the basis of \nsome respected constitutional scholars, as well as others who have \nresearched this area, we strongly feel and believe that our conclusions \nthat the constitutionality of the Dole substitute, as originally \npresented, meet constitutional muster, that those provisions are \nadhered to and that no constitutional question exists.\n  Nevertheless, the amendment of the Senator from Michigan is \nacceptable to this Senator and to the proponents of the Dole \nsubstitute, in that it clarifies any ambiguity that might exist or \nconcerns that might exist among some Members who have questioned the \nconstitutionality of that procedure.\n  For that reason, I think the amendment of the Senator from Michigan \nis appropriate and I trust and hope that it will be adopted by this \nbody.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senator from \nMichigan has brought up this particular amendment, which we would like \nto take a further look at. Senator Byrd is a recognized constitutional \nscholar, as he demonstrated, I think, very vividly yesterday, and I am \nsure he will have some questions or comments on this.\n  I would simply like to say, though, that I am particularly happy that \nthis has been brought up, because it allows me to raise some questions \nas to why in the world, with all of the other problems that we have had \nover the years in enacting some kind of an enhanced rescission or \nexpedited rescission or line-item veto--call it what you will, we all \nknow what we are talking about--why in the world are we bringing up \nmatters that I think are extraneous, that I think are not necessary.\n  I think this whole enrollment proposition is ludicrous from the \nstandpoint that I believe, as much as anything else, it could cause us \na great deal of difficulty with regard to the courts.\n  I still do not understand why, all of the sudden, after S. 4 and S. \n14, the two mainline bills in this regard were considered and \nintroduced in the Senate, hearings held on them in the Budget \nCommittee, in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and talk back and \nforth about which should be advanced and which should not be and in \nwhat form--at least in the Budget Committee a number of amendments were \noffered on a whole series of issues--but never once to my knowledge in \nany of the committees of the Congress of the United States this year \ndid we ever touch on or think about this enrollment mechanism that has \ncome out of nowhere to be one of the central parts of the bill finally \nintroduced by the majority leader and, as near as I can tell, endorsed \nand backed by all 54 Members of the Senate on the Republican side of \nthe aisle.\n  I would simply also point out that this enrollment mechanism, \nregardless of its merits or lack thereof, can be agreed by all to be \ncumbersome, to be laborious, and I do not see the need for it. \nCertainly, the House of Representatives did not think this was \nimportant. We, in the U.S. Senate, did not think it was important when \nwe introduced S. 4 and S. 14 and had all those hearings. It was not in \nthe Contract With America, as far as I know. And those who wrote and \nsigned the Contract With America, of which the line-item veto or \nenhanced rescissions or expedited rescissions, call it what you will, \nthey did not think it was important.\n  It comes over to the U.S. Senate and out of the blue comes this very \ndifficult system that I thought that my friend from Indiana did a \npretty good job of trying to explain yesterday. He went to the \nenrolling clerk. And he said he can do this with computers and it is \ngoing to be very easy to do.\n  Basically, again, I am not a constitutional scholar, I am not even a \nlawyer, but I listened with great interest to the presentation of one \nwho is, Senator Byrd. When I was listening to Senator Byrd yesterday, I \nthought, you know, thank God for the people of West Virginia sending us \na man of the talent and the intellect with regard to the constitutional \nproblems that might come up.\n  Basically, it seems to me, if you pass a bill in the U.S. Senate and \nthen you present that to the President of the United States in a \ndifferent form, at least you are asking for some problems from the \ncourts. It might well be that the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan might clarify that somewhat. I \nwould be very much interested in what Senator Byrd and others that have \nstudied this from a constitutional standpoint might feel about it.\n  Suffice it to say, it seems to me, Madam President, that the fact \nthat we seem to be somewhat concerned about this, at least some on that \nside of the aisle must be somewhat concerned because they have talked \nabout it a great deal, and now we have an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Michigan that tries to clarify it a little bit more, why \nclarify it? Why do we not pass the measure before us, which is termed \nthe majority leader's bill or the revision of S. 4? Why do we not pass \nit and go back to the simple, direct, and understandable form that we \nhad in this regard in S. 4, in S. 14, and in the measure that came over \nfrom the House of Representatives? Why do we not go back to that which \nI do not believe anybody has any objection to if they are for this?\n  I would think that Senator McCain, the original proponent of S. 4, \nwould feel that he had thought this through quite carefully. I suspect \nthat Senator Domenici and this Senator, who combined as original \ncosponsors of S. 14 and thought about it, we thought that the more \nsimple form with regard to how this was presented to the President \nwould be in the line-item form that Senator Thurmond talked about that \nhe used as Governor, as this Senator has talked about from the time \nthat I have served as Governor of Nebraska. I do not know why that kind \nof a form and process is not good if we are going to pass some kind of \na line-item veto or, once again, call it what you will.\n  So I simply say that I thank my distinguished friend from Michigan \nfor advancing this thought. But it gave this Senator an opportunity to \nsay, why are we going through all these exercises in futility, when it \nwould seem to me that the main sponsors of the amendment that was \noffered by the majority leader should recognize it would be to the good \nof all of us who would like to see some type of a line-item veto passed \nto go back to a sounder footing that I think we would have both from \nthe standpoint of expediting the process \n[[Page S4332]]  and from the standpoint of probably not being \nchallenged constitutionally on this particular item, and go back to the \nway line-item vetoes have generally been handled in the past without \nsome of these special, complicated enrollment procedures that have been \nthrown into this measure at the last minute for reasons that I do not \nbegin to understand?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I would just point out to my colleague \nand friend from Nebraska that the separate enrollment procedure is not \nsomething that is new. In fact, it is a procedure which has enjoyed \nsupport not only from Republicans but also from Democrats.\n  Senator Hollings, more than a decade ago, suggested, discussed, \nproposed the separate enrollment procedure. Senator Biden, then \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, spoke very articulately in favor \nof the separate enrollment procedure and its constitutionality.\n  It is a means by which we attempt to accomplish the end that I think \nmost now are admitting needs to be accomplished. That is, to provide a \nmeans by which we can check the unnecessary pork-barrel spending that \nhas come out of this Chamber and the House Chamber and sent to the \ndesk, to the President, in increasing amounts ever since the adoption \nof the Budget Act of 1974.\n  It is a practice that Members have used, and I suggest many have \nabused, of attaching to otherwise necessary legislation that the \nPresident needs to sign items that are designed to favor a few or favor \na parochial, narrow interest.\n  So as we have struggled to define the vehicle that will achieve the \nnecessary number of votes to grant a check and balance against this \npractice of Congress, we have looked at various forms--enhanced \nrescission is one; constitutional amendment is another; separate \nenrollment is the third.\n  Modern technology has allowed us to accomplish separate enrollment in \na means and way in which we could not a few years ago. Five or six \nyears ago, it was a valid complaint and a valid objection to say that \nit would lead to an incredibly difficult and complex process which \nwould require the enrolling clerk to go through all kinds of \nmachinations and additional work in order to accomplish the breakdown \nof a particular piece of legislation into individual items which could \nthen be enrolled and sent to the President.\n  Today, computer programs allow that to be accomplished in a matter of \nhours, if not minutes--depending on the size of the bill. What used to \nbe described as a nightmare of a procedure now is a routine procedure, \naccomplished both in the Senate and in the House.\n  Separate enrollment has the advantage of allowing the President to \nknow exactly what is laid on his or her desk, what item constitutes \nadditional spending for a particular purpose.\n  Rather than the obfuscation and rather than the confusion over how \ntaxpayers' money is going to be spent we now, under separate \nenrollment, pick up a piece of paper which contains a single item, \nincorporated in a form which the President can either accept or reject.\n  No longer will we have the excuse of saying, ``I didn't know what was \nin that massive bill. I thought we were voting on an emergency \nappropriation. I thought we were voting on something of national \ninterest. It was only later I discovered, to my horror, that it \nincluded all kinds of special tax benefits for single individuals, for \nlimited interests, special breaks for special interests.''\n  Or, ``I didn't know that the appropriations that went forward \nprovided what is often characterized as embarrassing expenditures of \nsomething that can only be described as pork-barrel spending.\n  ``Even had I known it, I'm afraid I would have had to vote for the \nbill, because it provided emergency funding for our national defense; \nit provided emergency funding for hurting Americans as a consequence of \na hurricane or floods or an earthquake, or necessary spending for \nessential functions of Government.''\n  Or, ``I didn't want to shut the whole Government down. We were right \nup against the deadline.''\n  Yes, those rascals always slip a few things in there at the end, but \nwe were up against the deadline and we had a massive bill that we had \nto pass or send to the President.\n  The President is faced with the choice of either accepting the entire \nbill or rejecting the entire bill. The President--each President in \nthis century with one exception--has formally asked the Congress, ``Let \nme have line-item veto authority so that I am not''--as Harry Truman \nsaid--``blackmailed by the legislature into either accepting the bill \nwith all of its extraneous, nonrelevant spending, or rejecting the bill \nand sending it back.''\n  By the way, you send a lot of these major appropriations up at the \nvery end of the fiscal year with hours to go, sometimes, before the \nfiscal year runs out, and then you put me in a position of saying if I \ndo not like something in that legislation, I have to send the entire \nbill back and close every office, and all the horror stories about the \nessential functions of Government are then raised. That is, as Harry \nTruman said, legislative blackmail.\n  Madam President, what we are attempting to do is to fashion a \nprocedure, a process which will allow the President to say ``I'll \naccept 99 percent of that bill or 94 percent of that bill, but I can't \naccept it with these dozen items in there that do not have anything to \ndo with the bill, that do not go toward any national interest, that are \nsimply attached because Members knew that this is the way to get their \npork-barrel spending through, that I had to accept the bill.''\n  By the same token, this is a process which will change the way \nMembers behave, the way Members act. Because now, knowing that the \nPresident would have the power under line-item veto to single out their \nparticular item, to single it out on one page of paper for everyone to \nsee, and knowing that the only way that item could become law is if \nthis Congress brought it back up and that Member were forced to come to \nthe floor, debate, and explain what was in the bill, what the spending \nwas for, and turn to his colleagues and say, ``I need your support but, \nby the way, you will have to put your `yes' or your `no' on public \nrecord so that your constituents understand how you feel about that \nparticular item,'' knowing that, I predict most Members will say, ``I \ndon't think that particular spending item is so important that I want \nto risk having to debate that or putting other Members on notice.'' Or, \n``I don't think I can get the necessary votes to achieve that \nparticular purpose.''\n  Separate enrollment brings forward into the light of public scrutiny \nthe particular item of expenditure, and no longer will we be able to \nhide that item.\n  Madam President, I note that the Senator from West Virginia has \narrived on the floor, and I am more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I just remind my colleague that the \nPresiding Officer still has the right to decide the floor.\n  Madam President, I have been listening with great interest to my \nfriend and colleague from Indiana. I would remind him that before he \nand many other people came to the Senate, former Senator Quayle, former \nVice President Quayle, and this Senator, were up appealing on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate along the same identical lines that the Senator from \nIndiana just mentioned.\n  I listened very much to his remarks in response to the suggestion \nthat I had made, but maybe he did not understand what I was talking \nabout. There is nothing wrong in using computers to try to ferret out \nso that all--including Members of the House, Members of the Senate, the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, who has to sign each one of these \nmeasures, the Speaker of the House--so that he or she is fully \ninformed, and the President of the United States, so that they are \nfully informed.\n  So we are not against the use of computers to furnish information and \nbreak down the figure.\n There is nothing wrong with that.\n\n  Much of the excellent remarks that were just made by my colleague \nfrom Indiana emphasized the need for a line- \n[[Page S4333]] item veto, enhanced rescission, expedited rescission--\ncall it what you will. So I do not think that is the debate that I was \ntrying to enter into, nor do I believe that is the intent of the \namendment offered, that we are now on, by the Senator from Michigan.\n  What we are talking about is whether or not it is wise to use the \nenrollment procedure that has come out of the blue. I agree with my \nfriend from Indiana. This is new. It has not been talked about before. \nIt has been suggested by Senator Hollings, it has been suggested by \nSenator Biden, as I understand it, and possibly others. But it was just \none suggestion that was made somewhere down the line.\n  I happen to believe that the House of Representatives, which studied \nthis matter, did not feel that the bill was unworkable unless we used \nthe enrollment process that suddenly has been instigated here as a key \npart. I do not believe that the Budget Committee or the other committee \nof jurisdiction that considered this matter felt that the measures that \nwere advanced were inoperative or had not been thought through because \nwe did not come through this magical enrollment procedure.\n  I will simply say that most of the remarks that the Senator from \nIndiana made were with regard to the merits and why we need a line-item \nveto of some type. He did not, I think, adequately address the concerns \nthat I was trying to bring up with regard to this enrollment process \nthat I think could cause us some serious constitutional problems, those \nof us who are now for and have been for a line-item veto of some type \nfor a long, long time.\n  So I simply want to focus, if it was not understood, on the concerns \nof this Senator with regard to this cumbersome procedure to carry out \nthe line-item veto.\n  For the life of me, I have not been able to understand yet how the \nPresident pro tempore and the Speaker and the President can carry out \ntheir duties by signing something that is on a computer. There is \nnothing wrong with using a computer to make sure that everybody knows \nwhat every item is from 1 cent to trillions of dollars. But I do not \nbelieve that that particular enrollment process is the key to success \nat all. In fact, I think that kind of a process, as I say once again, \ncould cause us some considerable difficulties in the courts. No one \nknows how they would decide that.\n  I simply wanted to make it clear, Madam President, that I was not in \nconflict with what the Senator from Indiana said with regard to the \nnecessity for a line-item veto. I am trying to focus on the fact that I \nbelieve that the enrollment process is also causing some concern to \nSenators on that side of the aisle, as evidenced by the fact that the \nSenator from Michigan must have some concerns about it or he would not \nbe in here offering his amendment.\n  So I simply warn and would like to have some consideration given to \nwhy can we not pass a cleaner, simpler, more direct line-item veto, a \nla what was sent to us by the House, a la what was incorporated in S. \n4, what was incorporated in S. 14? I do not believe that all of the \npeople that touched those different propositions had not thought \nthrough the process to the point that all is forsaken unless somehow we \naccept this concept that has been brought into this body for the first \ntime, as I know it, under the present consideration of a line-item veto \nor something akin to it in this current session of the Congress.\n  I happen to think that it is ill-advised to go that far, but the \nmajority has a right to work its will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the majority leader has made it quite \nclear, as has the Democratic leader, that we want to finish this bill \ntomorrow. We have now 14 amendments pending on the bill. We have spent \na long time on the bill. We would like to have debate on this \namendment. Any Member of this body can put the Senate into a quorum \ncall if they wish.\n  I would like to go ahead and debate the Abraham amendment and be able \nto move on to other amendments, if that is possible. If it is not \npossible, then obviously we may have to inconvenience Members by \nstaying here very late tonight so that we can keep consonance with the \ndesires of the majority leader and the rest of the Members of the body \nto finish this legislation tomorrow and not spend 3 and 4 weeks on a \nsingle piece of legislation as we did with the balanced budget \namendment and other amendments since we have gone into session here.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can move forward with this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not ready at this moment to debate the \namendment, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not seek to delay action on the \namendment, nor do I seek to delay action on the bill. But this is an \namendment that has just been called up and the author of the amendment \nis not in the Chamber. I was hoping to ask the author of the amendment \nsome questions. If Senators want me to begin, I can talk at length, but \nI do not seek to do that. That is not my purpose. I wanted to ask some \nquestions about the amendment. I wanted to ask some questions of the \nauthor.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona, of course, is seeking to convey the \nimpression that I am trying to delay the bill. I am not doing that. I \nam not quite ready yet to discuss this amendment, but I am also not \nready yet to allow a vote on it, until I have an opportunity to ask a \nfew questions.\n  So I will suggest if Senators wish to get on with the amendment, get \nthe author of the amendment over to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, \nthe Senator from Michigan, who is the author of the amendment, is on \nthe floor now if the Senator chooses to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have noted the amendment by Mr. Abraham to \nthe substitute offered by Mr. Dole.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to ask questions of other \nSenators, notwithstanding that I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. My first question to the distinguished Senator would be, \nwhy does the Senator feel that it is necessary to offer this amendment \nto the Dole substitute?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I have watched the debate as it has proceeded here. And \ncertainly during the period of time after the compromise version of \nthis legislation was developed, I have heard various Members of the \nSenate express concerns about its constitutionality and it struck me \nthat the area in which the concerns were primarily focused was, as \nearlier expressed, I think, by Senator Leahy, the presentment issues \nthat I have tried to address here.\n  My feelings were, although I believe as drafted the legislation could \nsustain a constitutional test, that it was in our interests to make the \nchanges I am proposing in this amendment to try to further address any \nconcerns people might have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on yesterday I spoke at some length with \nrespect to what I consider to be some constitutional flaws in the Dole \nsubstitute. One area which I discussed at some length was that which \npertained to the presentation clause; the fact that under the \nlegislation that is before the Senate, each of the bills or joint \nresolutions that will have been enrolled by the enrolling clerk of the \nHouse of origination will not have had action by either House, \nspecifically, on that particular enrolled bill. Consequently, I felt \nthat the legislation was constitutionally vulnerable. The pending \nlegislation deems that each such bill has passed both Houses, when in \nreality, each such bill would not have passed either House, to say \nnothing of both Houses.\n  So I take it that it is that perception of the unconstitutionality of \nthe legislation by Mr. Dole that has led the distinguished Senator to \noffer the amendment which is presently before the Senate?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. As I said, the concerns that had been expressed in the \nperiod of time during which this compromise was worked out and were \nexpressed, I think by you yesterday and by others here today, were \nconcerns I felt could be adequately addressed and resolved in this \nfashion. So I thought in developing this amendment we could effectively \nhandle the concerns that had been raised, although, as I say, I do not \nnecessarily accept the notion that the legislation would not pass \nconstitutional muster as is. But I thought this would allay fears and \nconcerns that had been brought up.\n  Mr. BYRD. But I think, Mr. President, that the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator will have certainly improved the legislation if \nthe amendment is agreed to, and I have no doubt that it will be.\n  Let me ask the Senator a further question. His amendment reads as \nfollows:\n\n       On p. 3, line 17, strike everything after the word \n     ``measure'' through the word ``generally'' on p. 4, line 14 \n     and insert the following in its place:\n\n  This is the language, now, that would be inserted by Mr. Abraham:\n\n     first passes both Houses of Congress in the same form, the \n     Secretary of the Senate (in the case of a measure originating \n     in the Senate) or the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     (in the case of a measure originating in the House of \n     Representatives) shall disaggregate the bill into items and \n     assign each item a new bill number. Henceforth each item \n     shall be treated as a separate bill to be considered under \n     the following subsections.\n\n  And so on.\n  The amendment of the Senator speaks not only with reference to \nappropriations bills but also with reference to authorization measures, \ndoes it not?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. BYRD. And on page 5 of the substitute offered by Mr. Dole and \nother Senators, under the section on definitions:\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (2) The term ``authorization measure'' means any measure, \n     other than an appropriations measure, that contains a \n     provision providing direct spending or targeted tax benefits.\n\n  Now, would that include a reconciliation bill?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am sorry?\n  Mr. BYRD. The definition of authorization measure, on page 5 of the \nDole substitute, under section 5 titled ``Definitions,'' paragraph (2):\n\n       The term ``authorization measure'' means any measure other \n     than an appropriations measure that contains a provision \n     providing direct spending or targeted tax benefits.\n\n  Does that language include a reconciliation bill?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would defer that interpretation to the manager.\n  Mr. BYRD. What does the Senator think it means, the Senator who \noffered the amendment? Does he believe the term ``authorization \nmeasure'' includes a reconciliation bill?\n  Mr. President, I am left alone on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor. \nAs I understand it, he is waiting for a response from the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the first question I have ever asked in the Senate \nthat caused the whole Senate to vanish, other than the Presiding \nOfficer and myself.\n  What am I to do?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, you have my complete attention.\n  Mr. BYRD. There was all this great hurry to get on with this bill and \nI have asked a question, but all Senators have left the floor.\n  Oh, they are returning now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor \nand continues to have unanimous consent to proceed with questions to \nanother Senator.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. After consultation with the manager of the bill, it is \nour interpretation that, yes, it would include reconciliation.\n  Mr. BYRD. It would include a reconciliation bill.\n  Then, I will read the amendment of the Senator further. According to \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator, ``the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives''--in most instances these measures would originate in \nthe House.\n  The Clerk of the House of Representatives then would disaggregate the \nbill, meaning a reconciliation bill, would disaggregate the bill into \nitems and assign each item a new bill number. In reconciliation bills \nthere is almost always direct spending. There are targeted tax \nbenefits. With the Senator's \n[[Page S4335]]  amendment then, I take it that a reconciliation bill \nthat has in it provisions providing direct spending or targeted tax \nbenefits--such bills would have to be disaggregated. Am I correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Meaning the whole bill has to be disaggregated. So, if \nthere are direct spending items in the bill, if there are targeted tax \nbenefits, the entire reconciliation bill under the Senator's amendment \nhas to be broken down, disaggregated for all of the items, assigned new \nbill numbers, and enrolled as separate bills. Am I correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. It would have to be disaggregated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is not the purpose of a reconciliation bill the bringing \ninto proper balance spending and the raising of revenues in such a way \nas to moderate or to reduce the deficit? Am I correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is correct. As I interpret the question, our \namendment is designed in a mechanical sense to call for a yes-no vote \non the question of all those separately disaggregated portions whether \nit is a reconciliation bill or other.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. So each of the items in the reconciliation bill would \nbe enrolled separately and be sent to the President. If the President \nchooses to veto certain items in the reconciliation bill, would this \nnot then have the undesired result of bringing into imbalance the \nreconciliation bill, rather than balancing the effects of revenue \nincreases and direct spending costs?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I defer on this to the Senator from Arizona. I yield to \nhim at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  I would say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia that this \nbill effects new spending, new taxes, or new entitlements. If the \nintention of reconciliation bills are to bring the deficit down, then \nwe should find another vehicle because the deficit has not come down. \nThe deficit has gone up. The deficit has gone up.\n  So I suggest that we invent a new vehicle. But a reconciliation bill, \nlike any other bill that has new spending, new taxes, or new \nentitlements associated with it, would be subject to a line-item veto.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the term ``authorization measure'' under section 5, \nentitled ``definitions,'' does not confine it to new spending or new \ntargeted tax benefits. The term ``authorization'' means any measure \nother than an appropriations measure that contains a provision \nproviding direct spending or targeted tax benefits. It does not say \nanything about new direct spending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will turn to the next page, where it says \nthe term ``item'' means with respect to an appropriations measure, any \nnumbered section, any numbered paragraph, any allocation or \nsuballocation of an appropriation made in compliance with section \n(2)(a) containing a numbered section and an unnumbered paragraph, and \nwith respect to an authorization measure, any numbered or unnumbered \nparagraph that contains new direct spending or a new direct tax benefit \npresented and identified in a conformance with (2)(b).\n  So I ask the distinguished Senator from West Virginia to look at next \npage for the explanation which seems to have eluded him.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the Senator's amendment said that the bill shall be \ndisaggregated. That means broken down. A reconciliation bill shall be \nseparated into all of its distinct parts and enrolled as separate bills \nand sent to the President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Whether there is ``new direct spending'' or just ``direct \nspending.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Only those items in the reconciliation bill which would \ncontain new direct spending or new targeted tax benefits identified in \nconformance with section (2)(b).\n  In addition to that, I do not see in light of a reconciliation bill \nany new entitlement or expansion of existing entitlement would also be \ncovered.\n  Mr. BYRD. What about a defense authorization bill? Would the entire \nbill have to be broken down?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say no.\n  Mr. BYRD. Only if it contained new direct spending or a new targeted \ntax benefit or an expansion or new entitlement. Defense authorization \nbills do include direct spending for retirement.\n  What I am really trying to get at is that it seems to me that this \namendment certainly has as its good purpose, the effort to cure what \nappears to be a constitutional vulnerability. But in the attempt, it \nraises as many questions as it answers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond to that? If I may ask the indulgence of \nthe Senator from West Virginia to try to respond very briefly to that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from West Virginia that we received \nfrom the Congressional Research Service from Mr. Johnny Killian, Senior \nSpecialist in American Constitutional Law, who I know that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is familiar with, and I will \nnot read the entire opinion. I would like to read the last paragraph \nwhich I think pretty much sums up the situation in my view.\n\n       In conclusion, we have argued that the deeming procedure--\n\n  We know what the deeming procedure is.\n\n     may present a political question unsuited for judicial \n     review, and, thus, that Congress would not be subject to \n     judicial review.\n\n  I will not read the whole thing because there is some ambiguity here, \nI say to my colleague from West Virginia.\n\n       We have considered, on the other hand, that the courts may \n     find they are not precluded from exercising authority to \n     review this proposal. If the proposal is reviewed by the \n     courts, and, even, if it is not, we have presented an \n     argument leading to sustaining the deeming procedure as not \n     in violation of a principle that bill, in order to become \n     law, must be passed in identical version by the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate. Because of the lack of \n     available precedent, we cannot argue that any of the three \n     versions of the argument is indisputably correct. Indeed, \n     there are questions about all three.\n\n  I repeat--questions about all three. The arguments concerning the \nseparate enrollment. He concludes by saying: ``In the end, Congress \nmust exercise a constitutional judgment when deciding on passage of a \nproposal.''\n  The Senator from Michigan felt, as he stated, that there might be \nsome ambiguities in judging this, and he felt that although it may or \nmay not--the language of the legislation is probably constitutional as \npresently framed. By his amendment, he could remove some of the \nambiguities associated with the constitutional question.\n  I do understand, and I paid attention yesterday to the very learned \nexposition of the Senator from West Virginia, about the \nconstitutionality of this issue. I suggest that perhaps one of the \nconclusions we might reach in this debate would be the final sentence \nof Mr. Killian's opinion which says: ``In the end, Congress must \nexercise a constitutional judgment when deciding on passage of the \nproposal,'' because as the Senator from West Virginia well knows, \naccording to article I, what the Congress deems as a bill has always \nbeen taken by the courts as a bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished \nSenator has just stated. But I think we are missing something; what we \nare saying is going by one another. I do not think the Senator's \nresponse goes to the point I raised. I agree that the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Abraham, is seeking to cure the vulnerability of the \nlanguage from a constitutional standpoint in the Dole substitute, \nespecially as it referred to the presentation clause. He is seeking to \nget around the deeming feature of that language. That is not what I am \nquestioning here. On that point, I am saying that I think his amendment \nis an improvement to the legislation.\n  But what I am trying to find out is whether or not this language \ncontemplates a reconciliation bill. And in one instance under the \nsection 5 definition, it reads: ``The term `authorization measure'''--\nwhich includes a reconciliation bill--``means any measure other than an \nappropriations measure that contains a provision providing direct \nspending or targeted tax benefits.'' That would indeed include a \nreconciliation bill.\n  I think Senators ought to be aware of that when they vote on this \nsubstitute. It is not just talking about appropriations bills. It is \ntalking about reconciliation bills as well. And Senators need to \nunderstand that the language \n[[Page S4336]]  of the amendment by Mr. Abraham instructs that the \nbill--the whole reconciliation bill--must be disaggregated if there is \none item in it, one provision, that provides for direct spending or \ntargeted tax benefits. The whole bill then must be broken down into \nseveral hundred, or perhaps thousands of separate ``billettes.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I apologize if I did not directly respond to his \nquestion. On March 22, there was a letter sent in to the Honorable Tom \nDaschle, James Exon, and John Glenn in response to a letter that was \nsent to the majority leader and it had a series of 11 questions. The \nlast question, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, stated:\n\n       Finally, would the veto authority provided in the amendment \n     extend to reconciliation measures? The current Byrd rule \n     formulation appears to protect reconciliation titles that \n     meet the Budget Committee's savings instruction, even if the \n     titles contain the deficit increasing measures. Would this \n     bill change that approach?\n\n  Does that get to the question that the Senator from West Virginia is \nasking?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not sure that it does. Will the Senator be kind enough \nto read that again?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It says,\n\n       Would the veto authority provided in the amendment extend \n     to reconciliation measures? The current Byrd rule formulation \n     appears to protect reconciliation titles that meet the Budget \n     Committee's savings instruction, even if the titles contain \n     the deficit increasing measures. Would this bill change that \n     approach?\n\n  I believe that might be the question. Fundamentally, the amendment of \nthe Senator from Michigan basically calls for just an added step in the \nprocedure. But it would not change the fundamental question about a \nreconciliation bill. Is that an accurate description of what is in the \nmind of the Senator from West Virginia as to the impact of the \namendment from the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not sure it is. My next question was, if the Senator \nsees any impact, what impact does this legislation have on the Byrd \nrule?\n  Mr. McCAIN. ``The pending line-item veto bill applies to \nreconciliation bills only if the reconciliation bill includes new \ndirect spending for a new targeted tax benefit provisions,'' as I have \nstated before. It goes on to say,\n\n       The line-item veto bill is independent of the Budget Act \n     and does not change the application of section 313 of the \n     Budget Act the Byrd rule to reconciliation bills. Compliance \n     with the Byrd rule, section 313 of the Budget Act, or the \n     budget resolutions reconciliation instructions, do not \n     protect the reconciliation bill from separate enrollment. \n     Just as appropriations bills are subject to the line-item \n     veto procedures, even if they comply with the Budget Act, \n     statutory caps, and the budget resolution's budget \n     allocations, reconciliation bills are subject to the line-\n     item veto procedures even if they comply with the budget \n     resolution's reconciliation directives and the Byrd rule.\n\n  In other words, what I think the Senator from West Virginia is \ngetting at--and I am hesitant, obviously, to try to articulate what he \ndoes far better than I do--is that a reconciliation bill is an attempt \nby the Congress to balance certain competing priorities.\n  What the Senator from West Virginia is concerned about is, if you \ntake out part of that, then it destroys the intent of the \nreconciliation process. I do believe that that would probably be one of \nthe impacts if the line-item veto were misused by a President of the \nUnited States.\n  But I would find it very difficult to believe that Congress would not \noverride a President who would abuse his authority in that fashion. But \nif that is the point the Senator is trying to make, I think that \nanswers it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I believe that we are \nfocusing on one and the same object now. I would not, however, have \nthat much faith in any President, that he might not veto items that \nwould result in an imbalance of the reconciliation measure.\n  Another question that I have: I note that the distinguished Senator's \namendment provides for 1 hour of debate--not to exceed 1 hour--and \nthat, of course, can be further limited. Suppose that it is discovered \nafter the enrolling clerk has disaggregated the entire bill--remember, \nit must be disaggregated, and each item is to be assigned a new bill \nnumber. Suppose it is found that the enrolling clerk has made some \nerrors,\n and that is certainly not entirely out of the question. We all make \nerrors.\n\n  I note that there could be no motion to recommit, it is not in order \nto reconsider the vote, and there must be an up or down vote then on \nthe matter; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. What do we do in instances where the enrolling clerk has \nmade errors in the enrolling of the billettes? Will we have any way to \nmake the corrections or are we left with no choice?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I might respond to the Senator, as the Senator from \nWest Virginia well knows, at the beginning of every session, there is \nan authorization passed for the enrolling clerk to make ``technical \ncorrections.'' Those technical corrections many times, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia well knows, are pretty interesting. Sometimes we \nhave amendments that are written on the back of an envelope and the \ninstructions to the enrolling clerk are, ``At the proper place shall be \ninserted.'' It is very standard at the end of the passage of a bill \nthat staff and others will make technical corrections to bring the bill \ninto proper legislative language.\n  I believe that if the enrolling clerk had made a mistake and it came \nto light that he or she did that, then that would fall under the \ntechnical corrections aspect of the rules of the Senate that are \nadopted each session.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it seems to me that the Senate ought to have \nthe opportunity to make corrections or to order corrections if such are \nfound in the many hundreds of bills that result from the enrolling \nclerk's action, yet, the Senate would be deprived of the ability to do \nso. Which all goes to the point that this is a measure that has been \nbrought to the Senate in a hurry.\n  The legislation was introduced in the Senate on Monday of this week \nby the distinguished majority leader. As far as I know, there was no \ninput into it by the minority--none--and immediately a cloture motion \nwas offered.\n  There was no committee report. There had been no committee hearings. \nIf there were committee hearings, I know of none. They certainly have \nnot been printed and placed on the desks.\n  But here is a wide-ranging, far-reaching piece of legislation that is \nbeing rammed through the Senate without enough time to carefully \nexplore and probe and scrutinize and study and debate and question the \nvarious provisions that are in the bill.\n  I think it is fortunate that the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nwho has offered this amendment, has had an opportunity to at least get \nthe amendment in before we finally vote on the bill. It certainly, as I \nhave already indicated, is an improvement over the legislation that was \nordered.\n  Now, there may be other improvements needed. But we are going to be \nexpected to vote on this legislation by no later than Friday.\n  I do not know what will happen to this measure in conference. It will \ncertainly undergo or can undergo many changes in conference. The House \nmay hold out for the version of the bill that passed that body. What we \nget back from conference may be a blending of the two measures, or it \nmay be one or the other, or it may not have a great resemblance to \neither.\n  I think it is unfortunate that the situation has developed whereby we \ncannot take more time and study and amend. This is an instance in which \nthere is an effort to clarify and treat one of the rather glaring flaws \nin the legislation. I compliment the Senator on his offering of the \namendment. I think that much has to be said for taking some time to \nexamine the measure and debate it. But I still think that the \nlegislation has many problems.\n  I hope that Senators will take a look at the Record and questions \nthat have been raised today about this amendment. And there may be \nother questions that will occur to other Senators. I doubt that I have \nexplored this matter to its fullest extent. But I hope it will cause \nother Senators to at least have a better understanding of what we are \nabout to pass here.\n   [[Page S4337]] This is going to be a first-class mess, where we \nbreak down the bill into hundreds of little bills and have them \nenrolled by the clerk of the originating body. They do not go through \nthe usual procedures of having each bill or joint resolution read three \ntimes. We do not, indeed, debate each of the bills or have an \nopportunity to amend each of the little billettes.\n  And when they are vetoed by the President, as many as may be vetoed \nby the President, is it the opinion of those who are managing the bill \nthat the several billettes that are vetoed by the President, will they \ncome back to the Congress all at once within a 10-day period, or will \nsome come the first day, some the second day, some the third day? And \nif there are three or four appropriations bills that happen to hit the \nSenate and the House for passage and are sent to the President about \nthe same time, will the originating body be expected to vote on each of \nthese little vetoed measures, or will the originating body have an \nopportunity to collect them, put them into one package to be overridden \nor not?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from West \nVirginia that, first of all, as to how those bills might come over, as \nthe Senator knows, the President has a certain number of days in order \nto consider a veto, so it would be strictly up to the President as to \nhow he would want to do that. He might want to send some over early and \nsome over later on. Of course, as the Senator knows, since each, as he \ncalls them, ``billettes'' are viewed as a separate bill, they would be \nconsidered separately by the originating body.\n  I would like to make one additional comment about the problem if the \nenrolling clerk made a mistake. I would remind the Senator, as he well \nknows, it happens from time to time around here that the enrolling \nclerk makes an error. By concurrent resolution we correct those \ntechnical errors in both Houses, and I envision we could do that.\n  I think, again--and I hesitate to put words into the mouth of the \nmost knowledgeable person in the Senate on these issues--I think the \nargument of the Senator from West Virginia is that if they came over in \ncertain ways, separate or staggered, then perhaps the body that has to \nconsider them would be deprived of the ability of considering them as a \nwhole, as they did on the initial passage of the bill.\n  I think that, again, is a valid concern. But I would also hope that \nin coordination with the President of the United States, he would \ninform those bodies as to which bills he was going to veto and in what \ncontext. I think the communications are good between here and 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Again, as the Senator from West Virginia did yesterday, those are \nvalid concerns that I think need to be addressed, and I also believe \nthat this kind of exposition of these aspects of the bill is very \nimportant for the record as far as the illumination of our colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. I like to believe, too, that this kind of debate is \ninformative and illuminating and helpful. I think it does generate \nadditional thinking, which in turn may generate some additional \namendments if such could be offered. I suppose the list has now been \ncompleted.\n  But in any event, it seems to me it is going to be a massive \nundertaking for the enrolling clerks. They have not been accustomed to \nanything like this, I do not believe. The idea of breaking down, for \nexample, the bill that I mentioned yesterday, energy-water bill, \nbreaking that down into 2,000 pieces, and each of the other 12 \nappropriations bills--which include the legislative branch, I assume, \nso the President could have an opportunity to line item out some parts \nof the legislative appropriation bill that either or both bodies might \njealously want to guard. This is quite a load to put on the enrolling \nclerks. In all of the 13 appropriation bills, as I indicated yesterday, \nmy staff estimated something like 10,000 little billettes that would \naccrue from the disaggregation of the 13 fiscal year 1995 \nappropriations bills. Now, that is quite an additional burden over and \nabove what the enrolling clerks, I think, usually have to contend with.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow me to make a response to that, \neven if it is not totally adequate?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I went down to see the \nenrolling clerk here in the Senate, who is equipped with a computer \nsystem which basically cranks these things out about every 30 seconds. \nThe computer can be programmed in such fashion.\n  I do agree with the Senator from West Virginia that this does \nincrease the legislative load considerably. From my perspective--and I \nknow it is not the perspective of the Senator from West Virginia--what \nI am exactly seeking is separate bills that can be examined separately \nso that there is no doubt as to what the Congress of the United States \nhas passed.\n  Again, I know that the Senator from West Virginia does not agree with \nthis viewpoint because we have had many hours of debate on this very \nissue. I believe that one of the problems is that we pass these massive \nbills which perhaps only the Senator from West Virginia is thoroughly \nfamiliar with and the rest of the body is not.\n  What happens is, we find--all too often, in my opinion--that we pass \nan appropriations bill, especially, and many times an authorization \nbill or even a reconciliation bill, and tucked away somewhere in there \nis--or a tax bill. I think the Senator from West Virginia would agree \nthat some of the most egregious offenses as far as special interests \nare concerned occur in the consideration and passage of tax bills \naround here. There are items that are tucked in there that we do not \nknow about, and weeks, months or years may pass by before the American \npeople and we as a body who have passed this legislation are aware of \nit.\n  I certainly understand what the Senator is saying about the large \namount of paperwork, but at the same time, we are also trying to cure \nwhat many Americans believe is an unhealthy habit of putting things \ninto bills--though they be authorization, or in the case of new \nentitlements, et cetera, or appropriations bills or tax bills--that are \nnot for the good of all Americans but are for the good of special \ninterests.\n  Now, whether that is actually true or not, the opinion of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is obviously different from mine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think there is undoubtedly a great deal of \ntruth in what the Senator is saying. No question of that.\n  I personally favor the approach that is envisioned in the substitute \nthat is being offered by Mr. Daschle, the distinguished minority \nleader. I intend to vote for something along that line.\n  I do not see in the original Domenici-Exon approach a shifting of \npower from the legislative branch to the executive branch. I do see in \nthe Domenici-Exon approach which has been built upon by the \ndistinguished majority leader in his substitute, I do see an \nopportunity for the President to register his opinion by rescinding \ncertain items in appropriation and having a vote up or down on those \nitems that he proposes to rescind.\n  It is a majority vote, that is true, and I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona prefers a two-thirds supermajority. But I favor \nthat approach. I have no problem with giving the President another \nopportunity to select from appropriation bills certain items which he \nfeels, for his reasons, whatever they may be, they may be political or \nfor whatever reasons, I have no problem with his sending them to the \ntwo Houses and our giving him a vote.\n  I see in this, I say to the Senator, I see a shifting of the \nlegislative power to the Executive. I think that power over the purse \nis so clearly vested in the legislative branch by the Constitution that \nwe ought to be hesitant to enact legislation the effect of which will \nbe to expand the President's powers. There is no question but the \nPresident's powers are somewhat expanded. To that extent, whatever the \nexpansion of the President's powers are, the powers of the legislative \nbranch are thereby decreased.\n  I also, as I said yesterday, am concerned about the breaking down of \nthe balance between the two Houses under any of these measures which we \nare likely to pass.\n   [[Page S4338]] I hope the measure that the distinguished minority \nleader introduces will be the one that will pass, but that remains to \nbe seen. I kind of have my doubts. But under the other measures, it \nseems to me that the Senate, to a considerable extent, loses. It no \nlonger remains an equal partner in the decision.\n  The Senator well knows that the Senate adds a lot of amendments to \nappropriation bills, and those amendments, when they are enrolled \nseparately, they go to the President. The President vetoes them. They \nactually originated in this body. But if they are vetoed, they are \ngoing to be sent back to the other body, and the other body will have \nthe option of trying to override or not trying to override. If the \nother body chooses not to attempt to override, then the Senate has no \nvoice at all. So to that extent I think the Senate is subordinated to \nthe other body.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I respond without interrupting?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes; I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sure the Senator from West Virginia will let me know \nwhen I am interrupting.\n  On the first point that the Senator from West Virginia makes about \nthe majority versus two-thirds, I, first of all, have engaged in that \ndebate with the Senator from West Virginia. But I also think that if we \nare going to call it, if it is going to be a veto by the President, \nthat the Constitution is clear on what a veto is--a two-thirds \nmajority. So I would even have a constitutional problem with the \nmajority override.\n  My second response is that it only took a majority of both Houses to \nput the measure into one of these bills, so it seems to me it would not \nbe very difficult to get a majority of both Houses to override that \nveto.\n  Now, I understand the argument that if a bill were given, under this \nscenario, the light of day and it was improper, then a majority of both \nbodies would probably not support such a thing, if it were wasteful or \nirrelevant. But I am not so sure of that. I think that it would be much \nmore appropriate for a two-thirds override.\n  When the distinguished Senator from West Virginia talks about a shift \nin power, which was what he spoke about initially, I know that the \nSenator from West Virginia knows, because he was one of the few who was \naround here when the President of the United States had basically \nimpoundment authority, when the President of the United States \nbasically could say, ``I don't care what the Congress of the United \nStates appropriates. I'm not going to spend that money.''\n  That, as the Senator well knows, goes back to Thomas Jefferson, in \n1801, who impounded $50,000 that was appropriated for gunboats.\n  So it is my view, as I have stated to the Senator from West Virginia \nmany times in the past, that when that impoundment act power \ndisappeared, there was that shift, a significant shift from the \nexecutive to the legislative branch and consequently, in my opinion--\nand I know it is not shared by the Senator from West Virginia--the \nrevenues and expenditures began to grow apart in a rather dramatic \nfashion.\n  Mr. BYRD. When was this?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In 1974.\n  Mr. BYRD. They actually started the big increase in 1981 after the \nelection of Mr. Reagan. That is when the precipitous increases began.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do have a chart I think that shows a very steady \nincrease. And I can bring it out. I think it is a valid chart.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have seen it. I think it is an excellent chart. I think \nhe very adroitly and expertly----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Describes it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I just finally respond to the aspect as far as which \nHouse might have some advantage.\n  Again, I think there is some validity to that argument. I think our \nFounding Fathers said that all revenue bills would begin with the other \nbody. And although we are obviously allowed to amend those bills, the \nprimary responsibility was placed in the other body, as responsibility \nfor approval of treaties, confirmation of nominees, et cetera, was \ndifferent. So the responsibility in the view of our Founding Fathers \ndid lie in the other body, in my view.\n  And also, if there are amendments that are passed on this side and \nattached to the bill, they are accepted in conference, I believe that \nthat acceptance in conference puts the stamp of approval on both \nbodies.\n  Now, in reality would a vote in the other body be as fervent or as \ncommitted to an amendment that originated in this body? Perhaps not. \nBut I would also suggest that it would be a quick way of retaliation if \nthey started doing that in the other body. Even though it originated \nthere, it would still have to come here, and there might be less \nenthusiasm for overriding the President's veto when those that \noriginated in that body got over here. So it is my view that it would \nprobably balance out in the long run.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I am not so sure progress is always \nthe end result when retaliation is taken by one body against another. \nThat works both ways. And the first thing we know the other body \nretaliates.\n  With respect to the approach that is being utilized by Mr. Daschle \nand which was envisioned in S. 14, I believe it was, that did not \ncontemplate a veto. That contemplated the rescissions of items by the \nPresident, and it was not a matter of overriding rescissions by two-\nthirds vote. It was a matter of rejecting the proposed rescissions by a \nmajority vote.\n  On an override of the veto, I agree, that should be a two-thirds \nvote.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. One final point and then I am going to yield because \nSenator Glenn is waiting.\n  The other point I wish to make here is that under this proposal, \nunder this substitute whereby each subsection, paragraph, item, \nallocation, suballocation, and all these things are enrolled \nseparately, will it not be possible for the President to strike a \nsection or a paragraph that imposes a condition on the expenditure of \ncertain sums?\n  Suppose we appropriate certain amounts of money to the Department of \nDefense with a condition that it not send troops to Somalia, or that if \ntroops are sent to Somalia the Senate and House decide that there \nshould be a condition included that they be withdrawn no later than 60 \ndays. Would it not be possible for the President simply to strike the \ncondition and leave in the amounts, thereby deciding policy which would \nnot have as its purpose the saving of moneys or the reduction of the \ndeficit? Would we not be handing the President a policymaking tool \nwhich would be exceedingly difficult for us to correct if he chose to \nline item out that condition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my colleague from West Virginia that that would \nnot be possible. What the Senator is referring to is what we normally \ncall fencing language, which is commonplace. The money would stay with \nthe fencing language. He could not veto out the money and leave the \nlanguage in, or vice versa. They would be attached to one another. And \nthat will be clarified.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his response. I feel I must \ndisagree with him. I am sure the Congress could so provide the language \nthat they would stay together, but Congress could also provide the \nlanguage in such a way that would make it possible for the President to \nstrike out the conditioning, the conditioning proviso, I believe. And \nthat gives me cause for concern.\n  I have no desire to keep the floor any longer. I thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I thank the Senator who is the author of the amendment.\n  I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 405 to Amendment No. 347\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the evaluation and sunset of tax expenditures)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       [[Page S4339]] The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 405 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . EVALUATION AND SUNSET OF TAX EXPENDITURES\n\n       (a) Legislation for Sunsetting Tax Expenditures.--The \n     President shall submit legislation for the periodic review, \n     reauthorization, and sunset of tax expenditures with his \n     fiscal year 1997 budget.\n       (b) Budget Contents and Submission to Congress.--Section \n     1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding \n     at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(30) beginning with fiscal year 1999, a Federal \n     Government performance plan for measuring the overall \n     effectiveness of tax expenditures, including a schedule for \n     periodically assessing the effects of specific tax \n     expenditures in achieving performance goals.''.\n       (c) Pilot Projects.--Section 1118(c) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended by--\n       (1) striking ``and'' after the semicolon in paragraph (2);\n       (2) redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and\n       (3) adding after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) describe the framework to be utilized by the director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget, after consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Comptroller General \n     of the United States, and the Joint Committee on Taxation, \n     for undertaking periodic analyses of the effects of tax \n     expenditures in achieving performance goals and the \n     relationship between tax expenditures and spending programs; \n     and''.\n       (d) Congressional Budget Act.--Title IV of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following:\n\n\n                           ``TAX EXPENDITURES\n\n       ``Sec. 409. It shall not be in order in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     contains a tax expenditure unless the bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report provides that the tax \n     expenditure will terminate not later than 10 years after the \n     date of enactment of the tax expenditure.''.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I believe this amendment has been \naccepted, cleared on both sides. It has three major parts. It requires \nthe President in next year's budget to submit legislation for an \norderly sunset or reconsideration of existing tax expenditures; No. 2, \nit requires the administration to conduct performance reviews of tax \nexpenditures just as they do now with regular discretionary spending; \nand three, it makes it out of order to consider a new tax expenditure \nif it does not consider a sunset or reconsideration, of course before \nthat sunset time.\n  The amendment will increase scrutiny of tax expenditures and help \nmake the line-item veto more effective.\n  I am happy that the Dole substitute to S. 4 provides the President \nwith the authority to item veto some new tax breaks. There seems to be \nsome disagreement about the scope of authority under the current \nlanguage. I believe that it should be interpreted quite broadly.\n  However, regardless of how broadly you read the language, it still \ndoes not include the $453 billion in existing tax expenditures which \nstill remain off limits. Now if you divide up the budget pie, tax \nexpenditures are a huge slice.\n  Tax expenditures are growing at a rate six times faster than \ndiscretionary spending. And unlike discretionary spending, these tax \nexpenditures generally do not receive regular scrutiny. Since the first \ncorporate tax law of 1909, special provisions have been placed in the \nCode and generally forgotten. In fact, many would be surprised to learn \nthat nearly half of the revenue losses from these expenditures stem \nfrom provisions placed in the Code before 1920.\n  I do not believe that all of these expenditures are unnecessary. In \nfact, I support many of them. But I believe that--after some of them \nhave been in the Code for the better part of a century--it is time we \nset up a review process to determine whether budget savings and program \nimprovements are achievable.\n  My amendment utilizes a concept that we have mandated for \ndiscretionary spending--performance review. It would require the \nPresident to determine just how well these programs are achieving their \ngoals. Are we getting our money's worth? We have spent a lot of time \ntalking about instituting cost-benefit analyses for Federal \nregulations. Would it not make sense to have a similar process for \nprograms that cost $453 billion this year.\n  This was first suggested in Governmental Affairs Committee report \nlanguage that accompanied the Government Performance and Results Act of \n1993. the distinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs, the \nsenior Senator from Delaware, was the father of that important law \nwhich for the first time established measurable objectives for agency \nprograms. My amendment codifies report language of that bill to include \nexpenditures.\n  While providing a better understanding of the effectiveness of \ncurrent tax expenditures, it will also help the President to determine \nwhen it may be advisable to item veto new tax expenditures and even new \nspending. Under performance review, the President will be able to \nbetter identify where current tax expenditures overlap or duplicate \nnewly proposed tax expenditures. And it will help him to identify \nwhether new spending programs are unnecessary because existing tax \nexpenditures are adequately achieving the same policy goals.\n  My amendment also requires the President to submit legislation to \nCongress which lays out an orderly schedule for the sunset and \nreauthorization of current tax expenditures. Just because something was \nplaced in the code at the beginning of the century does not mean that \nit should be exempt from any congressional review. We might be \nsurprised with what we find if we are forced to sit down and \nreauthorize many of these programs.\n  The President would not have to propose the sunset off all tax \nexpenditures. There may be some that he will suggest remain permanent. \nBut it will provide us with a roadmap for more comprehensive \ncongressional review of tax expenditures. The tax expenditures that the \nCongress determines should come under a reauthorization process, will \nalso be subject to the President's veto pen in the future.\n  In addition, under my amendment, it would be out of order to consider \nnew tax expenditures that did not include a sunset date at least within \n10 years. I don't think we should go through another century before the \ntaxes we enact today are reviewed.\n  I think this merely sets forth a good Government approach on tax \nexpenditures. It is high time we shed some light on this area of the \nbudget. I understand that my amendment has been cleared by both the \nminority and majority leaders and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Madam President, I think it has been accepted on the other side. I \nask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Arizona, if he has any \ncomments? I would be prepared to urge the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we are prepared to accept the amendment \non this side. I think it is a good amendment and one which I think will \nbe very helpful.\n  Madam President, may I say for the information of all Senators, I \nhave been asked by the majority leader to state there will be no \nfurther votes today. However, I hope Members who have amendments will \nremain this evening to offer them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio for \noffering the amendment. The amendment provides for a process for \nperiodically assessing the effects of tax loopholes and requires that \nall new loopholes have sunset provisions.\n  As I understand it, the language of his amendment has been \nnegotiated, it has been agreed to on both sides. I urge its adoption at \nthis time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I urge the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 405) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  [[Page S4340]] Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 406 to Amendment No. 347\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify the definition of items of appropriations)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Murkowski and Mr. Exon, proposes an amendment numbered 406 to \n     amendment No. 347.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 5(4)(A), strike ``; and'' and add the \n     following: ``but shall not include a provision which does not \n     appropriate funds, direct the President to expend funds for \n     any specific project, or create an express or implied \n     obligation to expend funds and--\n       ``(i) rescinds or cancels existing budget authority;\n       ``(ii) only limits, conditions, or otherwise restricts the \n     President's authority to spend otherwise appropriated funds; \n     or\n       ``(iii) conditions on an item of appropriation not \n     involving a positive allocation of funds by explicitly \n     prohibiting the use of any funds; and''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, under the substitute before us, the line-\nitem veto authority is not limited to appropriations. That may come as \na surprise to many of us, but that is the way the substitute is now \nworded. The line-item authority in the substitute, which is effectively \ngiven to the President, is not limited to appropriations. That is \nbecause a line item in an appropriations bill would be separately \nenrolled and would be subject to a veto. That would include not only \nthe appropriations themselves but also all limits on appropriations, \nconditions on appropriations, rescissions of appropriations. They would \nall be treated in the same way as appropriations themselves. The \npurpose of this bill is to try to reduce the add-ons of Congress that \ncannot in some minds be justified. The purpose of the bill is to reduce \nspending, not to increase spending. But if we treat limits on \nappropriations and rescissions of appropriations in the same way as we \ntreat appropriations which are added by the Congress, we are \neffectively going to be increasing spending and not reducing spending.\n  The rescissions that the Congress adds and puts into an \nappropriations bill, the limitations on appropriations that we put in \nappropriations bills, the conditions that we place on appropriations \nare all going to be treated as separate items from the appropriations \nthemselves. This process in the substitute is going to splinter the \ncondition on an appropriation into a separate bill. It will not be in \nthe same bill as the appropriations. So the President would be able to \nveto the limit on the appropriation and leave the appropriation itself \nthereby saving no money, indeed quite the opposite frequently, and \ngiving himself more authority in the process.\n  If the President can veto the limitations and the conditions placed \non appropriations without vetoing the appropriations itself, we have \nhad the exact opposite effect, I believe, of what was intended by this \nbill,\n and we have ceded great power to the President, without any gain, in \nterms of cutting spending. He can veto a rescission that we add to a \nbill and spend the money. He can veto a limitation on spending that we \nput in the bill and spend all the money.\n\n  Why should we give this special veto authority to the President when \nthe provisions of the bill that he would be vetoing cut spending \ninstead of adding to spending?\n  Let me give some examples. Suppose we put in a provision, as we have, \nwhich states that none of the funds appropriated shall be spent to keep \nAmerican troops in a particular country after a specified date? The \nPresident can veto that provision and then continue to spend the \nappropriated funds for the purpose that Congress voted to prohibit. \nSuppose we put a provision into a bill, as we have, which says none of \nthe funds in the foregoing paragraph shall be available to promote the \nsale of tobacco or tobacco products? The President could veto that \nrestriction and limitation and spend the money as he pleases, for the \nprohibited purpose. We would not have saved any money, but the \nPresident would be given the power to spend money for a purpose that we \nexplicitly prohibited--no savings to the Treasury and loss of \ncongressional authority at the same time. Suppose we put a provision \ninto a bill, as we have, stating that none of the funds appropriated \nshall be spent to provide an incentive for the purpose of inducing a \ncompany to relocate outside the United States? The President could veto \nthe provision and continue to spend money on the program that Congress \nintended to prohibit.\n  Say we put a provision into a bill, as we have, which says that of \nthe large appropriation, no more than x-million dollars can be spent on \nconsultants? We put a lot of provisions in like that. The Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, has been a leader to limit appropriated funds \nspent on consultants. The way the bill is currently written, without \nthis amendment, the President could veto that limit on spending for \nconsultants and then use the larger amount for any purpose he wanted, \nincluding all the money, if he wanted, for consultants. We will not \nhave saved any money. We will have lost the power to restrict the \nspending of money, with no gain to the Treasury.\n  We have put restrictions on entertainment. We have put restrictions \non travel, first-class travel. And if, again, those restrictions are \nput in separate bills, as they are under the current version of this \nsubstitute, and the President can veto those restrictions, the Treasury \ngains nothing, the taxpayers are out money that we did not want them to \nbe out, for instance, for first-class travel, and we will have lost the \npower of the purse, for no gain to the Treasury.\n  As I said, Madam President, almost more remarkable than the power \nthat would be yielded to the President under the version before us, \nwithout this amendment, is the fact that there would be no purpose \nserved in terms of saving money. And in the many cases I have given, \nand in many other cases, as a matter of fact, we would be losing and \nspending money that otherwise would not be spent.\n  Last night on the floor, I gave a few examples from a real \nappropriations bill--State, Commerce, and Justice. I want to give one \nof those examples again to show how this would work since I did bring \nthis up on the floor last night.\n  We had a provision in last year's appropriation bill for State, \nCommerce, Justice, that no more than $11 million would be spent on \nfurniture and furnishings related to new space alteration and \nconstruction projects. That is a limitation on spending. That says the \nPresident cannot spend more than that. That is part of a larger \nappropriations bill, a $2.3 billion appropriations bill. But it says \nthat out of that $2.3 billion, the maximum that can be spent for that \nnew furniture is $11 million. I had a chart up here on the floor last \nnight. If the President could veto the ``not to exceed $11 million,'' \nwhich would be in a separate enrolled bill, he would have then vetoed \nthe restriction on the spending, leaving himself the $2.3 billion \nappropriation of which he could spend all he wanted on furniture, \nwithout any limit. We would not have saved the money. It would have \nbeen spent on something we did not want it to be spent on. The Treasury \ndoes not gain a dime, but instead, something that we did not want \nbecause we did not think it was a high enough priority, would happen.\n  The Defense supplemental appropriations bill that we passed just last \nweek contained 20 separate paragraphs of Defense rescissions and 18 \nparagraphs of rescissions of nondefense funds, for a total of roughly \n$3 billion in spending cuts. This was in an appropriations bill, but \nthese are spending cuts, rescissions. For instance, the bill contained \nprovisions that would cut spending for \n[[Page S4341]]  FAA facilities by $35 million. It cut spending for \nhighway projects by $140 million. But under the substitute before us, \nunless this amendment is adopted, each of these provisions would be \nenrolled as a separate bill and sent to the President for signature. \nEach could be vetoed by the President, and if he exercised that \nauthority given to him by the substitute, the result would be more \nGovernment spending rather than less.\n  Madam President, the amendment which I have sent to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, and Senators Murkowski and Exon, addresses this issue \nthe best that we can in this bill. In my opinion, it can be addressed \nfar better in an expedited or enhanced rescission bill. But that is not \nthe issue before us. The issue before us is this substitute which, in \nall likelihood, is going to pass. We should avoid having in this \nsubstitute language which I believe has the unintended consequence of \neliminating all of the restrictions and the limits on spending, and the \nrescissions of spending that we put in appropriations bills.\n  So while I do not think that all of the problems I see in the \nsubstitute are cured, at least this would prevent the President from \nusing this separate enrollment power to increase spending, or to avoid \ncongressional restrictions and limitations on spending. And it is my \nhope that this amendment will be adopted because, again, I think it \ndoes address some of the unintended consequences of this substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 407 to Amendment No. 347\n\n (Purpose: To exempt items of appropriation provided for the judicial \n    branch from enrollment in separate bills for presentment to the \n                               President)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for himself, Mr. Roth, \n     Mr. Heflin, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     407 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 21, after ``separately'' insert ``, except \n     for items of appropriation provided for the judicial branch, \n     which shall be enrolled together in a single measure. For \n     purposes of this paragraph, the term `items of appropriation \n     provided for the judicial branch' means only those functions \n     and expenditures that are currently included in the \n     appropriations accounts of the judiciary, as those accounts \n     are listed and described in the Department of Commerce, \n     Justice and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1995 (Public Law 104-317).\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as I understand it, I now have that \namendment pending, and it can be set-aside and we will vote on it \ntomorrow sometime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 406 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, and the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, on working out this, I think, very important agreement. It \nis well thought out. The amendment reaffirms that any and all provisos \nor fencing language, including all limitations on spending, such as \ncaps, be tied to dollar amounts and not be enrolled freestanding.\n  The bill, as currently drafted, would not cause policy provisos to be \nseparately enrolled. However, if the Congress were to place caps on \nspending within an allocation, such language might be separately \nenrolled. This amendment clarifies that it would not. It is a good \namendment and we are prepared to accept it on this side.\n  I understand from my friend from Michigan that there may be concern \nby a Member or Members on his side of the aisle. So we will not seek \nits adoption until such time as it is either resolved or those who are \nin disagreement call for further debate and ensuing vote.\n  But again, I want to say to the Senator from Michigan--this is \nprobably not the appropriate time--whenever there is an issue, the \nSenator from Michigan goes into it in depth. He understands the \nlegislation. He find areas that need to be improved, and he is willing \nto reach accommodation with those who have similar but sometimes \nslightly differing views, as has just happened between Senator Levin \nand Senator Murkowski.\n  That is one of the reasons why it is a pleasure to work with him in \nthis body, as I have for many years on the Armed Services Committee and \non the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I believe there may be additional amendments by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader coming up, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me thank the Senator for his \ncomments, which are very reciprocal on my part in terms of working with \nhim over the years on the Armed Services Committee. We have had a very \ngood relationship. I thank him for the support of the amendment.\n  There is, indeed, as I mentioned, perhaps a Member on this side who \nmay oppose the amendment. We are not sure. We want to clarify that. It \nwould be better, therefore, that any vote on this be delayed until we \ncan ascertain whether there is objection on this side or not.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Levin in \noffering this amendment that would clarify the extent and scope of the \nPresident's ability to veto items in appropriations bills. This \namendments ensures that when Congress imposes a condition that prevents \nspending in a particular area, or imposes conditions on such spending, \nsuch a restriction will not be considered an item that can be \nseparately vetoed.\n  All of us recognize that approval of the Dole substitute line-item \nveto amendment or any other line-item veto proposal including S. 4, \nrepresents an historic shift of authority from Congress to the \nPresident. We are providing the President with very broad authority to \npick and choose which individual items in appropriations bills he deems \nan improper use of taxpayer funds. He will have the authority to veto \nthose items of spending that he disapproves of.\n  The substitute also gives the President authority to item veto \nauthority in spending authorization bills and in tax bills. However, \nthe only tax items that the President can item veto are a narrow range \nof provisions that affect only a limited group of taxpayers. More \nimportantly, the tax-item veto can only be used if the provision loses \nrevenue. A tax increase that targets a narrow class of taxpayers cannot \nbe item vetoed.\n  I believe the tax item veto represents an appropriate restrictions on \nthe President's ability to item veto because it is restricted to \nmeasures that lose revenue. The reason that I support the whole concept \nof the item-veto is that Congress has demonstrated an inability to \ncontrol spending both through the Tax Code and the appropriations \nprocess. Today we are more than $4.8 trillion in debt. Unless we take \ndrastic action, our national debt will double in the next 10 years.\n  Part of the reason our debt is nearly $5 trillion is because \nappropriators in both the House and Senate have devised ingenious ways \nto bury wasteful pork barrel spending in legislation designed to \nmaintain the operations of Government. Weeks and months after the \nPresident has signed an appropriations bill we learn that buried in the \nbill are tens of millions of dollars of wasteful spending programs. My \ncolleague from Arizona has already identified many of these wasteful \nspending programs. And under the current Presidential veto power, the \nPresident must approve these wasteful programs if he is to keep the \nGovernment running.\n  So the predicate, Madam President, for the line-item veto is to give \nthe President the authority to veto spending programs that waste the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  However, just as the President only should be able to veto tax \nprovisions \n[[Page S4342]]  that lose revenue, I believe the President should not \nbe\n permitted to item-veto congressional prohibitions on appropriations \nspending. As all Senators know, Congress routinely includes \nprohibitions on particular spending as a check on unrestricted and \narbitrary spending by the President. Most often, such prohibitions \nrepresent a conscious policy choice by Congress explicitly restricting \nthe President's discretion.\n\n  For example, last year's foreign operations appropriations bill \ncontains more than a dozen such restrictions. These restrictions \nprevent the President from providing money to an international \norganization that supports programs for ``coercive abortion or \ninvoluntary sterilization.'' Another provision prevents funds from \nbeing used for assistance to a country that is not in compliance with \nthe U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iraq.\n  These are just two of hundreds of examples of the legitimate power of \nthe Congress to prevent the President from spending money on programs \nand policies that the Congress disapproves of. These restrictions do \nnot increase the deficit. They do not represent pork barrel politics. \nThey are legitimate congressional checks on the President that are \nconsistent with the intent of the Founding Fathers when they created \nour constitutional system of separated powers and checks and balances.\n  Madam President, our amendment is intended to make clear that when \nCongress imposes a condition that prevents spending in a particular \narea, or conditions spending, that restriction will not be considered \nan item that can be separately vetoed. It ensures that a condition \nrestricting or prohibiting the use of funds must be enrolled with the \nitem of appropriation to which the condition applies.\n  Madam President, this amendment preserves congressional power to \nrestrict the President from acting contrary to the wishes of the \nmajority of Congress on important policy issues. I believe it is \nfundamentally necessary that we retain this authority and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Michigan. This amendment only makes good \nsense.\n  It would keep rescissions and cancellations of spending from being \ntransmitted to the Presidents as separate items. Thus it would make it \nmore difficult for the President to veto items that help to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  As well, the amendment would ensure that limitations on spending stay \ntogether with the spending provisions that they limit. To do otherwise \nwould allow the kind of nonsensical divisions of items that the Senator \nfrom Michigan so eloquently described yesterday evening.\n  I support the amendment and urge my colleagues to join in voting for \nit when it does come to a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from Utah, I \nask unanimous consent that he be added as an original cosponsor of the \nAbraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \npending Levin amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Hatch amendment will be \nset aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, both amendments will be set \naside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Hatch amendment, for purposes of \ncomplying with the unanimous-consent agreement, was presented and the \ndebate and vote will be held on it probably tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, our friend from Alaska has \nadditional materials which I would like to ask unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record, if available, tonight. If not, we will make that \nsame unanimous-consent request tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, if that is available tonight, it would \nbe inserted in the Record immediately following the remarks of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I wish to make some brief remarks with \nregard to support of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMichigan, but at this time I yield the floor because I believe Senator \nByrd would like to make some remarks not on the matter at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska, Mr. Exon.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4333-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4342-S4358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             SPRING RETURNS TO THE WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 2 days ago, the first day of spring \nofficially came to Washington. Here in Washington, the change from one \nseason to another is often dramatic. One morning, D.C. temperatures \nmight be in the freezing range, while the following day might find \nyoung men and women out on the Mall playing volleyball in shorts and \ntee shirts. Here, tulips and magnolias burst forth from nowhere, and \nthe cherry blossoms transform the city as if by overnight magic.\n  But a few miles west of us--among the peaks and plateaus of the high \nAppalachians in West Virginia, spring dawns like a beautiful young \nwoman awakening from a long sleep.\n  If the geologists are correct, spring has awakened in the same \nfashion in West Virginia for millions of years.\n  High on Alpine West Virginia ridges--once, we are told, the \nequivalent in altitude of some caps among the Himalayas today--crystal \nice and deep-packed snow begin their melt, the runoff seeking the sea \nfirst as droplets, then as rivulets, next as springs and brooks, then \nas creeks and streams, and finally as flooding branches that find their \nroutes either into the widening Potomac on the eastern slopes of the \nAlleghenies and the western sides of the Blue Ridge, or into the mighty \nOhio and Mississippi farther west--dependable flows of water of that \nhelped to create the shores of Tidewater Virginia and Maryland's \nEastern Shore through the millennia, on one hand, and that has built up \nthe Mississippi Delta since before the bison crossed into North \nAmerica, on the other hand.\n  But more subtle changes accompany spring's approach in West \nVirginia--changes too often observed only by the sparkling eyes of \nsquirrels and of the first adventurous rabbits out of their winter \nburrows--changes such as tiny blossoms in greening meadows, minuscule \nleaves emerging on bare maple branches, cardinals, and robins \nannouncing in concert the impending arrival of a new season, and \ngraceful deer grazing on tender blades of new grass--and all \nproclaiming the marvels of the Creator's bounty and brilliance.\n  Oh, to be a child once again in West Virginia--a child who, on his or \nher way to school in the cool of the morning air, can perhaps feast his \nor her senses on the dawning spring as most adults can no longer--a \nchild who catches the first perfume of cherry blossoms on young fruit \ntrees or who pauses to listen to the symphony of the songbirds or who \nsavors the gentle breezes on his or her cheek, where but days before \nthe cruel winter wind bit and chapped.\n  And soon, Mr. President, the mountains and hills of West Virginia \nwill again be enfolded in new foliage from base to summit, and the \nsunrises and sunsets will put even the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to \nshame with their incandescent colors and shafts of spun gold streaking \nacross the early morning and evening vault of the West Virginia \nfirmament.\n  There we may see,\n\n     The marigold that goes to bed wi' the Sun,\n     And with him rises weeping . . . daffodils,\n     That come before the swallow dares, and take\n     The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\n     But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\n     Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,\n     That die unmarried, ere they can behold\n     Bright Phoebus in his strength. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I invite all of our colleagues to visit West Virginia \nat any time, but particularly during this special season of rebirth \namong the mountains, down the valleys, and across the \n[[Page S4343]]  whole Appalachian Plateau. But if anybody accepts my \ninvitation, I suggest that they visit West Virginia in a recapturement \nof their childhood--with the open eyes and trusting heart of a child, \nwith the pure hearing of a child, and with the joy and wonder with \nwhich we were born--all of these things that permit children to listen, \nperceive, and relish the beauties and mysteries of life that the \nCreator shares every year with all of his offspring, but that, too \noften, as hardened and sometimes insensitive men and women, we lose the \ncapacity to enjoy, much less to appreciate.\n\n     The year's at the spring\n     And day's at the morn;\n     Morning's at seven;\n     The hillside's dew-pearled;\n     The lark's on the wing;\n     The snail's on the thorn:\n     God's in his heaven--\n     All's right with the world.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, if the Senator would withhold, I would \nlike to make a few remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I have listened with care in the last few \ndays to the debate on the so-called line-item veto. I have not heard \nall of it, but I have heard, I think, enough to understand the \nparameters we are talking about. And we are now debating the proposed \nsubstitute--the Separate Enrollment and Line-Item Veto Act of 1995.\n  The sponsors have claimed that this bill will provide the means to \nremove, among other things, a particular focus on what is known around \nthe country as pork-barrel spending from appropriations bills. The \nlanguage of the proposal, however, does not live up to the sponsors' \nclaims.\n  I am going to raise several questions tonight that I hope can be \nclarified or answered. Although the sponsors have aimed at certain \nexpenditures, as I see it, they have missed.\n  In fact, this proposal provides the President with significantly less \nauthority to control pork-barrel spending than would have been provided \nunder either the Domenici-Exon expedited rescission proposal or the \nMcCain enhanced rescission proposal.\n  Madam President, I see at least five serious problems with the \nproposed substitute. First, it contains loopholes so large that the \nproponents of pork will be able to insulate whole barrels of pork from \na Presidential veto if they choose to do so. Second, the separate \nenrollment procedures would allow the President to veto funding \nlimitations as well as funding amounts, which would inhibit the ability \nof Congress to address legitimate policy differences with the \nPresident.\n  Third, this proposal permits the President to increase, as well as \ndecrease spending, by allowing him to sign into law those portions of \nan appropriation bill that increase spending, and to veto those \nportions of an appropriation bill that rescind or reduce spending.\n  So, in other words, if a President chose to, under this authority, he \ncould take an appropriation bill that had been passed by the Congress \nand he could basically increase the amount in that appropriation bill \nby doing away or vetoing the rescissions in that bill that reduce \nfunding.\n  So just the opposite of what the sponsors have intended could occur. \nThis is just saying to the President, we think you are a whole lot \nbetter at this than we are, so we give you the authority. You make the \ndecisions--increase or decrease. You do whatever you want. I do not \nthink that is what is intended, but that is what the proposal does.\n  Fourth, the proposed substitute, if not undermined by the use of \nloopholes--and I do not assume that these loopholes would be used by \npeople with good faith, but I think that we have to assume that at some \npoint they will be--if not undermined by the loopholes, this substitute \nwill lead to what Senator Roth and the Republican members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee describe as ``undesirable rigidity'' in \nthe management of the executive branch and the legislative process.\n  Finally, the proposed substitute does nothing to enhance the ability \nof Congress to address the real problems here--that is, the legislative \npractices such as unauthorized appropriations, legislative earmarks, \nand adding items in conference even though they have not been approved \nby the House or the Senate.\n  Those are the abuses in the process. This proposal does nothing to \nget at those abuses. Those are the problems, but the target here has \nbeen missed.\n  Madam President, to place my concerns in context, I would like to \nbriefly summarize the current appropriations process. There are two \ntypes of documents that are produced by Congress in the appropriation \nprocess, and I really do not believe a whole lot of our Members \nunderstand this.\n  The first document is an appropriation bill which is passed by both \nHouses of Congress. It is signed into law by the President. Last year's \ndefense appropriation bill, for example, was 61 pages long. The bill is \nlegally binding upon the executive branch.\n  The second type of document is the reports issued by the \nappropriation committees and the House-Senate conferees. The three \nreports issued in connection with last year's defense bill are 853 \npages, covering over 2,300 different line items.\n  The policy directions in these reports is not binding on the \nexecutive branch. There is no requirement in law or Senate rule that an \nappropriation bill or report contain any specific level of detail. Most \nappropriation bills, particularly in the defense arena, set forth large \nlump-sum amounts that are not tied to specific programs, projects, or \nactivities.\n  Looking at an example from last year's Department of Defense \nAppropriation Act, the Act provides a specific sum for Army aircraft \nprocurement, $1,063,164,000. The text of the act does not require the \nArmy to spend that money on any particular type of aircraft.\n  The detail is set forth in the committee and conference reports which \nspecify the amounts for production or modification of a dozen different \ntypes of aircraft. Those report items are not legally binding on the \nDepartment of Defense. The Department, as a matter of law, can spend \nthat $1 billion on any type of army aircraft selected by the Army or \nthe Department of Defense, regardless of the types that are specified \nin the Appropriations Committee reports.\n  Any restrictions, earmarks, or other special conditions that are in \nthe committee report are not binding on the Department of Defense. As a \nmatter of comity and custom, the Department of Defense generally, but \nnot always, follows the guidance in the committee reports, but it is \nnot required to do so.\n  The Department of Defense routinely reprograms funds between various \nlines in the Appropriations Committee reports without any congressional \ninvolvement. Above certain thresholds, however, for example, operation \nand maintenance reprogrammings that exceed $20 million, there is a \ncustom of obtaining prior approval for reprogrammings from the \ncongressional defense committees.\n  That is, when they shift funds from one account to the other. In the \nDepartment of Defense this happens hundreds of times in a year because \nthere are certain programs that get behind schedule--they cannot be \ncompleted on time. Therefore, the money is not needed as originally \nanticipated. The money is needed somewhere else. They shift back and \nforth, back and forth. Over certain thresholds, they have to come back \nhere for informal approval.\n  There is nothing binding about reprogramming. They do not even have \nto come to us for reprogramming approval as a matter of law. That also \nis a matter of comity. Moreover, if Congress were to insist on such \nprior committee approvals, it would likely constitute an \nunconstitutional legislative veto.\n  In summary, Madam President, there is no requirement for an \nappropriation bill or report to contain any specific level of detail. \nAnd the material in the committee and conference reports is not legally \nbinding on the executive branch. Much--not all--but much of the pork, \nperhaps most, but at least much of the pork identified in the news \nmedia that we dwell on in here and that disturbs all members--and I \nknow the Senator from Arizona has been particularly vigilant in that \nrespect and I \n[[Page S4344]] think over the years I have, also--that pork, much of \nit, is not binding on the President but is spent as a matter of comity \nbetween the two branches.\n  I am often amused when Presidents are talking about how their hands \nare bound and they can not do certain things because of Congress, and a \nwhole lot of things they complain about are not binding on the \nPresidents of the United States.\n  As a matter of comity, if they disregarded the reports year in and \nyear out, they would be jeopardizing some of their own programs, but in \nmy opinion we have had several Presidents who have basically talked \nabout the line-item veto because they wanted to give the appearance \nthat they had to accept things beyond their control, when they knew \nthey had control, if they wanted to do something about it. Most of them \ndo not want to do anything about it because they want their own pet \nprojects.\n And it ends up being spent as a matter of comity between the two \nbranches of Government.\n\n  I know that is not going to change people's minds here, but that is \nthe way the system works. We need to understand that we are trying to \ncorrect something and we are shooting at a target that is not really a \ntarget.\n  In summary, Madam President, there is no requirement for an \nappropriation bill or report to contain any specific level of detail, \nand the material in committee and conference reports is not legally \nbinding on the executive branch. Much of the pork identified in the \nmedia is not binding on the President but is spent as a matter of \ncomity between the two branches.\n  Now, committee reports that explain legislative provisions are \nlegislative history, and they do have an effect. But what we are \ntalking about now is committee reports that talk about expenditures and \nhow that money would be spent, and that is not binding.\n  Madam President, with that background, I would like to turn to the \nloopholes in the proposed substitute. The supporters of the proposed \nsubstitute assert that it will require pork-barrel projects to be set \nforth in the text of appropriation bills and enrolled as separate \nenactments. There is no such requirement in the proposed substitute. As \ndrafted, the substitute merely provides that--I am quoting directly \nfrom it--``The committee on Appropriations of either the House or the \nSenate shall not report an appropriation measure that fails to contain \nsuch level of detail on the allocation of an item of appropriation \nproposed by that House as is set forth in the committee report \naccompanying such bill.''\n  The first defect is there is no requirement in current law, Senate \nrules, or the proposed substitute that the Appropriations Committee \nprovide any specific level of detail in the committee report. The \ncommittee report does not have to have any specific level of detail in \nit. So the very heart of this proposal ties it to details in the \ncommittee report, but the detail does not have to be in there. If we \nenact the proposed substitute, the Appropriations Committee, if they \nchoose to, can easily avoid a line-item veto by providing lump sum \nappropriations and then setting forth the detail in separate documents \nother than the committee report. These documents could include a floor \nstatement by the managers of the bill, an agreed joint statement of the \nmanagers of the conference which is placed in the Congressional Record \nin lieu of or in addition to the formal conference report, or a simple \nletter from the leadership of the committee to the head of an agency.\n  And I assume and I believe, based on previous practice and \nobservations, that within a year or two that will begin to happen.\n  In other words, there is no requirement that the committee report or \na conference report contain a specific level of detail. No line-item \ndetail is required, and there is no requirement that there be anything \nfor the President to veto beyond a lump sum appropriation.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Using the example I discussed earlier, the appropriation \nbill could simply provide $1 billion for army aircraft procurement. It \ncould set forth minimal descriptive material in the committee report \nand then provide all the details, including a pork-barrel earmark, in a \nfloor statement or a letter to the Department of Defense.\n  Alternatively, the committee could include all noncontroversial \nmaterials in the committee report and then address a pork-barrel \nearmark in a floor statement or letter to the DOD. In either case, Mr. \nPresident, the President of the United States under the proposed \nsubstitute would have nothing to veto except the big lump sum \nprocurement. That is all he would have to veto. He would not have the \ndetail in there.\n  The substitute appears to be based on the mistaken premise that the \nonly way Congress can earmark a pork-barrel project is through bill or \nreport language. Mr. President, that is naive and ignores both \nlegislative history and precedent. Unlike report language that \ninterprets a legislative provision, a line item in a committee report \nwhich sets forth a committee's policy direction on expenditures has no \nlegal standing. It has no more legal effect than a speech in the \nChamber, a letter from a committee, or a phone call from a committee \nchairman. Therefore, those who want to earmark or add pork do not need \nreport language. They can use any other form of communication to the \nexecutive branch.\n  The likely effect of the substitute will be to drive the pork into \nunderground shelters where it will be hidden from scrutiny. If the \nsubstitute is enacted, the really egregious earmarks no longer will be \nset forth in committee reports. The earmarks will be described in floor \nstatements, letters from committees, or even phone calls from committee \nchairmen to the heads of agencies. The proposed substitute will not \neliminate pork. It will drive it underground.\n  A related loophole is the failure of the substitute to cover floor \namendments. It is not unusual for an amendment to be offered in this \nChamber to increase a lump sum appropriation by a specified amount \nwithout stating the purpose in legislative language. The purpose is \noften set forth in the statement of a sponsor.\n  Under the proposed substitute, an amendment that increased a lump sum \nappropriation would not be enrolled as a separate bill even if the \nsponsor stated that the purpose of the increase was to earmark funds \nfor a pork-barrel project. Once the amendment is adopted by the Senate, \nthere is no requirement that the purpose of the amendment be discussed \neven in the conference report.\n  Mr. President, let us look at how a pork-barrel earmark would fare \nunder the proposed substitute as compared to how it would fare under \nthe Domenici-Exon expedited rescission bill or under the original \nMcCain bill.\n  Under the proposed substitute, if the earmark is set forth in a floor \nstatement or committee letter, there is no requirement that the item be \nset forth separately in the bill or separately enrolled. Unless the \nitem is set forth in the bill, the President could not veto it.\n  Under the Domenici-Exon expedited rescission proposal or under the \nMcCain original proposal, however, the President would not be limited \nto items expressly set forth in the bill. The President could propose \nrescission of a specified amount of money for a specified purpose. The \nPresident would be guaranteed a vote in the House and the Senate in a \nspecified period of time. That would not only serve as improvement in \nthe current law in the case of the Domenici-Exon proposal, but it would \nalso be a great improvement over the proposed substitute, which has \nenormous loopholes.\n  Ironically, the proposed substitute would enable the President to \nveto items that reflect legitimate policy differences between the \nPresident and the Congress. When we have major disagreements on matters \nof policy, we must express our requirements in legislation in order to \nensure that the President carries out the will of Congress.\n  Let us take, for example, an item that both of my colleagues in the \nChamber, the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Arizona, are \nvery familiar with, the V-22 aircraft. The 3sprey, or the V-22 \naircraft, has been a controversial item for several years. The V-22 has \nhad strong bipartisan support in the Congress, yet the Bush \nadministration wanted to cancel it. Congress insisted on authorizing \nand appropriating funds for the V-22 because we believed the funds were \ngenuinely \n[[Page S4345]] necessary for a strong national defense. We had to \ninclude specific legislative provisions to ensure that the program was \nnot canceled.\n  Under the proposed substitute, however, the President could have \nvetoed the V-22. He could have vetoed the strategic sealift program \nthat Congress initiated. He could have vetoed congressional increases \nfor weapons systems that had not been in the President's budget but \nwhich made a crucial difference in Operation Desert Storm, such as \nStealth fighters and the Patriot missile. He could have vetoed the $1 \nbillion LHD-6 ship that was added by the Congress even though it was \nnot in the President's budget. Many of our colleagues want to increase \nand restructure our missile defense program. That is another item ripe \nfor a Presidential veto under the proposed substitute.\n  The separate enrollment proposal allows the President to veto any \nparagraph of the appropriation bill. The proposal is not limited to \nprovisions containing pork-barrel earmarks. In fact, it is not limited \nto funding items. The proposal applies to any numbered section or any \nunnumbered paragraph.\n  That means the President can veto funding limitations as well as \nfunding amounts. In doing so, he could approve the appropriation bill \nbut he could veto conditions under which the appropriation was \nprovided.\n  The President, for example, could veto a provision such as section \n8135 of last year's appropriation bill. And I believe Senator Levin has \nbeen talking about that, the Senator from Michigan. That provision \nstated, ``None of the funds appropriated by this act may be used for \nthe continuous presence in Somalia of United States personnel, except \nfor the protection of United States personnel after September 30, \n1994.''\n  That provision was strongly supported by many of those who now back \nseparate enrollment. The President did not want the provision. I am \nsure he would have loved to have had the ability to veto that provision \nwithout affecting the underlying DOD appropriations.\n  Have any of the supporters of the proposed substitute, especially \nthose who opposed the operations in Somalia or Haiti, considered the \nwar powers implications of the drastic new restrictions on the \ncongressional power of the purse?\n  The power of the purse is the only thing we have to deal with. The \nWar Powers Act does not work. Everybody over here knows it. The power \nof the purse is the only way that Congress has to enforce restrictions \non foreign troop deployments. That power under this bill as now drafted \nin my opinion will be largely gone.\n  Another part of the DOD appropriation bill, section 8008, last year \nprovided:\n\n       Funds appropriated by this act may not be used to initiate \n     a special access program without prior notification 30 \n     calendar days in session in advance to the Committees on \n     Appropriations and Armed Services of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Those special access programs, as other programs, are very highly \nclassified programs that I will not discuss here on the floor. But I \nhave no doubt the President, any President, would welcome the ability \nto veto that provision. This was a limitation on Presidential \nexpenditures, saying you cannot spend this money except under certain \nlimited conditions. The President could keep the money, veto the \nconditions, and off we go--more expenditure, not less, as people want \nwhen they say they want a line-item veto.\n  Under the substitute there is just as much chance, over a period of \nyears, that the President, any President, would veto a restraint on \nspending as well as an increase in spending. This is not what the \npublic has in mind when they say they support a line-item veto.\n  In my opinion, there is just as much chance this provision, this \nbill, will cause an increase in spending as there is a decrease. That \ndoes not even take into account the ability of the President under this \nnew power to basically take certain provisions in a Senator's State and \nsay, ``You have these five provisions and if you do not vote with me \non, for instance, health care, my proposal on health care, I am going \nto make sure these proposals do not go into law unless you can produce \ntwo-thirds of the vote in both bodies to do so.''\n  It is a huge power shift to the President. But I am not even dwelling \non that in this speech today. It is a huge power shift to the \nPresident. And any President that has a pet project--health care, or \nwhatever they want to get through--will have a very greatly enhanced \nability to do that. Not by saving the public money, which is what they \nwant, but by threatening to veto those provisions in exchange for \nSenators and Members of the House basically voting to increase spending \non one of the President's proposals. It could be billions of dollars.\n  In my opinion what we are setting up here, the way we are heading--we \nare setting up provisions which give the President of the United States \na chance to threaten millions of dollars in exchange for getting votes \nfor billions of dollars. That is not what the public intends. That is \nexactly where this proposal is headed.\n  Mr. President, to take another example, the President could veto the \nso-called Hyde amendment restricting the use of Federal funds for \nabortion that has been included in the Labor-HHS appropriation bills \nover the years because it would be enrolled as a separate bill under \nthe proposed substitute.\n  The Hyde amendment was included as section 509 of the fiscal year \n1995 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and reads as follows:\n\n       Section 509. None of the funds appropriated under this act \n     shall be expended for any abortion except when it is made \n     known to the Federal entity or official to which funds are \n     appropriated under this act that such procedure is necessary \n     to save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the \n     result of an act of rape or incest.\n\n  I wonder if the people who are so enthused about this amendment, and \nthis proposal, have really thought through what they are doing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I will be happy to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will go ahead and yield, yes, sir.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, we are. Fortunately, a substantial part of the \nSenator's argument against this legislation has been taken care of by \nthe Levin-Murkowski-Exon amendment. I will be glad to quote it to him. \nIt adds:\n\n       * * * but shall not include a provision which does not \n     appropriate funds, direct the President to expend funds for \n     any specific project, or create an express or implied \n     obligation to expend funds and\n       (i) rescinds or cancels existing budget authority;\n       (ii) only limits, conditions, or otherwise restricts the \n     President's authority to spend otherwise appropriated funds; \n     or\n       (iii) conditions on an item of appropriation not involving \n     a positive allocation of funds by explicitly prohibiting the \n     use of any funds.\n\n  Basically what that does, I would say to the Senator from Georgia, it \nprohibits most of the scenarios that the Senator from Georgia just \ndescribed about being able to separate language from funds, funds from \nlanguage, and being able to so-called fence other areas.\n  I would like to let the Senator from Georgia finish, but I did want \nto point out this amendment, which I believe is going to be accepted, \ndoes address some of the major concerns the Senator raised.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Arizona. It is my understanding that \nhas not yet been adopted. Has that been adopted?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding it has not been adopted. As well, \nI have no doubt it will be.\n  Mr. NUNN. I am speaking of the proposal we now have before us. I \nthank my friend. I am glad the authors are considering that, because I \ncan assure you, if we debate this bill another 2 or 3 days, another 3 \nor 4 days, there are going to be a lot of other things that people are \ngoing to point out because this has not been thought through.\n  I believe the original proposals, the rescission proposals, have been \nthought through by the authors. I did not agree with the McCain \nproposal because of the two-thirds vote, but I think it had been \nthought through, the rescission part. This proposal has not been \nthought through. You are going to find one problem after another with \nthis.\n  For it to come on the floor of the Senate of the United States with a \ncloture motion at the same time, bypassing committees, bypassing the \nrescission proposals that had come out of the \n[[Page S4346]]  Governmental Affairs Committee and Budget Committee, \nand come up as a compromise with the threat of a cloture motion--this \nproposal has not been thought through. It is riddled with loopholes.\n  I am glad that particular amendment is being strongly considered, but \nit has not been adopted and of course I have no way of knowing what is \ngoing to be adopted so my remarks have to be addressed to the bill, the \nunderlying bill as it now stands. But I thank my friend from Arizona. I \nhope there will be that clarification as well as others that take \nplace.\n  The rescission proposals would not have that problem. The President \nwould send up rescissions on money items. He would not be sending up \nlanguage revisions. Those are totally different animals than what we \nhave here on the floor. This hybrid that has been put together as a \ncompromise has injected whole new areas that were not contemplated in \nthe rescission bill and present totally different problems. For us to \npass this bill in a week or 4 or 5 days to me is very bad legislative \nprocedure and will come back to haunt us if we continue to legislate \nthis way on these things that are this important. It is obvious this \nmatter has not been thought through.\n  In short, Mr. President, the proposed substitute is likely to give us \nthe worst of both worlds. It does not subject to veto the earmarks that \nare buried in floor statements, committee letters, and phone calls to \nCabinet Members. Those could be addressed in rescission bills. They \nwill not be able to be addressed in this bill.\n  It does subject to veto legitimate policy disagreements between \nCongress and the executive branch that have to be addressed in statute. \nI hope my friend from Arizona is correct on that, that policy \ndisagreements are going to be addressed in an amendment. I have not had \na chance to study the amendment and I do want to study that.\n  I believe the impact of the substitute proposal will be almost the \nopposite of what the Members of Congress and the American public had in \nmind when they said--and say in polls and in their letters and phone \ncalls--they want a line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also important to note, as I mentioned \nearlier in my summary remarks, that the substitute we have before us \nand that we may vote on even as early as tomorrow night, permits the \nPresident to increase Federal spending. The proposed substitute has \nbeen justified as a means to decrease Federal spending. This claim \noverlooks the fact that the substitute as drafted also permits the \nPresident to increase Federal spending.\n  As Members will recall, we acted last week on a defense supplemental \nbill to address urgent readiness problems.\n  That bill not only contained increases in spending for readiness, it \nalso contained rescissions--decreases in spending--to minimize the \nimpact on the deficit. A number of those offsets, were strongly opposed \nby the President, such as the reductions in environmental spending and \nreductions in the Technology Reinvestment Program.\n  Under the proposed substitute, each paragraph in the supplemental \nwould be enrolled as a separate bill, including the rescissions. As a \nresult, the President would be free to sign into law all the increases \nin spending and to veto any or all of the rescissions. In other words, \nthe President could increase the deficit by hundreds of millions or \nbillions of dollars without congressional approval. Only a two-thirds \nvote of both Houses could override these actions. Is it any wonder that \nany President would desire to have this power?\n  Obviously, any President would want these powers because he can take \na rescission and an appropriations bill that decreases an expenditure, \nveto the rescission, and keep the appropriations. What are we doing \nhere? Do we really know what we are doing in this proposal?\n  In that regard, the proposed substitute is clearly inferior to the \nDomenici-Exon expedited rescission proposal. Under an expedited \nrescission, the President could only propose decreases in spending.\n  I must say I believe that is also the way the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona would have worked.\n  The President could not obtain any increases under the Domenici-Exon \nexpedited rescission procedure. Why do those who support reductions in \nFederal spending want to give the President the authority, under the \nproposed substitute, to increase Federal spending instead of \nrestricting his power to reductions in spending? I can only conclude \nthat this proposal has not been carefully thought through.\n  The proposed substitute if implemented in good faith, if none of \nthese loopholes is taken advantage of by this Congress or a future \nCongress, will, in my opinion, result in rigidity, inflexibility, and \nin some cases chaos in the management of the Government's fiscal \naffairs in the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, the problem with the proposed substitute is that if it \nis administered in good faith with line-item appropriations, and if no \nloopholes are used by the Appropriations Committees--and I have already \ndescribed the gigantic loopholes that could be used--I believe it will \ncause chaos in the management of Government's fiscal affairs.\n  The most telling critique of the proposed substitute comes from the \nRepublican majority on the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  This was the report that came out with the rescission bill that had \nbeen brought out of the Governmental Affairs Committee just about 10 \ndays ago.\n  In explaining why it was better to have lump sum appropriations \nrather than line-item appropriations. Senator Roth and the Republican \nmajority on the Governmental Affairs Committee made the following \nobservations in their report on S. 4, which was the original proposal \nbefore this substitute came in.\n  Quoting from that majority report in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee:\n\n       Congress and the executive agencies are in broad agreement \n     that lump-sum financing is an effective way to manage the \n     Federal Government. Because of lump sum appropriations, \n     federal agencies are able to shift funds within large \n     appropriations accounts and therefore adjust to changing \n     conditions during the course of a fiscal year. By making \n     these shifts inside the account, the overall dollar figure \n     for the activity is not violated and therefore there is no \n     need to seek remedial legislation from Congress. Fund \n     shifting takes place under established reprogramming \n     procedures, with agencies notifying designated committees of \n     the shifts and in some cases seeking the advance approval of \n     those committees. * * *\n\n       This flexibility is important for the agency and for \n     Congress in its oversight capacity.\n       It is possible, although not desirable, to apply the state \n     budgeting system to the Federal Government and give \n     Presidents the kind of line-item veto available to governors. \n     To maximize item-veto authority for the President, the \n     details in conference reports, agency justification \n     materials, and other nonstatutory sources could be \n     transferred to appropriations bills * * * .\n  At this point I am not quoting. This majority report is describing \nthe problem exactly with the substitute we have before us. Back to the \nquote:\n\n       * * * However, placing items in appropriations bills would \n     produce an undesirable rigidity to agency operations and \n     legislative procedures. If Congress placed items in \n     appropriations bills, agencies would have to implement the \n     bill precisely as defined in the individual items. In cases \n     where the specific amounts detailed in the appropriations \n     statutes proved to be insufficient as the fiscal year \n     progressed, agencies could not spend above the specified \n     level. Doing so would violate the law. Agencies and \n     departments would have to come to Congress and request \n     supplemental funds for some items and rescissions for others, \n     or request a transfer of funds between accounts. Neither \n     Congress nor the agencies want this inflexibility and added \n     workload for the regular legislative process.\n\n  If we want further argument against this substitute, let us turn to \nwhat the Republican majority on the House Committee on Government \nReform and Oversight said in making similar observations in their \nreport on the line-item veto legislation that they passed, which I must \nsay is totally different from the substitute we have before us now.\n  Quoting from the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, \nRepublican majority:\n\n       We do not itemize appropriation bills and see no reason to \n     do so. . . . The details do not appear in the law. . . . We \n     could take the details from nonstatutory sources and place \n     them in appropriations bills, but that would add an \n     undesirable rigidity to agency operations. Executive \n     officials would have to implement highly detailed bills no \n     matter the magnitude of change that occurs over the course of \n     [a] fiscal year. Their only opportunity for relief would be \n     to come to Congress and request legislation to increase \n     [[Page S4347]]  funds for some items and eliminate them for \n     others. Agencies would be forced to seek large numbers of \n     statutory amendments to the original appropriations bill. No \n     one in either branch wants that.\n       Item-veto authority, as practiced at the state level, would \n     require the Federal Government to itemize appropriations \n     bills. Such a step would disrupt and undermine effective \n     agency management.\n\n  What we have, Mr. President, is both the Republican majority on the \nSenate side in Governmental Affairs, and the Republican majority on the \nHouse side in Governmental Affairs, have written reports in connection \nwith line-item veto that directly critiques and criticizes and \ndescribes as rigid and unworkable, in my words, the proposal that we \nare now about to vote on and will probably pass. It is an amazing \nlegislative performance.\n  I have never seen anything quite like it to have a committee report \nby the majority come out and basically to decry and criticize a later \nproposal that is on the floor as a substitute for the ones brought out \nof committee.\n  Let me illustrate the problems described by the Republican majority \non the Governmental Affairs Committee. Assuming the Appropriations \nCommittee set forth all the line items for defense in the defense \nappropriations bill, this would mean that a single defense \nappropriations bill, as we now know it, would be enrolled as over 2,300 \nseparate public laws. Reprogrammings between these public laws would no \nlonger be possible. Reprogramming could not take place because each \nitem would be in a separate law. As a result, fiscal managers would no \nlonger be able to move funds from a program that is in trouble to a \nprogram that is ahead of schedule. Overseas pay and benefits shortfalls \ncaused by devaluation of the dollar could not be addressed through \nreprogramming in the defense arena.\n  To the extent that Congress requires an agency to eat a pay raise--or \nabsorb the cost by shifting funds from other programs--the agency would \nbe unable to provide for the pay increase through reprogrammings.\n  Increases in operational tempo in time of international tension could \nnot be funded through a reprogramming from lower priority programs.\n  Readiness shortfalls would go unaddressed because money could not be \nmoved from lower priority O accounts into training activities.\n  We know how long it takes us to get through a supplemental \nappropriations bill. We are going to have to have supplemental after \nsupplemental after supplemental based on this legislation, if we pass \nit. There is going to be no end to the number of supplementals that we \nare going to have just in the Department of Defense alone.\n  The legislative activity load is going to just go up astronomically \nif we pass this legislation.\n  If military personnel accounts experienced temporary shortages--as \nthey did last year in the Air Force Reserve just before Christmas--\nfunds could not be reprogrammed to meet payrolls.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the executive branch would be faced \nwith fiscal gridlock. Like Gulliver, they would be bound by \nLilliputians in the form of thousands of minute appropriation bills.\n  Our fiscal managers would be unable to make reasonable adjustments \nduring the course of a year to spend the money wisely, and would be \nforced to delay actions needed to obtain savings or meet other critical \nmilitary needs. Moreover, because they could not move the money between \nline items, there would be a great incentive to spend all of the funds \nappropriated to a particular line, even if the money could be used more \nwisely in another program--just exactly the opposite of the incentives \nwe want to give the managers in DOD, or any other department. They \nwould know that they could not move it because they could not \nreprogram. They would know if they come to the Congress, they might \nhave to wait sometimes months, maybe even before the fiscal year is \nover, to be able to come up here and get another law passed so they \ncould spend the money in some other category. Are they going to be \ngreat managers and turn it back in? We all know what happens when \npeople have money to spend in agencies. It is a problem every \ngovernment faces. They spend it or lose it. Usually, unfortunately, \nthey spend it. That is what is going to happen here, multiplied by \nthousands of line items.\n  In other words, Mr. President, a proposal that started out to try to \nsave the taxpayers money, to try to delete waste, fraud, abuse, and \npork out of all sorts of legislation--a worthy objective and I think \none that could be achieved with something like the Domenici-Exon \nproposal--is now in the form of a substitute that we are about to vote \non. That is a formula for delay, inefficiency, and waste. That is how \nthis process has evolved--an amazing process.\n  Mr. President, the final comment on this proposal that I will make is \nthat the substitute we will probably vote on tomorrow does not address \nthe main problems criticized by its supporters. I must say, these are \nlegitimate criticisms of our current process. I am not a defender of \nthe current process. I think for us to have rescissions come from the \nPresident and, by doing nothing over here, allow those rescissions to \nhave no meaning at all, is unacceptable. We must change that. But the \nway to change it is not this proposed substitute. It is to require us \nto put the spotlight on and to vote again, as is provided in the \nDomenici-Exon proposal. That should be what we are really voting on \nhere.\n  I hope we are going to have a chance to vote on that. I hope some \npeople will change their minds, because we still have a chance to pull \nthis ox out of the ditch. Anybody who does not believe these are real \nproblems has not studied this very seriously, in my view. The \nsubstitute does not address a lot of the problems that really need \naddressing in the Congress.\n  Proponents of the substitute really hope the President will use it to \ncorrect the problems in the legislative process. I do not mind the \nPresident correcting problems in the legislative process under the \nright kind of proposal. Why do we not try to correct our own problems? \nWhy turn it all over to the President and say, Mr. President, we have \nall these problems and we do not handle this right, we are pretty \nsloppy, we have a lot of pork in legislation, and we have unauthorized \nappropriations and earmarks, we cannot solve it. We will send it down \nfor you to solve it. As a consequence, we will shift a lot of power \nfrom one branch to the other. I suggest we ought to address the \nproblems ourselves.\n  Unauthorized appropriations, for instance, are a significant problem. \nWhy do we not establish an effective point of order against \nunauthorized appropriations? I know the Senator from Arizona would \nagree with that. Earmarks that avoid the competitive process are wrong. \nWhy do we not establish an effective point of order against earmarks \nthat avoid merit-based selection procedures?\n  Adding a project in conference that was not included in either bill, \nHouse or Senate, is another significant problem. I think it is a \nterrible practice. Why do we not establish an effective point of order \nagainst projects added in conference that were not in either bill?\n  Conference reports that are not available for review prior to debate \nare a further problem. This particularly happens at the end of the \nsession on appropriations bills. Why do we not require conference \nreports to be available 2 or 3 days before debate? The proposed \nsubstitute addresses none of these problems. On the contrary, the \nsubstitute presumes that Congress will continue to employ procedures \nthat fail to constrain unnecessary spending.\n  Mr. President, we are putting the cart before the horse. Before we \nask the President to exercise our own responsibilities, we need to make \nevery reasonable effort to clean up our own act. This is not just a \nmatter of congressional prerogative. If we fail to restrain ourselves, \nwe can hardly expect the President to do it for us. And if we give him \nthese tools, we are going to be surprised over the years--I am not \ntalking about President Clinton, and I am not talking about any \nspecific President, but there is going to be a tremendous \ndisillusionment with the American public, because they are going to \nfind over the years that we are going to convert pork that costs \nmillions of dollars into strong-arm tactics by some President down the \nline that is going to cost the country billions of dollars--threatening \nto take out millions in order to get people to vote for billions. \nBelieve me, it is going to happen.\n  [[Page S4348]] It would be the height of cynicism for Congress to \ncontinue to earmark funds for pork barrel projects and then blame the \nPresident if he does not veto the very projects we approve.\n  Mr. President, I know that many who support the proposed substitute \ndo so out of strong conviction that something must be done to control \nFederal spending, and I agree. I agree with that point. But in our zeal \nto control spending, we must not lose sight of our duty to exercise our \nconstitutional legislative responsibilities with care. The history of \nthis legislation is not particularly edifying. The committees of \njurisdiction, the Budget Committee and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nhave marked up bills based on the use of a rescission process, not a \nseparate enrollment process. I will repeat that. These bills brought \nout of committee, at least with committee deliberation, are totally \ndifferent from what we have before us now that is a substitute.\n  Mr. President, the proposed substitute may be written on tablets of \nstone in terms of the way the votes are around here, but that does not \nmake it good legislation. As I have pointed out, it has enormous \nloopholes that will permit continued pork barrel earmarks--the very \nearmarks that we could capture if we use the Domenici-Exon expedited \nrescission proposal. The proposed substitute gives the President the \nauthority to increase spending by vetoing rescissions, a power that he \nwould not have under the Domenici-Exon expedited rescission proposal, \nor under the McCain proposal. Again, I do not favor the McCain proposal \nbecause of the enormous shift of power to the President. But it would \ncertainly not have the defects we have out here today. This substitute \ncreates the potential for chaos in Federal fiscal management, a problem \nthat would not arise under the Domenici-Exon expedited rescission \nproposal. It does nothing to address the legislative problems that \nencourage earmarks such as unauthorized appropriations, additions in \nconference reports, and conference reports that are not available in \nadvance of debate for examination.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous other problems with the proposed \nsubstitute which have been pointed out by others. My friend from West \nVirginia pointed out numerous problems. These include the \nconstitutionally questionable practice of delegating legislative power \nto the enrolling clerk and the enormous burden placed on the President \nof having to sign nearly 10,000 separate appropriations acts. I \nvisualize in the future where we will have candidates seeing who can \nsign the most pieces of paper the fastest, because that is going to \nrequire an enormous amount of Presidential time. We are going to have \nthousands and thousands of signing ceremonies, I suppose, and a lot of \npens. It is going to be good for the fountain pen industry but not for \nGovernment.\n  Presidential time management is a serious problem. I would rather \nhave a President working on correcting abuses in Government rather than \nsigning 10,000 or 12,000 bills a year. Mr. President, we have a choice \nin this debate. We can give the President and the Congress the tools \nneeded to effectively address wasteful spending, or we can vote for a \nbill that is an invitation for Congress to exploit loopholes as well--\nif that does not happen--as an invitation to fiscal gridlock in the \nexecutive branch. We should reject the proposed substitute and work in \na bipartisan fashion, which is entirely possible here in this bill. I \nthink both the majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, \nRepublicans as well as Democrats, really want an effective tool here. \nBut, Mr. President, this is not it.\n  This substitute should be rejected, and we should work together on an \neffective rescission bill that gives the President the authority to \naddress wasteful appropriations and unnecessary tax expenditures but \ndoes not cause the kind of mess that is going to be caused by this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was intrigued and somewhat amused by the \nthoughtful remarks of the Senator from Georgia. I was amused by his \nprospect that if the pork barrel spending or egregious appropriations \nwere somehow brought to the attention of the Members of this body, we \nwould rise up in righteous indignation and vote those down.\n  Well, apparently the Senator from Georgia has not been around when I \nhave come to this floor time after time after time after time with \namendments to do away with pork that was put in in conference reports, \nwith earmarks, with the most outrageous and egregious abuses of the \nsystem and been voted down time after time after time.\n  And I will tell the Senator from Georgia why. Because there is an \niron rice bowl around here that if you take care of your pet project, I \nwill take care of mine, and we will all vote down any attempt to do \naway with these because then that might start this whole system to \nunravel.\n  I can show the Senator from Georgia a record of vote after vote where \nI have come down here and clearly identified, including highway \ndemonstration projects to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, \nincluding earmarks for universities. I will provide him with the record \nof outrageous appropriations that have taken place, many of them \nstuffed in in conference, stuffed in in conference, which neither body \nsought, and I sought a majority vote to overturn them and could not do \nit, time after time after time.\n  So if the Senator from Georgia thinks that a simple majority vote \nwill be sufficient around here the way business is done, then he has \nnot had the same experience that I have.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield on that.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not remember using the word the Senator attributed to \nme, because I do not think it would be easy. But I think it will be a \nlot easier if the Senate sent up a rescission bill. And I think if we \nstuck to either the Domenici-Exon bill or the McCain bill on \nrescissions, that is the way to go about it.\n  I do not question what the Senator is trying to do. I agree. I do not \nquestion the problem you have identified. I agree.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I might reclaim the floor, the fact is, then, that the \nSenator cannot support a simple majority vote to override because that \nhas been tried. I tried it specifically. I tried it specifically on \nnumerous occasions and it has failed. And I can provide the Senator \nfrom Georgia with ample evidence of that--hundreds of millions of \ndollars in highway demonstration projects which have no relation \nwhatsoever to the needs of the States, but are put in. And I showed in \nthe debates the direct relation between those highway demonstration \nprojects and people who happen to be on the relevant committee. We \nattempted to overturn those. We failed time after time after time.\n  So then I do not understand what would lead the Senator from Georgia \nto the conclusion that if they came over here vetoed by the President a \nsimple majority override would do the job. It would not. It would not.\n  So even if the Senator from Georgia thinks that it would, I have \nevidence by standing on this floor hour after hour, day after day, week \nafter week trying to do away with these egregious pork barrel projects \nand failing to do so, just as we would fail to do it if it was not \nbrought up by me but it would be sent over by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  So I soundly reject the thesis on the part of the Senator from \nGeorgia that a simple majority vote would somehow put a brake to the \negregious practices which the American people, at least on November 8, \nsaid they were sick and tired of--sick and tired of.\n  As far as comparing letters and phone calls to the Pentagon from \ncommittee chairmen, I do not see how any legislation prevents that. I \ndo not see how you stop that. I do not do it. I do not believe in it. I \ndo not think it is appropriate to do so. And I am sorry to hear from \nthe Senator from Georgia that it is such a common practice.\n  But the fact is that the real crux of this issue, as I have said many \ntimes on this floor, is whether it is going to take a real veto, a real \nveto which is a two-thirds vote, as opposed to a majority vote. All the \nrest I felt was very negotiable. But I have had the experience, I have \nthe experience and I will provide for the Record the actual number of \ntimes I came down here and sought to draw an amendment to kill \nparticular projects that were put in in \n[[Page S4349]] the conference report which had no relation whatsoever \nto national security needs and lost those votes.\n  I would also like to remind the Senator from Georgia that the \nCongressional Research Service identified for me--the Congressional \nResearch Service--$62 billion in 5 years that was put in in defense \nappropriations bills which had nothing to do with defense; not any \nrelation whatsoever.\n  Now, I understand, as chairman or a senior member of the committee, \nthat you have a lot of latitude and a lot of power. And I know what \nreprogramming is about, too. It is a phone call to a chairman or a \nranking member, or both, sometimes just to one person, and millions of \ndollars are reprogrammed.\n  I do not believe in that, either, I will tell the Senator from \nGeorgia. I do not believe that is appropriate. And if we are going to \ndo away with that, then hooray, I am all for it, because too much of \nthat goes on. If we put some rigidity in how many of our departments of \nGovernment spend their money, then I am very happy about that.\n  As far as us now encouraging people to spend money, that this \nlegislation would encourage departments to not to give money back \nbecause they would be feel it is incumbent upon them to spend the \nmoney, I would ask the Senator from Georgia when is the last time the \nDepartment of Defense gave any money back to the Treasury under the \npresent system? I am not aware of any occasion in which that was the \ncase.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I did not interrupt the Senator.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. NUNN. That is OK.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would say it happens all the time. We have all sorts of \nprograms that are either in trouble one way or the other that we go \nthrough reprogramming.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did any of the money ever go back to the Treasury?\n  Mr. NUNN. The money is spent on other Defense Department needs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Georgia put his finger right on it. None \nof it goes back in the Treasury, but they find a way to spend it. With \nthis, they would not be able to spend it because of a veto and the \nmoney would go back to the taxpayers of America rather than them \ndeciding to find another place to spend it, which is the case today.\n  So perhaps the Senator from Georgia believes that it is a good idea \nthat if a program is not worthwhile and the money is not spent that it \ngo to another project without the knowledge of a majority of the \nCongress. Maybe with the knowledge of the Senator from Georgia when he \nwas chairman of the Armed Services Committee, but not with the \nknowledge of this Member, who I felt had an equal voice in what the \ndecision should be as the expenditure of America's tax dollars.\n  So if, as the Senator from Georgia states, this would stop this \nrepro- gramming, then I say I am very, very glad to hear \nthat information that it would stop the reprogramming.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. NUNN. As the Senator knows, on reprogramming, the reprogramming \ncomes up by written request. It goes to four different committees. It \nis examined by the committees. All the members of the committees have \naccess to that information if they want it.\n  The reprogramming is not done by telephone. And if the Senator wants \nto prevent reprogramming, the Senator is going to actually basically \nhave the Department of Defense come up with one bill after another all \nyear long. There will not be time for anything else.\n  I do not think the Senator has thought through this proposal.\n  I think the Senator has thought through the problem and I think he \nhas thought through it very carefully and I admire him for his fights \non that. I think he will find I voted with him on his amendments most \nof the time. And I think he would recall the challenge to the \nappropriations earmarks. I started that on the floor of the Senate. We \nactually won a majority vote on three different occasions. We have had \nthe money taken out of the earmarks on the Senate side. In the final \nanalysis, it usually gets put back in at the end of the conference.\n  So I agree with the Senator's frustration. But the problem is every \ntime you see a problem around here, that does not mean whatever \nsolution you throw at it is going to be the answer. I am saying that \nthere is a problem. The Senator is right, there is a problem. There are \nways to address that problem. But these solutions are going to create a \nwhole other set of problems that are worse than the problems that the \nSenator is describing. That is my case.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Georgia, and \nhe would be welcome to interrupt again.\n  As far as this issue not being examined sufficiently, I would remind \nthe Senator from Georgia that a former colleague of his from Georgia \nbrought this bill, this very same bill, with a few changes to it in \n1985 to the floor of the Senate. I know that the Senator from Georgia \nwas then in the Senate. I am sorry that he did not take part in the \ndebate and become illuminated on the issue at that time.\n  It was passed a couple years ago as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. NUNN. It was a different proposal. I examined that proposal. It \nwas the Mattingly proposal. It did not have anything like the level of \nlines required in this one. It was a different proposal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is fundamentally the same, and the Senator knows it as \nwell as I do.\n  The fact is the Mattingly amendment, plus a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that was passed not too long ago, I believe it was in 1993, \nbasically said the same thing. So this is not a new issue. It is not a \nnew item and it is not a new problem.\n  It is not a new problem. The fact is that if we do not address this \nproblem, then the American people's confidence will be far more eroded \nthan it is today, if that is possible.\n  I am convinced that if we adopt the so-called now Exon--since Senator \nDomenici no longer supports that proposal and supports this proposal--\nthat it will fail. And the Senator from Georgia probably knows that, \ntoo, because in the other body, the line-item veto, what he knows of as \nthe Domenici-Exon, was defeated by an overwhelming number, and it was \ndefeated because it only required a majority to overrule the line-item \nveto.\n  Most of our colleagues on the other side, and I hope most of my \ncolleagues here, understand that a simple majority does not do it. And \nit does not do it for the reasons I cited earlier to my colleague from \nGeorgia.\n  These items have been exposed to the light of day. Votes have been \ntaken, and they have been rejected. Even though those provisions may \nhave been snuck in, in a covert fashion initially, even when they were \nexposed, we still could not get a sufficient number of votes to remove \nthem through the amending process, which is basically what the \nPresident of the United States said.\n  I am amending this bill in order to take out what I find \nobjectionable, and then there is a vote. I am convinced if it is a \nmajority vote that overturns it, it is business as usual in this body, \nand in the Congress, and our colleagues on the other side, clearly--as \nthe Senator from Nebraska has stated very accurately quite often--is \nvery different from this body.\n  Our Founding Fathers meant for that to be the case. But they feel \nvery strongly, and perhaps it is because they have had more bitter \nexperience than we have had over here, that a two-thirds majority is \nrequired.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will not talk too much longer. I know the \nSenator from Nebraska wants to speak, and the Senator from Indiana is \nhere.\n  This issue is well-known. This issue is not brand new. Separate \nenrollment goes back as far as 1985. The issue of line-item veto goes \nback in the last century. There have been debates and discussions of \ndifferent forms of line-item veto for years. I have been part of many \nof them.\n  To convey the impression that this is a brand new thing that Members \nof this body have not considered, frankly, I believe, is an inaccurate \ndepiction of our knowledge of this issue of the line-item veto.\n  [[Page S4350]] Any members that go home, who have a town hall \nmeeting, not an hour goes by without someone standing up and saying, \n``Why can't we have the line-item veto, Senator or Congressman?'' \nObviously there is a discussion at that time because the American \npeople feel that we are spending too much of their dollars that they \nsend to Washington in a wasteful fashion.\n  I would like to say the Senator from Georgia made an excellent point: \nWhy not solve the problems ourselves? I think he made an excellent \npoint there, and I have seen effort after effort after effort to solve \nthe problems ourselves. We cannot. We do not show the political courage \nto do so.\n  I have sought, as the Senator from Georgia has, to attempt to not \nallow appropriations to be put in conferences. I try to have criteria \nset up for military construction projects, which are one of the most \negregious areas where pork shows up all the time. We tried to do away \nwith highway demonstration projects. We tried to do away with the land \ntransfers that are done--directly related to the influence of certain \nMembers of this body. I tried to do away with outrageous courthouse \ncosts.\n  We have not been able it do it, and we have run up a $5 trillion debt \nand laid it on few generations of Americans. There are very few people \nin this body that I respect more than the Senator from Georgia. There \nare times when he and I are in disagreement. This is one of them.\n  He contributes to the debate, as always. I feel that the points that \nhe raised, as well as the points raised by the Senator from West \nVirginia earlier, are very important ones. I am glad we are having this \nopportunity to debate these points on the floor prior to passage of the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to compliment my friend and \ngreat colleague from the State of Georgia. I think that all Members who \nhave known and worked with Sam Nunn know that he is historically one of \nthe most thoughtful Members of our body, and I think that that \nstatement would be agreed to by most people on either side of the \naisle.\n  Senator Nunn, unfortunately, brought forth his carefully thought out, \nwell-researched speech tonight to a U.S. Senate where only four Members \nwere on the floor. It was after it had been announced that we would \nhave no more votes. Therefore, as of this moment there are many people \noutside of the U.S. Senate who know much more about the reasoned \narguments made by the Senator from Georgia than is known by most U.S. \nSenators. For the most part, I suspect that as usual, when we announce \nthere are no more votes, there are not a large number of Senators in \ntheir offices listening to the debate, as is frequently the case.\n  I just wish that every Senator would read the statements made by the \nSenator from Georgia tonight, tomorrow. I do not know how much press we \nwill pick up on the statements made by the Senator from Georgia.\n  I am looking in the press gallery and I see one person, maybe \nsomebody else is hiding up there. I suppose that maybe some of the \npress may be watching on television, but unfortunately the tremendously \nthroughtful remarks of the Senator from Georgia which were critical of \nwhat we are trying to do here may fall on deaf ears.\n  I have been closely associated with him for the 16 years that I have \nbeen here. I sit next to him on the Armed Services Committee. I simply \nknow that Sam Nunn takes the time and effort to do the research as he \nhas done on this measure. I hope it will give some pause and some \nconsideration to those that may not have studied the proposition, \nclearly, as much as Mr. Nunn of Georgia.\n  I think that the Senator from Georgia clearly was not trying to pick \non anyone. Clearly, he was not trying to destroy anything. Clearly, as \nis his nature, Sam Nunn was saying to Members, ``Stop, look, and listen \nbefore you leap at the proposal offered by the majority leader, without \nhearing any discussion.''\n  What Senator Nunn brought out are some shortcomings in the measure \nthat I think we should take a look at. There might not be total \nagreement on every point that Senator Nunn made. But I notice that \nduring his discussion, the main argument that was made, some of the \nsalient points he was making, was an amendment to the Dole substitute \nthat was not in the Dole substitute, probably never had been thought of \nby those who put the Dole substitute together. In fact, they were \noffered by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  I just hope, therefore, that we would not jump to a conclusion that \nSam Nunn does not care. I think no one could say that with any great \nunderstanding. No one has said that yet.\n  I think that Sam Nunn has made a very excellent point. I think he \nsummed it up best by saying he supported the substitute amendment that \nis basically S. 14, the Domenici-Exon proposal that has been made, and \nwill be offered by the democratic leader in just a few moments. We will \nhave an opportunity to vote on that.\n  It has been said that Senator Domenici no longer supports the \nDomenici-Exon proposal. Well, that might be. But I believe that after \nlistening to the remarks by a man whom Senator Domenici has stood with \ntime after time after time on many matters, including matters to try \nand straighten out the fiscal policies of the United States of America, \nI am not sure that Senator Domenici would dismiss out of hand the \nDomenici-Exon proposal. A commitment has been made by the Republicans \nmeeting in caucus and everything necessary was done to get the \ncommitment of 54 solid votes--at least on cloture, and I assume 54 \nvotes for the measure. But perhaps my colleagues have listened to some \nof the debate that has been going on, if we would listen to Sam Nunn, \nif we would reflect on the thoughtful comments that have been made by \nSenator Byrd, whom most would recognize as a scholar and a historian \nand certainly a very well read and accepted critic and expert on the \nConstitution, we can still correct ourselves.\n  I hope that at least with the actions that have taken place today we \nwould take another look at the Democratic leader's proposal that is \nback to Domenici-Exon--maybe it is only the Exon amendment now, but I \nstill think it is a good amendment, worthy of consideration.\n  I would also add that I think it is very clear Senator Nunn was \nsupportive of either Domenici-Exon, which was S. 14, and prefers S. 4, \nwhich was the McCain amendment to the separate enrollment substitute. I \nlistened very carefully to Senator Nunn, and while Senator Nunn clearly \nfavored the Domenici-Exon S. 14, he clearly indicated that the McCain \nS. 4 was far superior, far, far superior to the substitute amendment \nthat was offered by the majority leader. So I think Sam Nunn, as usual, \nwas trying to say let us stop and think about this.\n  This new gimmick that I have criticized and Senator Byrd has \ncriticized and others have criticized, known as the enrollment \nprocedure, is an absolute disaster, if people will stop and take a look \nat it, they will see it is a disaster for lots of reasons. I do not \nthink there is any question but that if we incorporate the enrolling \nclerk in this measure we will open ourselves up to a challenge by the \ncourts that might sink a line-item veto that this Senator has been \nworking on for a long, long time--as I said earlier, prior to the time \nthat many people came here. I believe one of the first times that I \nremember doing anything about this was in consort with then Senator Dan \nQuayle of Indiana. Dan Quayle, of course, was later the Vice President \nof the United States.\n  I simply say it is not fair, in my opinion, since I know something \nabout the Mattingly amendment, to say that the Mattingly amendment was \nessentially the same thing as the enrollment today. The Mattingly \namendment clearly called for a division by section and paragraph. In \ncontrast, the Dole substitute amendment calls for a division by \nsection, paragraph, allocation, or suballocation. The Dole amendment \ncalls for far greater detail than the Mattingly amendment, and therein \nlies some of the concern, and I think legitimate concern, offered by \nour distinguished colleague from Georgia.\n  One other point or two. It has been said that, oh, the House of \nRepresentatives would never go for anything like Domenici-Exon, and \nmaybe now just Exon, about to become Daschle-Exon--call it what you \nwill, they would never \n[[Page S4351]]  go for anything like it. I submit, Mr. President, that \nH.R. 4600 passed July 14, 1994, on a vote of 342 to 69 in the House of \nRepresentatives was essentially the Domenici-Exon bill, the Exon bill, \nthe Daschle-Exon bill, the bill that Senator Nunn recommends that we \ntake a look at. That happened last year. Now, it is true that there has \nbeen a change in the makeup of the House of Representatives since that \ntime but not enough of a change to make that much difference in the \nvote that I have just outlined.\n  I just hope that we could also understand--and I congratulate my \nfriend from Arizona. It is true that he has been here time and time \nagain trying to point out pork barrel spending. I salute him for that, \nand many, many times I have been with him, and I think that I have \ncosponsored some of these measures with him. And he said but he has not \ngotten anywhere, and that is why you have to have more than a majority \nvote as provided in the bill that I will refer to as S. 14 so I will \nnot have to mention all those names over and over again.\n  Well, I can understand his frustration and I share in that \nfrustration. I would simply say to Members of the Senate that S. 14 \ndoes not call for one Member of the Senate--and as big and as important \nas we sometimes think we are, to begin to wield the same influence and \nthe spotlight as the President. We do not have the bully pulpit of the \nPresident of the United States. So I think I should assure all that if \nthe President of the United States under S. 14 would highlight, would \nveto, call something pork and send it back over here, with that kind of \na spotlight shining on it, rather than the spotlight of only one or two \nor three Senators spotlighting it. It would be well known around the \nUnited States of America, and I daresay that with the spotlight of the \nPresident of the United States exercising a veto as in S. 14, I do not \nthink there would be the courage or lack thereof in this Chamber or the \nHouse of Representatives to override it as easily as they have in the \npast.\n  I would simply say, Mr. President, in closing that we can still have \na good line-item veto, but I share and have spoken previously on what \nSenator Nunn outlined again tonight. Some of the things that Senator \nNunn outlined would be a disaster for the United States of America.\n  Here a measure came forth out of a Republican caucus without any \nconsultation with Democrats, without any hearings, without ever being \ndiscussed in the committees let alone holding hearings.\n  It is brought forth, it has been draped in a mantle of gold that \ncannot be touched because, if you touch it, you scratch it, and if you \nscratch it, you destroy it.\n  I do not think that is a very good way to legislate in the United \nStates of America. There is a better way, and the better way that I \nhope we will take another look at is in the form of the amendment that \nthe Democratic leader will be introducing tonight. I do not think the \nDemocratic leader is going to say this is sacrosanct. I do not think \nthe Democratic leader is going to say that there can be no changes made \nin it. I believe the Democratic leader will outline something tonight \nthat I hope we will further discuss tomorrow and invite the Republicans \nin to see if we can come up with something that is more workable, that \novercomes the constitutional objections that Senator Byrd, a \nconstitutional expert, has outlined; to overcome the objections and \nconcerns that have been highlighted by the Senator from Georgia. We can \nwork it out.\n  I think there is no pride in authorship. We are trying to pass a \nline-item veto that, as best as we can fashion it, can reduce \nunnecessary pork-barrel spending. I think that is what the Republicans \nwant to do, and I think that is what the Democrats want to do. But I, \nfor one, have been raising concerns about the process, concerns about \nthe majority leader and his actions of bringing forth this that had \nnever been discussed with the Democrats, never had any hearings held on \nit, and immediately to file a cloture petition on it. That is a \nrailroading type of thing that I think does not bode well for what is \ngenerally considered to be the most deliberative body in the world.\n  Now, rather than being accused of being too deliberative and too \ntalkative, I yield the floor and hope, if there is no one seeking \nrecognition, the Democratic leader could rise to introduce the bill \nthat he is going to introduce, and call it what you will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me begin by calling it what it ought \nto be called. This is the Domenici-Exon amendment. It is on the basis \nof the expertise of the two most able budgetary leaders in this body at \nthis time that we bring forth this amendment with some confidence.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nebraska, our ranking member, has very \ncapably and eloquently characterized the remarks made earlier by the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia. In both cases, the remarks made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska and certainly those made by the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, lay out precisely why this amendment is necessary \nand why we bring it forth with the best intentions this evening.\n  I will have more to say about this tomorrow, but I would like to \nbegin this evening by talking about our motivation and about why we \nview this to be a superior alternative to the substitute which was laid \ndown by the majority leader on Monday night.\n  As I have said, and as the distinguished Senator from Nebraska has \nreiterated on many occasions, the debate all week long has not been \nabout a line-item veto. There is no debate among most Senators in that \nregard. Most Senators would agree that a line-item veto in concept is \nsomething we ought to have. Forty-three States have it. Democrats and \nRepublicans have recognized for years it would be a good thing for us \nto have as well.\n  The question really is, What is our most effective approach? What in \nconcept would work the most effectively? It is really on the basis of \nthat desire--to bring forth the most practical and the most prudent \napproach--that I am sure Senator Domenici and Senator Exon originally \nproposed S. 14.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, who have looked at all the options, and have studied \nthis issue, as the distinguished Senator from Nebraska has said, for \nyears and years. On the basis of their considered judgment, and on the \nbasis of their expertise, concluded some time ago that S. 14, the \nproposal that they introduced earlier this year, is by far and away the \nsingle most appropriate approach to something we all say we want. And \nthey were so compelling in their reasons earlier this year that the \nmajority leader cosponsored S. 14.\n  There must have been a time at some point this year that the majority \nleader looked at the options as well and came to the conclusion that \nthey were right; that, indeed, having looked at all the different \nalternatives, S. 14 made the most sense.\n  There has been a good deal of discussion in recent weeks about \nDemocrats who voted one way for a balanced budget amendment and then \nvoted a different way this year. Obviously, going from one Congress to \nthe next on an issue of some importance, changing one's position is \nunderstandable. It happens here all the time. But to go from a \ncosponsored measure, one which enjoyed broad-based bipartisan support, \nand in the same Congress decide even though it was cosponsored, even \nthough publicly one is associated with it as the author, and then to \nvote against it would require a good deal of explanation, it would seem \nto me.\n  Regardless of what may ultimately come as a result of our debate over \nthe course of the next day, what S. 14 is appropriately described as is \nexpedited rescission, because it forces Congress to vote on spending \ncuts proposed by the President.\n  An almost identical proposal was passed in the House last year on a \ntotally bipartisan basis. That vote was 342 to 69. Every one of the 169 \nRepublican Members of the House at that time supported it. So the \nhistory of S. 14 is very clear. Republicans by wide margins in the \npast--in the past Congress as well as in the past months--have \ndemonstrated their conviction that this is a very appropriate way with \nwhich to achieve what we all say we want--line-item veto.\n  The proposal gives the President authority to force Congress to vote \non both spending and tax provisions that he considers wasteful. I will \ngo into that in a little while. Under current law, Congress can ignore \nthe President. We do not have to deal with rescissions the President \nsends to us. The current process is obviously very inadequate. It has \nnot worked. Current law is clearly too weak.\n  Overwhelmingly, I think, colleagues on both sides of the aisle would \ncome to that conclusion. So our amendment requires that Congress not \nignore the President. It creates a fast-track procedure which forces \nCongress to deal with the President's proposed cuts in a very limited \nperiod of time. It is not enough for the President to send something \nback. We could continue to ignore it and, in the waning days of a \nCongress, come to some conclusion about dealing with the President's \nrescission and technically, avoid having to make the tough decisions. \nBut what this measure says is that within 20 days the President must \nnotify the Congress, after passage of a spending or a tax bill, what he \nwants to see cut. Twenty days is all he has. Then, 2 days later, a bill \nwith the President's proposals has to be introduced and 10 days later \nthe Congress votes.\n  So, Mr. President, within little over one month's time the entire \nprocess must be complete. The President has 20 days to notify the \nCongress of whatever changes he wants to make. Two days later, a \nproposal has to be made within the body to ensure that the President's \nrecommendations are considered, and then Congress must act within 10 \ndays after that to make it happen. That is it. It is over. Within a \nmonth, it all has to happen.\n  There are no filibusters because we limit debate, once it comes to \nthe floor, to 10 hours.\n  Mr. President, there is a locked-in procedure here requiring from the \nvery beginning of the process all the way to the end the certainty that \nMembers of Congress must take action once the President makes his \ndecision. Both Houses are forced to act. Both Houses would ensure an \nopen public debate to place huge pressures on Congress itself to cut \nwasteful spending.\n  Mr. President, that is the process. I do not know how it can get much \nsimpler than that. I do not know how it can be any less complicated, \nany more certain, and any more streamlined a process as we consider \nlegislative proposals in this body.\n  So our amendment, in my view, has four main advantages over the \npending Dole substitute. I want to address those with a little more \nelaboration. But let me just articulate them first.\n  It is more practical. We will not see the legislative process tied up \nin knots, as I foresee the Dole substitute doing.\n  It is clearly constitutional. It would not be challenged in court. We \nknow that. Senator Nunn made quite a point of talking about the \nconcerns he has in that regard.\n  Third, it protects majority rule, a central principle of democracy. \nIt does not permit a minority in Congress, as the Dole substitute \nwould, to hold the majority hostage. It protects the balance of power \nbetween the President and the Congress. We all want review. We all want \nthe opportunity to ensure that in an expedited process we can be forced \nto deal with the proposals made by the President with regard to \nrescissions. But we also recognize how important it is that majority \nrule be maintained and protected during the legislative process.\n  Finally, it clearly and unambiguously puts tax breaks on the table \nsubject to Presidential review. There is no question here. I am going \nto get into that in a little more detail tomorrow. But there is no \nquestion with regard to the Exon proposal. Tax breaks \n[[Page S4354]]  are on the table, as spending measures are in all other \ncases.\n  Let me go back to the issue of practicality. Our amendment, as I \nsaid, would be so much easier to administer. I have described it in as \nsimple a way as I can. I do not know that anyone would have any \ndifficulty understanding what happened; 20 days, 2 days, 10 days. That \nis it. It is over.\n  The Appropriations Committee last year estimated that the 13 \nappropriations bills would ultimately be split into nearly 10,000 \nseparated minibills under the Dole amendment. Let me repeat that.\n  The Appropriations Committee estimates that last year's 13 \nappropriations bills, which would be subject under the Exon approach to \na simple process of reconsideration when the President sends them back, \nif he would choose to do so, would be changed from 13 bills to nearly \n10,000 separate minibills under the Dole amendment.\n  I do not have the paper to adequately represent the stacks, the \ntruckloads of paper we are going to need to do what the Dole substitute \nwould require. But coming on the heels of the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nfor the life of me, I do not understand how anybody can advocate going \nfrom 13 bills to 10,000. Here we are just talking about the \nappropriations process. We are still trying to determine the degree to \nwhich we will have scope on taxes. But on appropriations bills alone, \nthat is the question, do we want to go from 13 to 10,000?\n  As I indicated in an earlier speech on the Senate floor, the Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations Act is a pretty good example. That \nact was about 30 pages. The 30 pages, if we use that bill as an example \nthis year, would be split into 1,746 separate bills--1,746 separate \nbills.\n  So on the basis of prudence or practicality, does it make sense for \nany of us who voted for and have advocated paper reduction to take a \nsimple measure, and provide the complicated extraordinary burdensome \nprocess of going from 13 to 10,000 or in this case 1 page to 1,700? I \ndo not think so, Mr. President.\n  Second, let me address the issue I raised with regard to \nconstitutionality. We have not had the chance to properly evaluate the \nconstitutionality of this approach because it has not been considered \nby any committee, as the distinguished Senator from Nebraska has \nindicated. But the last time a separate enrollment proposal was \nconsidered was 1985. It was voted out unfavorably by unanimous vote in \nthe Rules Committee, then chaired by a Republican.\n  Several witnesses at the hearings held by the Rules Committee in 1985 \nraised serious questions as to the constitutionality of separate \nenrollment. The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia has \nspent a good deal of time on the floor over the course of the last \nseveral days talking about this issue, so I will not elaborate.\n  But let me just say how pleased I am that the amendment offered by \nthe senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, was adopted in order \nto expedite the judicial review of this bill. That is important. \nCertainly with judicial review, we will cut to the heart and go right \nto the question of constitutionality at some point in the not too \ndistant future.\n  While we will not know until the courts finally determine the \nconstitutionality of this legislation, it would certainly be better to \nenact our amendment which raises no questions at all. On the one hand, \nwe have a question of taking a chance, rolling the dice with regard to \nconstitutionality. On the other hand, with this amendment, there is no \nroll of the dice. There is no question of constitutionality. We know it \nis constitutional. We have that confidence.\n  So beyond the practicality of going from 13 to 10,000, then we \nquestion the constitutionality and say, look. On that side there is a \ndoubt. On this side, there is none.\n  If this legislation is struck down by the courts, what do we have? We \ngo back to ground zero. We probably enact the Exon bill. But why should \nwe go through that process? Why should we go back to step one?\n  Mr. President, based upon that, I would say that Senators ought to \ngive pause before they come to any final conclusions on the Dole \nsubstitute, which while it has merits, is not as good of a solution as \nthe amendment we have offered. I would certainly hope that they will \ntake a close look at what the chairman of the Budget Committee himself \nproposed earlier this year along with the ranking member.\n  Third, I indicated that majority rule and the balance of power is a \nconcern of many of us. Our amendment would require that a majority of \nCongress approve cuts that are proposed by the President using the \nprinciple of majority rule which has been in existence for 200 years. \nFor 200 years we have said majority rule ought to be our modus \noperandi, our approach to passing laws in this country. We would not \nallow a supermajority to hold hostage legislation that otherwise \ndeserves fair consideration.\n  Under the alternative, the President wins, if he gets the support of \njust one more than a third of either House of Congress. It is all over \nwith. A President wins if he can convince one more than one-third of \neither body of the propriety of his action.\n That is all it takes and it is over.\n\n  Do we really want to move that much power to the White House? Do we \nwant to see that kind of an imbalance between the executive and \nlegislative branches? Mr. President, I do not think so. That is not a \npartisan issue. Obviously, we have a Democratic President and a \nRepublican Congress. The roles could be reversed some day. But \nregardless of who dominates either branch, I really question whether we \nwant to push that kind of power, that kind of an imbalance, created now \nafter over 200 years. I would hope that Members, too, would give a \ngreat deal of careful thought to allowing the President to use that \nkind of influence.\n  I can recall so many occasions over the course of the last 16 years \nwhere Presidents have called me to urge my vote on a specific issue. \nThey have called me saying, ``It is in the national interest for you to \ndo something, Senator Daschle,'' or ``Congressman Daschle, that I know \nyou do not want to do.'' There have been times when I have had a \nfundamental philosophical disagreement with my own President, \nsometimes, with a Democratic President, not to mention a Republican \nPresident, and I have had to tell the President, ``No, I am not going \nto support you.'' But I wonder whether anybody could ever imagine--\nhopefully, it will never happen, but I wonder if a President might some \nday say, ``Senator Daschle, you have some water projects in South \nDakota that I am going to line-item veto unless * * *''--God forbid \nthat it happens. I hope it will not. But putting the power of the \nPresident in the position it will be in, under that substitute, gives \nme pause. If I know that I can convince the majority of my colleagues \nof the appropriateness of a given line item, I am going to be safe and \nsay, ``Mr. President, you can do anything you want to. I can convince \nmy colleagues of the merit of this particular position, so go ahead and \nveto it.'' I will convince the majority. But if all he needs is a \nthird, if that is all he needs, I am not sure I will ever get anywhere \nwith issues of great importance to this Senator or to anybody else.\n  Mr. President, the final issue has to do with tax breaks and the \nlanguage that the Exon proposal provides, as opposed to the language \nprovided in the Dole substitute. I must say I am very pleased that the \nRepublican majority has come a long way in meeting many of our concerns \nwith regard to adopting a provision which allows the President to veto \nspecial interest tax breaks. While I am pleased with this progress, the \nlanguage in our amendment is much clearer and freer of ambiguity. That \nis what we really want. It says clearly and forcefully: Tax breaks are \non the table, period; no questions asked, no doubt at all about where \nwe stand with regard to putting tax breaks on the table, in the same \nway that appropriations bills are offered. That is a given.\n  But I must say, I am hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can come \nto some closure on this issue of tax expenditures. It is gratifying \nthat the tax expenditure language that Republicans now propose is \nsimilar to language that Senator Bradley has introduced and has made \nvery clear is his No. 1 priority with regard to the line-item veto. I \nam very pleased that the distinguished Senator from Indiana has made \nthat \n[[Page S4355]]  point in a colloquy with Senator Bradley. I will just \nread into the Record what he had to say about this issue, because I \nthink it confirms what we have been hoping we can accomplish. Quoting \nnow, Senator Coats on March 21, in a colloquy with Senator Bradley. He \nsays:\n\n       I say to the Senator from New Jersey, our goal, I believe, \n     is the same--to address the same items that he attempts to \n     address. I hope that as we debate through this and work \n     through this, we can clarify so that Members know exactly \n     what we are after. It is hard to get the exact words in place \n     so that we understand just exactly how this applies to tax \n     items. But I believe that the targeted tax expenditures which \n     are targeted in the Dole amendment very closely parallel what \n     the Senator from New Jersey has tried for so long to \n     accomplish.\n\n  Mr. President, that clarification is very helpful. I commend the \nSenator from Indiana for making it. Republicans would subject a tax \nbreak to potential veto, and it provides more favorable tax treatment \nto a particular taxpayer or limited group of taxpayers ``when compared \nwith other similarly situated taxpayers.'' The only way a tax \nexpenditure would not be subject to potential veto under this language \nis if we define ``similarly situated'' as meaning identical. Our \nRepublicans colleagues have assured us that that is not their intent.\n  Suppose we proposed a $500 tax credit for all employees of Senate \noffices. Everyone would agree that this proposal should be subject to a \nPresidential veto. But if we define ``similarly situated'' as all \nemployees of Senate offices, then we would have the ridiculous result \nthat the proposal would not be subject to any line-item veto. What if \nwe provided a tax deduction to all businesses in Fairfax County, VA. We \nwould agree that the President should have the authority to review the \nprovision for possible line-item veto. If we only compare the taxpayers \nwho benefit from this deduction to businesses in Fairfax County, then \nwe end up with a nonsensical result that the deduction would not be \nsubject to the line-item veto.\n  So, Mr. President, as these examples show, defining ``similarly \nsituated taxpayers'' to mean the identical group of taxpayers leads to \na ridiculous result. But applying common sense to the term ``similarly \nsituated'' leads inevitably to a broad interpretation of that term, \nwhich is what I am sure our Republican colleagues have intended.\n  They have confirmed and assured us that it is not their intent to \nhave the line-item veto operate in the manner I just described with \nthese examples. Thus, similarly situated taxpayer should be interpreted \nbroadly, thereby subjecting a wide range of tax breaks to a \nPresidential veto.\n  Again, Mr. President, that is the question. Why should we have to go \nthrough an interpretation of broad or narrow scope with regard to tax \nbreaks? Why not put all tax breaks on the table? Why not recognize that \na tax break is an expenditure, an expenditure that has to be offset, an \nexpenditure that ought to be treated just like an appropriation? That \nis what the Democratic substitute does, very clearly.\n  So, in closing, Mr. President, let me just say that we will have more \nof an opportunity tomorrow to talk about these issues. But we need to \ngo back to the original Domenici-Exon language, cosponsored by the \nmajority leader. We appreciate very much that Republicans have come \ntoward our view on tax breaks. Now they should come back to their own \nlanguage that is part of our substitute. We support giving the \nPresident new authority to compel consideration of cuts in spending and \ntax breaks, and the best way to do it is to adopt this amendment. It is \nworkable, it is constitutional, it protects majority rule, and it \nclearly puts special interest tax breaks on the table.\n  I hope that in the spirit of bipartisanship, recognizing that the \norigin of this legislation came from Republicans and Democrats, and not \nonly just any Republican or Democrat, but it came from the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \npeople who know this issue better than the rest of us, I hope that \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle can recognize the wisdom of that \napproach and support it tomorrow when we have the rollcall vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in one very real sense, I welcome the \nremarks of the minority leader and welcome the support that the \nminority leader and others have offered on this floor for the concept \nthat we are attempting to advance; namely, how do we make it harder to \nspend the taxpayers' dollars? And how can we end a practice which most \nof us recognize as not a practice that brings credit to this \ninstitution, but one which annually causes us significant \nembarrassment?\n  The disclosure of certain types of spending, certain types of tax \nbenefits to the public severely undermines their confidence in us as an \ninstitution, severely enhances their criticism and their cynicism \ntoward this institution, as they regularly see expenditures for items \nthat are not considered to be in the national interest or in any sense \nof the measure a broad interest, but are targeted to just a few.\n  And it is a time honored, some would say--I would say time \ndishonored--process that we have engaged in over the years to slip \nthose little provisions in, sometimes in the back room, sometimes in \nconference, when there really is no chance to amend a bill that we know \nthe President has to sign.\n  And so we are encouraged that our colleagues from across the aisle \nhave recognized that this is a practice that needs to be limited or \nstopped.\n  But for the past 6 years, during my service in the Senate, I have \nbeen part of an effort led by Republicans to attempt to address this \nissue. And we failed each time. Really, going all the way back to 1985, \nthere have been six separate efforts to address line-item veto in which \nwe had votes. And in each one of those efforts, the number of Democrats \nsupporting Republicans or supporting the effort in general can be \ncounted generally on one hand. We have failed again and again and \nagain. We have failed because we have not had support from across the \naisle.\n  Oh, it is wonderful now to hear all these statements about how \nDemocrats support line-item veto; how they support enhanced rescission; \nhow they are trying to work toward the same goals as we are. Well, we \nwelcome their support. It is a little late, but it is not too late. And \nwe hope that that translates into finally arriving at a measure which \nwill get at this practice of tax pork and spending pork.\n  In 1985, when the measure was offered by Senator Mattingly, \nRepublican from Georgia, only seven Democrats supported the effort. And \nin 1990, when I offered not the line-item veto or a separate \nenrollment, but when I offered enhanced rescission, only four Democrats \nsupported the effort and we failed, as did Senator Mattingly in 1985.\n  We failed because the effort was filibustered. We failed because \npoints of order were raised forcing us to achieve 60 votes to even get \nto debate. We did not even get to the debate of the issue.\n  In 1990, my colleague and partner in this effort, Senator McCain, \nalso offered enhanced rescission and he only got four Democrat votes. \nAnd in 1992, Senator McCain offered it again and this time he got \nseven. So there was some movement in our direction.\n  But then a year later, in 1993, I offered it, the same bill, enhanced \nrescission--the rescission process that the Democrats are now talking \nabout as the alternative and the substitute to what we are attempting \nto do--and we only got five. So I must not have been as persuasive as \nSenator McCain because we lost two Democrats.\n  And even in 1993, when Senator Bradley changed his position on this \nissue from being opposed to it but recognizing that something had to be \ndone, something had to be done to stop this runaway spending and this \nrunaway deficit and this runaway national debt, even then Senator \nBradley, as a Democrat, could only secure 13 Democrats and the measure \nfell once again.\n  And so we have had a decade of resistance--a decade of efforts to \nblock our attempts to pass rescission, enhanced rescission, separate \nenrollment, line-item veto. And every one of those efforts has been \ndefeated not by the votes of Republicans but defeated by the votes of \nDemocrats.\n  So it is a little difficult to sit here through this debate and hear \nthe protestations that, ``If Republicans would just cooperate. If they \nwould just lean a little more our way and see the bill as we see it, we \ncould have line-item veto or we could have enhanced rescission. And \nsomehow the Republicans are \n[[Page S4356]]  blocking a measure to give the President this \nauthority.'' When the fact of the matter is that it is only the \npersistence of Republicans, the persistence of those who continue to \noffer this year after year after year, that finally has translated into \nan election last November which gave us the necessary new Members to \nhave a chance at succeeding on this item.\n  Now a great deal has been said about why do we not take the Domenici-\nExon package; that the chairman of the Budget Committee at one time \nsponsored a provision which is being offered now as an alternative, and \nit must have been a pretty good effort in putting that bill together \nbecause both the chairman and the ranking member supported it.\n  Well, Senator Domenici did offer that alternative to the McCain-Coats \nenhanced rescission. He offered expedited rescission. And it was \npointed out that expedited rescission really was not a major change \nfrom the status quo. It was a modest improvement, but it did not really \nhave the strength of fundamentally changing the way we do business in \nthis body and it lacked the two-thirds vote necessary to override the \nPresident's decision. As such, the conclusion was the same 51 votes \nthat passed the appropriation in the first place, that voted for the \nappropriation, could overturn the President's decision and retain the \nvery items that raised the questions about pork-barrel spending in the \nfirst place.\n  And so, it was Senator Domenici who said, ``Why don't we look at an \nalternative that will be even stronger, that will expand the scope?\"\n  In fact, Senator Domenici said, ``My problem with the McCain-Coats \neffort is that it only focuses on the appropriated items. And the \nappropriated items, once you separate out defense, amounts to less than \n20 percent of the budget.'' He thought that was unfairly targeted to a \ncertain segment of spending and it would ignore other areas. That is \nthe reason he crafted the alternative bill.\n  And so we sat down with Senator Domenici and said, ``Well, let's \nexamine some ways that we could expand this and address the question \nthat you raised because that is a legitimate question.'' And Senator \nStevens weighed in on it and he had the same concerns.\n  Out of that came the product that we are now debating that has been \noffered by Senator Dole, the majority leader, as the Dole amendment, \nthe product around which we have secured the support of nearly every \nRepublican because it was expanded to include additional items and not \njust the appropriated items.\n  And it was Senator Domenici, right after the introduction of the Dole \namendment, the separate enrollment provision, that came to the floor \nand made a lengthy statement as to why the Dole amendment was so \nsuperior to his own product and why he was withdrawing his amendment \nthat had been reported out of the Budget Committee, his bill, his \nproduct, why he was withdrawing support for that in favor of a much \nbetter version, a much more effective version, a much tougher version, \na version with real teeth. He outlined that, and I want to quote from \nhis remarks.\n  As my colleagues have said, the alternative that they are providing \nmust be a good one because it was Senator Domenici's original proposal. \nYes, it was his original proposal, in response to a measure that he did \nnot think was strong enough because it did not include enough \ncategories.\n  As a result of that, we met and we crafted a much stronger version, \nand Senator Domenici came down here and said, ``This is what I was \nreally looking for and this is a much superior product.''\n  I quote from him where he said, reading from the Congressional Record \nof March 20, 1995, Senator Domenici said ``I support the objective of \nSenator McCain's bill,'' enhanced recision, ``but I felt the McCain \nbill shifted too much power over the budget of the President and \nfocused too much attention on just the appropriated accounts, which \nexcluding defense, represents less than 20 percent of total spending. \nThe Dole amendment provides a less cumbersome process to overturn \nPresidential rescissions.''\n  The McCain-Coats bill has a two-stage process where Congress would \nhave to vote two times if the President vetoed the first effort. He \nsaid the new Dole amendment offers a one-hurdle process, and for that \nreason it is superior to the product that he had originally sponsored.\n  Second, he said, ``The Dole amendment applies to all spending. It \napplies to new spending and legislation, not just appropriations \nlegislation. In addition, it applies to any new very narrow targeted \ntax benefit legislation and new entitlements.'' Third, he says, ``It \nprovides for congressional review. It contained a sunset in the year \n2000.'' I quote again, ``I congratulate Senator Dole. He has found an \napproach that significantly expands the President's authority over \nspending, without unduly disrupting the delicate balance of power.''\n  The minority leader suggests this evening that this is some kind of a \nsurprise because it is a substitute to the previously reported bills. \nThe truth of the matter is that every provision in this has either been \nvoted on by the Senate or discussed thoroughly in committee. And he \ngoes on to state why it is not a surprise, and I will get to that in a \nmoment.\n  I will conclude Senator Domenici's remarks by quoting one more time: \n``This product,'' referring to Senator Dole's amendment, ``is as close \nas we will ever get to a fair line-item veto that has a chance of \nworking and that is broader than we originally conceived but fair in \nthat respect. It is fair. I will suggest that if there are some who \nthink that the old bill which I introduced should be revisited, and \nperhaps the President supports it, let me set that one aside.''\n  Let me repeat that. Senator Domenici, the one who wrote the bill \nalong with Senator Exon, that was his initial effort, came to this \nfloor and said, ``I will suggest that if there are some who think that \nthe old bill which I introduced should be revisited, let me set that \none aside,'' and he withdrew that bill and signed on to the Dole bill \nbecause it was a much superior, much tougher, much broader, much more \neffective, and as Senator Domenici said, fairer to a line-item veto \nthat has a chance of actually working.\n  We have talked a lot about the practicality of this bill and it seems \nthat the opposition--Democrats opposing this bill--keep using the \nquestion of process and mechanics, and how this is going to complicate \nthe effort.\n  Well, the President of the United States does not think it will \ncomplicate the effort. They worry about sending too many pieces of \npaper down to the White House. The President of the United States said \nin his statement released on March 20, ``I urge the Senate to pass the \nstrongest possible line-item veto.'' He did not say, ``I urge the \nSenate to pass expedited rescission.'' Expedited rescission does not \nbegin to resemble a line-item veto. Veto means two-thirds override. It \ndoes not mean majority vote. It does not mean the same votes that pass \nthe appropriation in the first place are necessary to overturn what the \nPresident has vetoed. It means two-thirds. Give me the line-item veto, \nthe President said, in his letter.\n  This is about closing the door on business as usual in Washington. \nBusiness as usual in Washington is 51 votes to pass tax benefits, which \nI call tax pork, that go to certain individuals or specialized interest \nthat do not apply to broad classes. And it is spending pork which go to \nspecial individuals, special interests, and do not apply to the broad, \npublic interest.\n  The President wants the real thing because he knows the real thing is \nthe only thing that will make a difference. He knows if we will change \nthe spending habits of Congress, if we are going to change the process \nof blackmail in sending him--what I should call ``legislative \nblackmail''--in sending him bills, where it is a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition, he knows that he has to have some tool that will have some \nteeth in it, and some authority that has some clout in it. That is what \nthe President understands. That is what he has asked for.\n  We Republicans do not give him very much of what he asks for or do \nnot like to give him very much that he asks for, but this is something \nwe have been trying to support, and trying to give him for a very \nconsiderable amount of time.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Dole substitute grants the \nPresident \n[[Page S4357]]  true veto authority. It requires a two-thirds vote by \nCongress to continue spending. Short of an amendment to the \nConstitution, which we are not able to secure enough votes to pass --I \nwish we could--it is the strongest tool we can grant the President. It \nis similar to the authority that 43 other Governors currently enjoy.\n  The Exon expedited recision package does little to restore the \nPresident's authority to withhold spending that he enjoyed prior to \n1974. At that time, Congress decisively grabbed the absolute power of \nthe purse. The only thing they gave the President was the power to \npropose rescissions. Most of those recissions that the President and \nsubsequent Presidents proposed, never saw the light of day.\n  In 1974, the President sent up recissions and Congress ignored every \none of them. One hundred percent. They said, ``No thank you, Mr. \nPresident. Everything we passed, stands.'' In 1976, 86 percent of the \nPresident's rescissions were ignored. In 1983, 100 percent of the \nPresident's recissions were ignored. In 1986, 95 percent. In 1987, 97 \npercent.\n  Now, the Exon legislation, the expedited rescission just offered by \nthe minority leader, is a modest improvement because it says that at \nleast the President's rescissions are going to get a vote. But it is \nonly going to get a vote of the same people who passed it in the first \nplace, and it is hard to see how that will change what Congress had \npreviously done.\n  If we are ever going to reverse spending trends in this body, we do \nnot need modest improvements. We need fundamental change. To continue \nspending under the substitute or appropriately, under the amendment \noffered by the minority leader, the only standard they are proposing is \nthat Congress needs a simple majority, and if it fails to enact a bill \nwithin 45 days, the funds are automatically released.\n  What is being offered as a poor substitute, a weak substitute, to the \nclosest thing we can get to line-item veto is, simply put, too little \ntoo late.\n  It does nothing to restore that healthy tension necessary between the \nlegislative and executive branch necessary to impose fiscal discipline \non Members of the Congress. Some have said that the veto standard, the \ntwo-thirds is too high a standard, that it is too difficult to muster \nthe numbers to override it.\n  To those, I would say that the greater challenge today is to reduce \nour Nation's debt and balance our Nation's books. In this day, it \nshould be tougher. It should be a formidable challenge to continue to \nspend money. It is time for a higher standard.\n  If we get the job done by the year 2000, then maybe we will want to \nrevisit this. Maybe we will want to look at this and see whether or not \nit has been abused, this new authority of the President has been abused \nas some say that it might be. I do not think it will. It certainly has \nnot been at the State level. There are no State legislators calling for \nrepeal of the line-item veto power that their governors have.\n  It sets up a healthy tension, a healthy tension, a necessary tension \nthat can restore some discipline to this body.\n  The Dole bill is the strongest line-item veto bill. It presumes that \nfunding is rescinded unless the elimination of spending is specifically \ndisapproved. It requires a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate \nto override a subsequent veto.\n  Let us show the American people we are serious about fundamentally \nchanging the way this Congress does business. Let us show them that we \nintend to present appropriations bills and tax bills without \nembarrassment. Let us show them that we intend to send a message to the \ntaxpayers that under our guidance their dollars will not be wasted. Let \nus act boldly to eliminate the dual deficits of public funds and public \ntrust and let us resist the urge to continue business as usual.\n  The alternative offered by the minority leader is essentially \nbusiness as usual. The Dole amendment is a real meaningful, fundamental \nchange in the way this Congress spends taxpayers' dollars. It makes it \ntougher. It makes it a lot tougher. It ought to make it tougher because \nwe have abused the privilege that we have had as Members of this body \nby being irresponsible in the way we spend those dollars, by running up \na debt and by sending to the President items which we in our hearts \nknow do not deserve to be in those appropriations or in those tax \nbills.\n  So while I urge my colleagues to reject the proposal offered by the \nminority leader, we welcome their support for the concept. What they \nhave offered is too little too late.\n  Let us pass something that will make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief because we have \nbeen at it a long time today, and I am sure that I am not going to \nscore very many points at this time of the night and we will start \nagain tomorrow.\n  I would just like to briefly sum up if I can. Although it has not \nbeen mentioned in the lengthy debate tonight, I believe that any \nobjective Republicans, if we can find one up in this Chamber this time \nof night, would probably concede that the Senator from Nebraska has \nbeen one of those with a pretty strong career of voting for line-item \nveto matters in this Chamber. So all of us cannot be accused of being \nJohnny-come-latelies.\n  What has happened in the past, though, is not nearly as important as \nwhat we are doing here tonight. And I would simply say that Senator \nNunn in a remarkable, well thought out speech, that could in no way \ncould be considered a partisan statement at all, outlined some \nconcerns.\n  Regardless of the intent of the Dole amendment--and it may be \ndescribed correctly as what came out of a meeting of the Republican \ncaucus, this was the product that came out of it--that does not \nnecessarily guarantee the product is not faulty and probably should \nreceive some further corrections.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues on that side of the aisle who on more \nthan one occasion today have agreed to amendments that I thought were \nabsolutely critical and essential, and we have had them to come our \nway. I hope they would agree we are trying to be constructive and not \ndestructive in trying to fashion something in the form of a line-item \nveto that would be as safe as it possibly could be from a court \nchallenge that I am certain will follow if we eventually pass the Dole \nsubstitute amendment.\n  I happen to feel that with the comments again tonight about the \nconstitutionality problem and the operational problems manifold \noutlined by Senator Nunn, many of which I think had obviously not been \nconsidered when this product was put together, we must continue to \nreason together if we can and keep this as nonpartisan as possible and \ntry and pass a piece of legislation that is not going to be thrown out \nby the courts.\n  If that happens, it will not be an exercise, indeed, in futility. And \nsince I have indicated I have had more than my share of futility on \nthis very matter time and time again before with many of the key able \nplayers in this line-item veto we are talking about tonight, I just \nhope we can get something done rather than one more exercise in \nfutility and disappointment.\n  That is why I appeal, I appeal once again to let us reason together \nand not stick by the basic principle that what came out of the \nRepublican caucus--because I think the Republicans would even admit \nit--just because it came out of a Republican caucus of the majority \nparty in the Senate is a guarantee it is perfect.\n  Let me appeal once again, Mr. President, that on tomorrow when the \nsun comes up, as it will, when we will be back here again, let us see \nif debate and reason and sound statements on the floor of the Senate \nmean something and they are not going to be automatically shunted aside \non a strictly party line Republican vote, 54 people marching in \nlockstep because the product which came out of their caucus is somehow \nsacrosanct and must not be tampered with.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 350 to Amendment No. 347\n\n       (Purpose: To prohibit the use of savings achieved through \n     lowering the discretionary spending caps to offset revenue \n     decreases subject to pay-as-you-go requirements)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on another matter, on behalf of the senior \nSenator \n[[Page S4358]]  from West Virginia, I call up amendment No. 350, which \nthe clerk has at the desk, and ask for its report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 350 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, the numbers are now in for the trade deficit \nfor January, and they are not good. In fact, we set a new deficit \nrecord for a single month. The trade deficit surged over 68 percent, to \na highest ever mark of $12.2 billion.\n  Mr. President, I never have met two economists who agree on \neverything. Some say you should not pay too much attention to trade \ndeficit numbers. But most economists will tell you that continuously \nrising deficits in merchandise and services trade, year upon year, are \nunsustainable. Last year's overall merchandise trade deficit reached a \nrecord high $166 billion. The figures just released for January of this \nyear indicate that the growth is not slowing. The growth in our trade \ndeficit is in fact accelerating. This is deeply troubling.\n  Mr. President, the soaring trade deficit is not just a matter of the \nvolume of imports from abroad. A ballooning trade deficit affects the \nstrength of the dollar, interest rates, the stock and bond markets, and \nthe long-term attractiveness of the U.S. as a destination for \ninvestment. In other words, it threatens the standard of living of \nevery American.\n  Despite the potential enormity of this problem, the administration \nhas yet to focus on it as a real threat to working Americans. I am \nreminded that in the months and weeks leading up to the Mexico crisis, \nit seemed that no one in the administration was minding the store. We \ndo not yet know the full extent of the fallout from that catastrophe. \nMr. President, I hope we are not today headed down the same road with \nregard to our growing trade deficit. I hope those in the administration \ncharged with watchfulness are not asleep a the witch.\n  Mr. President, we must not place our economic stability at risk. We \nmust not allow warning signs to go unheeded. No single month's figures \nare conclusive, but when the bad numbers pile up month after month, \nthey must not be ignored.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4358-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF JOHN LAHR\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yesterday's edition of the Montana \nStandard contained an article that I especially enjoyed reading. Let me \nshare part of this article with my colleagues:\n\n       A special passenger train ran from Helena to Garrison and \n     back Sunday to honor retiring Montana Power Company lobbyist \n     John Lahr, a train buff * * *. Montana Rail Link furnished \n     the engines; Burlington Northern provided several refurbished \n     passenger cars * * * and the engineers union furnished the \n     engineers for what was billed with banners on the engines as \n     the ``John Lahr Special.''\n\n  When I read this I could not help but think how appropriate this \ntribute is; a special train to honor a very special man.\n  We hear a lot of bad talk about lobbyists these days. And, both in \nHelena and in Washington, there are some bad lobbyists; some who use \nstrong-arm tactics; some who urge elected representatives to vote \nagainst the public interest.\n  But anybody who knows John Lahr has seen living proof that lobbying \ncan be a noble profession. He is a class act. He's a Montanan through-\nand-through. And he wants what is best for our State.\n  For almost 30 years, John has represented Montana Power Co. \nLegislative session after legislative session, John has been there in \nHelena working tirelessly. And, while he has always been an advocate \nfor Montana Power, he sticks to the facts; he's honest; he levels with \npeople; and he's got what may be the best--and certainly the driest--\nsense of humor in all of Montana.\n  So perhaps it is not surprising that John--though a lifelong \nDemocrat--enjoys universal respect from both Republicans and Democrats \nin Helena.\n  While John may be retiring from the power company, I have no doubt he \nwill continue to play an important role in the life of our State. He \nhas too many friends; he has too much talent and he cares too deeply \nabout Montana to quietly retire.\n  I wish both John and his wife, Beverly, the best of luck as they \nbegin a new chapter in their lives. And I feel very fortunate to count \nthem as friends and trusted advisers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4358-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4358-S4359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEFF GRIFFITH\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a tribute \nto Jeff Griffith, one of my former staffers who died recently here in \nWashington, DC be printed in the Record.\n  Jeff was one of the original members of my Senate staff, and I was \ndeeply saddened by his death. While I know his family, friends and \nformer colleagues will miss him terribly, as I will, I hope we will \nalso remember his many accomplishments, and his passion for justice.\n  The tribute was offered on my behalf at the funeral service this past \nweekend.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [[Page S4359]] Tribute to Jeff Griffith\n\n       My name is Colin McGinnis, and I am a staffer for U.S. \n     Senator Paul Wellstone. I was a friend and colleague of \n     Jeff's. Paul was very sad that he wasn't able to be with \n     Jeff's family and friends here because of several \n     longstanding commitments in Minnesota, and has asked me to be \n     here to represent him and my Wellstone staff colleagues. Paul \n     asked me to read a message to you from him. He writes:\n       ``While I cannot be with you today, I send my prayers and \n     my heartfelt sympathies to Jeff's family and friends. Jeff \n     was one of the first members of my Senate staff. I had known \n     him for several years, and had worked with him on the \n     Reverend Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign and on the \n     Rainbow Coalition's other important work for justice, so I \n     knew that when the chance came to bring him on to my staff, I \n     should jump at the chance. I did.\n       ``He was talented, energetic, and creative in his work, and \n     was admired and respected by his colleagues on staff, who \n     often came to him for advice. He was also a fierce advocate \n     for social justice.\n       ``As one of my press assistants, Jeff did a wonderful job \n     under often difficult circumstances. During the sometimes \n     chaotic days of the Gulf War crisis, Jeff helped to establish \n     our press operation; no easy task. He was also instrumental \n     in the founding of my ``First Friday'' radio show. Thanks to \n     his hard work in laying its foundation, it has been very \n     successful. It still provides one of the most important ways \n     that I communicate directly with Minnesotans.\n       ``It is not by chance that this was Jeff's idea. The direct \n     and participatory nature of this live radio program was a \n     hallmark of his style, which always sought to bring people, \n     real people, into the political process, and to make sure \n     they were heard, even above the din and background static \n     that often passes for political debate in our country.\n       ``Jeff had a unique gift for hearing and amplifying the \n     voices of regular people, and lifting up those voices for \n     people in the wider community to hear.\n       ``He knew instinctively that communication, if it is \n     authentic, is always two-way, that his job was not just to \n     sell my ideas and programs and policies to those whom I \n     represent, but also to make sure I heard what the people were \n     saying, to heed their voices and be accountable to them--\n     especially those who are at society's margins. He never lost \n     sight of these people, and always struggled to do what he \n     could to bring them in toward the center. That was one of his \n     life's most important missions: to bring those at the margins \n     of our society back toward the center.\n       ``As we celebrate Jeff's life and accomplishments today, \n     and mourn his death, my wife Sheila and I, and the members of \n     my staff, extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to his \n     mother, Mrs. Ella Evans, his other family members, and to all \n     his many friends who cared so much for him. We will miss Jeff \n     very much, and keep you all in our prayers.''\n       I'd like to add a short personal note to Paul's letter, \n     from my own experience working with Jeff. he was a strong, \n     thoughtful, decent man, a person of integrity, and real \n     commitment to people. He had a quiet grace and wisdom that \n     was often striking. And because he had lived through his own \n     struggles, he was always willing to listen to his friends and \n     colleagues, in our struggles. He'd packed a lot of living \n     into his young life, and was not unscarred by it. But that's \n     just the point.\n       He knew suffering, and yet could look beyond it, redeem it, \n     and get others to do the same. He was a wounded healer. A \n     wounded healer whose life reminds us of how careful we must \n     be with one another. And this concern for people translated \n     from Jeff's personal life into his political life. In fact, \n     people were at the center of his vision.\n       He was once asked, during a particularly stressful period, \n     why he had decided to work in the political arena, and why he \n     was willing to put up with all the long hours and struggles \n     and stress that sometimes accompanies political life.\n       Without skipping a beat, he said simply, ``Because I build \n     bridges. And Lord knows we need bridges now.'' I will \n     remember him as a bridge-builder, with a warmth, generosity \n     of spirit, sense of humor and passion for justice that is \n     rare. I hope you will, too.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4358-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

She looked at life, both the good and the bad, and chose to \nshape her existence around the possible.

She reached out to those in need and \ngave kindness where none was expected.\n  Four of her nine children met early and untimely deaths. Still she \nlooked forward. She expanded not only her mind but her many talents. \nShe overcame challenges and embraced life's opportunities as they came, \nno matter what her age.\n  She was a woman of devout faith. Small in stature, she was large of \nheart and warm in spirit. Her home was a haven for friends and family.\n  Earlier this month, at the age of 89--and independent till her very \nlast day--she completed her mortality. She is survived by 5 children, \n39 grandchildren, 92 great-grandchildren, and 3 great, great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Her name was Helen Kamm Hatch.

PATRICK'S DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week, friends of Ireland celebrated \nSt. Patrick's Day in an atmosphere of hope. The guns have been silent \nin Northern Ireland for 6 months and it appears that the people of that \nconflict-torn land may at long last be on the irreversible road to \npeace.\n  Today, the British Government's Minister of State at the Northern \nIreland Office, Michael Ancram, met with Loyalist paramilitary \nrepresentatives, and Sinn Fein representatives and the British \nGovernment appear close to an agreement on an agenda for Ministerial \ntalks to begin soon.\n  Most important, the people of Northern Ireland themselves are hopeful \nthat this peace will last. The vast majority believe it is time to get \non with talks. Irish citizens from Dublin and other parts of Ireland \nare traveling to Belfast in greater numbers because the fear of \nviolence is disappearing. The people of Northern Ireland are going out \nin the evenings without fear of terrorist attacks. Peace is pervasive, \nand each day makes it harder for violence to return.\n  The United States has played a significant role in achieving this \nemerging peace, and great credit for it goes to President Clinton. He \nhas taken risks for peace in Northern Ireland. He has embraced all \nthose in Ireland who are willing to do the same. His foresight and \njudgment have been vindicated. Irish Americans congratulate him--but \nmost of all, we thank him, and so do the people of Ireland, Protestant \nand Catholic alike.\n  The President and Mrs. Clinton hosted a reception on St. Patrick's \nDay at the White House which was an historic occasion itself. John \nHume, John Alderdice, Gerry Adams and Gary McMichael--four men \nrepresenting vastly different political views in Northern Ireland--were \nall in attendance. The evening was brought to a close when John Hume \nand Gerry Adams sang the poignant song, ``The Town I loved So Well.'' \nThe final verses of the song, which is about John Hume's home town of \nDerry in Northern Ireland speaks to everyone who cares about this \nissue:\n\n     Now the music's gone but they carry on,\n     For their spirit's been bruised, never broken.\n     They will not forget, but their hearts are set\n     On tomorrow and peace once again.\n\n     For what's done is done, and what's won is won;\n     And what's lost is lost and gone forever.\n     I can only pray for a bright, brand new day\n     In the town I love so well.\n\n  [[Page S4360]] Mr. President, only time will tell whether the bright, \nbrand new day is finally here. But several recent articles verify the \nnew optimistic mood and praise President Clinton for the role he has \nplayed. I ask unanimous consent that excellent articles by James F. \nClarity in the New York Times, David Nyhan in the Boston Globe, Mary \nMcGrory in the Washington Post, and Patrick J. Sloyan in Newsday, as \nwell as the lyrics to ``The Town I Loved So Well,'' and an ad thanking \nPresident Clinton which appeared in the New York Times on St. Patrick's \nDay, may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 22, 1995]\n\n                    The I.R.A.'s Political Strongman\n\n\n        gerry adams seems able to sustain truce and advance aims\n\n                         (By James F. Clarity)\n\n       Dublin, March 21.--As a result of his delicate and much-\n     publicized visit last week to New York, Washington and the \n     White House, Gerry Adams appears to have strengthened himself \n     considerably as the political leader of the Irish Republican \n     Army, the man most Irish people think has great influence in \n     sustaining the I.R.A. cease-fire now in its seventh month.\n       And Mr. Adams, back in Dublin, also seems to have achieved \n     significant success on a number of tactical goals of Sinn \n     Fein, the I.R.A.'s political arm.\n       At home, in the military council of the I.R.A., Mr. Adams, \n     the president of Sinn Fein, has shown once again that his \n     political efforts are bringing the Republican movement \n     benefits and concessions it could not even dream of if the \n     I.R.A. re-started the guerrilla warfare in Northern Ireland.\n       In addition to gaining the right to raise funds for \n     political purposes in America, Mr. Adams was invited to meet \n     and chat with the President of the United States, to talk and \n     have his picture taken with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to \n     attend a White House party in a tuxedo, all proud signs that \n     he and his movement have come a long way from the days when \n     he led the I.R.A.'s Belfast Brigade and was interned by the \n     British for his trouble. On television screens all over the \n     world he achieved the major Republican goal of getting \n     international attention for his argument that the British \n     should relinquish power in their Northern Ireland province.\n       Perhaps the most significant result of all this, according \n     to Irish officials and independent experts, is that Mr. \n     Adams' influence with the I.R.A. has probably never been \n     stronger, and that he seems to be easily strong enough in \n     army councils to sustain the cease-fire, at least for several \n     months. Tim Pat Coogan, a historian whose writings on the \n     I.R.A. are standard reference material, said Mr. Adams and \n     his No. 2 in Sinn Fein, Martin McGuinness, who also has a \n     guerrilla background, now have effective control of the \n     military organization.\n       Mr. Adams' diplomatic victories, the experts say, have made \n     it more difficult for any I.R.A. commanders who may still be \n     restless with the peace effort to gain support among their \n     fighters for a resumption of attacks on military and civilian \n     targets in the North. While the I.R.A. reportedly keeps going \n     through the training motions of selecting putative targets, \n     the Roman Catholics in the North, particularly in Belfast, \n     press for continuing the talks, for trying to negotiate the \n     early release of I.R.A. prisoners and for the reform of the \n     overwhelmingly Protestant Royal Ulster constabulary, the \n     police force.\n       Mr. Coogan, who has many friends in Sinn Fein, and other \n     experts said that Northern Catholics and Protestants want \n     negotiations that could bring their imprisoned fathers, \n     husbands and sons home rather than military operations that \n     risk more death and imprisonment. And, among politicians, the \n     need to keep talking also reflects the rarely spoken fear \n     that a particularly heinous violation of the cease-fire, one \n     that killed several civilians or British police or soldiers, \n     could still collapse the peace effort.\n       Mr. Coogan and Irish officials said that Mr. Adams was \n     compelled to make a worth-the-price concession to the British \n     in order to gain Mr. Clinton's approval of his visit: his \n     agreement to discuss I.R.A. disarmament with British \n     ministers. Asked this week if he was still ready to discuss \n     I.R.A. disarmament at such talks, Mr. Adams said, \n     ``Absolutely,'' but he declined to say how soon that might \n     happen. Previously, Mr. Adams had insisted that disarmament \n     could only be discussed at all-party talks, including \n     Northern Ireland's Protestant leaders, as part of a final \n     peace settlement.\n       Two weeks before he left for America, Mr. Adams said, \n     ``Republicans are fairly patient,'' and would not expect to \n     be included in all-party political tasks on disarmament, for \n     three or four months.\n       Politically, outside the I.R.A., Mr. Adams has also won \n     concessions. Until he and John Hume, the influential leader \n     of the Catholic-dominated Social Democratic Labor Party, \n     began a secret peace initiative two years ago, Sinn Fein was \n     banned from the United States as a front for a terrorist \n     organization.\n       Now Mr. Hume, once a political enemy whose candidate \n     defeated Mr. Adams in the 1992 British Parlimentary election, \n     has personally introduced Mr. Adams to Mr. Clinton in \n     Washington. And Mr. Adams can visit America, raise money, \n     and, most important, he was achieved an old Sinn Fein \n     objective: pulling the White House directly and openly into-a \n     mediator's role between the I.R.A. and the British. American \n     pressure on London delights Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. because \n     it influences, and sometimes vexes, the British Government.\n       Mr. Adam's agreement, under White House pressure, to \n     discuss disarmament with British ministers was followed in a \n     matter of days by a British concession on the issue Mr. Adams \n     calls ``demilitarization'': the promised withdrawal of 400 \n     British troops from the North.\n       And Mr. Adams has held on to the political support of the \n     Irish Government of Prime Minister John Bruton, support that \n     seemed weakened when Mr. Bruton replaced Albert Reynolds \n     three months ago. Mr. Reynolds had urged Britain and the \n     United States to trust the I.R.A.'s stated good intentions, \n     to keep the cease-fire going even though they refused to \n     renounce forever the option of returning to violence.\n       Mr. Reynolds welcomed Mr. Adams to Dublin to discuss peace \n     at an open Government forum. Mr. Bruton had long been accused \n     of being more sympathetic to the Protestants in the North who \n     want to remain part of Britain than to the I.R.A. goal of a \n     united Ireland free of British control.\n       Mr. Bruton has continued to nudge Mr. Adams on disarmament \n     and on a categorial renunciation of violence, and he has \n     emphasized that the Protestant unionist majority in the North \n     has a right to reject a united Ireland in a referendum.\n       But Mr. Bruton has also given Mr. Adams a symbolic hand-\n     shake and talked with him privately, and he urged the White \n     House to let him visit last week. Some experts, invoking the \n     Nixon-and-China principle, see Mr. Bruton as the Irish leader \n     who has the best chance of gaining trust among Protestant \n     unionists and persuading them to talk to Sinn Fein, \n     eventually.\n       And Prime Minister Bruton, with the approval of all sides, \n     seems willing to continue to play the role of referee in the \n     sparring match between Sinn Fein and Britain, making sure \n     that the predictable but sometimes sharp jabs are not struck \n     too low and, with most of the audience hoping anxiously for a \n     draw, that neither side tries for a knockout.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 22, 1955]\n\n               Irish Eyes Smile on Clinton's Peacemaking\n\n                            (By David Nyhan)\n\n     But when I returned, Oh how my eyes did burn\n     To see how a town could be brought to its knees\n     By the armored cars and the bombed-out bars\n     And the gas that hangs on every breeze. . .\n                                  ``The Town That I Love So Well''\n       President Clinton put it as plainly as it can be put Friday \n     night: ``Those who take risks for peace are always welcome \n     under this roof.''\n       The largely Hibernian crowd in the East Room for the White \n     House St. Patrick's Day bash erupted. While some of the \n     Ulster Orangemen may fulminate and Britain's John Major keeps \n     Clinton's phone call on hold and the British papers go \n     berserk, Clinton's daring little Irish play is working, and \n     the crowd gave the boyish president his due.\n       The president was straight-faced, but you knew he had to be \n     winking inside, when he said: ``The Irish knew then (in \n     Thomas Jefferson's day) how to back a winner (the fledgling \n     United States).'' But no one missed the irony: Major's Tory \n     party had bet big on a George Bush victory, and Clinton's \n     overture to the Irish Republican Army and its political \n     mouthpiece, Gerry Adams, was a longshot that paid off \n     handsomely.\n       It was John Hume who prevailed upon Ted Kennedy and his \n     sister, Jean Smith, the U.S. ambassador to the Republic of \n     Ireland: Convince Clinton to lift the visa restriction on \n     Adams, the Sinn Fein spokesman, and allow him into the United \n     States to raise money and visibility--and to hell with the \n     British. Because Ted Kennedy is arguably Clinton's biggest \n     bulwark on the left, Hume's initiative prevailed, Adams \n     arrived here a year ago, and the pace was set for the cease-\n     fire that now obtains.\n       Any president, who can, with some dextrous diplomatic \n     jujitsu, end a 25-year-old, guerrilla war deserves some \n     credit. And this crowd gave it to him. Irish Prime Minister \n     John Bruton, a veteran back-bencher who suddenly emerged to \n     lead the government, lavished gratitude upon Clinton ``for \n     the role you have played personally, Mr. President.''\n       Four times as many Dubliners now travel north to Ulster \n     every day to shop and spend\n      and renew kinship ties, he said. ``There's a whole weight \n     lifted off our shoulders,'' said Bruton. ``We're a happy \n     land now.''\n       And it was the United States and ``the stand for decency \n     the United States has taken on so many occasions'' that made \n     the difference, Ireland's leader testified. ``The courage of \n     the US has been the key factor in preserving the peace (in \n     Europe) over 50 years. Thank you again for the tremendous \n     good you have done for our country.''\n       Ireland may be grateful; Britain is hopping mad, if last \n     weeks' London newspapers were any indication. To Britons, \n     Adams' is the bearded visage of terrorism, the voice \n     defending heinous bombers who killed kids, civilians, \n     contractors, cab drivers, who blew up Harrods and Airey Neave \n     and tried to kill Thatcher and did kill Mountbatten. Would \n     [[Page S4361]]  America like it if Britain's ruler invited \n     the Lockerbie bombers to 10 Downing St. for tea? Not hardly.\n       But Clinton's gamble paid off. And he was toasted for it by \n     a crowd that included plenty from around here. There were \n     three O'Neills, enough Dunfeys to fill a bus and pairs of the \n     following: Bulgers (the Senate president and son Bill), \n     Flynns (Ambassador to the Vatican Ray and son Eddie), Kings \n     (administration personnel czar Jim and son Patrick) and at \n     least two Jesuits (BC President J. Donald Monan and former US \n     Rep. Robert F. Drinan).\n       But the real pair of the evening came late, when many had \n     left, and after Mark Gearan, the top Bay Stater on Clinton's \n     staff, prevailed upon Bill Bulger Sr. to give us a tune. He \n     responded with, ``I come from the County Kerry; I'm a typical \n     Irish-man.'' But then, Bulger said yesterday, ``I saw John \n     Hume give me the sign he had a song. So I called him up, and \n     he did ``The Town I Love So Well.'' That tune is the \n     traditional lament for Derry, Hume's battle-scarred hometown \n     in the North.\n       Bulger: ``So then I gave Gerry Adams the sign to come up, \n     and they did it as a duet.'' The sight and sound of Hume and \n     Adams singing under Bulger's benign tutelage in the East \n     Room, with the cease-fire holding, is all due to Clinton.\n       Bulger, back in Boston, said: ``This is a real success. \n     It's incredible. Everyone had said `no' to Adams. It was a \n     real bold thing to do. The president broke that stalemate.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n                    Irish Eyes Have Reason To Smile\n\n       Bill Clinton had a grand moment in the East Room at his \n     second St. Patrick's Day party. The Prime Minister of \n     Ireland, John Bruton, said to him, ``We're a happy land now, \n     thanks to the stand and courage that you and your colleagues \n     have shown, Mr. President.'' He further told his host that he \n     had been right and Dublin had been wrong about taking a \n     chance on Sinn Fein. It was the kind of ungrudging, \n     overflowing approval and vindication Clinton seldom hears. It \n     was the stuff of ethnic campaign commercials.\n       But he missed a moment of triumph, a tableau of Irish unity \n     and harmony that sent the audience into roaring raptures and \n     left them with a memory for the generations.\n       The Clintons had left. The guests lingered. The Clintons, \n     who forgot that the Irish rarely ``go gentle into that good \n     night'' from a good party, sent down instructions for music \n     to say good night to. Communications director Mark Gearan \n     went to the piano, Billy Bolger, the little Caesar of the \n     Massachusetts Senate and an eager tenor, was easily recruited \n     and ``When Irish Eyes Are Smiling'' was heard once again. \n     Suddenly Bolger stopped. ``I think we should hear from John \n     Hume,'' he said.\n       Hume, the valiant leader of the Catholic party in Northern \n     Ireland, came up and began to sing his theme song, ``The Town \n     that I Love So Well.'' He was into the second or third verse \n     when a dark, bearded figure joined him on the stage. It was \n     Gerry Adams, and with arms around each other, they finished \n     the song. The audience went wild. As soon as they recognized \n     Adams, they began cheering, and as the pair continued, they \n     stood up applauding. Adams's smile, for once, was not mocking \n     or supercilious. `History,'' they told each other, a \n     settlement in song in the Clinton White House.\n       ``Those who take risks for peace are always welcome under \n     this roof,'' Clinton had said in his welcome to the prime \n     minister. No one took a greater chance than Hume, the bright, \n     careworn favorite of Irish-American politicians, who sought \n     out the spokesman and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the \n     terrorist IRA, was discovered, harassed, threatened to the \n     point when he spent weeks in a hospital with a bleeding ulcer \n     and a bad case of despair. Hume convinced our ambassador Jean \n     Kennedy Smith and her brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, that \n     Adams was the key. Kennedy prevailed upon the president, and \n     a year ago February, while the British raged, Clinton gave \n     Adams a visa for a 48-hour U.S. stay.\n       Adams maddens many because he insists on talking about Sinn \n     Fein as if it were a stamp club. When arms and bombs and \n     kneecappings and hideous murders of parents before the eyes \n     of their children come up, he looks pained and recoils. What \n     would he know about all that? But last August, he came \n     through. A cease-fire came into effect, the Catholics and \n     Protestants of Ulster began to breathe. The shadow of the \n     gunman disappeared from the streets of Belfast. Plans for \n     Anglo-Irish talks were resumed.\n       It's still a long way to Tipperary, but another milestone \n     was passed when Clinton again leaned into the wind from \n     London, and not only let Adams come to Washington and the \n     White House, but let him raise money for Sinn Fein. Britain \n     saw it as a cheap bid for the votes of America's 40 million \n     Irish. Outrage led the British press. Adams raised $80,000 at \n     one New York lunch, and the British boiled over with warnings \n     that the money would go to buy arms to replace those that are \n     supposed to be ``decommissioned.'' Not a farthing, Adams \n     promised. John Major refused to take Clinton's calls.\n       But everyone at the White House gala was happy and hopeful, \n     particularly the Bostonians, who outnumbered all others. Ray \n     Flynn, Boston's erstwhile mayor and now Clinton's envoy to \n     the Vatican, was telling people the good news that while on a \n     confidential political mission to Pennsylvania, he had found \n     out that Reagan Democrats had put aside their differences on \n     gays in the military and such, and are coming home.\n       A number of nervous Irishmen seemed to have checked their \n     misgivings at the door. They were delighted to be able to \n     give their views in the splendors of the Executive Mansion. \n     Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party had a good chat \n     with Sen. Kennedy. Outside a handful of members of the \n     Families Against Intimidation and Terror picketed and \n     leafletted passersby. They were protesting the 46 beatings \n     that have been administered by both sides, Unionists and IRA, \n     since the cease-fire. Iron bars and clubs with nails are \n     used. The protesters had hoped to be invited in, they were \n     not but were assuaged by a visit to the Security Council the \n     following morning.\n       On Sunday, Major resumed speaking to the president and \n     expressed the hope of putting it all behind. Adams landed in \n     Dublin and said, with his usual surprise that anyone would \n     ask, that no one had pressured him on decommissioning arms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsday, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n                      Sinn Fein Balks at Disarming\n\n                         (By Patrick J. Sloyan)\n\n       Dublin.--A plump dove, white on a purple backdrop, flew \n     over the conference, streaming the Irish tricolor wrapped \n     around the slogan: ``Create Peace: Unite Ireland.''\n       ``Does anyone want to speak?'' Gerry Adams, president of \n     Sinn Fein, asked delegates to its annual conference. ``We \n     welcome your criticism.''\n       As the meeting of the Irish Republican Army's political \n     wing droned to a close yesterday, Adams seemed miffed over \n     news accounts of grumbling delegates. Some were dismayed by \n     the tepid tone of freedom fighters turned peacemongers.\n       Owen Bennett stalked to the Mansion House microphone. ``No \n     one can promise some future generation will not resort to \n     arms to win self-determination,'' Bennett said. He was from \n     south Armagh, a hotbed of IRA warfare for the past quarter of \n     a century. A roar filled the hall.\n       Until the IRA ceasefire last August, many of the delegates \n     lived by nationalist-intellectual Patrick Pearse's slogan: \n     ``Life springs from death. And from the graves of patriot men \n     and women spring living nations.'' It was on a banner set \n     discreetly to one side in the conference hall and was \n     decorated not with doves but crossed rifles, a revolver and a \n     pike.\n       Only a few blocks away is the Dublin post office seized on \n     Easter 1916 by Pearse and comrades determined to end \n     England's rule of Ireland. Now, 79 years later, Adams and the \n     heirs to that uprising were closer than ever to that goal.\n       But handling doves, as Adams is learning, is far trickier \n     than wielding a pike. The next step toward a permanent peace \n     in Northern Ireland and the beginning of an eventual union \n     between Irish north and south could be a difficult one for \n     the IRA.\n       Before starting negotiations on the Belfast framework \n     announced last week, British Prime Minister John Major wants \n     the Sinn Fein to give up thousands of IRA rifles, rocket \n     launchers, pistols and grenades and tons of hidden \n     explosives.\n       ``There has to be substantial progress made on the\n        decommissioning of arms,'' Sir Patrick Mayhew said \n     yesterday. He is the British government's Secretary of \n     Northern Ireland and has refused to talk with Sinn Fein. \n     Instead, his staff conducted preliminary talks on Mayor's \n     behalf with Sinn Fein emissaries.\n       ``We have told the British that Sinn Fein does not have any \n     weapons,'' said Martin McGuinness, who represented the \n     organization in talks with Mayhew's staff. Most delegates at \n     Mission House will wink at that one. McGuinness is reputed to \n     be military commander of the IRA, succeeding Adams in \n     directing attacks in Northern Ireland.\n       But McGuinness drew applause with a reminder that it was \n     Sinn Fein's unilateral initiative that produced the cease \n     fire that has sparked the peace process.\n       ``We told them, just in case the reality had escaped them, \n     that the British government and the British army had not \n     defeated the IRA; that the IRA had not surrendered and that \n     the British government could not even remotely expect Sinn \n     Fein to deliver that surrender for them,'' McGuinness said to \n     cheers.\n       Adams has a counterproposal: decommission British and \n     Unionist guns as well as IRA weapons. And demilitarize the \n     province by eliminating 13,500 Royal Ulster Constabulary \n     police at 161 stations and removing 19,000 British troops at \n     135 forts.\n       London is inching toward Sinn Fein demands. Border \n     checkpoints have become largely unmanned traffic snarls. \n     British army patrols have decreased dramatically, and \n     soldiers have vanished from some areas. Some British \n     government officials say troops could be withdrawn as \n     security needs subside.\n       Dublin government officials see a precedent for Sinn Fein \n     disarmament. When the 26 counties of the south won \n     independence in 1937, the IRA turned over many of their \n     weapons to help equip a new Irish army. ``But it would be \n     difficult now,'' said an aide to Deputy Irish Prime Minister \n     Dick Spring. ``Gerry Adams has to deal with the `hard men' \n     [extremists] in the Sinn Fein.'' \n     [[Page S4362]] \n       One possible compromise would be the release of an \n     estimated 600 IRA prisoners in Ulster and British prisons \n     coinciding with a Dublin decommisssioning of IRA weapons.\n       In the meantime, Adams and Major's demand for IRA weapons \n     is merely a dodge to stall the start of all-party talks, \n     including Sinn Fein and Unionist paramilitary leaders as well \n     as government officials from Dublin, Belfast, and London.\n       In response to Mayhew's statement yesterday demanding \n     progress on disarmament, Adams said: ``He wants to make up \n     his mind. It is a precondition of talks or it's not a \n     precondition.''\n       The Sinn Fein leader was daring Major to obstruct an Irish \n     peace process that has revived his slipping political \n     fortunes in Britain. A Gallup Poll financed by the London \n     Telegraph showed 92 percent of Britain voters supported the \n     Belfast framework and 68 percent believed Ulster Unionists \n     were wrong not to participate in the talks.\n       Another poll, commissioned by British television among \n     Northern Ireland's Unionist voters, approved the plan. Ulster \n     Marketing found 81 percent of the more moderate Unionist \n     party members favored the framework, which also was supported \n     by 61 percent on the more conservative Democratic Unionist \n     Party.\n       ``The British government position [on IRA disarmament] is \n     untenable,'' said Sinn Fein's McGuinness. ``It has to \n     change.''\n

vision in granting U.S. visas to leaders of the \n     Republican and Loyalist communities, who now wish to take the \n     gun forever out of Irish politics, was vital.\n       Your overall encouragement of the British and Irish \n     governments as they signed their historic Joint Framework \n     Document was inspiring.\n       By your actions, you have made clear how much the United

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Old Spanish Trail and the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail \nfor potential inclusion into the National Trails System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   old Spanish trail designation act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I'm sending legislation to the \ndesk to designate the Old Spanish Trail and the northern branch of the \nOld Spanish Trail for study for potential addition to the National \nTrails System.\n  [[Page S4366]] The Old Spanish Trail has been called the ``longest, \ncrookedest, most arduous pack mule route in the history of America.'' \nLinking two quaint pueblo outposts, Villa Real de Sante Fe de San \nFrancisco--now known as Santa Fe; and El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La \nReina de Los Angeles--present day Los Angeles--this 1,200 mile route \nwas a well worn path 150 years ago as annual caravans traded woolen \nblankets from New Mexico for California horses and mules.\n  According to an early historian, the trail:\n\n       * * * Headed Northwest from Santa Fe * * * eased over the \n     Continental Divide in northern New Mexico, cut through a spur \n     of the Rocky Mountains into Colorado, forded two swift rivers \n     (the Colorado and the Green above their junction), circled \n     northward to avoid the Grand Canyon's sculptured country, \n     dipped over the rim of the Great Basin into Utah, and crept \n     southwest through desert stretches of Nevada and California \n     to Los Angeles * * * Hoofs of pack animals leave but fleeting \n     imprints. As soon as the last mule train and left the Trail, \n     nature closed in to obliterate marks of human intrusion. \n     Matted brush sprang up to hide the mountain paths. Flash \n     floods gullied the gravel courses beside the streams. Chalky \n     gypsum surfaced the dry lake bottoms, so welcome to the hoofs \n     of foot-sore mules. Wind-born sand drifted over the shallow \n     trace through the wastelands. Even the dry bones that marked \n     the toll of an insatiable desert's greed crumbled to dust.\n\n  The trail entered present day Colorado south of Pagosa Springs and \nproceeded northwesterly past today's settlements of Arboles, Ignacio, \nDurango, Mancos, Dolores, and Dove Creek. This is essentially the route \nused by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante in 1776. Unlike Dominguez and \nEscalante, the trail continued to the northwest toward the site of \npresent day Monticello and crossed the Grand (Colorado) River at Moab \nand the Green River, 5 miles north of today's settlement of Green \nRiver. It continued westerly and passed the present settlements of \nCastle Dale, Salina, Sevier, Parowan, Newcastle, and St. George in \nUtah.\n  Another historic trade route, known as the northern branch of the Old \nSpanish Trail, was used by trappers and traders to access northwestern \nColorado and northeastern Utah. This route followed the east side of \nthe Rio Grande river northward to Taos and into Colorado to the area \nnear the present town of Alamosa. Another route of the northern branch \nfollowed the west side of the Rio Grande northward to Tres Piedras, New \nMexico, and to Antonito, Colorado, and joined the other branch near \nMonte Vista. From the vicinity of Monte Vista, the trail continued \nnorthwesterly and\n passed the present day settlements of Saguache, Gunnison, Montrose, \nDelta, and Grand Junction. From Grand Junction, the trail followed the \nGrand (Colorado) River for some 50 miles through Fruita and Loma to \nnear Dewey, UT, and then struck out northeast across the desert and \njoined the main Spanish Trail approximately 20 miles southeast of the \nGreen River crossing.\n\n  The northern branch was less used than the main Spanish Trail and \nvery little is recorded concerning its use. Antoine Robidoux's trading \nfort, near Delta, was a principal outpost on the trail.\n  The first person to record his journey from Santa Fe to Los Angeles \nwas Antonio Armejo, who went on a trading expedition in 1829. His route \nhad never been properly documented until 10 years ago when a historian \nfrom the University of Nevada began a study of the origins of the trail \nfor her masters thesis. Much of what we know about the trail comes from \nrecent scholarship and there is obviously much left to learn.\n  A journey over the Spanish Trail and the northern branch in 1848 was \nlater recorded by Lt. George B. Brewerton. The young lieutenant \naccompanied a party of some 30 men which included the noted scout, Kit \nCarson. Carson was carrying mail from Los Angeles to the East Coast. \nThe party left Los Angeles on May 4 and reached Santa Fe via Taos on \nJune 14, 41 days later. Carson proceeded east, reaching Washington, DC \nin mid-August, bringing news of the discovery of gold in California, \nand the great gold rush was on.\n  Another description of the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail \nin Colorado is told in the report of the Gunnison Expedition. In 1853, \nCapt. John Williams Gunnison, of the U.S. Corps of Topographic \nEngineers, was commissioned by the War Department to find a route for \nthe railroad across the Colorado Rockies along the 38th Parallel. The \nparty of 31 men and 32 U.S. Army Dragoons left Fort Leavenworth, KS, on \nJune 23, 1853. Among the civilians were a topographer, an artist-\ntopographer, an astronomer, a botanist, a geologist-surgeon, and a \nwagon master and his crew to manage the 18-unit wagon train.\n  After crossing the Sangre de Cristo Range, north of La Veta Pass, the \nGunnison Expedition came upon the northern branch of the Spanish Trail \nin the San Luis Valley. Captain Gunnison followed this existing trade \nroute of the northern branch of the Spanish Trail into eastern Utah \nwhere it joined the main Spanish Trail. The Gunnison Expedition came to \na tragic end on October 26, 1853, when Gunnison and four of his men and \nthree soldiers were killed in a skirmish with Indians near the present \nsite of Delta, UT.\n  The Old Spanish Trail played a part in all the cultures that occupied \nthe West: the Utes, Navajos, Spaniards, Mexicans, and American \nsettlers, including the mormons. The trail's period of use, from 1830 \nto the 1880's spans the development of the West,\n from the Spaniard on foot to the great railways. Few routes, if any, \npass through as much relatively pristine country as the Old Spanish \nTrail, particularly in northwest New Mexico, western Colorado, central \nUtah, southern Nevada and southern California. A number of independent \nscholars and various researchers have begun separate studies of \ndifferent segments of the trail, and an Old Spanish Trail Assoc. was \nrecently founded in Colorado to study and preserve this trail, and \nraise the public awareness of our country's diverse cultural heritage \nin this region. Some of the members of the association have already \nlocated wagon ruts and other vestiges of the trail's heyday, and a \nproper study is certain to produce more such exciting echoes of our \nshared heritage.\n\n  These is a groundswell of support for a study of the Old Spanish \nTrail. I've received resolutions to designate the trail as historic \nfrom over 20 municipalities in Colorado, as well as the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly. There are also a number of volunteer groups along the \ntrail who are anxious to offer their services, expertise and assistance \nto this very exciting and long overdue endeavor.\n  The time has come to acknowledge the national historical importance \nof the Old Spanish Trail. Mr. President, this bill to designate the Old \nSpanish Trail for study for potential addition to the National Trails \nSystem promotes the recognition, protection and interpretation of our \nhistory in the West. By introducing this legislation today, we pay \ntribute to the cultures of the West, and to an important period in \nAmerican history.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(36) The Old Spanish Trail, beginning in Santa Fe, New \n     Mexico, proceeding through Colorado and Utah, and ending in \n     Los Angeles, California, and the Northern Branch of the Old \n     Spanish Trail, beginning near Espanola, New Mexico, \n     proceeding through Colorado, and ending near Crescent \n     Junction, Utah.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n        Pressler):\n  S. 588. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 with respect to rules governing litigation contesting \ntermination or reduction with respect to rules governing litigation \ncontesting termination or reduction of retiree health benefits; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 retiree health benefits protection act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week on the floor of the Senate I \nspoke about the struggles of the 1,200 retirees \n[[Page S4367]]  of the John Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, \nwho, along with over 2,000 other company retirees around the country, \nfound out in January that their health benefits--benefits they believed \nthey would have for life--were being abruptly terminated. These \nretirees, many of whom had accepted lower pensions in return for the \npromise of lifetime health benefits, were suddenly faced with the \nprospect of paying up to $500 a month per couple for health insurance \nor losing the benefits that they had assumed would be available during \ntheir retirement years.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to help these retirees and their \nfamilies; legislation that would restore their health benefits as they \nseek redress in court and establish protections against such arbitrary \nbehavior by employers in the future.\n  My bill would protect retirees' health benefits in two ways:\n  First, it would require employers to continue to provide retiree \nhealth benefits while a cancellation of benefits is being challenged in \ncourt. Anyone who has dealt with our legal system and its long waiting \nperiods and delays knows the importance of this measure.\n  Why should anyone who has worked for 20 or 30 years be forced to \nspend his or her life savings on health insurance--or go without health \ninsurance entirely--while their pleas for simple justice wind through \nthe courts?\n  Second, my bill would eliminate the surprise nature of employee \nhealth benefit cancellations by requiring employers to prove they had \nwarned workers in advance, before they retire, that their future \nbenefits could be canceled at some time in the future. That seems only \nfair.\n  This legislation recognizes that health benefits are not charity. \nMany workers give up larger pensions and other benefits in exchange for \nthem. It never occurs to these workers that their benefits could be \ntaken away, with no increase in their pensions or other benefits to \ncompensate for the loss.\n  Many workers stay with the same company for dozens of years, perhaps \nall of their adult lives. They believe that a company they help build \nwill reward their loyalty, honesty, and hard work.\n  Unfortunately, this is not always the case, as the 3,300 retirees of \nJohn Morrell & Co. found out only a week before their benefits were \nterminated.\n  In this particular case, Morrell retirees received a simple, yet \nunexpected, letter stating their health insurance plan was being \nterminated, effective midnight, January 31, 1995--only a week later. \nThe benefits being terminated, the letter said, included all hospital, \nmajor medical, and prescription drug coverage, Medicare supplemental \ninsurance, vision care, and life insurance coverage.\n  For those retirees under 65, this action poses a particular problem. \nWhile Morrell gave them the option of paying for their own coverage for \nup to 1 year, few can afford the $500 monthly premium for a couple. And \nmany cannot purchase coverage at any price, because of preexisting \nconditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n Medicare beneficiaries would have to buy expensive supplemental \ninsurance on their own.\n\n  Morrell's decision was all the more painful to the retirees because \nit was so unexpected. These retirees believed they worked for a fair \ncompany; that a fair day's work resulted in a fair day's pay. Part of a \nfair day's pay is the retirement income and benefits employees earn \nthrough their service.\n  These retirees found out the hard way that the company they had \nhelped to build had turned its back on them.\n  They also found out that the court system was not sympathetic to \ntheir cause. An Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling allowed the \ncompany to take this action. The union representing the retirees plans \nto appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.\n  Sadly, some of the retirees won't live long enough to benefit from a \npossible reversal.\n  These proud and hard-working people now worry that high medical costs \nwill impoverish them or force them to rely on their children or the \ngovernment for financial help. Each day they live in fear of illness \nand injury because they have no health insurance.\n  Because this legislation is not just for the Morrell retirees, \nbecause what happened to these workers is not an isolated situation--it \ncould happen to any of the 14 million retired workers who believe they \nand their families have life-long health insurance coverage through \ntheir employers.\n  Two-thirds of American companies surveyed recently had plans to \nreduce retiree health benefits or to shift more costs to retirees.\n  The Morrell dispute is one of 35 cases nationwide in which retirees \nare suing their former companies for slashing those benefits, or \ncutting them altogether.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the long-run solution is comprehensive \nhealth reform that guarantees every American--and employer--access to \naffordable health care.\n  I have fought over the years for this kind of comprehensive reform \nand was deeply disappointed when the 103d Congress was unable to pass \nlegislation addressing some of our health care system's most serious \nproblems. If we had passed health reform, the Morrell retirees would \nnot be facing this loss of their health benefits today.\n  Clearly, the problems we talked about in last year's health reform \ndebate did not solve themselves when the session ended.\n  And some of these problems, like the one the Morrell retirees face, \ncannot wait for the long-run. These retirees cannot wait for the \nresolution of the health reform debate.\n  The new majority in Congress seems to believe the solution to all our \nproblems--economic, social, moral, you name it--is passing their so-\ncalled Contract With America.\n  I believe the solution is restoring the old contract between workers \nand employers. The contract that said if you work hard, you can get \nahead. The contract that said if you give a company 20 or 30 years of \nloyal service, you can retire with dignity. The contract that said if \nyou give someone your word, you will keep it.\n  Restoring that contract must be our ultimate aim.\n  In the meantime, I am determined to work with my colleagues in \nCongress to make sure retirees can keep their health insurance while \nthey wait for their day in court, and to be sure that no other retirees \nget an unexpected letter in the mail, similar to the one the Morrell \nretirees received.\n  That is the goal of the legislation that I am introducing today.\n  I hope we can pass this measure expeditiously, to end the injustice \nof the Morrell situation, and so that others never have to face the \nproblem Morrell retirees are grappling with today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to permit \nGovernors to limit the disposal of out-of-State solid waste in their \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n           INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Interstate \nTransportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. For the past 5 \nyears, I have fought to give all States and local communities the right \nto say ``No'' to out-of-State trash. I am convinced that interstate \nwaste legislation is necessary so that States and communities can \nintelligently plan their waste disposal needs.\n  As interstate waste legislation has traveled through the Senate and \nthe House, we have learned important principles in the effort to \nprotect importing States while allowing exporters sufficient time to \nadjust to new rules. My bill incorporates these important principles.\n  First, my bill allows the importing States to ratchet down the amount \nof trash they receive. Beginning in 1997, landfills and incinerators \nthat receive more than 50,000 tons of trash may reduce the amount of \nout-of-State trash they import.\n  Second, my bill requires the exporting States to reduce the\n   amount of trash that they export by certain target dates. This \nprovision allows for a gradual adjustment on the part of the large \nexporting States.\n\n  Third, my bill allows all States to choose between 1993 and 1994 \nfreeze levels. This provision ensures flexibility without sacrificing \nprotection from flow levels that fluctuate.\n  Finally, my bill will provide additional backup authority to limit \nwaste flows by allowing the State planning and permitting process to \ntake into account local need when siting new capacity. Under this \nprovision, a State could deny a permit for construction or operation of \na new landfill based on the fact that there is no local or regional \nneed.\n  The flow of waste across State lines is not a new problem. States \nlike Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Indiana have suffered \nunder the tremendous volumes of out-of-State waste. States have tried \nto stop the growing shipments of interstate waste by enacting \nlegislation that restricts the flow. Yet, courts have held many of \nthese laws in violation of the commerce clause and therefore \nunconstitutional. In order to address the constitutional question, \nCongress must legislate the issue.\n  During the past 5 years, Congress has come close to giving the States \nthe power to enact interstate waste legislation. Many of my colleagues \nhave worked very hard to see that this is finally accomplished. We have \nhad to give and take on both sides. I am hopeful that this is the year \nthat Congress can complete the task.\n  This legislation issues a simple plea for each community, each State, \nto be responsible for the environment, and accountable for the trash \nthey generate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Matt Clawson; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    private relief for matt clawson\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of Matt Clawson of Pocatello, ID. Mr. Clawson has been required \nto pay dearly for mistakes made by his Government. His plaintive appeal \nfor help is a proper place for Congress to begin redressing and \nreforming profligate regulatory excesses, abuses, and injustices by \nthis Government against its citizens.\n  Mr. Clawson obtained from the U.S. Forest Service all of the required \napprovals for his mining claim and plan of operations on the Middle \nFork of the Salmon River near the Frank Church River of No Return \nWilderness in Idaho. He spend what was for him an enormous sum of money \nto develop and begin working the claim according to Forest Service \nrequirements. Shortly thereafter, however, and before he could recover \nany of his investment, he was required to cease operations. The reason \nwas a lawsuit and subsequent court rulings that found the Forest \nService had erred in granting the approvals.\n  This bill simply reimburses Mr. Clawson's expenses with interest \n[[Page S4370]]  added. It does not attempt to provide compensation for \nany purported value of the claim. He has exhausted all of his legal \nremedies, necessitating this private relief bill. I believe the \ncompensation is more than warranted. Moreover, U.S. Claims Court Judge \nWiese commented on the record that Mr. Clawson's case had ``been a very \ntroubling case'' for him and he believed ``this man should be given \nsome relief somewhere.'' That somewhere can only be, and must be, here.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 592.

Mr. President, one issue about which all of us have \nheard from our constituents, over and over again, is the need for \nfundamental reform of the tortured and increasingly tangled web of \nFederal overregulation. Perhaps more than in any other area of Federal \nGovernment regulation, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration [OSHA] has come to symbolize what is wrong. Today I \noffer a bill to reform the laws that were originally intended to ensure \nworkplace safety.\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate on numerous occasions in \nrecent months on examples of Federal Government overregulation, of the \nunintended consequences of regulatory excess that puts Americans out of \nwork, usurps our constitutional rights, and saps our productivity and \neconomic competitiveness. OSHA problems are always at the top of my \nconstituents' concerns.\n  For example, in my home State of Texas, an OSHA compliance officer \nfrom the Corpus Christi area office, stated under oath that OSHA area \ndirectors are under enormous pressure to produce high numbers of \ncitations and penalties--that OSHA employees' job performance \nevaluations apparently depend on meeting de facto quotas. This same \nOSHA compliance officer also testified that his supervisor directed him \nto cite companies, even when both the supervisor and the inspector knew \nfull well a company did not violate any regulation and did not warrant \na citation. In the words of this conscientious officer, his supervisors \ntold him to hit the employer.\n  In otherwords, Mr. President, one regulator can carry on a vendetta \nagainst an innocent business, thus jeopardizing that business and \neveryone who depends on that business to support themselves and their \nfamilies. This sort of thing is not supposed to happen in America, and \nit is Congress' job to make sure it does not.\n  Congress originally established OSHA to protect Americans from the \nthreat of injury in the workplace. OSHA was charged with investigating \nand, if necessary, penalizing businesses that willfully endangered its \nworkers. Businesses and workers have a mutual interest in promoting \nworkplace safety. No responsible businessman or businesswoman would \nintentionally put another human being at risk. Furthermore, accidents \nreduce productivity and cost money; they deprive businesses of their \nmost important, hardworking, productive employees. No business prospers \nwhen its employees are ill or injured.\n  Congress founded OSHA with the hope and expectation that the Federal \nGovernment could encourage businesses and employees to work\n together to resolve problems and to foster safer working environments. \nMr. President, this hope has been dashed--dashed by the congress' \nfailure to update Federal safety laws to keep pace with changes in the \nworkplace, dashed by the emergence of a culture of regulatory excess \nthat eats away at the vitality of our economy.\n\n  Therefore, I introduce a bill today to restore what Congress intended \n25 years ago, when OSHA was created, and to inject into our regulatory \nagencies some common sense and sound objective criteria. My bill aims \nto foment real cooperation between employer, employee and the Federal \nGovernment, and to ensure that OSHA's resources are focused on the \nsafety issues the American people want to have protected--not on \nvendettas against certain businesses, not on quotas for Federal \ninspectors to meet, not on tearing down labor-management cooperation we \nmust have if we are to continue as the world's most productive and \ndynamic economy.\n  A safe worksite is everybody's responsibility, but today that is not \nthe case. Laws are enforced so that the responsibility rests \nexclusively on the employer. Employers must be held accountable, but \nthe frivolousness manner in which safety laws are applied in many cases \ndoes nothing to improve safety and does incalculable harm to American's \nconfidence in their Government.\n  Not long ago, the Indiana OSHA found the owner of an Indiana Handy \nMart liable for not providing a safe workplace after an armed bandit \nrobbed and killed an employee of the store. In other words, it is the \nstore owner's fault that there are armed criminals on our streets. By \nthis same logic, it is every robbery victim's fault, for not having \ntaken sufficient precautions.\n  Mr. President, we all know how serious the problem of crime and \nviolence are. But does anyone think the fault for this crisis and the \nresponsibility for overcoming it lies with the victims?\n  This case highlights the way that regulatory excess has been allowed \nto drift into absurdity. Indeed, the absurd is becoming the norm, as \nmillions of Americans who operate businesses and work for a living \nknow. It is Congress that has refused to acknowledge how long overdue \nare the fundamental reforms needed to restore common sense.\n  My bill will also stop OSHA from citing an employer, even when he or \nshe has provided the proper training and equipment to prevent an \naccident, and taken every conceivable step to assure safety.\n  In east Texas, after two workers--a supervisor and his assistant--\ndied of asphyxiation after entering a confined space against strict \ncompany policy, originally OSHA concluded that there was no violation, \nand OSHA closed the case. However, OSHA reopened the case and issued \nseveral citations after a civil lawsuit was filed. The employer's \ninsurance company panicked and settled the suit for $1.5 million. \nSubsequently, OSHA dropped the citations. But the harm was done.\n  This kind of case sets a very dangerous precedent. The mere fact that \nOSHA has cited a company is often enough to convince a jury of employer \nwrongdoing, and in many jurisdictions a citation is admissible as per \nse negligence. An employer has no choice but to challenge very OSHA \ncitation for fear of civil liability if he or she complies. We must \nchange that, and my bill does--by making OSHA citations and abatement \nefforts inadmissible as evidence in any private litigation or \nenhancement of recovery under worker's compensation law.\n  My bill also changes current OSHA practice of conducting wall-to-wall \ninspections of a business whenever an employee files a complaint about \na specific workplace issue. Congress didn't intend for Federal \nregulators to tear a business apart every time a complaint is filed. \nOSHA's current policies threaten every business with a disgruntled \nemployee.\n  To encourage more labor-management cooperation, my legislation also \nasks that an employee first notify his or her employer of a potential \nworkplace hazard. Any responsible business operator will take steps to \nrectify problems before an accident occurs. If not, OSHA can step in \nand take action. Common sense, Mr. President, just plain common sense.\n  Another provision of my legislation borrows from the TEAM Act, \nintroduced by my friend from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, who chairs the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee. Federal regulators\n currently prohibit employers and employees from forming employer-\nemployee groups to discuss issues like workplace safety. The \nlegislation I introduce today, just like the TEAM Act which Senator \nKassebaum has authored--which I cosponsored--would permit such \nlegitimate workplace cooperation.\n\n  Businesses, especially small businesses, are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to endure the current regulatory environment. The same small \nbusiness \n[[Page S4371]]  sector that has always been the engine of economic \ngrowth, the creator of most new jobs in our country, is increasingly \nstifled and hamstrung by a rising tide of Federal overregulation.\n  But as I speak, OSHA is readying a gigantic expansion of its \nregulatory authority. Its so-called ergonomics rules will give OSHA \nauthority to control virtually every aspect of a business' operations. \nUnder the proposed new rules, OSHA would be able to set limits on \nemployee productivity, to limit work shifts and overtime, to re-design \nmachinery, even entire production lines, and to prohibit innovation.\n  At best, these proposed rules are based on the shakiest of scientific \njustification. But there is no doubt of the harm they will do. Initial \nestimates put the costs of compliance at $21 billion a year. \nEventually, however, these new rules would guarantee our businesses and \nour workers would lose ground steadily in the vital areas of \nproductivity and innovation, thus doing incalculable harm to our \neconomy.\n  According to the Clinton administration's 1995 regulatory plan, OSHA \nis also working on eight other significant new regulations. I \nbureaucratic parlance, a significant action is one that will cost at \nleast $100 million annually. It's no wonder the administration is \nrequesting a more-than-10 percent increase in OSHA's budget. Enforcing \nall of these new regulations will require thousands of new inspectors, \nsupervisors, and bureaucrats.\n  The administration also is fighting to maintain funding for the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which I propose \nto end. NIOSH costs nearly $133 million this year, with no appreciable \nbenefits for workplace safety or the national welfare.\n  Twenty-five years ago, this body helped to create a new agency, OSHA, \nto pursue a worthwhile goal--protecting American workers from avoidable \ninjury in the work place. The idea was based upon a partnership between \nemployers, employees and the Government. That experiment has not \nworked. The very legislation that was meant to free people from the \neveryday threat of accidental injury is now threatening to remove our \nfreedoms.\n  Mr. President, we have the responsibility of averting threats to our \nfreedoms. We can do so merely by doing what Congress intended to do in \nthe first place. Through the application of common sense tests for \nFederal involvement and return to cooperation, we can make worksites \nboth safer and better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nauthorize the export of new drugs and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 FDA export reform and enhancement act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, almost 10 years ago, the Congress had a \ngood idea.\n  In 1986, we approved legislation which took the unprecedented step of \nallowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to export their products to 21 \nforeign nations, without prior FDA approval.\n  Many though it was a bold step at the time.\n  It turned out to be a good idea which worked well.\n  Today, 9 years later, I rise to introduce legislation to take another \nstep in that process. I am joined in cosponsorship of this legislation \nby Senator Gregg, and by Senators Kassebaum, Abraham, Frist, and Coats.\n  Let me at this time recognize the outstanding leadership that our \nHouse colleague, Representative Fred Upton, has shown in both drafting \nand marshalling considerable support for this legislation. This bill \nwould not be possible without Mr. Upton's leadership.\n  Undoubtedly some will also consider this legislation bold. But I \nsubmit to my colleagues that it will also turn out to be a good idea \nwhich works well. Even better than the 1986 law, which I authorized.\n  The Hatch-Gregg legislation, the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement \nAct of 1995, has a simple premise: that the Food and Drug \nAdministration cannot continue to be the traffic cop for world trade in \nmedical goods.\n  Current Food and Drug Administration regulations significantly \nrestrict the ability of U.S. manufacturers of human and animal drugs, \nbiological, and medical devices to export their products to world \nmarkets.\n  Under section 801(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, \nexporting a medical device that is not commercially distributed in the \nU.S. is subject to FDA receipt of the receiving country's approval of \nthe device and FDA determination that the export would not be contrary \nto the public health and safety of the importing country.\n  The FDA requires an export permit for unapproved, class III devices, \nthose requiring pre-market approval [PMA's]. Many countries also \nrequest a certificate of free sale from the United States indicating \nthat the product has been approved in the United States. This is \nbasically a rubber stamp provided by the FDA on a voluntary basis.\n  The irony in this situation is that a manufacturer cannot export \ncertain unapproved medical devices, even if they have been approved by \nthe foreign country with an established regulatory system.\n  Also under section 801(e) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \npharmaceutical companies are only free to export unapproved drugs to 21 \ncountries delineated in the law. Those countries are; Australia, \nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal\n Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \nLuxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, \nSweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\n  Prior to 1986, there was no authority for manufacturers of FDA-\nregulated \n[[Page S4375]]  products to send those products overseas unless they \nwere first approved by the FDA. The Pharmaceutical Export Act of 1986, \nallowed, for the first time, manufacturers to export their products to \nthe above list of countries, provided the sponsor is pursuing a new \ndrug application [NDA] in the United States.\n  Our experience since that time has shown that the law is still too \nrigid. The list of countries is too proscriptive, and the regulatory \nrequirements unnecessarily burdensome.\n  For example, the list does not include Israel. It does not include \nEastern European countries or most of the Pacific rim. There is near \nuniversal agreement this needs to be rectified.\n  Although the 1986 act represented a good step forward, it has led to \nthe development of a patchwork quilt of bureaucracy that has forced \nU.S. manufacturers to establish and maintain facilities outside the \nUnited States.\n  For example, prior approval of export plans by FDA is required to \nship products overseas. To ship bulk or finished products, companies \nmust apply for prior approval from FDA, be granted approval, and ship \nthe products. This process takes 3-12 months plus transportation time, \ncreating costly delays that reduce market access and penetration by \nU.S. firms.\n  It is important to note that market conditions in importing companies \nmay dictate the sale of products utilizing dosage strengths, e.g., 250 \nmilligrams versus 125 milligrams, formulations--caplet, tablet, etc.--\nor inert ingredients different from those approved or being pursued in \nthe U.S. export of similar, but not identical, products is currently \nprohibited.\n  Another problem is that FDA labeling requirements mandate that \npackaged exports be labeled in English for the FDA-approved \nindications, regardless of the linguistic or regulatory requirements of \nthe importing country.\n  At the same time, the law imposes time-consuming requirements on FDA, \nwhose resources should be better directed to reviewing new, life-saving \nmedicines and technologies.\n  It is clear that FDA is making progress in speeding up review times \nfor drugs and devices, although there still are problems.\n  For example, FDA says that its average processing time for export \npermits for medical devices has moved from 65 days in 1993 to 16 days \nin 1994. For export certificates, the FDA says its processing times \nhave declined from 51.5 days in 1993 to 10 days in 1994.\n  I must commend the Center director, Dr. Bruce Burlington, and the \nOffice of Device Evaluation Director, Dr. Susan Alpert, for that \nprogress. Their work has really made a difference.\n  But the FDA statistics don't tell the whole story. These\n   are average review times. In 1993, in some cases, it took the FDA \nover 270 days to approve export permits, and still up to 150 days for \napproval in 1994. In 1994 they processed 756 permit applications, and \n1,469 certificates.\n\n  Not only can FDA review be time-consuming, but using it is a measure \nof export delays is misleading. Manufacturers have to compile the data \nto send to FDA requesting export. And, they have to go to the importing \ncountry and get a letter proving that the country has approved the \ndevice for import. This, too, adds substantial time to the process \nupfront.\n  Another concern we have is about the potential for FDA reprogramming \nits resources away from this activity to another. We have no assurance \nthat the statistics will stay at the current rate.\n  But I feel compelled to raise the larger point.\n  I think we have to ask ourselves if this export review is how we want \nto be spending Government resources in this day and age. If other \nnations wish to receive the benefits of our technology, why must we \ninsist on approving that technology first?\n  In a time of unprecedented harmony in worldwide trade, as reflected \nby recent passage of GATT, our laws relating to the export of foods, \ndrugs, medical devices and cosmetics should reflect that comity as \nwell. The paternalistic approach evidenced in our current law is no \nlonger compatible with today's world marketplace.\n  The Hatch-Gregg bill remedies this situation by allowing \nmanufacturers to export their products in any countries belonging to \nthe World Trade Organization [WTO]. A second provision allows export to \nnon-WTO countries unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ndetermines that the possibility of the reimportation of the device or \ndrug into the United States presents an imminent hazard to the public \nhealth and safety of the United States and the only means of limiting \nthe hazard is to prohibit the export of the device or drug.\n  The products to be exported must accord to the specifications of the \nforeign purchaser. They must not be in conflict with the laws of the \ncountry to which they are intended for export. They must be labeled for \nexport on the outside of the shipping package. They must not be sold or \noffered for sale in domestic commerce. And they cannot have been \n``banned,'' or turned down for approval here in the United States.\n  This is not a health bill, Mr. President, S. 593 is about exports and \njobs. It is about U.S. competitiveness abroad.\n  The U.S. drug manufacturing industry accounts for about $60 billion \nin annual production, with a trade surplus of $800 million in 1993. \nLast year, U.S. drug companies accounted for about a third of total \nworld production.\n  There are approximately 11,000 medical device companies in the United \nStates which make between 60,000 and 80,000 different brands or models. \nMost of these companies are small. Two-thirds of the companies have \nfewer than 50 employees.\n  In Utah, we have over 100 device manufacturing companies, some of the \nfinest in the Nation, and they are really feeling the pinch of our \nrestrictive export policies.\n  The U.S. medical device manufacturing industry accounts for more than \n$50 billion in production and had a trade surplus in 1994 of $4.9 \nbillion.\n  Last year, U.S. companies accounted for 46 percent of global \nproduction. Moreover, this industry has been a major source of \nemployment and export growth in recent years.\n  Between 1988 and 1993, 32 percent of production growth for this \nindustry went to serve strong overseas demand for medical technology. \nDuring the same period, employment grew by more than 4 percent a year \nin this industry.\n  In June 1944, the Gallup Organization surveyed 58 medical electronics \nmanufacturing companies which--based on their estimates--serve as many \nas 76 million patients around the world with their products.\n  These companies indicated the following:\n  Eighty-three percent said they experienced excessive delays by FDA \nfor approval of new products;\n  Forty percent said they reduced the number of employees in the United \nStates due to FDA delays;\n  Twenty-nine percent said they increased their investment in non-U.S. \noperations; and\n  Twenty-two percent said they moved U.S. jobs overseas.\n  This provides compelling evidence that U.S. regulatory policies are \ndriving medical device manufacturing companies offshore. The same thing \nis happening with pharmaceuticals.\n  Manufacturers experience so much red-tape in sending their products \noverseas, that they prefer to make them overseas. The United States is \na net loser: in jobs and productivity.\n  We should not allow this to continue.\n  Mr. President, almost a week ago, the administration announced it was \nundertaking several FDA reforms, including a review of its export \npolicy.\n  I am hopeful that the administration will seriously consider our \nlegislation so that we may work together to see these needed changes in \nthe law are made.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is \ndesigned to address a number of problems that currently prohibit \nAmerican companies from competing in the international marketplace: the \nFood and Drug Administration's [FDA] export policies on the overseas \nsale of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. The FDA has \nrepeatedly stated that export issues are not within their realm of \nexpertise, and that they would not oppose a new standard as put forth \nby Congress.\n  We are here to submit that new standard. This bill does not call for \nradical measures that would jeopardize \n[[Page S4376]]  the safety of citizens of other countries. This bill \ndoes not simply allow unapproved products to be randomly shipped around \nthe world. It does not allow export products to be sold domestically.\n  What this bill does do is recognize the authority of our \ninternational trading partners by acknowledging that WTO [World Trade \nOrganization] members have an evolved import system to control what \nproducts are being brought into their country, a step up from general \nGATT signatories. It permits WTO countries to decide for themselves \nwhether or not they want to approve a product to be available to their \ncitizens, and specifies a notification process by U.S. manufacturers to \nthe FDA for those nations that are not WTO members. Our bill specifies \nthat a device which is banned in the United States by the FDA cannot be \nexported. This legislation provides recourse to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to prohibit exports if she judges there to be an \n``imminent hazard'' that the product would be shipped back into the \nUnited States, threatening to the health or safety of consumers.\n  These are all critical components and appropriate to promoting U.S. \nmanufacturers in the international marketplace. The bill is designed to \nallow U.S. medical technology and products, the best in the world, to \ncompete fairly with foreign manufacturers. And it allows autonomy among \nour trading partners.\n  I as pleased to hear the President address FDA reform in his speech \non March 16 as part of ``Reinventing Government.'' This is a positive \nstep in dealing with a number of issues that stem from the current \nregulatory climate at this, and many other, Federal agencies. I look \nforward to working with the administration and my colleagues here on \nthe Hill to reform the policies and procedures of this important \nagency.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 594. A bill to provide for the administration of certain Presidio \nproperties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    presidio trust establishment act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to minimize \nthe costs to the taxpayer of the newest addition to our National Park \nSystem, the Presidio of San Francisco.\n  In 1972, Congress recognized the park potential of the Presidio. At \nthat time Congressman Phil Burton's legislation creating the Golden \nGate National Recreation Area [GGNRA] was drawn to include the \nPresidio, and provided that the Presidio would become a national park \nwhen it was no longer needed by the Army. Thus when the Army vacated \nthe base last September, the Park Service assumed responsibility for \nadministering the Presidio as part of the GGNRA.\n  It is projected that the new park will attract 10 million or more \nvisitors a year. Those visitors will enjoy one of the most beautiful \nand historic urban open spaces in the world. The park offers \nspectacular vistas of the Pacific Ocean, the Golden Gate, the Marin \nHeadlands, San Francisco Bay, and the skyline of San Francisco.\n  The Presidio also offers over 200 years of military history, from its \nfounding in 1776, through the Civil War, the Spanish-American War and \nWorld Wars I and II. Presidio architecture represents a remarkable \ncollection of structures dating from the days of Mexican sovereignty \nover California. The entire Presidio was declared a national historic \nlandmark in 1962.\n  The bill we introduce today will establish the Presidio Trust, a \npublic entity modeled on the successful Pennsylvania Avenue Development \nCorporation.\n  The Trust will help us put the Presidio's buildings to work for the \npark. Rents and other revenues will be retained to restore and conserve \nthe Presidio's extraordinary natural and historic resources.\n  The Trust will manage the facilities at the Presidio which are not of \nthe type normally administered by the National Park Service. It will be \nresponsible for leasing, maintenance, and property management--\nconsistent with the park management plan and the legislation creating \nthe Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The open space, forests, and \nrecreational land will be managed by the Park Service as they are doing \nin other parts of the GGNRA.\n  Critical to the success of this undertaking will be the Presidio's \nability to generate revenues to offset the costs of operation and \ncapital improvement. The Trust will have the flexibility necessary to \nnegotiate terms of leases and other contracts, to leverage lease \nrevenues, and to utilize a staff qualified in financial management. It \nwill be accountable to the public through a public-private governing \nboard of directors, annual auditing and reporting requirements, and a \nrequirement to adhere to the publicly approved general management plan \nfor the Presidio and the GGNRA authorizing legislation.\n  According to expert analysis, the Presidio Trust established by this \nbill would produce savings of 20 to 30 percent when compared to the \ncost of total Federal management of the Presidio. The Presidio is an \nexample of defense conversion that will be cost effective while serving \nan important national purpose.\n  The Presidio is one of the Nation's great treasures. If we act now, \nwe can ensure its successful transformation from a military base into \none of the world's outstanding urban parks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 594\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Presidio, located amidst the incomparable scenic \n     splendor of the Golden Gate, is one of America's great \n     natural and historic sites;\n       (2) the Presidio is the oldest continuously operating \n     military post in the Nation dating from 1776, and was \n     designated as National Historic Landmark in 1962;\n       (3) preservation of the cultural and historic integrity of \n     the Presidio for public use recognizes its significant role \n     in the history of the United States;\n       (4) the Presidio, in its entirety, is a part of the Golden \n     Gate National Recreation Area, in accordance with Public Law \n     92-589;\n       (5) as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, \n     the Presidio's outstanding natural, historic, scenic, \n     cultural, and recreational resources must be managed in a \n     manner which is consistent with sound principles of land use \n     planning and management, and which protects the Presidio from \n     development and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty \n     and historic and natural character of the area; and\n       (6) the Presidio will be managed through an innovative \n     public/private partnership that minimizes cost to the United \n     States Treasury and makes efficient use of private sector \n     resources that could be utilized in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 2. INTERIM LEASING AUTHORITY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') is authorized to negotiate \n     and enter into leases, at fair market rental and without \n     regard to section 321 of chapter 314 of the Act of June 30, \n     1932 (40 U.S.C. 303b), for all or part of the Presidio of San \n     Francisco that is under the administrative jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary until such time as the property concerned is \n     transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \n     Presidio Trust. Notwithstanding sections 1341 and 3302 of \n     title 31 of the United States Code, the proceeds from any \n     such lease shall be retained by the Secretary and used for \n     the preservation, restoration, operation and maintenance, \n     improvement, repair and related expenses incurred with \n     respect to Presidio properties. For purposes of any such \n     lease, the Secretary may adjust the rental by taking into \n     account any amounts to be expended by the lessee for \n     preservation, maintenance, restoration, improvement, repair \n     and related expenses with respect to properties within the \n     Presidio.\n\n     SEC. 3. THE PRESIDIO TRUST.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a body corporate \n     within the Department of the Interior to be known as the \n     Presidio Trust (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Trust'').\n       (b) Transfer.--(1) The Secretary shall transfer to the \n     administrative jurisdiction of the Trust those areas commonly \n     known as the Letterman/LAIR complex, Fort Scott, Main Post, \n     Cavalry Stables, Presidio Hill, Wherry Housing, East Housing, \n     the structures at Crissy Field, roads, utilities or other \n     infrastructure servicing the properties and such other \n     properties that the Secretary deems appropriate, as depicted \n     on the map referred to in this subsection.

No appointed director \n     may serve more than 8 years in consecutive terms. No member \n     of the Board of Directors may have a financial interest in \n     any tenant of the Presidio.\n       (3) Organization and compensation.--The Board shall \n     organize itself in such a manner as it deems most appropriate \n     to effectively carry out the authorized activities of the \n     Trust.

The Trust may participate in the \n     development of programs and activities at the properties that \n     have been transferred to the Trust. In exercising its powers \n     and duties, the Trust shall act in accordance with the \n     approved General Management Plan, as amended, for the \n     Presidio (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Plan'') and shall have the following authorities:\n       (1) The Trust is authorized to manage, lease, maintain, \n     rehabilitate and improve, either directly or by agreement, \n     those properties within the Presidio which are transferred to \n     the Trust by the Secretary.\n       (2)(A) The Trust is authorized to negotiate and enter into \n     such agreements, leases, contracts and other arrangements \n     with any person, firm, association, organization, corporation \n     or governmental entity, including without limitation entities \n     of Federal, State and local governments (except any agreement \n     to convey fee title to any property located at the Presidio) \n     as are necessary and appropriate to finance and carry out its \n     authorized activities. Agreements under this paragraph may be \n     entered into without regard to section 321 of the Act of June \n     30, 1992 (40 U.S.C. 303b).\n       (B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E), \n     Federal laws and regulations governing procurement by Federal \n     agencies shall apply to the Trust.\n       (C) The Secretary may authorize the Trust, in exercising \n     authority under section 303(g) of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 253(g)) \n     relating to simplified purchase procedures, to use as the \n     dollar limit of each purchase or contract under this \n     subsection an amount which does not exceed $500,000.\n       (D) The Secretary may authorize the Trust, in carrying out \n     the requirement of section 18 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416) to furnish the \n     Secretary of Commerce for publication notices of proposed \n     procurement actions, to use as the applicable dollar \n     threshold for each expected procurement an amount which does \n     not exceed $1,000,000.\n       (E) The Trust shall establish procedures for lease \n     agreements and other agreements for use and occupancy of \n     Presidio facilities, including a requirement that in entering \n     into such agreements the Trust shall obtain such competition \n     as is practicable in the circumstances.\n       (3) The Trust is authorized to appoint and fix the \n     compensation and duties of an executive director and such \n     other officers and employees as it deems necessary without \n     regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, \n     governing appointments in the competitive service, and may \n     pay them without regard to the provisions of chapter 51, and \n     subchapter III of chapter 53, title 5, United States Code \n     (relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates).\n       (4) To augment or encourage the use of non-Federal funds to \n     finance capital improvements on Presidio properties \n     transferred to its jurisdiction, the Trust, in addition to \n     its other authorities, shall have the following authorities:\n       (A) The authority to guarantee any lender against loss of \n     principal or interest on any construction loan, provided that \n     (i) the terms of the guarantee are approved by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, (ii) adequate guarantee authority is \n     provided in appropriations Acts, and (iii) such guarantees \n     are structured so as to minimize potential cost to the \n     Federal Government.\n       (B) The authority, subject to available appropriations, to \n     make loans to the occupants of property managed by the Trust \n     for the preservation, restoration, maintenance, or repair of \n     such property.\n       (C) The authority to issue obligations to the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, but only if the Secretary of the Treasury \n     agrees to purchase such obligations after determining that \n     the projects to be funded from the proceeds thereof are \n     credit worthy and that a repayment schedule is established. \n     The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a \n     public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any \n     securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United States \n     Code, and the purposes for which securities may be issued \n     under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of \n     such notes or obligations acquired by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury under this subsection. The aggregate amount of \n     obligations issued under this subparagraph which are \n     outstanding at any one time may not exceed $150,000,000. \n     Obligations issued under this subparagraph shall be in such \n     forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject \n     to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and shall bear interest at a rate \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into \n     consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.

The report also shall include a section \n     that describes in general terms the Trust's goals for the \n     current fiscal year.\n       (i) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall preclude \n     the Secretary from exercising any of the Secretary's lawful \n     powers within the Presidio.\n       (j) Leasing.--In managing and leasing the properties \n     transferred to it, the Trust should consider the extent to \n     which prospective tenants maximize the contribution to the \n     implementation of the General Management Plan and to the \n     generation of revenues to offset costs of the Presidio. The \n     Trust shall give priority to the following categories of \n     tenants: tenants that enhance the financial viability of the \n     Presidio thereby contributing to the preservation of the \n     scenic beauty and natural character of the area; tenants that \n     facilitate the cost-effective preservation of historic \n     buildings through their reuse of such buildings, or tenants \n     that promote through their activities the general \n     programmatic content of the plan.\n       (k) Reversion.--In the event of failure or default, all \n     interests and assets of the Trust shall revert to the United \n     States to be administered by the Secretary.\n       (l) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     the activities of the Trust.\n       (m) Separability of Provisions.--If any provisions of this \n     Act or the application thereof to any body, agency, \n     situation, or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of \n     the Act and the application of such provision to other \n     bodies, agencies, situations, or circumstances shall not be \n     affected thereby.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 595. A bill to provide for the extension of a hydroelectric \nproject located in the State of West Virginia; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               extension of ferc license for grafton, wv\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I introduce, on behalf of myself and Senator \nRockefeller, a bill to grant the city of Grafton, WV, a 4-year \nextension of its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] license to \nbegin construction of a hydroelectric power project at Tygart Dam in \nTaylor County. This project is to be financed entirely by the city of \nGrafton and its investors through nonpublic equity and debt. This \nextension is necessary because the license expires during the current \nyear and over $3 million has already been invested in this project. The \nhydroelectric project takes advantage of the existing dam on the Tygart \nRiver in order to generate power and will also include the development \nof recreational facilities. Extensive environmental studies on the \nproject have been conducted in coordination with interested regulatory \nagencies. Without any contribution from the Federal Government, the \ncity and its investors will finance the project, which will include \nfishing piers, walkways, picnic facilities, and a parking area.\n  The city and its investors anticipate that the project would employ \n200 staff during the peak of construction, with a $1 million monthly \npayroll. The total construction payroll for the project is expected to \nbe $15 million. The Grafton hydropower project will provide substantial \ntaxes and other payments to various governmental entities during \nconstruction and operation. The Federal Government will benefit from \nthis project since it will receive annual payments of $200,000 from the \nhydroelectric project. The Federal Government also will receive income \ntax from the project, as it will be privately financed. It is hoped \nthat the license extension made possible by this bill will bring \nsignificant economic development to the Taylor County region of West \nVirginia.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Bradley):\n  S. 596. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to disallow \ndeductions for advertising and promotional expenses for tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          elimination of deductibility of tobacco advertising\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation that addresses a very serious problem in a \ncommonsense way. During the budget debate in 1992 I offered an \namendment to limit the tax deductibility of tobacco advertising. It \ndidn't pass. And, because it didn't pass, the American taxpayers are \nstill coughing up billions to promote smoking.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would eliminate the taxpayer \ndeductibility of tobacco advertising and promotion.\n  These days we hear a lot of talk about cuts in school lunches, cuts \nin the WIC Program, cuts in investments to improve the health of \nAmericans.\n  I believe there's a better way to go--with commonsense cuts that \npromote the health of our economy and the health of our people.\n  It's time for tobacco companies to quit blowing our tax dollars up in \nsmoke with their big tobacco advertising campaigns. It's time for them \nto stop luring our kids into their deathtraps.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission the tobacco industry spent \n$5.2 billion in 1992 to advertise and promote cigarettes. But that's \nnot just their money, it's ours, too. Because all of those expenses are \ntax deductible.\n  In fact, American taxpayers are coughing up nearly $2 billion a year \nin tax subsidies and serving as a silent partner in helping big tobacco \ncompanies peddle their products and hook our kids.\n  This taxpayer-subsidized multi-billion-dollar effort includes ads in \nmagazines and newspapers, and outside advertising such as billboards, \nadvertising at supermarkets and convenience stores, use of gifts, and \nsponsorship of sporting events.\n  And all of this is designed to convince people that smoking is cool--\nnecessary for social acceptance and helps make one attractive to the \nopposite sex. It is deliberately designed to keep people smoking, but \nmore importantly, to attract a new generation to the smoking habit.\n  Every day, another $5 million of taxpayer money is used to promote a \nproduct that--when used as intended--causes disease, disability, and \ndeath.\n  Every day, another 3,000 of America's children get hooked on smoking.\n  Consider what the taxpayers receive for their money. We get Old Joe \nCamel. If you don't know who Joe Camel is just ask any first-grader.\n  According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, more 6-year-olds can identify Old Joe Camel than adults. \nIn fact, just as many 6-year-olds can identify Old Joe Camel as they \ncan Mickey Mouse.\n  And his name recognition has really paid off--since the introduction \nof Old Joe, sales of Camel cigarettes to children under 18 went from $6 \nmillion to over $476 million a year.\n  But that's not all. Joe is branching out. And so are some of his \ncompetitors. They have all started what I call merchandising clubs in \nwhich you can smoke your way to all sorts of gifts.\n  A study in this month's Consumer Reports magazine found that 11 \npercent of children between the age of 12 to 17 owned at least one \ntobacco industry promotional item.\n  And it only gets worse, cigarette companies not only know what kids \nlike, they know where they live. The same poll in Consumer Reports \nfound that 7.6 percent of teens received cigarette company mail at home \naddressed directly to them. If you carry those figures nationwide, that \nmeans 1.6 million children are on the tobacco mailing list.\n  These campaigns are outrageous and they violate the industry's own \ncigarette advertising code. The industry has adopted a code that states \nthat ``cigarette advertising shall not represent that cigarette smoking \nis essential to social prominence, distinction, success, or sexual \nattraction.\n  But how does that square with these ads? How does that square with \nthe Marlboro Aventure Team? How does that square with Joe Camel? It \nsimply doesn't and we ought not subsidize it.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in \nlegislation he is offering today to allow American taxpayers to recover \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health program costs associated \nwith tobacco-related illnesses. For too long the tobacco companies have \nbeen raking in profits while the American taxpayers have been coughing \nup billions in health care costs attributable to tobacco related \nillness.\n  The Medicare and Medicaid share of these costs total over $15 billion \nper year and the costs to other Federal health programs are nearly $5 \nbillion.\n  The Columbia University Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse has \nestimated that tobacco-related illnesses \n[[Page S4379]]  will cost the Medicare program $800 billion over the \nnext 20 years. At\n that rate, Medicare will go bankrupt.\n\n  It is unconscionable that the tobacco industry has profited while the \ntaxpayer has been left with the devastating and widespread costs \nassociate with tobacco use.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Lautenberg would hold \nmanufacturers accountable for the damage they do. Manufacturers of \ntobacco products would pay for the cost of tobacco-related illness \nincurred by Government through the Medicaid, Medicare, and other health \nprograms.\n  I am also pleased that Senator Bradley is introducing legislation to \nfurther the effort to decrease cigarette smoking. An increase in the \ntobacco tax is one of the most effective methods for significantly \nreducing tobacco use among children and adults. We know that for every \n10 percent increase in the price of tobacco products, there will be \napproximately a 4-percent decrease in tobacco consumption, and possibly \neven greater decrease in tobacco use among children.\n  Mr. President, we must take every possible opportunity to convince \npeople to stop smoking and prevent children from ever taking up the \nhabit. As former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated:\n\n       Smoking is associated with more death and illness than \n     drugs, alcohol, automobile accidents, and AIDS combined.\n\n  U.S. Public Health Service figures tell us that over 430,000 \nAmericans will die from cigarette smoking this year. That is more than \nthe number of Americans who died in all of World War II. Over 1,000 \nAmericans will die today from smoking. That is more than the equivalent \nof two fully loaded jumbo jets crashing with no survivors--every day.\n  The medical data on the health effects of smoking are well \nestablished. Since 1964, when the first Surgeon General's ``Report on \nSmoking and Health'' was issued, some 50,000 scientific studies on the \nrelationship between smoking and disease have been conducted. Smoking \nhas been shown to be a major case of heart disease, chronic bronchitis, \nand emphysema; cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, pancreas, \nand bladder; pneumonia and stomach cancers.\n  Mr. President, as we look for way to tackle the budget deficit we \nshould not be cutting initiatives that help people and investment in \nour future. Instead we should close the corporate tax loopholes. And \nlet's start by eliminating special breaks that help big tobacco \ncorporations and hurt our kids.\n  Passage of the Harkin, Lautenberg, and Bradley bills would be a \ntriple play for our economy and our Nation's health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTIONS FOR ADVERTISING AND \n                   PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RELATING TO TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCT USE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part IX of subchapter B of chapter 1 of \n     subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     items not deductible) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 2801. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTION FOR TOBACCO \n                   ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES.\n\n       No deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for \n     expenses relating to advertising or promoting cigars, \n     cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, or any similar \n     tobacco product. For purposes of this section, any term used \n     in this section which is also used in section 5702 shall have \n     the same meaning given such term by section 5702.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     part IX is amended by adding after the item relating to \n     section 280H the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 280I. Disallowance of deduction for tobacco advertising and \n              promotion expenses.''\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1995.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Harkin, \nto introduce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to forbid tobacco companies to deduct their advertising and \npromotional expenses when calculating their taxes.\n  I have already discussed the huge toll--in both economical and human \nterms--which tobacco wreaks on this country. And I have already \nintroduced a bill increasing the tax on all tobacco products by a \nfactor of five. Mr. President, the Harkin-Bradley bill complements my \nearlier bill by ensuring that Federal Government acts consistently when \nit comes to tobacco.\n  Why do I say the Government acts inconsistently with regard to \ntobacco? Because on the one hand, it allows tobacco companies to deduct \ntheir advertising and promotional costs on their taxes. These tax \nexemptions are the equivalent of direct Government payments. In terms \nof lost revenues to the Federal Treasury, they are no different from \ncash payments to AFDC recipients. And we're not talking a small amount \nof money--in 1992, these deductions were worth approximately $1.7 \nbillion a year to tobacco companies.\n  On the other hand, the Government spends millions and millions of \ndollars to try to offset the harmful effects caused by tobacco use. We \nare giving more than $1.7 billion to the National Cancer Institute for \nresearch this year alone; this includes $114 million specifically for \nlung cancer. We require warning labels to be placed on cigarette \npackages to inform our citizens of the direct links between tobacco use \nand respiratory and lung diseases and possible birth defects. We \nprovide millions of dollars for public health campaigns to warn people \nof the danger of tobacco, and to help them to quit.\n  These are directly contradictory policies. First, we give the tobacco \ncompanies a tremendous tax incentive--a Government handout--essentially \nencouraging them to advertise and promote tobacco products. Then, we \nturn around and spend a billion or two trying to unravel the harm that \nwe have helped to cause, to reduce the health devastation we have \ncontributed to, by funding research on tobacco use and to fund \ncampaigns to discourage and end its use.\n  And think about those advertising and promotional campaigns which we \nare helping to finance. Many of them are targeted at our youth, who \noften may ignore well-intended and wise warnings about mortality, and \ninstead obey the behavior of their own peer groups who believe that \nsmoking is cool. Approximately 90\n percent of all smokers begin in their teens or younger. The tobacco \ncompanies know this and specifically target younger age groups in their \nadvertising. And the Federal Government helps to pay the bill for them \nto do so.\n\n  Mr. President, virtually all of the health care bills which were \nconsidered last session placed great emphasis on prevention. We know we \ncan reduce health care costs if we encourage our citizens to avoid \nunhealthy choices, and to exercise regularly, to eat right, and design \nour health care system to focus on preventive care and not wait until \nsomeone is sick to treat them. Yet cigarette smoking is the single most \npreventable cause of death in the United States. This bill takes action \nnow to put meaning into all the rhetoric about prevention. And at the \nsame time, it will save the Federal Government an estimated $1.7 \nbillion a year in foregone tax expenditures, once it is fully \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, this bill is health care reform that is right on \ntarget. It doesn't control prices, limit choices, or require any new \nGovernment intervention in health care. It addresses only those who are \ndirectly responsible for the largest preventable cause of death in the \nUnited States--the tobacco companies themselves.\n  Mr. President, the Government should speak with one voice on this \nproblem, and that voice should unequivocally say: ``Tobacco use will \nharm you.'' We will not subsidize the seller; we will not underwrite \nthe smoker; we will support efforts to stop; and we will dedicate our \nresources to preventing Americans from ever starting. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in ensuring that we speak with one voice by \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 597. A bill to insure the long-term viability of the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other Federal health programs by \n[[Page S4380]]  establishing a dedicated trust fund to reimburse the \nGovernment for the health care costs of individuals with diseases \nattributable to the use of tobacco products; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                     medicare/medicaid solvency act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare/Medicaid Solvency Act of 1995. This legislation will require \nthe tobacco industry to reimburse the Federal Government for Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other Federal health care program costs for diseases \nattributable to tobacco products.\n  Deliberations on the budget will soon begin and it looks like the \nCongress is serious about undertaking real, meaningful, and significant \ndeficit reduction. My bill will do just that.\n  Any serious attempt at deficit reduction must consider health care, \nparticularly the Medicare, Medicaid, and the other Federal health care \nprograms. Federal expenditures for these programs have skyrocketed in \nrecent years and current HCFA projections indicate that the Medicare \ntrust fund, which pays for Medicare part A costs, will become insolvent \nshortly after the turn of the century. Medicare part B, Medicaid, and \nother Federal health programs have no dedicated trust fund and \ncontribute with increasing severity each year to the deficit spending \nabout which we here in Congress complain so vehemently. It is now clear \nto everyone that changes in our Federal health care programs are \ninevitable if we wish to control and reduce the deficit.\n  My Republican colleagues have proposed to cut Medicare and Medicaid \nby $255-$275 billion over the next 5 years. As much as I admire the \nRepublicans' commitment to reducing Government waste and inefficiency, \nI do not believe we should seek to reduce the deficit by cutting health \ncare for our most vulnerable citizens: seniors, children, and the \ndisabled.\n  And so I now proposed a better idea. The Centers for Disease Control \ntell us that Federal health care expenditures for diseases attributable \nto tobacco products are currently about $20 billion per year. While \ntobacco companies receive approximately $100 billion in annual revenues \nand earn huge profits from the sale of their deadly products, taxpayers \nare forced to pay the health care bills for the diseases those products \ncause. This is outrageous and is exactly backwards from what logic and \njustice tell us it ought to be. We need to turn this system on its \nhead. We should be sending the Federal health care bills for tobacco-\nrelated diseases to the tobacco companies rather than to the taxpayers.\n  It is time to get serious about reducing the deficit. And the right \nway to reduce the deficit is not to reduce health care programs for \npeople in need; rather it is to insist that the tobacco industry accept \nfinancial responsibility for the problems it knowingly causes. My bill \ndoes this.\n  My message to the Republican leadership is simple: The tobacco \nindustry must be a part of any deficit reduction package. Much has been \nsaid in this Chamber about the need to reduce the Federal deficit, and \nthe need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions. Now \nit is time for the tobacco industry to accept responsibility for its \nactions. No member of this body who wishes to remain credible on \ndeficit reduction can continue to ignore the extraordinary impact of \nthis one industry on Government spending. There is no choice: either we \nvote to make the tobacco industry part of the solution to the deficit \nproblem, or we abandon any pretense of being serious on this issue.\n  My bill will reduce the deficit by $100 billion over 5 years. That is \napproximately $1,000 for every taxpayer in the country. It does this by \ndirecting the Secretary of Health and Human Services to annually \ndetermine the amount of Federal health care expenditures for diseases \nattributable to tobacco products and then authorizes the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to bill each tobacco company for its share of those \nexpenditures, based on each company's share of the market for tobacco \nproducts. My bill does not penalize smokers nor does it restrict \nsmoking in any way. It simply demands that those tobacco companies \nwhose products are the direct and immediate cause of many billions of \ndollars of Federal health care costs pay their fair share of those \ncosts.\n  The real question is: Who will pay for the Federal health care costs \nfor diseases attributable to tobacco products? Will it be the American \ntaxpayers who are drowning in our national debt, or will it be the \ntobacco companies who are swimming in profits? With this legislation, I \nchoose to side with the taxpayers and I hope my Senate colleagues will \ndo so as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of this bill, \na fact sheet, and a letter of support from the Coalition or Smoking or \nHealth printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare/Medicaid Solvency \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) illnesses and diseases that result from the use of \n     tobacco products cost Federal Government health care programs \n     billions of dollars, including $10,200,000,000 in the \n     medicare program, $5,100,000,000 in the medicaid program, and \n     $4,700,000,000 in other Federal health programs in fiscal \n     year 1993;\n       (2) in April 1994, the trustees of the medicare trust funds \n     concluded that such funds may be insolvent in 2001;\n       (3) such insolvency would severely affect the ability of \n     the medicare trust funds to continue to protect the health of \n     America's senior citizens; and\n       (4) the medicare population has a significantly higher risk \n     of contracting illnesses and diseases that result from the \n     use of tobacco products than younger age groups.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to insure the \n     long-term viability of the medicare, medicaid, and other \n     federal health programs by establishing a dedicated trust \n     fund to reimburse the government for the health care costs of \n     individuals with diseases attributable to the use of tobacco \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

We \n     agree with you that it is more appropriate for the tobacco \n     industry to pay these costs than innocent taxpayers.\n       Your proposal would be one of the most important public \n     health steps this country has ever taken. It would conserve \n     taxpayer dollars, discourage hundreds of thousands of \n     teenagers from becoming addicted to tobacco and save about \n     two million lives over time.\n       You have our full support. We look forward to working with \n     you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     Scott D. Ballin,\n                                Vice President for Public Affairs,\n                                       American Heart Association.\n     Fran Du Melle,\n                                         Deputy Managing Director,\n                                        American Lung Association.\n     Michael F. Heron,\n                       National Vice President for Public Affairs,\n                                          American Cancer Society.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 598. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe excise taxes on tobacco products, and to use a portion of the \nresulting revenues to fund a trust fund for tobacco diversification, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        tobacco consumption reduction and health improvement act\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat takes a bold step toward reducing the devastating health and \nfinancial effects of tobacco use in this country.\n  Mr. President, in both 1991 and 1993, I rose before this Chamber to \ntalk about the destructive effects of tobacco use and to introduce \nlegislation that would begin to redress these effects. Since my 1993 \nstatement, almost 1 million more people have died from tobacco-related \nillnesses. The time to stop this travesty is now, and to do that I am \nintroducing legislation that will raise the Federal excise tax on \ntobacco by a factor of five, which translates to an increase of $1.00 \nper pack of cigarettes.\n  Over 30 years after the 1964 Surgeon General's report sounded the \nhealth alarm for smoking, approximately one-quarter of the Nation's \nadults remain addicted to cigarettes. Smoking now kills an estimated \n419,000 Americans every year--more than alcohol, heroin, crack, \nautomobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides, and AIDS \ncombined. Furthermore, environmental tobacco smoke--smoke from other \npeople's cigarettes--causes tens of thousands of additional deaths. \nThis year, one out of every five Americans who dies will die from \ntobacco use.\n  If these statistics were not staggering enough, each year a growing \nnumber of teenagers start smoking, even though selling cigarettes to \nminors is illegal. Virtually all new users of tobacco are teenagers or \nyounger, and every 30 seconds a child in the United States smokes for \nthe first time. The efforts that have been waged by public health \nofficials against youth smoking have been dwarfed by the billions spent \nby the industry on advertising aimed at children and teenagers. The \naddiction of children to tobacco, and consequently the long-term \neffects, is a moral disgrace.\n  A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a lobbying group for the \ntobacco industry, was quoted as saying with regard to smoking:\n\n       This is a day and age when we ultimately have to recognize \n     that adults are going to indulge in the legal pleasures that \n     others don't approve of.\n\n  My response to the industry is: This legal pleasure kills more than \none out of three long-term users when used as intended. This legal \npleasure has been determined to be a major cause of heart disease, lung \ncancer, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, low-birthweight babies, strokes, \nand a variety of other diseases.\n This legal pleasure is as addictive as cocaine or heroin. They are \nright that I don't approve of the effects of this legal pleasure, and \nfor good reason.\n\n  Furthermore, this legal pleasure contributes substantially to health \ncare costs every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, health care expenditures caused directly by smoking totaled \n$50 billion in 1993, and $22 billion of those costs were paid by \nGovernment funds. According to a former Secretary of the Department of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare, smoking is the largest single drain on \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n  One of the most effective things we can do to control health care \ncosts is to end smoking. I view tobacco taxes as compensation for a \nportion of the health care costs burden we are forced to bear, thanks \nto smoking. It is more than fair to ask smokers to share some of the \ncosts which they help to create.\n  [[Page S4382]] Some people may think that the tobacco tax has already \nbeen raised substantially in recent years, and therefore that it is \nunfair to raise it again. This is a misconception. Despite the fact \nthat the average price of a pack of cigarettes has risen by more than \n$1.10 since 1982, only 8 cents of this increase is due to a rise in the \nFederal excise tax. And even the dollar-per-pack increase which I am \nproposing will generate only about $12 billion a year in additional \nincome--far less than the $50 billion in health care costs caused \ndirectly by tobacco in 1 year.\n  But this bill has an even more important goal than recovering health \ncare expenditures. It will help decrease tobacco consumption \nsignificantly. Conservative estimates predict that a 10 percent \nincrease in the price of cigarettes will reduce overall smoking by \nabout 4 percent. And for kids, who are more price sensitive than \nadults, the impact is even greater--every 10-percent increase in \ncigarette prices decreases demand among children and teenager by as \nmuch as 14 percent.\n  Mr. President, despite the many advantages of this legislation, I am \nnot blind to the fact that there are those whom it will impact \nnegatively--particularly, tobacco farmers. By no means do I think that \nthe potential losses to these farmers are an adequate justification for \nmaking no efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. But because I realize \nthe impact of an increased excise tax on these farmers, my bill puts 3 \npercent of all revenues it generates into a special trust fund to be \nused to help tobacco framers substitute new crops in place of tobacco.\n  Mr. President, these days everyone is looking for a way to reduce \nGovernment spending on health care. Almost all of the actions under \nconsideration will be painful. In contrast, increasing the tobacco tax \nis one of the wisest and most beneficial ways of addressing this \nproblem. It will save billions of dollars in health care costs, not \nonly for the Federal Government but for private insurers and citizens \nacross the country. It will save countless lives. It will decrease \nunnecessary suffering. It will discourage millions of children and \nteenagers from ever becoming addicted to tobacco. And poll after poll \nhas found that public support is high for a significant hike in the \ntobacco tax--and this support is consistent across people from all \ngeographic and economic backgrounds.\n  Mr. President, this bill is good health policy. It is good economic \npolicy. And it is key to helping our children and teenagers achieve a \ntobacco-free future. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 598\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Tobacco Conversion Trust Fund.''\n\n                                                                    ____\n   Tobacco Consumption Reduction and Health Improvement Act of 1995--\n                                Summary\n\n       This bill provides for an increase of the Federal excise \n     tax on tobacco products. It raises the excise tax five-fold \n     on cigarettes, from 24 cents to $1.24 per pack. The excise \n     tax for all other tobacco products will also be increased \n     five-fold. This bill will generate approximately $12 billion \n     in additional federal revenues each year.\n       The reasons for this increase are clear. First, it allows \n     us to use the most potent weapon we have at our disposal to \n     discourage smoking--raising the price of tobacco. This will \n     allow us to specifically direct our attention to a vulnerable \n     and price sensitive group--children and teenagers. It is also \n     smart tax policy--it taxes what we want to discourage so we \n     can cut taxes on the things we want to encourage. Second, the \n     Centers for Disease Control and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment have estimated the cost to society of cigarette \n     smoking at over $100 billion annually; $22 billion of these \n     costs were paid by government funds. It is more than fair to \n     ask smokers to shoulder some of these costs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 599. A bill to eliminate certain welfare with respect to fugitive \nfelons and probation and parole violators, and to facilitate sharing of \ninformation with law enforcement officers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   fugitive felons and welfare reform\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, like most of my colleagues in the \nSenate, I have followed with interest the activity in the House \nregarding welfare reform. It is with a unique perspective that I have \nviewed the House action having been at the center of the House's \nwelfare reform debate last year and having been deeply involved in the \ndirection and decision making of the House Republican platform.\n  During the 103d Congress, I served as the ranking Republican member \non the Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee. Preceding me in \nthat capacity is quite a list of dedicated ranking members who all have \nand continue to make a very significant contribution to the welfare \nreform discussions--Senator Hank Brown, Gov. Carroll Campbell, and the \ncurrent chairman of that subcommittee, Congressman Clay Shaw. As the \nSenate now prepares for its own activity on welfare reform, I hope to \ncontinue to be equally active on this side in setting that direction.\n  It is hard to undertake any discussion on welfare reform without \nrealizing the multitude of issues, programs, problems, and complexities \nthat are involved. And while my activity in the House covered many \naspects of welfare and welfare-related programs, one such issue that I \nwanted to discuss today pertains to fugitive felons receiving welfare \nbenefits.\n  Under current law, barriers exist to information sharing between law \nenforcement officials and social service agencies. While few States \nhave defined criteria where the exchange of information can occur \nbetween police and social service offices, most States have not. And \nwith the reality of fugitives receiving public assistance, it makes \nsense to provide police access to welfare records that indicate the \nwhereabouts of wanted individuals, without violating the privacy \nlanguage and rights of welfare beneficiaries.\n  In the 103d Congress, I introduced legislation (H.R. 4657) which \nestablishes criteria for information sharing between law enforcement \nofficials and social service agencies, allows cross reference checks \nbetween the Immigration and Naturalization Service and law enforcement \nwith regard to illegal immigration, and sets a Federal definition of \ntemporarily absent in instances where children of beneficiaries are \naway from the home for extended periods of time.\n  The information and record referencing under the bill is limited to \nindividuals for whom warrants are outstanding. The bill permits access \nby law enforcement to information when a warrant is produced, and it is \nfound that \n[[Page S4384]] the individual is receiving benefits. Someone who is not \na fugitive felon would remain fully protected from such inquiries under \nthe Welfare Privacy Act.\n  Is there a need for such information sharing? I'd like to submit for \nthe Record a copy of a news article from Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on \nJuly 29, 1994. The article describes a situation in which an individual \nwanted for an 1984 slaying in Pittsburgh, had been on the run and \nreceiving Federal welfare benefits under his real name. Likewise, a \nsituation last year in Cleveland, OH, highlighted the difficulties that \nexist in tracking fugitives and trying to interface with social service \nagencies. In that instance, Cuyahoga County officials were denied \naccess to records as they attempted to cross reference outstanding \nfugitive warrants with social service records.\n  It is absurd that taxpayers are subsidizing a fugitive's freedom when \nchecking a recipient's address could lead to their apprehension. \nCurrently, the National Crime Information Center lists 397,000 \noutstanding fugitive warrants nationwide--warrants being defined as \n``felonies'' or ``high misdemeanors'' in cases where States agree to \nextradition. Several police groups have projected that as many as 75 \npercent of those fugitives are receiving public assistance. \nAdditionally, as I have discovered with Pennsylvania, the extradition \nstipulation for warrants in the NCIC data bank actually shields the \nnumber of outstanding warrants in a given State. You too may find that \nyour State figures are significant.\n  Last week, I met with the Philadelphia Fugitive Task Force to discuss \nthe practical effects of the legislation. In confronting their 50,000 \noutstanding fugitive warrants, they feel strongly that the bill \nprovides them yet another tool in their investigative efforts. \nLikewise, the measure has received similar comment from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the National Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, and the Law Enforcement Alliance of \nAmerica.\n  While the fugitive felon situation generally involves the parent or \nan adult, the bill also addresses ambiguity in the law with regard to \nchildren. Under current law, a mother can continue to receive AFDC \npayment for a child even if that child is temporarily absent from the \nhome. Depending on their definition, States have the authority to end \nAFDC payments if the child is not going to physically be in the home \nfor an extended period of time. Again, like the fugitive felon issue, \nFederal and State law remains undefined in most cases for temporarily \nabsent. My bill would federally define temporarily absent for those \ninstances where juveniles are away from the home as a result of a court \ndecision or criminal activity.\n  Mr. President, while this legislation today may serve as my first \nofficial measure for the 104th Congress in the area of welfare reform, \nit is by no means the sole measure I will be introducing to the Senate. \nIn the weeks ahead, I plan on introducing proposals covering child \nsupport enforcement, supplemental security income, and a more \ncomprehensive proposal speaking to welfare reform in its entirety. \nAdditionally, I plan on being very active within the Agriculture \nCommittee in the area of nutrition programs and examining the reform \noptions available to us, including a review of the block grant concept.\n  I welcome and encourage my colleagues' interest in this and other \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \ncopy of the article I referenced earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 599\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

They hadn't \n     known he was on welfare.\n       ``I'm sure it would have made things a lot easier,'' said \n     Detective Joe Hasara of the Federal Fugitive Task Force in \n     Philadelphia, one of the squads that for years pursued lead \n     after dead-end lead searching for Brabham.\n       Police--even those looking for longtime fugitives--don't \n     routinely look at welfare rolls to locate suspects, primarily \n     because of the legal obstacles, Hasara said.\n       ``It's just not feasible,'' said Hasara, citing red tape. \n     ``We'd have to have one or two people doing nothing but \n     getting subpoenas and court orders. We can't operate like \n     that.''\n       Hasara, a Philadelphia police detective who makes up part \n     of the city's federally funded fugitive task force, located \n     Brabham after a typically long and laborious investigation \n     that involved following tips and digging into clues. He won't \n     be more specific than that, for fear of divulging the task \n     force's gumshoe secrets.\n       The victim, Charlene Summers, 36, was living with Brabham \n     in Pittsburgh's Beltzhoover area. Police said Brabham \n     reported the January 1984 killing to city homicide in a \n     telephone call. He claimed Summers had attacked him with a \n     knife.\n       Brabham, who posted bond days after he was charged with her \n     murder, never showed up at a coroner's hearing. A bench \n     warrant for his arrest went out in May 1984. In March 1990, a \n     federal court handed down a fugitive warrant.\n       By then, the Greater Pittsburgh Fugitive Task Force was \n     already hunting him, said FBI Agent Ralph Young, a task force \n     member.\n       ``We had people all over the country looking for him,'' \n     Young said. ``He never came back to Pittsburgh.''\n       Philadelphia was one of the investigative hot spots: \n     Brabham had relatives there, Young said.\n       ``We'd hear sightings. We'd follow up. It'd lead to a dead \n     end,'' he said.\n       The state's welfare listings may be accessible to police \n     who petition the Commonwealth Court for specific information, \n     said department spokesman Kevin Campbell.\n       Although state law forbids disclosure of individual welfare \n     information for personal, commercial or political uses, a \n     specific statute allows law enforcement queries if authorized \n     by a judge, Campbell said.\n       ``District attorneys have done it in the past, certainly,'' \n     said Campbell, who added that police face no other official \n     barriers.\n       ``Apparently they've never worked the street,'' Hasara \n     snorted.\n       After Brabham's arrest Wednesday, Young telephoned Summers' \n     mother, Lillie Jones, with the news.\n       ``For ten years, I never gave up on this,'' said Jones, 70, \n     who described a dream she had Tuesday night. ``She and I was \n     very close. In the spiritual world, we had a lot of \n     connection.\n       ``I dreamed some man was chasing her around and around my \n     house with a gun, and around and around my neighbor's house, \n     and she was calling me for help: she ran to me and said, \n     ``Mama, save me.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4365-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4365-S4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 587. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Old Spanish Trail and the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail \nfor potential inclusion into the National Trails System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   old Spanish trail designation act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I'm sending legislation to the \ndesk to designate the Old Spanish Trail and the northern branch of the \nOld Spanish Trail for study for potential addition to the National \nTrails System.\n  [[Page S4366]] The Old Spanish Trail has been called the ``longest, \ncrookedest, most arduous pack mule route in the history of America.'' \nLinking two quaint pueblo outposts, Villa Real de Sante Fe de San \nFrancisco--now known as Santa Fe; and El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La \nReina de Los Angeles--present day Los Angeles--this 1,200 mile route \nwas a well worn path 150 years ago as annual caravans traded woolen \nblankets from New Mexico for California horses and mules.\n  According to an early historian, the trail:\n\n       * * * Headed Northwest from Santa Fe * * * eased over the \n     Continental Divide in northern New Mexico, cut through a spur \n     of the Rocky Mountains into Colorado, forded two swift rivers \n     (the Colorado and the Green above their junction), circled \n     northward to avoid the Grand Canyon's sculptured country, \n     dipped over the rim of the Great Basin into Utah, and crept \n     southwest through desert stretches of Nevada and California \n     to Los Angeles * * * Hoofs of pack animals leave but fleeting \n     imprints. As soon as the last mule train and left the Trail, \n     nature closed in to obliterate marks of human intrusion. \n     Matted brush sprang up to hide the mountain paths. Flash \n     floods gullied the gravel courses beside the streams. Chalky \n     gypsum surfaced the dry lake bottoms, so welcome to the hoofs \n     of foot-sore mules. Wind-born sand drifted over the shallow \n     trace through the wastelands. Even the dry bones that marked \n     the toll of an insatiable desert's greed crumbled to dust.\n\n  The trail entered present day Colorado south of Pagosa Springs and \nproceeded northwesterly past today's settlements of Arboles, Ignacio, \nDurango, Mancos, Dolores, and Dove Creek. This is essentially the route \nused by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante in 1776. Unlike Dominguez and \nEscalante, the trail continued to the northwest toward the site of \npresent day Monticello and crossed the Grand (Colorado) River at Moab \nand the Green River, 5 miles north of today's settlement of Green \nRiver. It continued westerly and passed the present settlements of \nCastle Dale, Salina, Sevier, Parowan, Newcastle, and St. George in \nUtah.\n  Another historic trade route, known as the northern branch of the Old \nSpanish Trail, was used by trappers and traders to access northwestern \nColorado and northeastern Utah. This route followed the east side of \nthe Rio Grande river northward to Taos and into Colorado to the area \nnear the present town of Alamosa. Another route of the northern branch \nfollowed the west side of the Rio Grande northward to Tres Piedras, New \nMexico, and to Antonito, Colorado, and joined the other branch near \nMonte Vista. From the vicinity of Monte Vista, the trail continued \nnorthwesterly and\n passed the present day settlements of Saguache, Gunnison, Montrose, \nDelta, and Grand Junction. From Grand Junction, the trail followed the \nGrand (Colorado) River for some 50 miles through Fruita and Loma to \nnear Dewey, UT, and then struck out northeast across the desert and \njoined the main Spanish Trail approximately 20 miles southeast of the \nGreen River crossing.\n\n  The northern branch was less used than the main Spanish Trail and \nvery little is recorded concerning its use. Antoine Robidoux's trading \nfort, near Delta, was a principal outpost on the trail.\n  The first person to record his journey from Santa Fe to Los Angeles \nwas Antonio Armejo, who went on a trading expedition in 1829. His route \nhad never been properly documented until 10 years ago when a historian \nfrom the University of Nevada began a study of the origins of the trail \nfor her masters thesis. Much of what we know about the trail comes from \nrecent scholarship and there is obviously much left to learn.\n  A journey over the Spanish Trail and the northern branch in 1848 was \nlater recorded by Lt. George B. Brewerton. The young lieutenant \naccompanied a party of some 30 men which included the noted scout, Kit \nCarson. Carson was carrying mail from Los Angeles to the East Coast. \nThe party left Los Angeles on May 4 and reached Santa Fe via Taos on \nJune 14, 41 days later. Carson proceeded east, reaching Washington, DC \nin mid-August, bringing news of the discovery of gold in California, \nand the great gold rush was on.\n  Another description of the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail \nin Colorado is told in the report of the Gunnison Expedition. In 1853, \nCapt. John Williams Gunnison, of the U.S. Corps of Topographic \nEngineers, was commissioned by the War Department to find a route for \nthe railroad across the Colorado Rockies along the 38th Parallel. The \nparty of 31 men and 32 U.S. Army Dragoons left Fort Leavenworth, KS, on \nJune 23, 1853. Among the civilians were a topographer, an artist-\ntopographer, an astronomer, a botanist, a geologist-surgeon, and a \nwagon master and his crew to manage the 18-unit wagon train.\n  After crossing the Sangre de Cristo Range, north of La Veta Pass, the \nGunnison Expedition came upon the northern branch of the Spanish Trail \nin the San Luis Valley. Captain Gunnison followed this existing trade \nroute of the northern branch of the Spanish Trail into eastern Utah \nwhere it joined the main Spanish Trail. The Gunnison Expedition came to \na tragic end on October 26, 1853, when Gunnison and four of his men and \nthree soldiers were killed in a skirmish with Indians near the present \nsite of Delta, UT.\n  The Old Spanish Trail played a part in all the cultures that occupied \nthe West: the Utes, Navajos, Spaniards, Mexicans, and American \nsettlers, including the mormons. The trail's period of use, from 1830 \nto the 1880's spans the development of the West,\n from the Spaniard on foot to the great railways. Few routes, if any, \npass through as much relatively pristine country as the Old Spanish \nTrail, particularly in northwest New Mexico, western Colorado, central \nUtah, southern Nevada and southern California. A number of independent \nscholars and various researchers have begun separate studies of \ndifferent segments of the trail, and an Old Spanish Trail Assoc. was \nrecently founded in Colorado to study and preserve this trail, and \nraise the public awareness of our country's diverse cultural heritage \nin this region. Some of the members of the association have already \nlocated wagon ruts and other vestiges of the trail's heyday, and a \nproper study is certain to produce more such exciting echoes of our \nshared heritage.\n\n  These is a groundswell of support for a study of the Old Spanish \nTrail. I've received resolutions to designate the trail as historic \nfrom over 20 municipalities in Colorado, as well as the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly. There are also a number of volunteer groups along the \ntrail who are anxious to offer their services, expertise and assistance \nto this very exciting and long overdue endeavor.\n  The time has come to acknowledge the national historical importance \nof the Old Spanish Trail. Mr. President, this bill to designate the Old \nSpanish Trail for study for potential addition to the National Trails \nSystem promotes the recognition, protection and interpretation of our \nhistory in the West. By introducing this legislation today, we pay \ntribute to the cultures of the West, and to an important period in \nAmerican history.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 with respect to rules governing litigation contesting \ntermination or reduction with respect to rules governing litigation \ncontesting termination or reduction of retiree health benefits; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 retiree health benefits protection act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week on the floor of the Senate I \nspoke about the struggles of the 1,200 retirees \n[[Page S4367]]  of the John Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, \nwho, along with over 2,000 other company retirees around the country, \nfound out in January that their health benefits--benefits they believed \nthey would have for life--were being abruptly terminated. These \nretirees, many of whom had accepted lower pensions in return for the \npromise of lifetime health benefits, were suddenly faced with the \nprospect of paying up to $500 a month per couple for health insurance \nor losing the benefits that they had assumed would be available during \ntheir retirement years.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to help these retirees and their \nfamilies; legislation that would restore their health benefits as they \nseek redress in court and establish protections against such arbitrary \nbehavior by employers in the future.\n  My bill would protect retirees' health benefits in two ways:\n  First, it would require employers to continue to provide retiree \nhealth benefits while a cancellation of benefits is being challenged in \ncourt. Anyone who has dealt with our legal system and its long waiting \nperiods and delays knows the importance of this measure.\n  Why should anyone who has worked for 20 or 30 years be forced to \nspend his or her life savings on health insurance--or go without health \ninsurance entirely--while their pleas for simple justice wind through \nthe courts?\n  Second, my bill would eliminate the surprise nature of employee \nhealth benefit cancellations by requiring employers to prove they had \nwarned workers in advance, before they retire, that their future \nbenefits could be canceled at some time in the future. That seems only \nfair.\n  This legislation recognizes that health benefits are not charity. \nMany workers give up larger pensions and other benefits in exchange for \nthem. It never occurs to these workers that their benefits could be \ntaken away, with no increase in their pensions or other benefits to \ncompensate for the loss.\n  Many workers stay with the same company for dozens of years, perhaps \nall of their adult lives. They believe that a company they help build \nwill reward their loyalty, honesty, and hard work.\n  Unfortunately, this is not always the case, as the 3,300 retirees of \nJohn Morrell & Co. found out only a week before their benefits were \nterminated.\n  In this particular case, Morrell retirees received a simple, yet \nunexpected, letter stating their health insurance plan was being \nterminated, effective midnight, January 31, 1995--only a week later. \nThe benefits being terminated, the letter said, included all hospital, \nmajor medical, and prescription drug coverage, Medicare supplemental \ninsurance, vision care, and life insurance coverage.\n  For those retirees under 65, this action poses a particular problem. \nWhile Morrell gave them the option of paying for their own coverage for \nup to 1 year, few can afford the $500 monthly premium for a couple. And \nmany cannot purchase coverage at any price, because of preexisting \nconditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n Medicare beneficiaries would have to buy expensive supplemental \ninsurance on their own.\n\n  Morrell's decision was all the more painful to the retirees because \nit was so unexpected. These retirees believed they worked for a fair \ncompany; that a fair day's work resulted in a fair day's pay. Part of a \nfair day's pay is the retirement income and benefits employees earn \nthrough their service.\n  These retirees found out the hard way that the company they had \nhelped to build had turned its back on them.\n  They also found out that the court system was not sympathetic to \ntheir cause. An Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling allowed the \ncompany to take this action. The union representing the retirees plans \nto appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.\n  Sadly, some of the retirees won't live long enough to benefit from a \npossible reversal.\n  These proud and hard-working people now worry that high medical costs \nwill impoverish them or force them to rely on their children or the \ngovernment for financial help. Each day they live in fear of illness \nand injury because they have no health insurance.\n  Because this legislation is not just for the Morrell retirees, \nbecause what happened to these workers is not an isolated situation--it \ncould happen to any of the 14 million retired workers who believe they \nand their families have life-long health insurance coverage through \ntheir employers.\n  Two-thirds of American companies surveyed recently had plans to \nreduce retiree health benefits or to shift more costs to retirees.\n  The Morrell dispute is one of 35 cases nationwide in which retirees \nare suing their former companies for slashing those benefits, or \ncutting them altogether.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the long-run solution is comprehensive \nhealth reform that guarantees every American--and employer--access to \naffordable health care.\n  I have fought over the years for this kind of comprehensive reform \nand was deeply disappointed when the 103d Congress was unable to pass \nlegislation addressing some of our health care system's most serious \nproblems. If we had passed health reform, the Morrell retirees would \nnot be facing this loss of their health benefits today.\n  Clearly, the problems we talked about in last year's health reform \ndebate did not solve themselves when the session ended.\n  And some of these problems, like the one the Morrell retirees face, \ncannot wait for the long-run. These retirees cannot wait for the \nresolution of the health reform debate.\n  The new majority in Congress seems to believe the solution to all our \nproblems--economic, social, moral, you name it--is passing their so-\ncalled Contract With America.\n  I believe the solution is restoring the old contract between workers \nand employers. The contract that said if you work hard, you can get \nahead. The contract that said if you give a company 20 or 30 years of \nloyal service, you can retire with dignity. The contract that said if \nyou give someone your word, you will keep it.\n  Restoring that contract must be our ultimate aim.\n  In the meantime, I am determined to work with my colleagues in \nCongress to make sure retirees can keep their health insurance while \nthey wait for their day in court, and to be sure that no other retirees \nget an unexpected letter in the mail, similar to the one the Morrell \nretirees received.\n  That is the goal of the legislation that I am introducing today.\n  I hope we can pass this measure expeditiously, to end the injustice \nof the Morrell situation, and so that others never have to face the \nproblem Morrell retirees are grappling with today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to permit \nGovernors to limit the disposal of out-of-State solid waste in their \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n           INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Interstate \nTransportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. For the past 5 \nyears, I have fought to give all States and local communities the right \nto say ``No'' to out-of-State trash. I am convinced that interstate \nwaste legislation is necessary so that States and communities can \nintelligently plan their waste disposal needs.\n  As interstate waste legislation has traveled through the Senate and \nthe House, we have learned important principles in the effort to \nprotect importing States while allowing exporters sufficient time to \nadjust to new rules. My bill incorporates these important principles.\n  First, my bill allows the importing States to ratchet down the amount \nof trash they receive. Beginning in 1997, landfills and incinerators \nthat receive more than 50,000 tons of trash may reduce the amount of \nout-of-State trash they import.\n  Second, my bill requires the exporting States to reduce the\n   amount of trash that they export by certain target dates. This \nprovision allows for a gradual adjustment on the part of the large \nexporting States.\n\n  Third, my bill allows all States to choose between 1993 and 1994 \nfreeze levels. This provision ensures flexibility without sacrificing \nprotection from flow levels that fluctuate.\n  Finally, my bill will provide additional backup authority to limit \nwaste flows by allowing the State planning and permitting process to \ntake into account local need when siting new capacity. Under this \nprovision, a State could deny a permit for construction or operation of \na new landfill based on the fact that there is no local or regional \nneed.\n  The flow of waste across State lines is not a new problem. States \nlike Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Indiana have suffered \nunder the tremendous volumes of out-of-State waste. States have tried \nto stop the growing shipments of interstate waste by enacting \nlegislation that restricts the flow. Yet, courts have held many of \nthese laws in violation of the commerce clause and therefore \nunconstitutional. In order to address the constitutional question, \nCongress must legislate the issue.\n  During the past 5 years, Congress has come close to giving the States \nthe power to enact interstate waste legislation.

A bill for the relief of Matt Clawson; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    private relief for matt clawson\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of Matt Clawson of Pocatello, ID. Mr. Clawson has been required \nto pay dearly for mistakes made by his Government. His plaintive appeal \nfor help is a proper place for Congress to begin redressing and \nreforming profligate regulatory excesses, abuses, and injustices by \nthis Government against its citizens.\n  Mr. Clawson obtained from the U.S. Forest Service all of the required \napprovals for his mining claim and plan of operations on the Middle \nFork of the Salmon River near the Frank Church River of No Return \nWilderness in Idaho. He spend what was for him an enormous sum of money \nto develop and begin working the claim according to Forest Service \nrequirements. Shortly thereafter, however, and before he could recover \nany of his investment, he was required to cease operations. The reason \nwas a lawsuit and subsequent court rulings that found the Forest \nService had erred in granting the approvals.\n  This bill simply reimburses Mr. Clawson's expenses with interest \n[[Page S4370]]  added. It does not attempt to provide compensation for \nany purported value of the claim. He has exhausted all of his legal \nremedies, necessitating this private relief bill. I believe the \ncompensation is more than warranted. Moreover, U.S. Claims Court Judge \nWiese commented on the record that Mr. Clawson's case had ``been a very \ntroubling case'' for him and he believed ``this man should be given \nsome relief somewhere.'' That somewhere can only be, and must be, here.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 592. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 and the National Labor Relations Act to modify certain provisions, \nto transfer certain occupational safety and health functions to the \nSecretary of Labor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n               occupational safety and health reform act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, one issue about which all of us have \nheard from our constituents, over and over again, is the need for \nfundamental reform of the tortured and increasingly tangled web of \nFederal overregulation. Perhaps more than in any other area of Federal \nGovernment regulation, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration [OSHA] has come to symbolize what is wrong. Today I \noffer a bill to reform the laws that were originally intended to ensure \nworkplace safety.\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate on numerous occasions in \nrecent months on examples of Federal Government overregulation, of the \nunintended consequences of regulatory excess that puts Americans out of \nwork, usurps our constitutional rights, and saps our productivity and \neconomic competitiveness. OSHA problems are always at the top of my \nconstituents' concerns.\n  For example, in my home State of Texas, an OSHA compliance officer \nfrom the Corpus Christi area office, stated under oath that OSHA area \ndirectors are under enormous pressure to produce high numbers of \ncitations and penalties--that OSHA employees' job performance \nevaluations apparently depend on meeting de facto quotas. This same \nOSHA compliance officer also testified that his supervisor directed him \nto cite companies, even when both the supervisor and the inspector knew \nfull well a company did not violate any regulation and did not warrant \na citation. In the words of this conscientious officer, his supervisors \ntold him to hit the employer.\n  In otherwords, Mr. President, one regulator can carry on a vendetta \nagainst an innocent business, thus jeopardizing that business and \neveryone who depends on that business to support themselves and their \nfamilies. This sort of thing is not supposed to happen in America, and \nit is Congress' job to make sure it does not.\n  Congress originally established OSHA to protect Americans from the \nthreat of injury in the workplace. OSHA was charged with investigating \nand, if necessary, penalizing businesses that willfully endangered its \nworkers. Businesses and workers have a mutual interest in promoting \nworkplace safety. No responsible businessman or businesswoman would \nintentionally put another human being at risk. Furthermore, accidents \nreduce productivity and cost money; they deprive businesses of their \nmost important, hardworking, productive employees. No business prospers \nwhen its employees are ill or injured.\n  Congress founded OSHA with the hope and expectation that the Federal \nGovernment could encourage businesses and employees to work\n together to resolve problems and to foster safer working environments. \nMr. President, this hope has been dashed--dashed by the congress' \nfailure to update Federal safety laws to keep pace with changes in the \nworkplace, dashed by the emergence of a culture of regulatory excess \nthat eats away at the vitality of our economy.\n\n  Therefore, I introduce a bill today to restore what Congress intended \n25 years ago, when OSHA was created, and to inject into our regulatory \nagencies some common sense and sound objective criteria. My bill aims \nto foment real cooperation between employer, employee and the Federal \nGovernment, and to ensure that OSHA's resources are focused on the \nsafety issues the American people want to have protected--not on \nvendettas against certain businesses, not on quotas for Federal \ninspectors to meet, not on tearing down labor-management cooperation we \nmust have if we are to continue as the world's most productive and \ndynamic economy.\n  A safe worksite is everybody's responsibility, but today that is not \nthe case. Laws are enforced so that the responsibility rests \nexclusively on the employer. Employers must be held accountable, but \nthe frivolousness manner in which safety laws are applied in many cases \ndoes nothing to improve safety and does incalculable harm to American's \nconfidence in their Government.\n  Not long ago, the Indiana OSHA found the owner of an Indiana Handy \nMart liable for not providing a safe workplace after an armed bandit \nrobbed and killed an employee of the store. In other words, it is the \nstore owner's fault that there are armed criminals on our streets. By \nthis same logic, it is every robbery victim's fault, for not having \ntaken sufficient precautions.\n  Mr. President, we all know how serious the problem of crime and \nviolence are. But does anyone think the fault for this crisis and the \nresponsibility for overcoming it lies with the victims?\n  This case highlights the way that regulatory excess has been allowed \nto drift into absurdity. Indeed, the absurd is becoming the norm, as \nmillions of Americans who operate businesses and work for a living \nknow. It is Congress that has refused to acknowledge how long overdue \nare the fundamental reforms needed to restore common sense.\n  My bill will also stop OSHA from citing an employer, even when he or \nshe has provided the proper training and equipment to prevent an \naccident, and taken every conceivable step to assure safety.\n  In east Texas, after two workers--a supervisor and his assistant--\ndied of asphyxiation after entering a confined space against strict \ncompany policy, originally OSHA concluded that there was no violation, \nand OSHA closed the case. However, OSHA reopened the case and issued \nseveral citations after a civil lawsuit was filed. The employer's \ninsurance company panicked and settled the suit for $1.5 million. \nSubsequently, OSHA dropped the citations. But the harm was done.\n  This kind of case sets a very dangerous precedent. The mere fact that \nOSHA has cited a company is often enough to convince a jury of employer \nwrongdoing, and in many jurisdictions a citation is admissible as per \nse negligence. An employer has no choice but to challenge very OSHA \ncitation for fear of civil liability if he or she complies. We must \nchange that, and my bill does--by making OSHA citations and abatement \nefforts inadmissible as evidence in any private litigation or \nenhancement of recovery under worker's compensation law.\n  My bill also changes current OSHA practice of conducting wall-to-wall \ninspections of a business whenever an employee files a complaint about \na specific workplace issue. Congress didn't intend for Federal \nregulators to tear a business apart every time a complaint is filed. \nOSHA's current policies threaten every business with a disgruntled \nemployee.\n  To encourage more labor-management cooperation, my legislation also \nasks that an employee first notify his or her employer of a potential \nworkplace hazard. Any responsible business operator will take steps to \nrectify problems before an accident occurs. If not, OSHA can step in \nand take action. Common sense, Mr. President, just plain common sense.\n  Another provision of my legislation borrows from the TEAM Act, \nintroduced by my friend from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, who chairs the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee. Federal regulators\n currently prohibit employers and employees from forming employer-\nemployee groups to discuss issues like workplace safety. The \nlegislation I introduce today, just like the TEAM Act which Senator \nKassebaum has authored--which I cosponsored--would permit such \nlegitimate workplace cooperation.\n\n  Businesses, especially small businesses, are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to endure the current regulatory environment. The same small \nbusiness \n[[Page S4371]]  sector that has always been the engine of economic \ngrowth, the creator of most new jobs in our country, is increasingly \nstifled and hamstrung by a rising tide of Federal overregulation.\n  But as I speak, OSHA is readying a gigantic expansion of its \nregulatory authority. Its so-called ergonomics rules will give OSHA \nauthority to control virtually every aspect of a business' operations. \nUnder the proposed new rules, OSHA would be able to set limits on \nemployee productivity, to limit work shifts and overtime, to re-design \nmachinery, even entire production lines, and to prohibit innovation.\n  At best, these proposed rules are based on the shakiest of scientific \njustification. But there is no doubt of the harm they will do. Initial \nestimates put the costs of compliance at $21 billion a year. \nEventually, however, these new rules would guarantee our businesses and \nour workers would lose ground steadily in the vital areas of \nproductivity and innovation, thus doing incalculable harm to our \neconomy.\n  According to the Clinton administration's 1995 regulatory plan, OSHA \nis also working on eight other significant new regulations. I \nbureaucratic parlance, a significant action is one that will cost at \nleast $100 million annually. It's no wonder the administration is \nrequesting a more-than-10 percent increase in OSHA's budget. Enforcing \nall of these new regulations will require thousands of new inspectors, \nsupervisors, and bureaucrats.\n  The administration also is fighting to maintain funding for the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which I propose \nto end. NIOSH costs nearly $133 million this year, with no appreciable \nbenefits for workplace safety or the national welfare.\n  Twenty-five years ago, this body helped to create a new agency, OSHA, \nto pursue a worthwhile goal--protecting American workers from avoidable \ninjury in the work place. The idea was based upon a partnership between \nemployers, employees and the Government. That experiment has not \nworked. The very legislation that was meant to free people from the \neveryday threat of accidental injury is now threatening to remove our \nfreedoms.\n  Mr. President, we have the responsibility of averting threats to our \nfreedoms. We can do so merely by doing what Congress intended to do in \nthe first place. Through the application of common sense tests for \nFederal involvement and return to cooperation, we can make worksites \nboth safer and better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nauthorize the export of new drugs and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 FDA export reform and enhancement act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, almost 10 years ago, the Congress had a \ngood idea.\n  In 1986, we approved legislation which took the unprecedented step of \nallowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to export their products to 21 \nforeign nations, without prior FDA approval.\n  Many though it was a bold step at the time.\n  It turned out to be a good idea which worked well.\n  Today, 9 years later, I rise to introduce legislation to take another \nstep in that process. I am joined in cosponsorship of this legislation \nby Senator Gregg, and by Senators Kassebaum, Abraham, Frist, and Coats.\n  Let me at this time recognize the outstanding leadership that our \nHouse colleague, Representative Fred Upton, has shown in both drafting \nand marshalling considerable support for this legislation. This bill \nwould not be possible without Mr. Upton's leadership.\n  Undoubtedly some will also consider this legislation bold. But I \nsubmit to my colleagues that it will also turn out to be a good idea \nwhich works well. Even better than the 1986 law, which I authorized.\n  The Hatch-Gregg legislation, the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement \nAct of 1995, has a simple premise: that the Food and Drug \nAdministration cannot continue to be the traffic cop for world trade in \nmedical goods.\n  Current Food and Drug Administration regulations significantly \nrestrict the ability of U.S. manufacturers of human and animal drugs, \nbiological, and medical devices to export their products to world \nmarkets.\n  Under section 801(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, \nexporting a medical device that is not commercially distributed in the \nU.S. is subject to FDA receipt of the receiving country's approval of \nthe device and FDA determination that the export would not be contrary \nto the public health and safety of the importing country.\n  The FDA requires an export permit for unapproved, class III devices, \nthose requiring pre-market approval [PMA's]. Many countries also \nrequest a certificate of free sale from the United States indicating \nthat the product has been approved in the United States. This is \nbasically a rubber stamp provided by the FDA on a voluntary basis.\n  The irony in this situation is that a manufacturer cannot export \ncertain unapproved medical devices, even if they have been approved by \nthe foreign country with an established regulatory system.\n  Also under section 801(e) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \npharmaceutical companies are only free to export unapproved drugs to 21 \ncountries delineated in the law. Those countries are; Australia, \nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal\n Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \nLuxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, \nSweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\n  Prior to 1986, there was no authority for manufacturers of FDA-\nregulated \n[[Page S4375]]  products to send those products overseas unless they \nwere first approved by the FDA. The Pharmaceutical Export Act of 1986, \nallowed, for the first time, manufacturers to export their products to \nthe above list of countries, provided the sponsor is pursuing a new \ndrug application [NDA] in the United States.\n  Our experience since that time has shown that the law is still too \nrigid. The list of countries is too proscriptive, and the regulatory \nrequirements unnecessarily burdensome.\n  For example, the list does not include Israel. It does not include \nEastern European countries or most of the Pacific rim. There is near \nuniversal agreement this needs to be rectified.\n  Although the 1986 act represented a good step forward, it has led to \nthe development of a patchwork quilt of bureaucracy that has forced \nU.S. manufacturers to establish and maintain facilities outside the \nUnited States.\n  For example, prior approval of export plans by FDA is required to \nship products overseas. To ship bulk or finished products, companies \nmust apply for prior approval from FDA, be granted approval, and ship \nthe products. This process takes 3-12 months plus transportation time, \ncreating costly delays that reduce market access and penetration by \nU.S. firms.\n  It is important to note that market conditions in importing companies \nmay dictate the sale of products utilizing dosage strengths, e.g., 250 \nmilligrams versus 125 milligrams, formulations--caplet, tablet, etc.--\nor inert ingredients different from those approved or being pursued in \nthe U.S. export of similar, but not identical, products is currently \nprohibited.\n  Another problem is that FDA labeling requirements mandate that \npackaged exports be labeled in English for the FDA-approved \nindications, regardless of the linguistic or regulatory requirements of \nthe importing country.\n  At the same time, the law imposes time-consuming requirements on FDA, \nwhose resources should be better directed to reviewing new, life-saving \nmedicines and technologies.\n  It is clear that FDA is making progress in speeding up review times \nfor drugs and devices, although there still are problems.\n  For example, FDA says that its average processing time for export \npermits for medical devices has moved from 65 days in 1993 to 16 days \nin 1994. For export certificates, the FDA says its processing times \nhave declined from 51.5 days in 1993 to 10 days in 1994.\n  I must commend the Center director, Dr. Bruce Burlington, and the \nOffice of Device Evaluation Director, Dr. Susan Alpert, for that \nprogress. Their work has really made a difference.\n  But the FDA statistics don't tell the whole story. These\n   are average review times. In 1993, in some cases, it took the FDA \nover 270 days to approve export permits, and still up to 150 days for \napproval in 1994. In 1994 they processed 756 permit applications, and \n1,469 certificates.\n\n  Not only can FDA review be time-consuming, but using it is a measure \nof export delays is misleading. Manufacturers have to compile the data \nto send to FDA requesting export. And, they have to go to the importing \ncountry and get a letter proving that the country has approved the \ndevice for import. This, too, adds substantial time to the process \nupfront.\n  Another concern we have is about the potential for FDA reprogramming \nits resources away from this activity to another. We have no assurance \nthat the statistics will stay at the current rate.\n  But I feel compelled to raise the larger point.\n  I think we have to ask ourselves if this export review is how we want \nto be spending Government resources in this day and age. If other \nnations wish to receive the benefits of our technology, why must we \ninsist on approving that technology first?\n  In a time of unprecedented harmony in worldwide trade, as reflected \nby recent passage of GATT, our laws relating to the export of foods, \ndrugs, medical devices and cosmetics should reflect that comity as \nwell. The paternalistic approach evidenced in our current law is no \nlonger compatible with today's world marketplace.\n  The Hatch-Gregg bill remedies this situation by allowing \nmanufacturers to export their products in any countries belonging to \nthe World Trade Organization [WTO]. A second provision allows export to \nnon-WTO countries unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ndetermines that the possibility of the reimportation of the device or \ndrug into the United States presents an imminent hazard to the public \nhealth and safety of the United States and the only means of limiting \nthe hazard is to prohibit the export of the device or drug.\n  The products to be exported must accord to the specifications of the \nforeign purchaser. They must not be in conflict with the laws of the \ncountry to which they are intended for export. They must be labeled for \nexport on the outside of the shipping package. They must not be sold or \noffered for sale in domestic commerce. And they cannot have been \n``banned,'' or turned down for approval here in the United States.\n  This is not a health bill, Mr. President, S. 593 is about exports and \njobs. It is about U.S. competitiveness abroad.\n  The U.S. drug manufacturing industry accounts for about $60 billion \nin annual production, with a trade surplus of $800 million in 1993. \nLast year, U.S. drug companies accounted for about a third of total \nworld production.\n  There are approximately 11,000 medical device companies in the United \nStates which make between 60,000 and 80,000 different brands or models. \nMost of these companies are small. Two-thirds of the companies have \nfewer than 50 employees.\n  In Utah, we have over 100 device manufacturing companies, some of the \nfinest in the Nation, and they are really feeling the pinch of our \nrestrictive export policies.\n  The U.S. medical device manufacturing industry accounts for more than \n$50 billion in production and had a trade surplus in 1994 of $4.9 \nbillion.\n  Last year, U.S. companies accounted for 46 percent of global \nproduction. Moreover, this industry has been a major source of \nemployment and export growth in recent years.\n  Between 1988 and 1993, 32 percent of production growth for this \nindustry went to serve strong overseas demand for medical technology. \nDuring the same period, employment grew by more than 4 percent a year \nin this industry.\n  In June 1944, the Gallup Organization surveyed 58 medical electronics \nmanufacturing companies which--based on their estimates--serve as many \nas 76 million patients around the world with their products.\n  These companies indicated the following:\n  Eighty-three percent said they experienced excessive delays by FDA \nfor approval of new products;\n  Forty percent said they reduced the number of employees in the United \nStates due to FDA delays;\n  Twenty-nine percent said they increased their investment in non-U.S. \noperations; and\n  Twenty-two percent said they moved U.S. jobs overseas.\n  This provides compelling evidence that U.S. regulatory policies are \ndriving medical device manufacturing companies offshore. The same thing \nis happening with pharmaceuticals.\n  Manufacturers experience so much red-tape in sending their products \noverseas, that they prefer to make them overseas. The United States is \na net loser: in jobs and productivity.\n  We should not allow this to continue.\n  Mr. President, almost a week ago, the administration announced it was \nundertaking several FDA reforms, including a review of its export \npolicy.\n  I am hopeful that the administration will seriously consider our \nlegislation so that we may work together to see these needed changes in \nthe law are made.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is \ndesigned to address a number of problems that currently prohibit \nAmerican companies from competing in the international marketplace: the \nFood and Drug Administration's [FDA] export policies on the overseas \nsale of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. The FDA has \nrepeatedly stated that export issues are not within their realm of \nexpertise, and that they would not oppose a new standard as put forth \nby Congress.\n  We are here to submit that new standard. This bill does not call for \nradical measures that would jeopardize \n[[Page S4376]]  the safety of citizens of other countries. This bill \ndoes not simply allow unapproved products to be randomly shipped around \nthe world. It does not allow export products to be sold domestically.\n  What this bill does do is recognize the authority of our \ninternational trading partners by acknowledging that WTO [World Trade \nOrganization] members have an evolved import system to control what \nproducts are being brought into their country, a step up from general \nGATT signatories. It permits WTO countries to decide for themselves \nwhether or not they want to approve a product to be available to their \ncitizens, and specifies a notification process by U.S. manufacturers to \nthe FDA for those nations that are not WTO members. Our bill specifies \nthat a device which is banned in the United States by the FDA cannot be \nexported. This legislation provides recourse to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to prohibit exports if she judges there to be an \n``imminent hazard'' that the product would be shipped back into the \nUnited States, threatening to the health or safety of consumers.\n  These are all critical components and appropriate to promoting U.S. \nmanufacturers in the international marketplace. The bill is designed to \nallow U.S. medical technology and products, the best in the world, to \ncompete fairly with foreign manufacturers. And it allows autonomy among \nour trading partners.\n  I as pleased to hear the President address FDA reform in his speech \non March 16 as part of ``Reinventing Government.'' This is a positive \nstep in dealing with a number of issues that stem from the current \nregulatory climate at this, and many other, Federal agencies. I look \nforward to working with the administration and my colleagues here on \nthe Hill to reform the policies and procedures of this important \nagency.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 594. A bill to provide for the administration of certain Presidio \nproperties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    presidio trust establishment act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to minimize \nthe costs to the taxpayer of the newest addition to our National Park \nSystem, the Presidio of San Francisco.\n  In 1972, Congress recognized the park potential of the Presidio. At \nthat time Congressman Phil Burton's legislation creating the Golden \nGate National Recreation Area [GGNRA] was drawn to include the \nPresidio, and provided that the Presidio would become a national park \nwhen it was no longer needed by the Army. Thus when the Army vacated \nthe base last September, the Park Service assumed responsibility for \nadministering the Presidio as part of the GGNRA.\n  It is projected that the new park will attract 10 million or more \nvisitors a year. Those visitors will enjoy one of the most beautiful \nand historic urban open spaces in the world. The park offers \nspectacular vistas of the Pacific Ocean, the Golden Gate, the Marin \nHeadlands, San Francisco Bay, and the skyline of San Francisco.\n  The Presidio also offers over 200 years of military history, from its \nfounding in 1776, through the Civil War, the Spanish-American War and \nWorld Wars I and II. Presidio architecture represents a remarkable \ncollection of structures dating from the days of Mexican sovereignty \nover California. The entire Presidio was declared a national historic \nlandmark in 1962.\n  The bill we introduce today will establish the Presidio Trust, a \npublic entity modeled on the successful Pennsylvania Avenue Development \nCorporation.\n  The Trust will help us put the Presidio's buildings to work for the \npark. Rents and other revenues will be retained to restore and conserve \nthe Presidio's extraordinary natural and historic resources.\n  The Trust will manage the facilities at the Presidio which are not of \nthe type normally administered by the National Park Service. It will be \nresponsible for leasing, maintenance, and property management--\nconsistent with the park management plan and the legislation creating \nthe Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The open space, forests, and \nrecreational land will be managed by the Park Service as they are doing \nin other parts of the GGNRA.\n  Critical to the success of this undertaking will be the Presidio's \nability to generate revenues to offset the costs of operation and \ncapital improvement. The Trust will have the flexibility necessary to \nnegotiate terms of leases and other contracts, to leverage lease \nrevenues, and to utilize a staff qualified in financial management. It \nwill be accountable to the public through a public-private governing \nboard of directors, annual auditing and reporting requirements, and a \nrequirement to adhere to the publicly approved general management plan \nfor the Presidio and the GGNRA authorizing legislation.\n  According to expert analysis, the Presidio Trust established by this \nbill would produce savings of 20 to 30 percent when compared to the \ncost of total Federal management of the Presidio. The Presidio is an \nexample of defense conversion that will be cost effective while serving \nan important national purpose.\n  The Presidio is one of the Nation's great treasures. If we act now, \nwe can ensure its successful transformation from a military base into \none of the world's outstanding urban parks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 594\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Presidio, located amidst the incomparable scenic \n     splendor of the Golden Gate, is one of America's great \n     natural and historic sites;\n       (2) the Presidio is the oldest continuously operating \n     military post in the Nation dating from 1776, and was \n     designated as National Historic Landmark in 1962;\n       (3) preservation of the cultural and historic integrity of \n     the Presidio for public use recognizes its significant role \n     in the history of the United States;\n       (4) the Presidio, in its entirety, is a part of the Golden \n     Gate National Recreation Area, in accordance with Public Law \n     92-589;\n       (5) as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, \n     the Presidio's outstanding natural, historic, scenic, \n     cultural, and recreational resources must be managed in a \n     manner which is consistent with sound principles of land use \n     planning and management, and which protects the Presidio from \n     development and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty \n     and historic and natural character of the area; and\n       (6) the Presidio will be managed through an innovative \n     public/private partnership that minimizes cost to the United \n     States Treasury and makes efficient use of private sector \n     resources that could be utilized in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the extension of a hydroelectric \nproject located in the State of West Virginia; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               extension of ferc license for grafton, wv\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I introduce, on behalf of myself and Senator \nRockefeller, a bill to grant the city of Grafton, WV, a 4-year \nextension of its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] license to \nbegin construction of a hydroelectric power project at Tygart Dam in \nTaylor County. This project is to be financed entirely by the city of \nGrafton and its investors through nonpublic equity and debt. This \nextension is necessary because the license expires during the current \nyear and over $3 million has already been invested in this project. The \nhydroelectric project takes advantage of the existing dam on the Tygart \nRiver in order to generate power and will also include the development \nof recreational facilities. Extensive environmental studies on the \nproject have been conducted in coordination with interested regulatory \nagencies. Without any contribution from the Federal Government, the \ncity and its investors will finance the project, which will include \nfishing piers, walkways, picnic facilities, and a parking area.\n  The city and its investors anticipate that the project would employ \n200 staff during the peak of construction, with a $1 million monthly \npayroll. The total construction payroll for the project is expected to \nbe $15 million. The Grafton hydropower project will provide substantial \ntaxes and other payments to various governmental entities during \nconstruction and operation. The Federal Government will benefit from \nthis project since it will receive annual payments of $200,000 from the \nhydroelectric project. The Federal Government also will receive income \ntax from the project, as it will be privately financed. It is hoped \nthat the license extension made possible by this bill will bring \nsignificant economic development to the Taylor County region of West \nVirginia.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Bradley):\n  S. 596. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to disallow \ndeductions for advertising and promotional expenses for tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          elimination of deductibility of tobacco advertising\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation that addresses a very serious problem in a \ncommonsense way. During the budget debate in 1992 I offered an \namendment to limit the tax deductibility of tobacco advertising. It \ndidn't pass. And, because it didn't pass, the American taxpayers are \nstill coughing up billions to promote smoking.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would eliminate the taxpayer \ndeductibility of tobacco advertising and promotion.\n  These days we hear a lot of talk about cuts in school lunches, cuts \nin the WIC Program, cuts in investments to improve the health of \nAmericans.\n  I believe there's a better way to go--with commonsense cuts that \npromote the health of our economy and the health of our people.\n  It's time for tobacco companies to quit blowing our tax dollars up in \nsmoke with their big tobacco advertising campaigns. It's time for them \nto stop luring our kids into their deathtraps.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission the tobacco industry spent \n$5.2 billion in 1992 to advertise and promote cigarettes. But that's \nnot just their money, it's ours, too. Because all of those expenses are \ntax deductible.\n  In fact, American taxpayers are coughing up nearly $2 billion a year \nin tax subsidies and serving as a silent partner in helping big tobacco \ncompanies peddle their products and hook our kids.\n  This taxpayer-subsidized multi-billion-dollar effort includes ads in \nmagazines and newspapers, and outside advertising such as billboards, \nadvertising at supermarkets and convenience stores, use of gifts, and \nsponsorship of sporting events.\n  And all of this is designed to convince people that smoking is cool--\nnecessary for social acceptance and helps make one attractive to the \nopposite sex. It is deliberately designed to keep people smoking, but \nmore importantly, to attract a new generation to the smoking habit.\n  Every day, another $5 million of taxpayer money is used to promote a \nproduct that--when used as intended--causes disease, disability, and \ndeath.\n  Every day, another 3,000 of America's children get hooked on smoking.\n  Consider what the taxpayers receive for their money. We get Old Joe \nCamel. If you don't know who Joe Camel is just ask any first-grader.\n  According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, more 6-year-olds can identify Old Joe Camel than adults. \nIn fact, just as many 6-year-olds can identify Old Joe Camel as they \ncan Mickey Mouse.\n  And his name recognition has really paid off--since the introduction \nof Old Joe, sales of Camel cigarettes to children under 18 went from $6 \nmillion to over $476 million a year.\n  But that's not all. Joe is branching out. And so are some of his \ncompetitors. They have all started what I call merchandising clubs in \nwhich you can smoke your way to all sorts of gifts.\n  A study in this month's Consumer Reports magazine found that 11 \npercent of children between the age of 12 to 17 owned at least one \ntobacco industry promotional item.\n  And it only gets worse, cigarette companies not only know what kids \nlike, they know where they live. The same poll in Consumer Reports \nfound that 7.6 percent of teens received cigarette company mail at home \naddressed directly to them. If you carry those figures nationwide, that \nmeans 1.6 million children are on the tobacco mailing list.\n  These campaigns are outrageous and they violate the industry's own \ncigarette advertising code. The industry has adopted a code that states \nthat ``cigarette advertising shall not represent that cigarette smoking \nis essential to social prominence, distinction, success, or sexual \nattraction.\n  But how does that square with these ads? How does that square with \nthe Marlboro Aventure Team? How does that square with Joe Camel? It \nsimply doesn't and we ought not subsidize it.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in \nlegislation he is offering today to allow American taxpayers to recover \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health program costs associated \nwith tobacco-related illnesses. For too long the tobacco companies have \nbeen raking in profits while the American taxpayers have been coughing \nup billions in health care costs attributable to tobacco related \nillness.\n  The Medicare and Medicaid share of these costs total over $15 billion \nper year and the costs to other Federal health programs are nearly $5 \nbillion.\n  The Columbia University Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse has \nestimated that tobacco-related illnesses \n[[Page S4379]]  will cost the Medicare program $800 billion over the \nnext 20 years. At\n that rate, Medicare will go bankrupt.\n\n  It is unconscionable that the tobacco industry has profited while the \ntaxpayer has been left with the devastating and widespread costs \nassociate with tobacco use.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Lautenberg would hold \nmanufacturers accountable for the damage they do. Manufacturers of \ntobacco products would pay for the cost of tobacco-related illness \nincurred by Government through the Medicaid, Medicare, and other health \nprograms.\n  I am also pleased that Senator Bradley is introducing legislation to \nfurther the effort to decrease cigarette smoking. An increase in the \ntobacco tax is one of the most effective methods for significantly \nreducing tobacco use among children and adults. We know that for every \n10 percent increase in the price of tobacco products, there will be \napproximately a 4-percent decrease in tobacco consumption, and possibly \neven greater decrease in tobacco use among children.\n  Mr. President, we must take every possible opportunity to convince \npeople to stop smoking and prevent children from ever taking up the \nhabit. As former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated:\n\n       Smoking is associated with more death and illness than \n     drugs, alcohol, automobile accidents, and AIDS combined.\n\n  U.S. Public Health Service figures tell us that over 430,000 \nAmericans will die from cigarette smoking this year. That is more than \nthe number of Americans who died in all of World War II. Over 1,000 \nAmericans will die today from smoking. That is more than the equivalent \nof two fully loaded jumbo jets crashing with no survivors--every day.\n  The medical data on the health effects of smoking are well \nestablished. Since 1964, when the first Surgeon General's ``Report on \nSmoking and Health'' was issued, some 50,000 scientific studies on the \nrelationship between smoking and disease have been conducted. Smoking \nhas been shown to be a major case of heart disease, chronic bronchitis, \nand emphysema; cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, pancreas, \nand bladder; pneumonia and stomach cancers.\n  Mr. President, as we look for way to tackle the budget deficit we \nshould not be cutting initiatives that help people and investment in \nour future. Instead we should close the corporate tax loopholes. And \nlet's start by eliminating special breaks that help big tobacco \ncorporations and hurt our kids.\n  Passage of the Harkin, Lautenberg, and Bradley bills would be a \ntriple play for our economy and our Nation's health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTIONS FOR ADVERTISING AND \n                   PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RELATING TO TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCT USE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part IX of subchapter B of chapter 1 of \n     subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     items not deductible) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 2801. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTION FOR TOBACCO \n                   ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES.\n\n       No deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for \n     expenses relating to advertising or promoting cigars, \n     cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, or any similar \n     tobacco product. For purposes of this section, any term used \n     in this section which is also used in section 5702 shall have \n     the same meaning given such term by section 5702.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     part IX is amended by adding after the item relating to \n     section 280H the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 280I. Disallowance of deduction for tobacco advertising and \n              promotion expenses.''\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1995.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Harkin, \nto introduce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to forbid tobacco companies to deduct their advertising and \npromotional expenses when calculating their taxes.\n  I have already discussed the huge toll--in both economical and human \nterms--which tobacco wreaks on this country. And I have already \nintroduced a bill increasing the tax on all tobacco products by a \nfactor of five. Mr. President, the Harkin-Bradley bill complements my \nearlier bill by ensuring that Federal Government acts consistently when \nit comes to tobacco.\n  Why do I say the Government acts inconsistently with regard to \ntobacco? Because on the one hand, it allows tobacco companies to deduct \ntheir advertising and promotional costs on their taxes. These tax \nexemptions are the equivalent of direct Government payments. In terms \nof lost revenues to the Federal Treasury, they are no different from \ncash payments to AFDC recipients. And we're not talking a small amount \nof money--in 1992, these deductions were worth approximately $1.7 \nbillion a year to tobacco companies.\n  On the other hand, the Government spends millions and millions of \ndollars to try to offset the harmful effects caused by tobacco use. We \nare giving more than $1.7 billion to the National Cancer Institute for \nresearch this year alone; this includes $114 million specifically for \nlung cancer. We require warning labels to be placed on cigarette \npackages to inform our citizens of the direct links between tobacco use \nand respiratory and lung diseases and possible birth defects. We \nprovide millions of dollars for public health campaigns to warn people \nof the danger of tobacco, and to help them to quit.\n  These are directly contradictory policies. First, we give the tobacco \ncompanies a tremendous tax incentive--a Government handout--essentially \nencouraging them to advertise and promote tobacco products. Then, we \nturn around and spend a billion or two trying to unravel the harm that \nwe have helped to cause, to reduce the health devastation we have \ncontributed to, by funding research on tobacco use and to fund \ncampaigns to discourage and end its use.\n  And think about those advertising and promotional campaigns which we \nare helping to finance. Many of them are targeted at our youth, who \noften may ignore well-intended and wise warnings about mortality, and \ninstead obey the behavior of their own peer groups who believe that \nsmoking is cool. Approximately 90\n percent of all smokers begin in their teens or younger. The tobacco \ncompanies know this and specifically target younger age groups in their \nadvertising. And the Federal Government helps to pay the bill for them \nto do so.\n\n  Mr. President, virtually all of the health care bills which were \nconsidered last session placed great emphasis on prevention. We know we \ncan reduce health care costs if we encourage our citizens to avoid \nunhealthy choices, and to exercise regularly, to eat right, and design \nour health care system to focus on preventive care and not wait until \nsomeone is sick to treat them. Yet cigarette smoking is the single most \npreventable cause of death in the United States. This bill takes action \nnow to put meaning into all the rhetoric about prevention. And at the \nsame time, it will save the Federal Government an estimated $1.7 \nbillion a year in foregone tax expenditures, once it is fully \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, this bill is health care reform that is right on \ntarget. It doesn't control prices, limit choices, or require any new \nGovernment intervention in health care. It addresses only those who are \ndirectly responsible for the largest preventable cause of death in the \nUnited States--the tobacco companies themselves.\n  Mr. President, the Government should speak with one voice on this \nproblem, and that voice should unequivocally say: ``Tobacco use will \nharm you.'' We will not subsidize the seller; we will not underwrite \nthe smoker; we will support efforts to stop; and we will dedicate our \nresources to preventing Americans from ever starting. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in ensuring that we speak with one voice by \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 597. A bill to insure the long-term viability of the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other Federal health programs by \n[[Page S4380]]  establishing a dedicated trust fund to reimburse the \nGovernment for the health care costs of individuals with diseases \nattributable to the use of tobacco products; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                     medicare/medicaid solvency act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare/Medicaid Solvency Act of 1995. This legislation will require \nthe tobacco industry to reimburse the Federal Government for Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other Federal health care program costs for diseases \nattributable to tobacco products.\n  Deliberations on the budget will soon begin and it looks like the \nCongress is serious about undertaking real, meaningful, and significant \ndeficit reduction. My bill will do just that.\n  Any serious attempt at deficit reduction must consider health care, \nparticularly the Medicare, Medicaid, and the other Federal health care \nprograms. Federal expenditures for these programs have skyrocketed in \nrecent years and current HCFA projections indicate that the Medicare \ntrust fund, which pays for Medicare part A costs, will become insolvent \nshortly after the turn of the century. Medicare part B, Medicaid, and \nother Federal health programs have no dedicated trust fund and \ncontribute with increasing severity each year to the deficit spending \nabout which we here in Congress complain so vehemently. It is now clear \nto everyone that changes in our Federal health care programs are \ninevitable if we wish to control and reduce the deficit.\n  My Republican colleagues have proposed to cut Medicare and Medicaid \nby $255-$275 billion over the next 5 years. As much as I admire the \nRepublicans' commitment to reducing Government waste and inefficiency, \nI do not believe we should seek to reduce the deficit by cutting health \ncare for our most vulnerable citizens: seniors, children, and the \ndisabled.\n  And so I now proposed a better idea. The Centers for Disease Control \ntell us that Federal health care expenditures for diseases attributable \nto tobacco products are currently about $20 billion per year. While \ntobacco companies receive approximately $100 billion in annual revenues \nand earn huge profits from the sale of their deadly products, taxpayers \nare forced to pay the health care bills for the diseases those products \ncause. This is outrageous and is exactly backwards from what logic and \njustice tell us it ought to be. We need to turn this system on its \nhead. We should be sending the Federal health care bills for tobacco-\nrelated diseases to the tobacco companies rather than to the taxpayers.\n  It is time to get serious about reducing the deficit. And the right \nway to reduce the deficit is not to reduce health care programs for \npeople in need; rather it is to insist that the tobacco industry accept \nfinancial responsibility for the problems it knowingly causes. My bill \ndoes this.\n  My message to the Republican leadership is simple: The tobacco \nindustry must be a part of any deficit reduction package. Much has been \nsaid in this Chamber about the need to reduce the Federal deficit, and \nthe need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions. Now \nit is time for the tobacco industry to accept responsibility for its \nactions. No member of this body who wishes to remain credible on \ndeficit reduction can continue to ignore the extraordinary impact of \nthis one industry on Government spending. There is no choice: either we \nvote to make the tobacco industry part of the solution to the deficit \nproblem, or we abandon any pretense of being serious on this issue.\n  My bill will reduce the deficit by $100 billion over 5 years. That is \napproximately $1,000 for every taxpayer in the country. It does this by \ndirecting the Secretary of Health and Human Services to annually \ndetermine the amount of Federal health care expenditures for diseases \nattributable to tobacco products and then authorizes the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to bill each tobacco company for its share of those \nexpenditures, based on each company's share of the market for tobacco \nproducts. My bill does not penalize smokers nor does it restrict \nsmoking in any way. It simply demands that those tobacco companies \nwhose products are the direct and immediate cause of many billions of \ndollars of Federal health care costs pay their fair share of those \ncosts.\n  The real question is: Who will pay for the Federal health care costs \nfor diseases attributable to tobacco products? Will it be the American \ntaxpayers who are drowning in our national debt, or will it be the \ntobacco companies who are swimming in profits? With this legislation, I \nchoose to side with the taxpayers and I hope my Senate colleagues will \ndo so as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of this bill, \na fact sheet, and a letter of support from the Coalition or Smoking or \nHealth printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) illnesses and diseases that result from the use of \n     tobacco products cost Federal Government health care programs \n     billions of dollars, including $10,200,000,000 in the \n     medicare program, $5,100,000,000 in the medicaid program, and \n     $4,700,000,000 in other Federal health programs in fiscal \n     year 1993;\n       (2) in April 1994, the trustees of the medicare trust funds \n     concluded that such funds may be insolvent in 2001;\n       (3) such insolvency would severely affect the ability of \n     the medicare trust funds to continue to protect the health of \n     America's senior citizens; and\n       (4) the medicare population has a significantly higher risk \n     of contracting illnesses and diseases that result from the \n     use of tobacco products than younger age groups.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to insure the \n     long-term viability of the medicare, medicaid, and other \n     federal health programs by establishing a dedicated trust \n     fund to reimburse the government for the health care costs of \n     individuals with diseases attributable to the use of tobacco \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe excise taxes on tobacco products, and to use a portion of the \nresulting revenues to fund a trust fund for tobacco diversification, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        tobacco consumption reduction and health improvement act\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat takes a bold step toward reducing the devastating health and \nfinancial effects of tobacco use in this country.\n  Mr. President, in both 1991 and 1993, I rose before this Chamber to \ntalk about the destructive effects of tobacco use and to introduce \nlegislation that would begin to redress these effects. Since my 1993 \nstatement, almost 1 million more people have died from tobacco-related \nillnesses. The time to stop this travesty is now, and to do that I am \nintroducing legislation that will raise the Federal excise tax on \ntobacco by a factor of five, which translates to an increase of $1.00 \nper pack of cigarettes.\n  Over 30 years after the 1964 Surgeon General's report sounded the \nhealth alarm for smoking, approximately one-quarter of the Nation's \nadults remain addicted to cigarettes. Smoking now kills an estimated \n419,000 Americans every year--more than alcohol, heroin, crack, \nautomobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides, and AIDS \ncombined. Furthermore, environmental tobacco smoke--smoke from other \npeople's cigarettes--causes tens of thousands of additional deaths. \nThis year, one out of every five Americans who dies will die from \ntobacco use.\n  If these statistics were not staggering enough, each year a growing \nnumber of teenagers start smoking, even though selling cigarettes to \nminors is illegal. Virtually all new users of tobacco are teenagers or \nyounger, and every 30 seconds a child in the United States smokes for \nthe first time. The efforts that have been waged by public health \nofficials against youth smoking have been dwarfed by the billions spent \nby the industry on advertising aimed at children and teenagers. The \naddiction of children to tobacco, and consequently the long-term \neffects, is a moral disgrace.\n  A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a lobbying group for the \ntobacco industry, was quoted as saying with regard to smoking:\n\n       This is a day and age when we ultimately have to recognize \n     that adults are going to indulge in the legal pleasures that \n     others don't approve of.\n\n  My response to the industry is: This legal pleasure kills more than \none out of three long-term users when used as intended. This legal \npleasure has been determined to be a major cause of heart disease, lung \ncancer, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, low-birthweight babies, strokes, \nand a variety of other diseases.\n This legal pleasure is as addictive as cocaine or heroin. They are \nright that I don't approve of the effects of this legal pleasure, and \nfor good reason.\n\n  Furthermore, this legal pleasure contributes substantially to health \ncare costs every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, health care expenditures caused directly by smoking totaled \n$50 billion in 1993, and $22 billion of those costs were paid by \nGovernment funds. According to a former Secretary of the Department of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare, smoking is the largest single drain on \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n  One of the most effective things we can do to control health care \ncosts is to end smoking. I view tobacco taxes as compensation for a \nportion of the health care costs burden we are forced to bear, thanks \nto smoking. It is more than fair to ask smokers to share some of the \ncosts which they help to create.\n  [[Page S4382]] Some people may think that the tobacco tax has already \nbeen raised substantially in recent years, and therefore that it is \nunfair to raise it again. This is a misconception. Despite the fact \nthat the average price of a pack of cigarettes has risen by more than \n$1.10 since 1982, only 8 cents of this increase is due to a rise in the \nFederal excise tax. And even the dollar-per-pack increase which I am \nproposing will generate only about $12 billion a year in additional \nincome--far less than the $50 billion in health care costs caused \ndirectly by tobacco in 1 year.\n  But this bill has an even more important goal than recovering health \ncare expenditures. It will help decrease tobacco consumption \nsignificantly. Conservative estimates predict that a 10 percent \nincrease in the price of cigarettes will reduce overall smoking by \nabout 4 percent. And for kids, who are more price sensitive than \nadults, the impact is even greater--every 10-percent increase in \ncigarette prices decreases demand among children and teenager by as \nmuch as 14 percent.\n  Mr. President, despite the many advantages of this legislation, I am \nnot blind to the fact that there are those whom it will impact \nnegatively--particularly, tobacco farmers. By no means do I think that \nthe potential losses to these farmers are an adequate justification for \nmaking no efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. But because I realize \nthe impact of an increased excise tax on these farmers, my bill puts 3 \npercent of all revenues it generates into a special trust fund to be \nused to help tobacco framers substitute new crops in place of tobacco.\n  Mr. President, these days everyone is looking for a way to reduce \nGovernment spending on health care. Almost all of the actions under \nconsideration will be painful. In contrast, increasing the tobacco tax \nis one of the wisest and most beneficial ways of addressing this \nproblem. It will save billions of dollars in health care costs, not \nonly for the Federal Government but for private insurers and citizens \nacross the country. It will save countless lives. It will decrease \nunnecessary suffering. It will discourage millions of children and \nteenagers from ever becoming addicted to tobacco. And poll after poll \nhas found that public support is high for a significant hike in the \ntobacco tax--and this support is consistent across people from all \ngeographic and economic backgrounds.\n  Mr. President, this bill is good health policy. It is good economic \npolicy. And it is key to helping our children and teenagers achieve a \ntobacco-free future.

Tobacco Conversion Trust Fund.''\n\n                                                                    ____\n   Tobacco Consumption Reduction and Health Improvement Act of 1995--\n                                Summary\n\n       This bill provides for an increase of the Federal excise \n     tax on tobacco products. It raises the excise tax five-fold \n     on cigarettes, from 24 cents to $1.24 per pack. The excise \n     tax for all other tobacco products will also be increased \n     five-fold. This bill will generate approximately $12 billion \n     in additional federal revenues each year.\n       The reasons for this increase are clear. First, it allows \n     us to use the most potent weapon we have at our disposal to \n     discourage smoking--raising the price of tobacco. This will \n     allow us to specifically direct our attention to a vulnerable \n     and price sensitive group--children and teenagers. It is also \n     smart tax policy--it taxes what we want to discourage so we \n     can cut taxes on the things we want to encourage. Second, the \n     Centers for Disease Control and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment have estimated the cost to society of cigarette \n     smoking at over $100 billion annually; $22 billion of these \n     costs were paid by government funds. It is more than fair to \n     ask smokers to shoulder some of these costs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 599. A bill to eliminate certain welfare with respect to fugitive \nfelons and probation and parole violators, and to facilitate sharing of \ninformation with law enforcement officers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   fugitive felons and welfare reform\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, like most of my colleagues in the \nSenate, I have followed with interest the activity in the House \nregarding welfare reform. It is with a unique perspective that I have \nviewed the House action having been at the center of the House's \nwelfare reform debate last year and having been deeply involved in the \ndirection and decision making of the House Republican platform.\n  During the 103d Congress, I served as the ranking Republican member \non the Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee. Preceding me in \nthat capacity is quite a list of dedicated ranking members who all have \nand continue to make a very significant contribution to the welfare \nreform discussions--Senator Hank Brown, Gov. Carroll Campbell, and the \ncurrent chairman of that subcommittee, Congressman Clay Shaw. As the \nSenate now prepares for its own activity on welfare reform, I hope to \ncontinue to be equally active on this side in setting that direction.\n  It is hard to undertake any discussion on welfare reform without \nrealizing the multitude of issues, programs, problems, and complexities \nthat are involved. And while my activity in the House covered many \naspects of welfare and welfare-related programs, one such issue that I \nwanted to discuss today pertains to fugitive felons receiving welfare \nbenefits.\n  Under current law, barriers exist to information sharing between law \nenforcement officials and social service agencies. While few States \nhave defined criteria where the exchange of information can occur \nbetween police and social service offices, most States have not. And \nwith the reality of fugitives receiving public assistance, it makes \nsense to provide police access to welfare records that indicate the \nwhereabouts of wanted individuals, without violating the privacy \nlanguage and rights of welfare beneficiaries.\n  In the 103d Congress, I introduced legislation (H.R. 4657) which \nestablishes criteria for information sharing between law enforcement \nofficials and social service agencies, allows cross reference checks \nbetween the Immigration and Naturalization Service and law enforcement \nwith regard to illegal immigration, and sets a Federal definition of \ntemporarily absent in instances where children of beneficiaries are \naway from the home for extended periods of time.\n  The information and record referencing under the bill is limited to \nindividuals for whom warrants are outstanding. The bill permits access \nby law enforcement to information when a warrant is produced, and it is \nfound that \n[[Page S4384]] the individual is receiving benefits. Someone who is not \na fugitive felon would remain fully protected from such inquiries under \nthe Welfare Privacy Act.\n  Is there a need for such information sharing? I'd like to submit for \nthe Record a copy of a news article from Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on \nJuly 29, 1994. The article describes a situation in which an individual \nwanted for an 1984 slaying in Pittsburgh, had been on the run and \nreceiving Federal welfare benefits under his real name. Likewise, a \nsituation last year in Cleveland, OH, highlighted the difficulties that \nexist in tracking fugitives and trying to interface with social service \nagencies. In that instance, Cuyahoga County officials were denied \naccess to records as they attempted to cross reference outstanding \nfugitive warrants with social service records.\n  It is absurd that taxpayers are subsidizing a fugitive's freedom when \nchecking a recipient's address could lead to their apprehension. \nCurrently, the National Crime Information Center lists 397,000 \noutstanding fugitive warrants nationwide--warrants being defined as \n``felonies'' or ``high misdemeanors'' in cases where States agree to \nextradition. Several police groups have projected that as many as 75 \npercent of those fugitives are receiving public assistance. \nAdditionally, as I have discovered with Pennsylvania, the extradition \nstipulation for warrants in the NCIC data bank actually shields the \nnumber of outstanding warrants in a given State. You too may find that \nyour State figures are significant.\n  Last week, I met with the Philadelphia Fugitive Task Force to discuss \nthe practical effects of the legislation. In confronting their 50,000 \noutstanding fugitive warrants, they feel strongly that the bill \nprovides them yet another tool in their investigative efforts. \nLikewise, the measure has received similar comment from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the National Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, and the Law Enforcement Alliance of \nAmerica.\n  While the fugitive felon situation generally involves the parent or \nan adult, the bill also addresses ambiguity in the law with regard to \nchildren. Under current law, a mother can continue to receive AFDC \npayment for a child even if that child is temporarily absent from the \nhome. Depending on their definition, States have the authority to end \nAFDC payments if the child is not going to physically be in the home \nfor an extended period of time. Again, like the fugitive felon issue, \nFederal and State law remains undefined in most cases for temporarily \nabsent. My bill would federally define temporarily absent for those \ninstances where juveniles are away from the home as a result of a court \ndecision or criminal activity.\n  Mr. President, while this legislation today may serve as my first \nofficial measure for the 104th Congress in the area of welfare reform, \nit is by no means the sole measure I will be introducing to the Senate. \nIn the weeks ahead, I plan on introducing proposals covering child \nsupport enforcement, supplemental security income, and a more \ncomprehensive proposal speaking to welfare reform in its entirety. \nAdditionally, I plan on being very active within the Agriculture \nCommittee in the area of nutrition programs and examining the reform \noptions available to us, including a review of the block grant concept.\n  I welcome and encourage my colleagues' interest in this and other \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \ncopy of the article I referenced earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 599\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

During a decade on the lam \n     for a 1984 slaying in Pittsburgh, he used at least five \n     aliases and five Social Security numbers.\n       But when he went on welfare, Brabham used his real name--\n     and his state-issued welfare card bore his current address \n     and photo.\n       The cops who arrested him Wednesday in Philadelphia saw the \n     card when they asked Brabham for identification. They hadn't \n     known he was on welfare.\n       ``I'm sure it would have made things a lot easier,'' said \n     Detective Joe Hasara of the Federal Fugitive Task Force in \n     Philadelphia, one of the squads that for years pursued lead \n     after dead-end lead searching for Brabham.\n       Police--even those looking for longtime fugitives--don't \n     routinely look at welfare rolls to locate suspects, primarily \n     because of the legal obstacles, Hasara said.\n       ``It's just not feasible,'' said Hasara, citing red tape. \n     ``We'd have to have one or two people doing nothing but \n     getting subpoenas and court orders. We can't operate like \n     that.''\n       Hasara, a Philadelphia police detective who makes up part \n     of the city's federally funded fugitive task force, located \n     Brabham after a typically long and laborious investigation \n     that involved following tips and digging into clues. He won't \n     be more specific than that, for fear of divulging the task \n     force's gumshoe secrets.\n       The victim, Charlene Summers, 36, was living with Brabham \n     in Pittsburgh's Beltzhoover area. Police said Brabham \n     reported the January 1984 killing to city homicide in a \n     telephone call. He claimed Summers had attacked him with a \n     knife.\n       Brabham, who posted bond days after he was charged with her \n     murder, never showed up at a coroner's hearing. A bench \n     warrant for his arrest went out in May 1984. In March 1990, a \n     federal court handed down a fugitive warrant.\n       By then, the Greater Pittsburgh Fugitive Task Force was \n     already hunting him, said FBI Agent Ralph Young, a task force \n     member.\n       ``We had people all over the country looking for him,'' \n     Young said. ``He never came back to Pittsburgh.''\n       Philadelphia was one of the investigative hot spots: \n     Brabham had relatives there, Young said.\n       ``We'd hear sightings. We'd follow up. It'd lead to a dead \n     end,'' he said.\n       The state's welfare listings may be accessible to police \n     who petition the Commonwealth Court for specific information, \n     said department spokesman Kevin Campbell.\n       Although state law forbids disclosure of individual welfare \n     information for personal, commercial or political uses, a \n     specific statute allows law enforcement queries if authorized \n     by a judge, Campbell said.\n       ``District attorneys have done it in the past, certainly,'' \n     said Campbell, who added that police face no other official \n     barriers.\n       ``Apparently they've never worked the street,'' Hasara \n     snorted.\n       After Brabham's arrest Wednesday, Young telephoned Summers' \n     mother, Lillie Jones, with the news.\n       ``For ten years, I never gave up on this,'' said Jones, 70, \n     who described a dream she had Tuesday night. ``She and I was \n     very close. In the spiritual world, we had a lot of \n     connection.\n       ``I dreamed some man was chasing her around and around my \n     house with a gun, and around and around my neighbor's house, \n     and she was calling me for help: she ran to me and said, \n     ``Mama, save me.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, A.M.

Rohatyn. He said in a \nspeech at Wake Forest University:\n\n       The big beneficiaries of our economic expansion have been \n     the owners of financial assets and a new class of highly \n     compensated technicians working for companies where profit-\n     sharing and stock ownership was widely spread.\n       What is occurring is a huge transfer of wealth from lower-\n     skilled middle-class American workers to the owners of \n     capital assets and to the new technological aristocracy.\n       As a result, the institutional relationship created by the \n     mutual loyalty of employees and employers in most American \n     businesses has been badly frayed. . . . These relationships \n     have been replaced by a combination of fear for the future \n     and a cynicism for the present as a broad proportion of \n     working people see themselves as simply temporary assets to \n     be hired or fired to protect the bottom line and create \n     ``shareholder value.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Rosenthal column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The column follows:\n                        American Class Struggle\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n       When the Republicans took over Congress in the November \n     election, I didn't take it hard. I voted for candidates from \n     both parties, so I told my Democratic friends not to go into \n     mourning. After all, shifting control of Congress once every \n     few decades was not exactly destroying democracy.\n       But I began to get nervous when I heard Representative \n     Newton Gingrich boast that he was a revolutionary, the only \n     one around.\n       Myself, I think the first American Revolution was carried \n     out well enough to be the last. Any major-party leader who \n     prattles about being a revolutionary strikes me as stunningly \n     insensitive to the havoc that revolutions cause, especially \n     when they are rooted not in oppression but in the brain of a \n     politician afloat in self-esteem.\n       I still give him the benefit of the doubt; put the \n     revolutionary talk down to a boyish pose. But sometimes a \n     pose creates a result a young fellow might not foresee.\n       The fact is that the ambitions of the Newtonians, their \n     lust for the quick, dramatic change and their deep \n     fascination with themselves do have in them the makings of \n     one important ingredient of revolution. That is class \n     struggle.\n       Done carefully, with each Federal program to be sliced \n     examined with the caring attention that we usually save for \n     our own self-interest, much of the Contract With America \n     could be of benefit.\n       But absent that tenderness, the program is turning into \n     more than Americans who voted for it might want. They \n     expected to save some government money spent on other \n     Americans, give bureaucrats the scare of their lives, and \n     have a good housecleaning.\n       But I doubt they expected the slash-and-burn campaign the \n     Republicans have mounted against so much of the economic and \n     social safety net created by Republican as well as Democratic \n     administrations since World War II.\n       What's more, all this is going on when a particular kind of \n     economic expansion is also taking place. Felix G. Rohatyn, \n     senior partner of Lazard Freres, described it in a speech at \n     Wake Forest University last week:\n       ``The big beneficiaries of our economic expansion have been \n     the owners of financial assets and a new class of highly \n     compensated technicians working for companies where profit-\n     sharing and stock ownership was widely spread.\n       ``What is occurring is a huge transfer of wealth from \n     lower-skilled middle-class American workers to the owners of \n     capital assets and to the new technological aristocracy.\n       ``As a result, the institutional relationship created by \n     the mutual loyalty of employees and employers in most \n     American businesses has been badly frayed. . . . These \n     relationships have been replaced by a combination of fear for \n     the future and a cynicism for the present as a broad \n     proportion of working people see themselves as simply \n     temporary assets to be hired or fired to protect the bottom \n     line and create `shareholder value.'''\n       All right, put this attitude toward workers as disposable \n     together with ``slash that net.'' Target people on welfare \n     wholesale, take important aid programs from immigrants, legal \n     or not, put Medicare on the cutting board and hint that \n     Social Security will be next. Reduce money for narcotics \n     therapy, summertime jobs for youngsters, health care and \n     other parts of the net created over the last five decades. \n     Cut very deep, very fast.\n       Inevitably Americans who find themselves poorer or more \n     frightened, with nothing between them and the ground, will \n     look to business, a big beneficiary and supporter of the \n     cuts, to erect a new net.\n       Too bad for them. Mr. Rohatyn warns that it won't work, \n     that being the social safety net of last resort is \n     government's business, which makes two of us.\n       So: If they destroy too much of the government safety net, \n     Republicans will be loading business down with a job it \n     cannot do, with working-class expectations it does not want \n     to meet and cannot.\n       As a bleeding-heart conservative, I believe that will be \n     not only the prescription for class struggle but the \n     beginning of its reality.\n       Class struggle does not automatically bring revolution--\n     real, not sound-bite. But in 1932, President Roosevelt \n     understood the danger of economic class struggle, and moved \n     to overcome it and save capitalism. Left unrecognized or \n     ignored, class struggle creates divisions that can undermine \n     society--any society.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4394-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4394-S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE 1995 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nsubject of drugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] \nhas now released its annual National Drug Control Strategy, dated \nFebruary 1995. I regret that this strategy continues in the direction \nestablished in the 1994 strategy, a direction I strongly criticized at \nthe time. The administration has produced another deeply flawed \ndocument that will not advance the war against drugs.\n  In this document the administration outlines its priorities for \ndealing with illicit drugs. the document extols treatment and \nprevention as the primary tools in combating the drug problem. The \nstrategy never addresses interdiction. It stresses policy changes to \nenhance the administration's demand side approach to dealing with the \nflood of foreign illegal drugs entering the United States, rather than \nenforcement efforts.\n  The document is 150 pages long, with a 45 page long lost of \nconsultants. The strategy frequently contradicts itself from one \nchapter to the next in its interpretation of its findings, whether the \nfindings were based on surveys or medical reports. This strategy \nprovides an overinflated justification for expanded treatment and \nprevention efforts, without ever dealing with the underlying problem of \nthe ease with which illegal drugs can be obtained.\n  Furthermore, this document attempts to distinguish between the drug \nuser and the drug dealer, claiming one is a public health problem while \nthe other is a criminal. The truth of the matter is that both using and \ndealing are criminal violations and the dealer could not exist, much \nless profit, without the user. Drug dealers can only be arrested by \nworking through drug users. Therefore, enforcement efforts against \nusers should not be curtailed, but instead reinforced.\n  Some of the contradictions contained within the report are serious. \nThe report begins with a strategy overview which would lend the \nimpression that enforcement was going to be a major theme in the \nstrategy. This does not turn out to be the case. Under the section \nentitled ``Principles for Responding to Illicit Drug Use'', on page 10, \nthe report states: ``To ensure the safety of our communities, certainty \nof punishment must be promoted for all drug offenders--particularly \nyoung offenders. All offenders must receive appropriate punishment when \nthey first encounter the criminal justice system.'' This theme is \nfurther advanced on page 12, section entitled ``Action Plans for \nResponding to America's Drug Problem'' where it states ``Use the \nauthority of \n[[Page S4395]]  the criminal justice system to require drug-using \noffenders to stop taking drugs; Punish the criminal activities of drug \nusers and sellers.''\n  This theme is immediately contradicted by a subsequent passage that \nstates: ``This Strategy recognizes that Americans make a distinction \nbetween drug dealers and drug users when stating how policies should be \ndeveloped and carried out. Recent public opinion polls indicate that \nAmericans believe that drug dealers deserve tough criminal sanctions \nand that drug users should have the opportunity for intensive treatment \nto break their dependence on drugs.'' This directly contradicts the \nprevious message of punishment for both users and dealers. This section \nfurther contradicts the need for strong enforcement action when it \nstates: ``The Action Plan for Reducing the Demand for Illicit Drugs \nemphasized drug prevention as the ultimate key to ensuring [sic] the \nfuture of the Nation's children.''\n  While demand reduction is the ultimate key to victory in the war on \ndrugs, this approach completely disregards the immediate problems of \nthe availability of illicit drugs, the monetary rewards for dealing \nillegal drugs, and the constant flow of illegal drugs into the United \nStates. furthermore, most drug dealers are also drug users. How are the \ncourts to differentiate between the classes of criminals as described \nwithin this strategy?\n  Law enforcement efforts and the criminal penalties for illegal drug \nactivities directly affect drug availability, financial incentives for \ndrug trafficking, and the flow of these illegal drugs. Once the supply \nis reduced, then treatment can be effective to further reduce demand.\n  This section of the strategy closes with 14 listed goals to be used \nas the measure of success for the strategy. The top eight goals are all \ntreatment or prevention measures. Once again this strategy of targeting \ntreatment without addressing illegal drug availability and drug law \nenforcement concerns is akin to the old problem of putting the cart \nbefore the horse.\n  Section II, ``Drug Use in America,'' details the number of casual and \nchronic drug users in the United States. This section states on page \n17, ``First, rates of illicit drug use are rising among the Nation's \nyouth and second, rates of heroin use are increasing, particularly \nbecause existing drug users are adding heroin to the list of drugs they \nconsume. In addition, there are new users of heroin, many of them \nyouth.''\n  This statement is immediately contradicted on page 24 of the same \nsection, where it states: ``The strongest sign of an epidemic is the \nentry of a large number of new users (new initiates) into illicit drug \nuse. There is no systematic evidence that this is the case with \nheroin.'' The report denies that there is a significant increase in \nheroin use. Yet in January 1995, 1 month prior to the release of this \nreport, ONDCP stated in its monthly newsletter, ``more potent forms of \nmarijuana are becoming increasingly popular among people under 30 and \nthat heroin and marijuana use are rising.'' The newsletter further \nstates, ``The Department of Health and Human Services also released the \nDrug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN] survey, showing in 1993 a 31-percent \nincrease in heroin-related emergency room visits,''. These \ncontradictory statements leave us with a very basic question--how can \nan effective strategy be devised and implemented when the underlying \ncauses and extent of the problem are in dispute?\n  In December 1994, ONDCP released a newsletter entitled ``Pulse Check, \nNational Trends in Drug Abuse.'' This newsletter concluded that illegal \ndrug use is on the rise, directly contradicting the strategy released 2 \nmonths after this\n publication. On page 17 of the newsletter, under section headed \n``Conclusion,'' it states: ``This Pulse Check found a continuing \npresence of high-purity, low-priced heroin in many urban areas. In \naddition to the traditional addict in his 30s who injects the drug, \nnontradional groups are forming and growing larger that include persons \nin their teens and twenties, females, and middle-income persons. New \nand young users usually smoke or inhale heroin to avoid the stigma \nassociated with the needle-using addict, but some of these users are \nquickly switching to injection.''\n\n  This section continues: ``Some ethnographic sources report that they \nare now convinced that the new user group represents a new epidemic of \nuse, particularly since heroin appears to be moving out of traditional \nuser groups and involves alternative methods of use such as snorting \nand smoking.'' The conclusions stated in this publication directly \ncontradict the National Drug Control Strategy--yet both were prepared \nby the ONDCP.\n  Section III, ``Drug Use and Its Consequences,'' clearly shows the \nnexus between drugs and violent crimes. Although the nexus between \ndrugs and violence is acknowledged, the elevation of treatment over \nenforcement again takes center stage. Page 38 states: ``Numerous \nstudies confirm the fact that treatment of chronic, hardcore addicts, \nboth within the correctional setting and in community-based programs, \nis the most cost-effective response and the course of action that makes \nthe most practical sense.''\n  This blanket statement can be contradicted by any number of \nadditional studies that show that treatment by itself without effective \nlaw enforcement efforts will never eradicate the drug problem. This \nsection attempts to justify ONDCP's position by the following \nstatement: ``The most compelling demonstration of the cost-\neffectiveness of treatment is from a recent California study assessing \ndrug and alcoholism treatment effectiveness. This study found that in \n1992 alone, the cost of treating approximately 150,000 drug users in \nCalifornia was $209 million. Approximately $1.5 billion was saved while \nthese individuals were in treatment and in the first year after their \ntreatment. Most of these savings were in the form of reductions in \ndrug-related crime (a two-thirds decline in the level of criminal \nactivity among these drug users was observed from pretreatment to \nposttreatment).''\n  This is a very misleading assertion for several reasons: First, if \nthese defendants were incarcerated for drug violations, the same \nsavings due to reduced criminal activity would apply. Second, these \nindividuals were under supervision for this study, making criminal \nactivity difficult. Third, if criminal activity were to take place, how \ncan the possible losses be accurately cacluated? The figure would be \nthe product of pure conjecture.\n  This section goes on to state: ``Locking up drug users and drug \naddicts does not go far enough to protect communities from the problems \ncreated by drug use.'' This statement is true to the extent that mere \nincarceration will not eradicate continued drug use, but incarceration \nis the first step in identifying and eventually treating chronic drug \nabusers. All too often, bleeding heart liberals forget that drugs are \naddictive and that most addicts will not voluntarily change their \naddictive behavior.\n  Further, incarceration of casual drug users sends a clear and \nconvincing message that illegal drug use will not be tolerated by our \nsociety. The real threat of criminal penalties acts as a deterrent to \nthe casual drug user, and increased law enforcement efforts in turn \nincrease this deterring effect.\n  In my remarks on the drug problem in prior years, I emphasized the \nimportance of social delegitimization of illegal drug use. I believe \nthat the crop of new users reported by ONDCP is, in important part, the \nproduct of a relegitimization of illegal drug use, flowing from \nmessages of tolerance implicit in the administration's statements and \nactions on this subject, taken as a whole.\n  Mr. President, it is not premature to issue a serious assessment of \nthis administration's performance in the war on drugs. It has been \ndismal, and will only get worse. The problem is that the full penalty \nfor this administration's failures--in analyzing and understanding the \nproblem, in crafting a policy and budgetary response to it, and in \nimplementing its decisions--will be paid by future generations of \nAmericans. The current occupants of the White House will be long \ndeparted from any official responsibility for U.S. policy before the \nfull impact of their mistakes is felt.\n  I pledge to continue my fight for the people of New York and the \ncitizens of America, who deserve the domestic tranquility they were \npromised in the Preamble to the Constitution, but who are denied civil \npeace by the twin \n[[Page S4396]] plagues of violent criminal activity and illegal drug \nuse. This year, we will revise last year's crime bill to make it more \neffective and more responsive to the concerns of the American people.\n  Moreover, the coming national election will give us a chance to \npresent to the people of the United States this administration's record \nand ask for their judgment at the polls on its performance in this \ncritical area. I believe the American people will understand as we do \nthe abject and serious failure of this administration's policies, and \nwill vote to change them.\n  \n\n                H_______________________________________\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                            U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1994                                           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n                     Name and country                             Name of currency          Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKatherine Howard:                                                                                                                                                                               \n    United States.........................................

Mr. President, for 45 years the Reverend Marian \nCurtis Bascom, Sr., has, as pastor of the Douglas Memorial Community \nChurch in Baltimore, been a leading force for fairness, opportunity, \ngrowth, and advancement, not only for the many devoted members of his \ncongregation, but for all the people of Baltimore. His leadership, \nvision and commitment have made Reverend Bascom, and the members of his \ncongregation truly a visible, viable, and compassionate force in \nBaltimore.\n  This month Reverend Bascom will officially retire as pastor of \nDouglas Memorial Community Church, but his influence will continue to \ngrow not only by his continued presence and leadership in our \ncommunity, but also through the lives and works of the countless people \nhe has led, inspired, and challenged to achieve the highest levels of \ndedication and commitment of which they are capable.\n  Born in Florida and educated there and in Chicago, Reverend Bascom \nholds an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Florida Memorial \nCollege, and has completed advanced studies at Wesley Seminary and \nHoward University in Washington, having served as president of Howard's \nalumni association.\n  [[Page S4404]] Since coming to Baltimore in 1949 as pastor of Douglas \nMemorial Community Church, Reverend Bascom has held leadership posts in \na broad range of institutions critical to our community's growth and \nvitality. He has twice served as president of the Interdenominational \nMinisterial Alliance, and with his fellow clergy in this wide ranging \ninstitution, Marian Bascom has been a force for economic, social, and \ncivic progress leading the way to opening up access to our institutions \nto all people.\n  His inspired and committed leadership in the community has made him a \nleader in many ways--the first black commissioner of the Baltimore City \nFire Department, first black to serve on the board of Baltimore City \nHospitals, past president of the National Council of Community \nChurches, leader in support of working men and women, and vice \npresident of Associated Black Charities.\n  Under his inspired leadership, Douglas Memorial Community Church has \nplayed a critical role in reaching out to the people of Baltimore and \ninto the world. Under Reverend Bascom's pastorate, Douglas has \ndeveloped and implemented programs which focus on youth, our senior \ncitizens, and the homeless. There are camps for the youth, a Meals-on-\nWheels service, apartments, a vibrant Sunday school and youth \nfellowship, and a ministry that touches people of all races and creeds \nthroughout the community.\n  Mr. President, it has been my special honor and privilege to work \nwith Rev. Marian C. Bascom over the years. I have found him to be an \ninspired leader, committed servant of his faith and tireless advocate \nfor fairness and opportunity. His retirement will be only the next \nphase of involvement for this dedicated and inspiring clergyman, and I \nask that all our colleagues join with me in wishing him every \nhappiness. I also ask that a brief biography of the Reverend Marian \nCurtis Bascom, Sr., be printed in the Record.\n  The biography follows:\n      Marion Curtis Bascom, Sr.: Preacher, Teacher, and Innovator\n\n       The growth of Douglas Memorial Community Church as a \n     visible, viable compassionate force in the city of Baltimore \n     is inextricably woven in the leadership of and by its \n     minister, Rev. Marion Curtis Bascom, Sr.\n       Marion Curtis Bascom, Sr. was born in Pensacola, Florida \n     and was blessed by the early influence of a religious life \n     with his parents and grandparents. He soon became active as a \n     child-preacher at the Mt. Olive Baptist church in Pensacola. \n     As a young boy, he also lived in Chicago, Illinois, where he \n     acquired his early education. Later he returned to Pensacola, \n     and was graduated from High School.\n       In 1970 his Alma Mater, Florida Memorial College bestowed \n     upon him the honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree. He also \n     completed additional studies at the Wesley Seminary, \n     Washington, D.C. In 1976, Dr. Bascom was selected to receive \n     Howard University's coveted Distinguished Alumni Award at the \n     111th Anniversary of the founding of the institution. He has \n     served the University frequently as a resource person for the \n     School. Dr. Bascom has been president of the Alumni \n     Association.\n       Before coming to assume the pastorate of Douglas Memorial \n     Community Church, he had served as pastor at Mt. Zion Baptist \n     Church, Pensacola, Florida; Shiloh Baptist Church, St. \n     Augustine, Florida; and the First Baptist Church, St. \n     Augustine, Florida. In July, 1949, he accepted the invitation \n     to become the pastor of Douglas Memorial Community Church in \n     Baltimore, Maryland.\n       Under the astute leadership of Dr. Marion Curtis Bascom, \n     Douglas Memorial Community Church has become known as the \n     church whose people have an acute awareness of the religious, \n     social and political problems inherent of the city of \n     Baltimore and which extend into the world. His leadership in \n     connection with outreach programs focused on youth, the aged \n     and homeless has brought recognition to him as one who \n     believes that ``Love for one's fellowman reaches the highest \n     pinnacle when we render service to others.''\n       Since 1949, Dr. Bascom has attained innumerable religious \n     and civil heights, attesting to his stature as an inspired \n     and committed leader in the Baltimore community. His \n     prodigious list of credits include: twice president of the \n     Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance; first Black \n     Commissioner of the Baltimore City Fire Department; a former \n     chairman of the Task Force for Welfare Rights; and the first \n     Black to serve on the Board of Baltimore City Hospitals. In \n     addition, he is a Past President of the National Council of \n     Community Churches; and a former member of the Board of \n     Directors of the Baltimore Branch of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People. He has actively \n     supported the local labor movement, and participated fully in \n     the political life of Baltimore City. He was also a trustee \n     of the Roseland Gardens Culture Center. Community concern has \n     been maintained and Dr. Bascom serves as Vice President of \n     Associated Black Charities.\n       Dr. Bascom has constantly admonished the Douglas \n     Congregation that instead of doing ``church work'' it should \n     ``do the work of the church.'' As a consequence with his \n     foresight and guidance, Douglas has developed an enviable \n     succession of outreach programs with four of its more \n     prominent being: Camp Farthest Out, Inc., located in Barrett, \n     Maryland, and serving four hundred under-privileged children \n     for two-week periods throughout each summer; the Douglas \n     Memorial Federal Credit Union, with assets over $1,000,000; a \n     Meals-on-Wheels Kitchen serving all creeds and Douglas \n     Village, with 49 apartments, occupying the entire 1300 block \n     of Madison Avenue.\n       He was responsible for leading the church into sponsorship \n     of a Headstart program and also for establishing the \n     ``Seeker's House,'' a coffee house on Pennsylvania Avenue for \n     area residents. Dr. Bascom was a local leader and activist \n     during the civil rights movement, and marched in Selma with \n     Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Poverty marchers enroute to \n     Washington were housed and fed at Douglas Memorial, as a \n     small part of its awareness of the social problems of the \n     day.\n       His battle for economic equality erupted in the development \n     of a business thereby opening the entrepreneurial door in the \n     minority community to the sale of fine papers--an arena \n     previously closed in the Baltimore community.\n       Always available to growth prospects, the last five years \n     have seen major efforts to renovate the Church House come to \n     fruition. An elevator, long needed to care for more maturing \n     congregants, has been installed to serve both the church and \n     church house. Plans to install a new organ are evident and \n     growing.\n       The intrinsic, incalcuable effects of his forty years at \n     Douglas are reflected in a vibrant Sunday Church School, an \n     active Youth Fellowship, an outstanding musical aggregation, \n     responsible and committed circles and spiritual group \n     fellowships--all hallmarks of the blessings visited upon the \n     Douglas Family through the untiring efforts of its pastor, \n     Marion Curtis Bascom, Sr.\n       In addition to his wife, Dorothy, immediate family members \n     include their children, Bernadette M. Miller, Marion Jr., \n     Peter and Singleton Bascom and Yiviane B. Yeadon and their \n     grandchildren; Chokise L.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my \ncolleagues who are asking that hearings be held on the nomination of \nDr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General.\n  Dr. Foster is widely recognized as one of the Nation's leading \nauthorities on infant mortality, as well as preventing teen pregnancy \nand drug abuse. He has contributed a great deal during his career, and \nis clearly an excellent candidate for the position of Surgeon General \nof the United States.\n  It is important that we focus on Dr. Foster's credentials and look at \nhow he has dedicated his career to helping others. After finishing his \nmedical training, Dr. Foster returned to his native rural South and \nbegan his lifelong crusade against infant mortality. Dr. Foster \ndeveloped a comprehensive approach to maternal and child health which \ninvolved teams of doctors, social workers, and nutritionists, with a \ngoal of preventing health problems in mothers and newborn babies. The \nteams worked in rural communities to reach women early in their \npregnancies, identify those women with a high potential for \ncomplication, and ensure they received specialized attention throughout \ntheir pregnancy and following the birth. Dr. Foster's approach was \nahead of its time, becoming a national model for regionalized perinatal \ncare.\n  In 1991 the ``I Have a Future'' program, which Dr. Foster developed, \nwas named a ``Point of Light'' by President Bush for its innovative \nwork to reduce teen pregnancy and build self-esteem for at-risk youth. \nThis program works with parental and community involvement, to help \nteenagers learn skills needed to start a business or get an education, \nand to point out the consequences of teenage pregnancy.\n  These are only two of the successful, innovative programs which Dr. \nFoster\n [[Page S4405]] has developed, but they give a good indication of the \ngreat contributions that Dr. Foster has made.\n  Mr. President, there has been much discussion about Dr. Foster \nperforming abortions. Abortion is a legal procedure that should not \ndisqualify Dr. Foster or any other nominee from Federal appointment. In \nresponse to some remarks about this performing abortions, Dr. Foster \nstates that he believes abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, ``but \n[his] life's work has been dedicated to making sure that young people \ndon't have to face the choice of having abortions.'' With efforts such \nas the I have a future program, Dr. Foster has shown this dedication.\n  Mr. President, there are several things that have been twisted and \nmisinterpreted in looking at Dr. Foster's career. We must look at this \ntotal record, and his commitment to working with young people, parents, \nand teachers to ensure we do decrease teen pregnancies, do decrease the \nnumber of low birthweight babies, do decrease the number of children \nliving in poverty, and do decrease the number of abortions performed in \nthis country.\n  I have heard from numerous medical groups in support of Dr. Foster, \nincluding, the American Medical Association, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Physicians, \nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine, and many more. His \ndistinguished career, and his commitment to the health of women and \nchildren, eminently qualify Dr. Foster for the position of Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  I look forward to his consideration by the full Senate.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4404-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4405-S4407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO IMPOSE CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I find curious the delay in the \nfiling of the Senate report on the constitutional amendment to impose \ncongressional term limits. When this matter was first listed on a \nJudiciary Committee agenda back on January 18, our Republican \ncolleagues seemed in a tremendous rush to proceed on this matter, one \nof the 100 or so constitutional amendments introduced so far this \nCongress. When the Judiciary Committee voted to report Senate Joint \nResolution 21 to the Senate back on February 9, the rush continued. The \nfervor seems to have cooled for now here in the Senate. Indeed, it took \nthe majority 3 weeks to circulate a draft report. The committee was \nasked last Thursday to reconsider the procedural manner in which the \nresolution was reported, and as far as I can tell, the committee report \nis still yet to be filed.\n  I have no problem with the majority putting off consideration of this \nmatter, which I oppose. The proposal is, in my view, a limitation on \nthe right of the people to choose their representatives. I am concerned \nthat our House colleagues will not have the benefit of our views when \nthey take up this matter next week.\n  Because I have no assurance that the Senate report will be printed \nand available to them in time for their debate, I ask to include in the \nRecord my opposition views, which were submitted to be included in the \ncommittee report back on March 3, and which I hope will appear in the \nSenate report, if and when it is printed.\n  The views follow:\n\n  Additional Opposing Views of Senator Patrick Leahy in Opposition to \n   Senate Joint Resolution 21, a Constitutional Amendment To Impose \n                       Congressional Term Limits\n\n       I oppose this constitutional amendment. The Constitution \n     does not set congressional term limits, trusting to the \n     people to decide who will best represent them. Indeed, this \n     proposal is, in essence, a limitation on the rights of the \n     electorate. I reject it as such.\n       I urge my colleagues not to be afraid to do the right \n     thing, even if it does not appear from certain polls to be \n     the currently popular thing, and stop demagoguing \n     constitutional amendments as the cure to our ills. Our \n     Constitution has served us well, over more than 200 years. It \n     is the cornerstone of our vibrant democracy. It has been \n     amended only 17 times since the adoption of the Bill of \n     Rights in 1791--and two of those were prohibition and its \n     repeal.\n       The Constitution is now under attack. The fundamental \n     protections of separation of powers and the First Amendment \n     are under siege. In the opening days of this Congress almost \n     100 constitutional amendments have been introduced. One, the \n     so-called balanced budget amendment, has already been passed \n     by the House and been narrowly defeated in the Senate. We \n     risk making a mockery of Article V's requirement that we deem \n     a constitutional amendment ``necessary'' before proposing it \n     to the states.\n       One way to consider the impact of this proposed amendment \n     is to look at who would not be here currently were this 2-\n     term limit already part of the Constitution. The 2-term limit \n     contained in S.J. Res. 21 would eliminate all of us who have \n     been returned to the Senate by our constituents after \n     standing for reelection more than once.\n       Think for a moment what imposing such a limitation would \n     mean to the Senate. For example, are Senators Thurmond, \n     Hatfield, Stevens, Packwood, Roth, Domenici, Chafee, Lugar, \n     Kassebaum, Cochran, Simpson and Hatch, and Senators Byrd, \n     Pell, Kennedy, Inouye, Hollings, Nunn, Glenn, Ford, Bumpers, \n     Moynihan, Sarbanes, Biden and others not possessed of \n     judgment and experience on which we all rely and on which \n     their constituents depend? What of the Majority Leader, \n     Senator Dole, should he have had to retire in 1980 after \n     serving only two terms?\n       Consider what this type of measure would have meant over \n     our history. Those who have served beyond two terms include \n     among their ranks some of our most distinguished \n     predecessors. Each of our Senate Office Buildings, in fact, \n     is named for a Senator whose service would have been cut \n     short by the type of term limit being proposed as a \n     constitutional amendment: Richard Russell, Philip Hart, \n     Everett McKinley Dirksen. It is a loss when illness takes \n     such leaders from us; it would be a tragedy to have denied \n     the country and their constituents their service through an \n     arbitrary rule limiting congressional terms.\n       Think about Kentucky's Henry Clay; South Carolina's John C. \n     Calhoun; Missouri's Thomas Hart Benton; Ohio's Robert Taft; \n     Iowa's William Allison; Michigan's Arthur Vandenberg; \n     Arizona's Carl Hayden and Barry Goldwater; Maine's Margaret \n     Chase Smith and George Mitchell; Vermont's Justin Morrill and \n     George Aiken; Massachusetts' Daniel Webster and Charles \n     Sumner; Montana's Mike Mansfield; Washington's Scoop Jackson; \n     North Carolina's Sam Ervin; Arkansas's William Fulbright; New \n     York's Jacob Javits; Wisconsin's William Proxmire and the \n     LaFollettes; Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey; Tennessee's \n     Howard Baker, Jr. Such lists invariably leave out many who \n     distinguished themselves through their service into a third \n     Senate term.\n       Voters have not had any trouble electing challengers in the \n     last several years. In 1978, 1980 and 1986, numbers of \n     incumbents were defeated in primaries and general elections \n     for the United States Senate. From the last election, one-\n     third of those elected\n      to the Senate are serving in their first terms. In the House \n     of Representatives fully one third of the Members are \n     beginning their first or second terms. The electorate does \n     not seem to have a problem deciding whom to elect and whom \n     not to reelect.\n       Indeed, rather than debating a constitutional amendment to \n     impose term limits, our time might be better spent thinking \n     about why more and more of our respected colleagues are \n     choosing to abandon this body. Our friend from Colorado, the \n     Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, has already \n     announced that he will not seek reelection in 1996, after \n     five terms in the House but only one here in the Senate. The \n     senior Senator from Illinois, the Ranking Democrat on the \n     Constitution Subcommittee, has also announced that he will \n     not seek reelection after five terms in the House and two \n     terms here in the Senate. The distinguished Ranking Democrat \n     on the Energy Committee, the senior Senator from Louisiana \n     has announced his intention to return to Louisiana.\n       Last year, George Mitchell and a total of nine of our \n     colleagues in the 103rd Congress chose not to seek \n     reelection. The Congress has become less and less a place \n     where Members choose to run for reelection.\n       I respect my colleagues for doing what they think is right \n     for themselves and their families. I commend those who like \n     Hank Brown and our freshman colleagues believe strongly in \n     term limits and conform their own actions to that rule. I \n     urge them, however, to stop short of seeking to impose their \n     view on all others and upon all other States for all time by \n     way of this constitutional amendment.\n       The reality is that this is an institution that is called \n     upon to deal with many important and complex matters, where \n     judgment and experience do count for something. Some sense of \n     history and some expertise can, from time to time, be helpful \n     in confronting our tasks and fulfilling our responsibilities \n     to our constituents and the country. Thus, I do not believe \n     that a one-size-fits-all limit on congressional service makes \n     sense.\n       Further, as the representative of a small State, I am \n     acutely aware that we fulfill the purposes of the Senate and \n     sometimes best represent our States when we have a bit of \n     seniority and a track record on the issues. I believe, as did \n     our Founders, that it is up to the people to let us know if \n     we seek to overstay our term of service.\n       Before we embark on this course to rewrite the work of the \n     Founders and impose an artificial limit on the length of \n     congressional service, we should know what evil this \n     constitutional amendment is intended to reach? On this the \n     proponents speak in conflicting voices--some urging that term \n     limits will make us more responsive to the electorate\n      [[Page S4406]] and others arguing that it will give us \n     greater distance and independence from them. Which is it?\n       It is remarkable that while the majority's rhetorical \n     flourishes raise to new heights the mythological citizen-\n     legislator and the majority report discusses everything from \n     Aristotle, ancient Greece and term limit suggestions that \n     were rejected by the Founders in the ``final draft of the \n     Constitution,'' to bills, amendments and resolutions not \n     considered by the Judiciary Committee, it nowhere discusses--\n     let alone justifies--the specific congressional term limits \n     it seeks to impose. The sole hearing into this matter was \n     focussed in large part on proponents arguing that a 6-term \n     limit for the House was ``no limit at all'' and that to \n     include such a provision in this measure amounted to ``phony \n     term limits,'' since 12 years is longer than the average term \n     of service in the House. Nowhere in its long-delayed report \n     does the majority discuss Senator Kyl's amendment to double \n     the House term limits from three to six terms, hint at the \n     controversy surrounding this key, substantive provision, nor \n     indicate that it would invalidate limits adopted in over 20 \n     states.\n       Further, the majority gives no consideration to the \n     effectiveness of limiting terms of only one group of actors \n     in our political democracy. Will we also limit the tenure of \n     professional staff? Will we limit the number of years someone \n     may lobby the Congress? Why not limit the years that someone \n     can serve as a political consultant, a pollster, or an \n     adviser? Are we prepared to venture into campaign reform and \n     limit the number of times a person may contribute to Senate \n     races over time? If not, term limits on candidates will only \n     serve to increase the influence of these other groups at the \n     expense of the people.\n       Do we expect first-term Senators intent on reelection to be \n     less responsive to lobbyists and political consultants? For \n     those who succeed in being reelected to a second and final \n     term, will they be oblivious of the need to earn a living in \n     succeeding years? With no prospect for a career in public \n     service, Members of Congress may become more solicitous of \n     ``special interests'' as they look beyond their lame duck \n     status to new career opportunities.\n       Despite good intentions, this proposed constitutional \n     amendment would not give us a citizen-legislature but, \n     instead, a legislature made up of those independently wealthy \n     and capable of taking 12 years from building a career outside \n     this body to serve as philosopher-kings for a time.\n       I must oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination \n     with laying waste to our Constitution and the protections \n     that have served us well for over 200 years. The First \n     Amendment, separation of powers, the power of the purse, the \n     right of the people to elect their representatives should be \n     supported and defended. That is the oath that we all swore \n     when we entered this public service. That is our duty to \n     those who forged this great document, our commitment to our \n     constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us.\n       The Constitution should not be amended by sound bite. This \n     proposed limitation evidences a distrust not just of \n     congressional representatives but of those who sent us here, \n     the people. Term limits would restrict the freedom of the \n     electorate to choose and are based on disdain for their \n     unfettered judgment. These are not so much term limits on the \n     electorate to choose their representatives.\n       To those who argue that this proposal will embolden us or \n     provide us added independence because we will not be \n     concerned about reelection, I would argue that you are \n     turning our democracy on its head. This proposal has the \n     effect of eliminating accountability, not increasing it.\n       It is precisely when we stand for reelection that the \n     people, our constituents, have the opportunity to hold us \n     accountable. This proposal would eliminate that \n     accountability by removing opportunities for the people to \n     reaffirm or reject our representation of them. It would make \n     each of us a lame duck immediately upon reelection.\n       Thus, my fundamental objection to the proposed \n     constitutional amendment is this: It is, at base, distrustful \n     of the electorate. It does not limit candidates so much as it \n     limits the rights of the people to choose whoever they want \n     to represent them. We should be acting to legislate more \n     responsively and responsibly, not to close off elections by \n     making some candidates off limits to voters. I will put my \n     faith in the people of Vermont and keep faith with them to \n     uphold the Constitution.\n\n\n                            Leahy Amendment\n\n       When this matter reaches the Senate for debate, I intend to \n     offer an amendment, along the lines of the one that I offered \n     during the course of the Judiciary Committee's deliberations. \n     I will try to move us toward an honest discussion of what \n     this amendment would mean and what impact it would have on \n     Congress. When politicians talk about imposing term limits, \n     they tend to support proposals that, on examination, will not \n     affect them. Thus, I have pointed out that S.J. Res. 21 is \n     drafted so as not to affect adversely any of us.\n       This proposal is designed to become effective after the \n     ratification process, which may itself take seven years. \n     Thereafter, and only thereafter, are we to start counting \n     terms in office for purposes of these constitutional term \n     limits. Thus, this proposal is drafted so that some of us can \n     get in two more successful reelection campaigns before we \n     have even to start counting terms toward the 2-term limit. I \n     suspect that all of us expect to be ``former'' Senators in \n     2020 after as many as four more\n      terms, anyway. That is all that this amendment contemplates.\n       By contrast, my amendment will have the affect of making \n     these constitutionally-mandated congressional term limits \n     apply to each of us immediately upon ratification. Thus, the \n     2-term limit would apply to each of us then currently \n     serving. Those of us serving in our second term, or greater, \n     would be able to serve out the remainder of that term. Those \n     in their first term in the Senate at the time of ratification \n     would be able to run for reelection, once.\n       As I noted in the course of the Judiciary Committee's \n     deliberations, my amendment would conform the congressional \n     term limits amendment to the transition rule adopted in the \n     22nd Amendment, which imposed term limits on the President. \n     The 22nd Amendment provides that it would ``not prevent any \n     person who may be holding the office of President, or acting \n     as President, during the term within which this Article \n     becomes operative from holding the office of President or \n     acting as President during the remainder of such term.'' The \n     22nd Amendment did not say that the President serving at the \n     time of ratification could be elected to two more, 4-year \n     terms. It is noteworthy that this precedent continues to be \n     ignored by the majority.\n       As reported, S.J. Res. 21 includes language in section 3 \n     intended to provide special privileges to those Members who \n     are serving at the time of ratification. Thus, all prior and \n     current service is to be disregarded and Members serving at \n     the time of ratification are to be accorded the prospect of \n     two additional 6-year Senate terms and six additional 2-year \n     House terms, regardless of the number of prior terms in the \n     Senate or House. Rather than have the constitutional \n     amendment eligibility limitations apply to everyone, S.J. \n     Res. 21 is drafted so that Members serving at the time of \n     ratification would be accorded the special privilege of being \n     able to complete their current terms and then start over, \n     counting from zero, with respect to elections and service \n     toward term limits. This is, in the words of a member of the \n     Committee who voted in favor of the constitutional amendment \n     ``transparent hypocrisy.''\n       A few examples indicate the unfairness of these special \n     privileges:\n       Senators elected after ratification would be locked into \n     inferior status in terms of seniority, chairmanships, \n     committee assignments and staff allocations. By contrast, \n     Senators serving now and at the time of ratification would \n     have their seniority preserved and protected.\n       A Senator elected one day before ratification would be able \n     to serve three full 6-year terms before the limits took \n     effect.\n       A Senator first elected in 1990 could run for reelection to \n     a second term in 1996, run successfully for a third term in \n     2002, see the ratification process subsequently completed in\n      2003, finish out the third term in 2008 and still be \n     reelected to two more full terms through 2020 before being \n     affected by any term limits. At the same time a new \n     Senator first elected in 2004 would be restricted to two \n     terms and be barred from serving past 2016. Thus, the \n     older Senator would be able to serve four years past the \n     forced retirement of the newer and for a total of 18 years \n     more than the newer Senator.\n       Senators voting for the amendment ought to be willing to \n     bind themselves to its terms and not just to bind others who \n     follow in their footsteps. Yet during the Judiciary Committee \n     markup, the following Senators voted for this popular \n     proposal and against my amendment to have it apply to them \n     fully upon ratification: Hatch, Thurmond, Simpson, Grassley, \n     Brown, Thompson, DeWine, Kyl and Abraham.\n       The amendment I will propose to the Senate will strike 3 \n     and its language excluding elections and service occurring \n     before final ratification from the calculation of the term \n     limits being imposed. Instead, the amendment will expressly \n     provide that the term limits being imposed by the \n     constitutional amendment would apply to Members serving at \n     ratification.\n       In order to avoid a retroactive effect or canceling the \n     results of a completed election, the amendment will allow \n     Members serving at the time of ratification to complete their \n     current term. The prohibition in the proposed constitutional \n     amendment would then operate prospectively to forbid any \n     Member serving a term at or beyond the term limit being \n     imposed from seeking reelection.\n       The amendment will also be intended to remove the ambiguity \n     created by language included in Section 1, which begins: \n     ``After this article becomes operative, no person. * * *'' \n     Unless stricken, this language might be interpreted to exempt \n     Members of Congress serving before ratification from the \n     effect of the constitutional amendment entirely. At the \n     least, the language implies that the eligibility of those \n     Members of Congress serving at ratification is intended to be \n     determined by consciously disregarding their current and past \n     elections and service.\n       Unless stricken this language could create a special class \n     of Members and grant them special privilege from the full \n     effect of the constitutional amendment at the moment that it \n     is ratified. The irony is that many of the very Members who \n     vote to impose term\n [[Page S4407]] limits on others elected in the future would secure for \nthemselves special dispensation so that they may serve either an \nunlimited number of terms or as many terms as can be begun before final \nratification plus an additional two terms in the Senate and an \nadditional six terms in the House.\n       The effect on my amendment will be that upon ratification \n     of this constitutional amendment to impose congressional term \n     limits, our current terms of service will be considered. This \n     is in keeping with the substance of the amendment and would \n     give it full effect upon ratification, rather than waiting \n     for another 12 to as many as 20 years before it takes effect. \n     If constitutionally-mandated congressional term limits are \n     necessary to solve an important problem, then why should the \n     amendment to the Constitution exclude the very situation that \n     it is being proposed to correct? We should not provide \n     ourselves with special privileges and adopt rules for the \n     next generation of Members. ``Grandfathering'' or \n     ``grandparenting'' ourselves from the full effects of this \n     amendment is not any way to proceed, if it is the will of the \n     Congress and the States that we should proceed.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/22/senate-section/article/S4405-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 MEASURE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED--S. 169\n\n  Mr. COATS.
