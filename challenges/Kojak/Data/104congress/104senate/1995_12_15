Mr. President, the House of Representatives will be \nlosing one of its true giants when Alabama Congressman Tom Bevill \nretires at the end of this Congress. His tremendous leadership, \nparticularly in the areas of waterway development, energy policy, and \nmedical research will be virtually impossible to replace. I was highly \ndisappointed at his decision, for he is a tried and true leader for our \nNation. His retirement will be a huge loss for the country and for \nAlabama.\n  Tom and I attended law school together at the University of Alabama \nand remained close friends over the years. He is the dean of the \nAlabama congressional delegation, having served now for over 30 years. \nTom Bevill has served longer in the U.S. House of Representatives than \nany other Member of Congress from Alabama. Today, Tom is the House's \n11th most senior Member and one of its most effective legislators.\n  He has worked closely on several issues of particular importance to \nour State. He certainly has played an important role in the growth and \nthe development of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Because of \nhis leadership and efforts, UAB, as it is known, is today home to one \nof the very best medical schools in the Nation and has some of its \npremier health care facilities and is on the vanguard of medical \nresearch.\n  Tom Bevill was chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water \nDevelopment of the House Appropriations Committee from 1977 until this \nyear when the Republicans took control of that Chamber.\n  His leadership extended beyond the confines of his own district. For \nexample, Mobile, a port city located some distance from his district in \nnorth Alabama, has been greatly enhanced by several waterways projects \nresulting from his stewardship.\n  Every area in the State of Alabama has benefited from his seniority \nand position in Congress. Some have even called him Alabama's third \nSenator, and, I will say, that the Nation, as a whole, certainly has \nbenefited. No one has been in the forefront more pertaining to waterway \ndevelopment. And waterway development is extremely important. He has \nhad some battles with Presidents relative to waterway development. I \nmight say that he came out victorious in these battles.\n  He is a native of a small Walker County mining community in Alabama \nby the name of Townley. Tom Bevill has spent part of his childhood \nbuilding small dams. He is a lifelong Democrat, and a fundamental \nreason for his party \n\n[[Page S18674]]\naffiliation is the suffering and the poverty he saw during the Great \nDepression.\n  He has said that his philosophy of Government was formed during the \nDepression when he saw his father, a former miner and a storekeeper in \nrural Townley, give food to people who were literally starving. He \nopenly admired Franklin Delano Roosevelt and what the New Deal did for \nAlabama and the Tennessee Valley.\n  Beginning in 1958, he served two terms in the Alabama State Senate. \nIn 1966, he won his seat to the U.S. House and has been there ever \nsince.\n  From the start, he earned the admiration and the respect of his \ncolleagues by not ever allowing policy or political disagreements to \nbecome personal. He is known for his fairness in all of his dealings. \nHe is a gentleman with a courtly manner that often eases tensions and \ninvites compromise. He is principled and consistent, a man true to his \nword, his conscience, his constituents and his colleagues.\n  Tom Bevill will be sorely missed when the 105th Congress convenes in \nJanuary 1997, but I can certainly understand his decision, having made \nthe same one earlier this year.\n  I wish him and his wonderful, gracious wife, Lou, all the best as \nthey enter a new phase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18673-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH ALABAMA FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, in the bustling North Alabama town of \nFlorence, an athletic dynasty reigns, cloaked in the royal purple and \ngold school colors, producing a championship heir each year since 1993. \nI come to the Senate floor today to tell you of an amazing group of \nyoung people at an outstanding university in my beloved State of \nAlabama.\n  Just days ago, on December 9, the University of North Alabama Lions \nclaimed their third consecutive national championship in Division II \nfootball. This is an achievement unmatched in college football history \nby any team from that division or higher. Their victory came at the \nexpense of a worthy opponent, Pittsburg State, with a final score of 27 \nto 7.\n  I can go on and on- and, mind you, I will in a moment- about the \nunbelievable records that have been set and broken by these champions \nover the past 3 years, but I would first like to call attention to a \nstatement made by the UNA Lions Coach Bobby Wallace. In an interview \nwith the Florence TimesDaily, Coach Wallace stressed that this once-in-\na-lifetime opportunity of three championships in a row is not what made \nhis team unique:\n\n       Don't get me wrong, I wanted very badly to win this game. \n     But winning really wasn't that important. A win today wasn't \n     going to make this team special. They were special long \n     before today. All they did today was go out and prove they \n     may be the best ever in Division II.\n\n  Mr. President, it is this type of attitude that sets the Lions apart \nas true champions. These young men and their outstanding coaches \nrealize that winning isn't the true mark of a good team. Character, \ndetermination, dedication and hard work all factor into the champion \nspirit. However, I would be remiss if I failed to point out the \nobvious: In addition the champion spirit, UNA most definitely has the \ntalent to capture the victory. And it is this astounding talent that I \nwould like to note for the record.\n  Over 15,000 people attended the sold-out game at Braly Stadium and \ncountless more watched on ESPN. Ken Berger of the Associated Press \nsummarized the championship game: ``It wasn't even close. North Alabama \n(14-0) shredded Kansas-based Pittsburg State (12-1-1), amassing 380 \nyards to the Gorillas' 176 and holding a 2-to-1 advantage in possession \ntime.''\n  Ronald McKinnon, senior linebacker, received the 1995 Harlon Hill \nTrophy as the NCAA Division II National Player of the Year. He is the \nfirst defensive player in the 10-year history of the award to finish in \nthe top three, much less win the award. He proved worthy once again in \nthe championship game with 14 tackles, one for a 5-yard loss and a \nrecovered fumble that led to UNA's second touchdown.\n  Starting quarterback Cody Gross, suffering from a torn hip muscle, \nstill managed to complete eight of 13 passes for 102 yards and a \ntouchdown in addition to carrying the ball three times for four yards. \nHe split the time with senior back-up quarterback Cale Manley who \nguided the team in a stunning 76-yard, 12-play drive on UNA's opening \npossession. Jermaine Roberts led UNA's championship game effort with \n107 yards on 20 carries, scoring twice.\n  Mike Goens, regional editor at the Florence TimesDaily, described the \natmosphere in the final 3 minutes of the game: ``At that moment, an \novercast afternoon turned to dusk. Metaphorically, the lights began \ngoing out for Pittsburg State. And the evening sky, fittingly, began \nturning shades of purple and gold.''\n  The UNA Lions have dominated their field of play as no other college \nfootball team has, ever. They have a 3-year record of 41 wins and 1 \nloss. That loss was to the No. 1 ranked Division I-AA Youngstown State. \nThe Lions are the only college football team at any level to win 40 \ngames in 3 years. UNA's current 23-game winning streak is second best \nin the Nation, behind Division I's Nebraska with 24.\n  This team is indeed made up of outstanding young men. Nineteen of the \nfifty-two players who dressed out for the championship game are \nseniors. This senior class closed their collective careers as the \nwinningest in school and Gulf South Conference history at 48-5-1.\n  Coach Wallace, not known as one to rest on his laurels, told the \nmedia after the game that he plans to guide the UNA Lions to a fourth \nstraight championship next season. That is the spirit of a true \nchampion. For now, however, I join my voice with a legion of others in \nproudly hailing UNA's conquering heroes with the resounding cheer: ``Go \nLions.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18674-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18674-S18675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A PROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues' \nattention to a recent proclamation made by President Gordon B. Hinckley \non behalf of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of \nthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  I believe this proclamation to be especially timely during this \nholiday season. The holidays often afford us the opportunity to \nreestablish family bonds. I believe President Hinckley's words have \nrelevance for all Americans and will help each of us reaffirm our \ncommitment to the primacy of the family as the basis for strong \ncommunities and to the sanctity of marriage as the foundation for \nhealthy families.\n  I hope that the core principles expressed within this proclamation \nwill continue to guide and strengthen us during this holiday season and \ninto the coming year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the proclamation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the proclamation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                      A Proclamation to the World\n\n (From the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of the \n              Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)\n\n     This proclamation was read by President Gordon B. Hinckley as \n     part of his message at the General Relief Society Meeting \n     held September 23, 1995, in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n       We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve \n     Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \n     solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is \n     ordained of God and that the family is central to the \n     Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.\n       All human beings--male and female--are created in the image \n     of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly \n     parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. \n     Gender is an essential characteristic of individual \n     premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.\n       In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and \n     worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan \n     by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain \n     earthly experience to progress toward perfection and \n     ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of \n     eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family \n     relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred \n     ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it \n     possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and \n     for families to be united eternally.\n       The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve \n     pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and \n     wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to \n     multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further \n     declare that God \n\n[[Page S18675]]\n     has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed \n     only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and \n     wife.\n       We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be \n     divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its \n     importance in God's eternal plan.\n       Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and \n     care for each other and for their children. ``Children are an \n     heritage of the Lord'' (Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred \n     duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to \n     provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach \n     them to love and serve one another to observe the \n     commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens \n     wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and \n     fathers--will beheld accountable before God for the \n     discharge of these obligations.\n       The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and \n     woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled \n     to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a \n     father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete \n     fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be \n     achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus \n     Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and \n     maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, \n     forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome \n     recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to \n     preside over their families in love and righteousness and are \n     responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection \n     for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the \n     nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, \n     fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as \n     equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may \n     necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should \n     lend support when needed.\n       We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, \n     who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family \n     responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. \n     Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will \n     bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the \n     calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\n       We call upon responsible citizens and officers of \n     government everywhere to promote those measures designed to \n     maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of \n     society.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18674-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18675-S18676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what the \nRepublican balanced budget bill, the bill that President Clinton vetoed \nwith such fanfare last week, would accomplish in a very important area; \nthat is, the area of student loans.\n  Mr. President, a great deal of attention has been paid to this issue. \nI do not think most people have heard the whole story, the real story. \nThe real story is this: The Republican balanced budget plan will \ndecrease--let me repeat, decrease--the cost of higher education for \nAmerican families.\n  The compromise worked out between the House and Senate reduced \nmandatory spending in the student loan program by $4.9 billion--a \nsavings of $4.9 billion. We achieve this goal without--without--\nincreasing the cost of student loans for students, for their parents, \nor for the colleges. We made these reductions by cutting the \nadministrative overhead of the Federal bureaucracy and by reducing the \nFederal spending--to banks, secondary markets, guaranty agencies, and \nother private lenders who administer the guaranteed student loan \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, none--let me repeat, none--of these cuts can be passed \non to the students, parents, or to their colleges.\n  In addition, the Republican balanced budget plan did not achieve this \n$4.9 billion in savings by cutting the amount of money made available \nto students and their parents for college education.\n  Mr. President, I think these are two very important points. The \nRepublican balanced budget plan does not ask students or their parents \nor colleges to pay more for student loans. The Republican balanced \nbudget plan does not cut the amount of money made available to students \nand their parents for a college education. The fact is, Mr. President, \nand the rest of the story really is, balancing the budget as our \noverall budget plan would do, would ultimately decrease the cost of \nstudents loans. It only makes sense.\n  If we balance the Federal budget, which will reduce interest rates, \nthe cost of borrowing by students and their families will fall. For \nexample, a student that borrowed $11,000 at an interest rate of 8 \npercent will repay $18,578 over the life of the loan. By balancing the \nbudget in 7 years and by reducing interest rates by 2 percent that same \nstudent repayment amount will be lowered--lowered--by $2,167, resulting \nin a lower yearly payment of $216. That is real money.\n  Mr. President, it is clear these policy changes will not make it more \ndifficult for families to pay for their children's education. Just the \ncontrary. What our changes will do will be to make it easier for \nfamilies.\n  In addition, our Republican balanced budget plan will provide \nstudents with a tax deduction on a portion of the interest they pay on \nstudent loans. If you average it out, Mr. President, the average \nborrower will save $8 a month--$8 a month.\n  The number of student loans is scheduled to increase as well. Let me \nrepeat that: The number of student loans under our plan is going to \nincrease. In 1996, it will be higher than ever before with over 7.1 \nmillion student loans. The Congressional Budget Office projects that \nstudent loans will continue to rise through the end of the century. \nThis year the volume of student loans stands at about $24.5 billion; by \nthe year 2000 it will rise above $33 billion. That is an increase of \nnearly 50 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, the average student loan amount will rise from today's \n$3,646 to $4,300 in the year 2000. So the balanced budget plan, our \nbalanced budget plan, will help make education more affordable.\n  The bill will also make substantive changes in the law that are both \nwise and necessary, changes that will make the lending system fair and \nmore efficient. The Republican balanced budget plan will extend to \nthose students who are in the guaranteed loan program the same benefits \nenjoyed by those who participate in the direct lending program.\n  Mr. President, today if you are a student receiving loans under the \ndirect lending program, you have a wide variety of options for \nrepayment. You can have an extended repayment or income-contingent \nrepayment. These and other repayment options make it easier for young \npeople to make the transition from college life to the working world. A \nyoung person getting out of college may decide to take a job that pays \nlittle but will give him or her a lot of experience. There is no reason \nthat student should not be allowed to pay the loan back further in the \nfuture when he or she is making more money. That is flexibility.\n  Mr. President, you can do that with the direct lending program. I \nbelieve it is only fair that we extend those same options to students \nin the regular guaranteed loan program. That is what the Republican \nbalanced budget plan will do.\n  We have just received a few details on what the President's proposal \nwould do. It is clear that the President's plan would take away from \nthe benefits that students would receive under the Republican balanced \nbudget plan. The President's proposal, the Clinton proposal, would \neliminate the expansion of repayment options to students in the \nguaranteed loan program. Under that plan, only students in the Federal \ndirect lending program--only in the direct lending program--would have \nflexible repayment options. That is an endorsement, I believe, of the \nstatus quo, which really is unfair.\n  Mr. President, that is some of what the President proposes. We are \nwaiting, as I speak this morning, for more details. The more we learn, \nthe clearer it becomes that the Republican budget plan in regard to \nstudent loans is better for students, is better for their parents, is \nbetter for the colleges. The Republican balanced budget plan provides a \ntax deduction for interest on student loans, the first time since 1986. \nIt provides flexible repayment options for all students. Most \nimportantly, it cuts the deficit without making a college education \nless affordable for students, parents, and colleges. \n\n[[Page S18676]]\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, the Republican balanced budget plan \nconstitutes a major step forward for the young people in this country. \nI believe strongly that these student loan provisions ought to be \nincorporated in whatever final budget compromise is reached between the \nPresident and the Congress. Students, parents, or colleges should not \nbe made to pay more for a college education. The Republican balanced \nbudget plan did not make students, parents, or colleges pay more. The \nPresident's plan should not either.\n  I see also on the floor my colleague from Indiana who has played such \na major role and has really taken the lead in shaping this very \nresponsible plan that we have put forward. It is a plan I know he is \nproud of and I am proud of, as well. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Coats, is recognized for up to 45 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18675-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18676-S18678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will not take nearly that much time. I \nthank my colleague and friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for his \nsupport throughout this effort. I will take a portion of that allotted \ntime to explain what we are about and why we feel it is so important, \nat this particular time, to define the future for those students and \nparents who are anxiously wondering about what their opportunities will \nbe to secure guaranteed loans for college expenses and university \nexpenses in the future.\n  As many who have followed this issue know, after weeks of \nnegotiations, the Senate and House reconciled the differences between \ntheir two pieces of legislation regarding student loans, and came up \nwith a savings figure of $4.9 billion. We had to do so because, in an \neffort to balance the budget, which is a noble effort which will \nhopefully come to a conclusion here in this next week, each committee \nwas directed to achieve a certain amount of savings.\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee has a very limited impact in \nterms of the savings that it can contribute to this balanced budget \neffort and, in fact, had very little other choice other than to look at \nstudent loans. We were faced with somewhat of a dilemma. We know \ncollege costs are rising and tuition costs are rising. We know cutting \nback on the amount of loans available, or the repayment obligations of \nthose loans, puts a serious crimp on families and students alike. So, \nwhat we were able to do is come up with our recommended savings, $4.9 \nbillion, without decreasing, without limiting, without imposing any new \ncosts on students, on their families or on the schools. Not one student \nor one parent will pay 1 cent more for a student loan under the \nRepublican reconciliation package, the balanced budget package, than \nthey pay today.\n  This debate has gone on for more than a year, but particularly this \nyear. And, unfortunately, there is a tremendous amount of \ndisinformation being spread by the administration that somehow students \nand parents are going to be adversely affected by these drastic cuts in \neducation; that students will not be able to secure loans to pay for \ntheir future education.\n  Demonstrations have been held during hearings. The hearing room is \npacked with students coming down. As we point out the facts to these \nstudents, they are almost in disbelief, because they have been told \nthat the Republican balanced budget plan is going to drastically reduce \ntheir ability to secure student loans and drastically increase the \nrepayment obligations on those loans.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, not 1 cent of additional cost is being \nimposed on students. Mr. President, 70 percent of the $4.9 billion are \ncosts that are imposed on the banks and guaranty agencies and secondary \nmarkets who participate in administering these loans: Taking the \napplications, determining who is eligible, providing the money, doing \nthe repayment collection and so forth. Those are the agencies that will \ntake a second, additional, substantial increase in the amount of \nexpenditures that they will have to absorb without passing any of that \non to the students or the parents who take out the loans.\n  The 1993 Budget Act imposed a very substantial cost, several billion \ndollars of additional costs on these banks and agencies, and now we are \nadding an additional $4.9 billion. All of the rhetoric coming out of \nthe Department of Education and coming out of the administration speaks \nto the opposite of what is happening. Because the balanced budget \npackage actually affords students not only the ability to retain their \nexisting benefits in the same form that they currently exist, but \ncreates new benefits by ensuring that the two student loan programs, \nthe guaranteed loan program and the direct lending program, will offer \nthe same benefits to students. For example, until now, students \nreceiving loans through the direct lending program were given the \noption of an income-contingent repayment. That is, their repayments \nwere based on their ability to repay--income-contingent. Under the \npackage that is now presented to us, this same option will be extended \nto students in the guaranteed loan program as well as the direct \nlending program.\n  Furthermore, students, their families, and colleges were protected \nfrom a precipitous move to an unproven program by capping the direct \nlending program at 10 percent of total loan volume. The administration \nhas opposed this cap because the President and Department of Education \nhave been committed for some time to a very dramatic extension, an \nexpansion of this program, the direct lending program, and were not \nwilling to take some time and set aside a demonstration to see whether \nor not it would be in the better interests of the students and colleges \nand actually provide the savings they claim.\n  Initially, the savings claimed started out somewhere close to $12-\nplus billion. That was revised to $6 billion. Then we finally got an \nestimate back from the Congressional Budget Office saying that, no, it \nnot only would not save money for the Government, it would actually \ncost money because of a number of factors including administrative \ncosts at the Department of Education.\n  A point we are trying to deal with here is that if we were to adopt \nand accept the President's proposals to continually raise the cap and \neventually get, I think, to a program that only administered student \nloans through the direct lending program, we are likely to see the \ntermination of the competing program, the guaranteed loan program, \nbecause these agencies cannot continue to absorb increased \nadministrative costs while their market for distributing loans \ncontinues to shrink, as more shift over into the direct loan program. \nSo the conferees thought that what we ought to do is double the current \nsize of the direct lending program from 5 to 10 percent, put a cap on \nthat 10 percent, test it as a demonstration program to see how we could \nadminister it efficiently and effectively to see whether or not it \nlived up to the claims that were made for it, and then make a final \ndecision on what the best way to offer student loans to students would \nbe.\n\n  The Clinton plan began by removing any participation target for \ndirect lending, effectively allowing, as I said, direct lending to go \nto 100 percent, as the administration has been pushing as recently as 5 \nmonths ago in legislation that it sent to the Congress. At the same \ntime, the administration was imposing virtually all of the subsidy \nreductions on the guaranteed loan program, the other program, added to, \nas I said, increases in costs that were imposed in 1993. Taken \ntogether, these subsidy reductions along with the open-ended level of \nthe direct loan program, in my opinion and in the opinions of many, \nwould have effectively ended the guaranteed loan program and \neffectively denied and taken away the choice for the vast majority of \nthe Nation's schools and students.\n  Again, let me state the facts. Even though we are putting together a \nplan to balance the budget in 7 years, the decision was made that we \nwill not achieve savings by imposing on students or their parents or \nthe schools or universities any additional costs. That ought to be good \nnews for every college, every university, and every student and young \nperson in this country. Despite that, we continue to hear and read the \nrhetoric coming out of the administration that we are denying \nopportunities to students and imposing higher costs on them. That is \nsimply not true.\n  Make no mistake, there is a real higher education debate going on. \nBut \n\n[[Page S18677]]\nthe debate is not whether we will provide loan assistance to students \ngoing to school. The debate is how we will provide that assistance. It \nis not a debate about student cuts or school fees, it is a debate about \nwhere the funds for loans will originate and who will handle that, \nadminister the loans once they are made. The difference really comes \ndown to whether or not you believe that a Government-run program will \nbe more cost efficient and more effective than a private sector-run \nprogram. That point was made very well in the Washington Post op-ed \narticle 2 weeks ago.\n  Two economists at the CRS, Dennis Zimmerman and Barbara Miles, wrote \nan article explaining that the debate between the direct lending and \nthe guaranteed loan program is fundamentally a debate over political \nphilosophy and not a debate over economics. I have a quote from what \nthey wrote on this chart:\n\n       There are no inherent cost advantages in direct lending as \n     opposed to guaranteed lending. Regardless of how the loans \n     are made, rules of the program dictate that the same number \n     of loans will be made to the same students for the same \n     purposes, and with the same interest rates and repayment \n     terms. The idea that direct lending would somehow produce \n     multibillion-dollar savings was attributable to . . . [and I \n     think they generously said] misunderstanding.\n       The choice between the two boils down to political \n     philosophy, not economics.\n\n  It is important to keep in mind that these economists at the \nCongressional Research Service are not individuals who work for the \nRepublican Party, nor are they individuals who have some hidden agenda, \nwho have some connection to the banks or the guaranty agencies. They \nare simply economists who work for the Congressional Research Service \nand provide us with objective, nonpartisan analyses of the programs \nthat Congress develops.\n  As many know, I have been a vocal opponent of the direct lending \nprogram since its inception. To put it simply, I simply do not believe \nthat the Federal Government is able to better manage a program than the \nprivate sector at a time when we are looking to privatize many \nGovernment services because we are discovering--whether it is in small \ntown America, whether it is in our States, or whether it is at the \nFederal level--that the private sector does the job more efficiently \nand cost effectively than Government. At a time when we are attempting \nto privatize and find the savings in Government, along comes the \nadministration saying, ``Let us create a brand new program to be \nadministered by a Government agency, Government bureaucracy, and let us \ntake away a function that is being performed by the private sector and \ntransfer it to Government.''\n  I think anybody who has studied, or looked at, or even instinctively \nunderstands that Government programs do not operate as efficiently or \neffectively as the private sector, has to seriously question the \ndecision of the administration to begin to administer an entirely new \nprogram at the Department of Education.\n  In my opinion, and on the basis of my analysis of Government programs \nand the thousands of requests, complaints, and inquiries that come into \nmy Senate office here in Washington, or my Senate or regional offices \nin Indiana, complaints about the ineptness, the mismanagement, the \nbureaucracy, and the delays of administering Federal programs, I simply \ncannot endorse a program that would add yet another function to the \nFederal Government.\n  I believe that quality of service would seriously decline. I believe \nthat the default rate would skyrocket. I think that making a Federal \nagency the responsible agent to ensure that the loans are repaid is not \ngoing to begin to give us the accountability that we achieve through \nthe private sector.\n  One of my greatest concerns is program management. The direct lending \nprogram will centralize control at the Department of Education. The new \nFederal bureaucracy needed to oversee direct lending is already growing \nand having predictable results. We started with a 5-percent test, and \nalready we are considerably more than that. Some of the results are in.\n\n  The Department has had to hire 400 new people to administer the \nprogram and has plans to hire some 700 more by the time the program is \nfully operational.\n  Yet, a recent issue of Forbes magazine reported that the Department \nis already having problems managing the $700 million that it disbursed \nin 1994 through direct loans. In the first year of that program, when \nthe Department was only responsible for 5 percent of total loan volume, \nthey somehow lost track of almost 15 percent of the loans disbursed.\n  The program mismanagement becomes an even greater concern with the \npossibility that direct lending could become the only student loan \nprogram.\n  As I mentioned earlier, despite their newfound love for program \nchoice, the President and the Department of Education have made it very \nclear that they want ultimately to end up with 100 percent direct \nlending. And, in this environment, the Department of Education would \nthen become the third largest bank in the country requiring a vast new \nGovernment bureaucracy to handle details like customer assistance and \nloan checks.\n  This is the same Department that, after 16 years of operation and \n$342 billion of taxpayer money, has failed to improve the quality of \neducation in this country. Do we want this institution to have a \nmonopoly on student loans?\n  Concern over this program management and whether this is a proper \nexpansion of Federal Government is shared by four former Secretaries of \nEducation. Former Secretaries Bennett, Cavazos, Alexander, and \nHufstedler, President Carter's first Secretary of Education, wrote a \nletter to Senator Dole opposing direct loans on the grounds that the \nDepartment of Education simply cannot manage this program.\n  I have put on this chart--it may be difficult to see--a copy of this \nletter to Senator Dole from the three former Secretaries of Education, \nLamar Alexander, Lauro Cavazos and William Bennett, and I will read \nonly a portion of it.\n\n       The effort to rapidly federalize the administration of the \n     massive student loan program is ill-conceived and presents \n     substantial risk to the financial lifeline for millions of \n     this Nation's college students and families.\n\n  They further wrote that at a time when the Clinton administration has \nadvocated public-private partnerships and deregulation to improve \nAmerican competitiveness, the nationalization of the student loan \nprogram directly conflicts with those objectives.\n  Such strong bipartisan opposition to direct lending clearly sends a \nsignal that we need to at the most test this program before allowing it \nunrestricted and unfettered growth, as the President proposed in his \nbalanced budget plan.\n  The report that the conference between the House and the Senate gave \nback to us said they believed it was appropriate to cap this program at \na 10-percent rate--10 percent of the total loan volume--and test it to \nsee whether or not our concerns were real concerns.\n  I believe that a 10-percent cap would allow for a reasonable \ndemonstration to occur. We can then take the results and make further \ndecisions as to what we ought to do.\n  We ought to heed the words of those former Secretaries of Education \nfrom both parties who caution that rapid federalization of student \nloans as currently being undertaken by the administration presents \nsubstantial risk to the financial lifeline for millions of this \nNation's college students and families.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to save student loans and to support the \nbalanced budget provision which was supported by the Senate.\n  We are entering now into a period of time over the next several days \nwhen some very fundamental decisions will have to be made in terms of \ngetting to a balanced budget in a 7-year period of time with honest \nnumbers, without fudging the numbers or cooking the books or making \nfalse assumptions.\n  We owe it to the future of this country, we owe it to our children \nand grandchildren, and we owe it to those young people who ought to \nhave the kind of opportunities that we have enjoyed.\n  This is just one piece of the puzzle. It is an important piece. It is \na $4.9 billion piece. But it could result in a program which, if left \nunfettered, left uncapped and not tested first, could begin \n\n[[Page S18678]]\nto push us down that road which we have been traveling for the last \nseveral decades of open-ended programs with entitlements to individuals \nand no ability of Congress to check it.\n  We have a program now that works. We have substantially improved that \nprogram in the private sector. We have imposed costs and fees on the \nbanks, guarantors, and lenders that have helped us in our budget \nsavings without imposing additional restrictions on students.\n  Frankly, it is a pretty good deal for America, to be able, when you \nsend your children to school, to borrow funds at no interest, use those \nfunds to pay college costs, and then have an extended repayment period \nafter graduation where you are not even paying interest on the use of \nthe funds for the entire time that you are in school, plus in a 6-month \nperiod of time after graduation from school.\n  Now, I do not know if there are many better deals in America. If \nthere are, I would like to know about them.\n  And so I think we ought to deal with the facts and not the political \nrhetoric. We ought to recognize that we have in place an \nextraordinarily generous program to help parents who need the help and \nstudents who need the help in providing funds to pay for their college \ncosts.\n  A program which allows you to borrow at zero interest for your entire \ntime in school and then gives you a generous 10-year or more repayment \nprogram where the interest does not even begin to run on the amount \nthat you have borrowed until 6 months after you have graduated, give \nyou time to go out and look for employment so that you can begin to pay \nback these loans, is a pretty generous program. At a time when we are \nfacing a substantial budget crisis, are attempting to bring fiscal \nresponsibility to the Federal Government, at this historic moment when \nwe hope to finally once and for all balance the budget, this is more \nthan a reasonable proposition.\n  So I hope that the conferees in deciding what the final composition \nof the Balanced Budget Act will look like and in negotiating with the \nPresident understand what the House and Senate have come up with in \nterms of the student loan program is more than reasonable, does not \nimpose additional costs on students, does not reduce the amount of \nloans available to those students, and simply is the way we ought to \nproceed.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time.

My \nwonderful wife, Pat and I always felt Dick Halverson was one of God's \ngreatest gifts to us and our spiritual well-being. He never let us \ndown, and he always built us up.\n  The Christian glow of Chaplain Halverson, like a strobe light in the \ndark or a beacon in the storm and fog, shone brightly always and will \neverlastingly. Few have attained or maintained the mission of what \nobviously was God's wisdom and compassion in creating and sending forth \namong us poor sinners this giant workman for faith and good.\n  I knew him well years before he was called upon to be the spiritual \nleader of the Senate. Way back in the early 1970's, when I first met \nthis man, I correctly sensed, when he came to Nebraska to lead us in a \nGovernors' Christian retreat, his devotion and his unique ability to \nspread our Maker's message of peace and love and understanding.\n  While he is gone from us in this life, and we will miss him, the \nlight and glow of Richard Halverson does not even flicker. It is \nbrighter than ever. For this wonderful man, who has been taken from us \nand from his family, we issue condolences to that great family of \nRichard Halverson, but we commit to continue his gentle but most \neffective teachings that he has left all of us for the betterment of \nmankind.

Mr. President, before I speak on my frustrations with the \nWar Powers Act and relate some of the most recent debate on Bosnia and \nmost recent deployment of American military forces, I would like to say \nthere was an article in the Washington Times this morning in effect \nsaying I had declared all-out war in an effort to lobby Senators to \ndefeat the Defense authorization conference report.\n  Mr. President, just for clarification, I will vote against the \nconference report. I worked very hard with Senator Thurmond and with \nother members of the committee to get a bill that would not only be \nsomething that I could support but also, more importantly, that the \nPresident would sign. I am afraid we do not have that kind of product \ncoming in the conference report. But I have informed the Democratic \nCloakroom and the Democratic leadership that I wish to cooperate fully \nwith Senator Thurmond in getting this conference report before the \nSenate. I certainly will do everything I can to get a time agreement \nfor a reasonable period for debate where people can express their views \nboth ways, for and against this bill. I will do everything I can to \npersuade other Senators not to have extended debate. I have no intent \nof trying to keep this bill from going to the President for his final \ndecision, whether he signs it or whether he does not sign it.\n  This article also said I was busy laying some kind of strategy to \ndefeat the bill and lobbying Republican Senators and that I was trying \nto get out in front of Chairman Thurmond and defeat this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have not asked a single Senator to vote against this \nbill. I do not intend to lobby against the bill. I intend to state my \nviews as to why I cannot support the bill. The conference report speaks \nfor itself. There are some people who will be for it, some opposed to \nit. This article is right out of the whole cloth. I do not know how \nreporters are able to make these kinds of reports to the public without \nany check whatsoever with the people they are purporting to report on, \nin this case me.\n  It is true that I said I would vote against the bill. It is true that \nI laid out some of the reasons in a press release. It is not true that \nI am trying to impede the bill and its progress. It is not true that I \nam launching any kind of all-out effort to defeat the bill. It is my \nview that the bill will pass.\n  It will have, I think, majority support. It will have support from \npeople, I am sure, from both sides of the aisle. So, I wanted to \nclarify my view on this. \n\n[[Page S18679]]\n I will vote against the bill. But if I wanted to defeat this \nconference report, if I felt that was the appropriate route--and I do \nnot--I would certainly be engaged in extensive debate, thereby \nrequiring 60 votes to pass it rather than 50. I do not intend to do \nthat. If there is any kind of effort for extensive debate, it will not \nonly be without my cooperation but it would be against my own advice \nand something being done by individual Senators.\n  So, I hope that whoever is spreading that message or making that \nreport or seeing that article also will take into account the remarks I \nhave made here on the floor, which happen to be factual and true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18678-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18679-S18682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR POWERS ACT\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the overall concept \nof war powers and the congressional role in making decisions to deploy \nUnited States forces abroad. There was not sufficient time in the \ndebate on Bosnia during which I alluded to my frustration in this \nregard, but did not go into detail. Today I hope to lay out my views in \na more complete fashion.\n  Mr. President, during Wednesday's debate on the Bosnia resolutions, I \nnoted that when President Clinton publicly committed the United States \nto participate in implementing a peace agreement by putting U.S. forces \non the ground in Bosnia, he did so without consulting with Congress \nprior to making that commitment, as far as I know. I was not consulted, \nand I do not know of others who were. I certainly do not know of any \nkind of formal consultation or any kind of leadership meeting before \nthat commitment to deploy U.S. ground forces was made to the world and \nto our allies.\n  It was a very important commitment. At that time, we were not on the \nverge of a peace agreement, so it was not taken as being important by \nthe news media or by those people in Congress in leadership positions; \nbut it was important. And I think all of us need to understand that \nwhen Presidents make these kinds of commitments internationally, and \nwhen they do so without consulting Congress, then the cards are already \ndealt.\n  Those of us in the Congress who have certain constitutional \nresponsibilities, if we do not do a better job ourselves, then this \nkind of pattern--it has not only been President Clinton, but it has \nbeen the same with other recent Presidents--will continue.\n  President Reagan made commitments and certainly took action in Panama \nand Grenada and Congress played almost no role.\n  President Bush, though he did, to his great credit, come to Congress \nbefore actually going to war, deployed hundreds of thousands of troops \nto Saudi Arabia without any congressional action. Congress did not take \nany action. I do not blame President Bush for that. Congress did not \nact. And President Bush then virtually doubled the number of forces in \nSaudi Arabia, which prevented a troop rotation, which meant that the \nclock was ticking. There was no way to rotate those forces. Therefore, \nthey either had to be used in some kind of conflict or it had to be \nresolved. So, the clock was ticking there. Then President Bush also \nmade it clear that whatever Congress did, even though he sought \ncongressional authority, he was going to go forward.\n  So, all of this leads me to think that it is time, way past time, \nprobably 10 or 15 years past time, for Congress to rethink its own \nrole. I think this is fundamentally a congressional responsibility. I \ndo not think it is going to be solved by a President, whether it is a \nRepublican President or Democratic President. It is not their job. I \nwould hope that any President would cooperate if Congress takes its own \ninitiative to exercise its own responsibility and authority. But, at \nthis stage, I do not expect the President to solve our own problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would be pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to corroborate the fact that in February 1993, \nwhen President Clinton made this specific commitment, I did not have \nany knowledge nor did other members, senior members, of the Armed \nServices Committee, to my knowledge.\n  Likewise, I remember the commitment of that large number of troops by \nPresident Bush. I recall the Senator from Georgia was quite concerned \nwhen he learned about it through other sources than through the \nconsultation process which, in some effect, was taking place during \nthat period in the fall. But I remember the Senator specifically raised \na point that at no time in that consultation process--and I was the \nranking member then--was there any to the then-chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Georgia. And the Senator called the \nPresident to task for failing to do that.\n  Last, Mr. President, I urge the Senator to look at a very erudite \narticle on this subject written by Lloyd Cutler appearing in the \nWashington Post, I think about 2 weeks ago. I will put it in the \nRecord, the exact date of that article. It lays out with detail the \nlegal chronology of the War Powers Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 26, 1995]\n\n Our Piece of the Peace--Sending Troops to Bosnia: Our Duty, Clinton's \n                                  Call\n\n                          (By Lloyd N. Cutler)\n\n       After months of sustained effort, the Clinton \n     administration has succeeded in negotiating a peace agreement \n     among the three warring ethnic factions in Bosnia. The \n     agreements initialed in Dayton would require us and our NATO \n     allies to place peacekeeping units of our armed forces in \n     Bosnia for a year or more. This raises once again the biggest \n     unresolved issue under the U.S. system of separate executive \n     and legislative departments: Is the constitutional authority \n     to place our armed forces in harm's way vested in the \n     president or in Congress, or does it require the joint \n     approval of both?\n       President Clinton has said he would follow the precedent \n     set by George Bush before the 1991 Desert Storm invasion and \n     seek a congressional expression of support before committing \n     American units to the enforcement of the Bosnian peace \n     agreement. But he has also asserted the constitutional power \n     to act on his own authority, just as Bush did. This time, it \n     is Republican congressional leaders who are challenging a \n     Democratic president's view that the president can lawfully \n     act on his own, but, more typically it has been Democratic \n     Congresses challenging presidents of either party.\n       During the coming debate. Congress would be wise to bear in \n     mind, as it did five years ago, that the world will be \n     watching how the one and only democratic superpower reaches \n     its decisions, or whether it is so divided that it is \n     incapable of deciding at all. Congress needs to recognize \n     that we cannot have 535 commanders-in-chief in addition to \n     the president and that some deference to presidential \n     judgments on force deployments is in order. That is \n     especially true when, as in Korea, Iraq and Bosnia, the \n     president's proposed deployments are based on United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions that we have sponsored and on \n     joint decisions with our allies pursuant to treaties Congress \n     has previously approved.\n       In the case of Bosnia, the argument for committing U.S. \n     forces to carry out a peace agreement is a strong one. All of \n     us are revolted by the ethnic cleansing and other human \n     rights abuses that the various factions have committed. \n     These abuses are likely to continue if the peace agreement \n     is not formally signed in mid-December as now scheduled, \n     or if it is signed but not carried out. If the war goes on \n     or soon resumes, it may well spread to other parts of the \n     former Yugoslavia and to the rest of the Balkans, still \n     the most unstable region of Western and Central Europe. \n     Any widening of the Balkan wars could well spread to \n     Eastern Europe and the Middle East and pose a substantial \n     potential threat to U.S. national security.\n       Some foreign forces are needed to separate the contending \n     armies and to control the standing down of heavy weapons. \n     Under our leadership, and only under our leadership, NATO is \n     ready to supply the necessary forces. The stronger the \n     forces, the better the chance that they will not be attacked \n     and that they will accomplish their mission. All these \n     reasons argue for a significant U.S. military commitment, now \n     that a promising peace agreement has been reached.\n       In 1991, the Democratic Congress narrowly approved \n     President Bush's decision to reverse the Iraqi invasion of \n     Kuwait, thus mooting the issue of whether the president could \n     have acted alone. Today, the Republican congressional \n     leadership, while sounding somewhat more conciliatory than in \n     recent weeks, is challenging President Clinton to make his \n     case for the proposed deployment. This war powers question \n     has come up repeatedly since the 1950 outbreak of the Korean \n     War, when President Truman committed our forces without first \n     seeking congressional approval, but has never been resolved.\n       In foreign and national security policy, as in domestic \n     policy, neither Congress nor the president can accomplish \n     very much for very long without the cooperation of the other. \n\n\n[[Page S18680]]\n     This is so for both constitutional and practical reasons. The \n     Constitution gives Congress the power to ``declare war,'' but \n     both Congress and the president share the power to raise \n     armies and navies and to raise and appropriate funds for \n     their maintenance and deployment. Only Congress can enact \n     such measures, but it needs the president's approval or a \n     two-thirds majority of both houses to override his veto. Only \n     the president can negotiate treaties, but he needs a two-\n     thirds vote of the Senate to ratify them. The president's \n     separate powers are limited to receiving ambassadors, serving \n     as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and faithfully \n     executing the laws. If as commander-in-chief he orders our \n     armed forces into a combat situation, he still needs \n     congressional approval to finance such a commitment over an \n     extended period of time.\n       Before the United States became a superpower, disputes over \n     the authority to commit our forces rarely arose. We had few \n     occasions to deploy our military units abroad, much less \n     commit them to conflict. Armies, navies and news of battle \n     traveled very slowly. Air forces and long-range missiles did \n     not exist. There was plenty of time after learning of a \n     threatening event for the president to deliberate with \n     Congress about the proper response. Occasionally, presidents \n     committed us unilaterally, as in our attacks on the Barbary \n     pirates in Tripoli in Jefferson's time, but it was rare for \n     Congress to claim that its own prerogatives were being \n     usurped by the president.\n       Since World War II, all this has changed. As commander-in-\n     chief of the democratic superpower, presidents now deploy our \n     armed forces all over the world. We can attack, or be \n     attacked, within moments. On numerous occasions, presidents \n     have committed our forces to armed conflict, sometimes of a \n     sustained nature as in Korea and Vietnam, without asking \n     Congress to declare war. In Vietnam, as it had in Korea, \n     Congress initially supported the president's initiatives by \n     appropriations and other measures. But as the duration and \n     scope of our military actions in Indochina escalated, an \n     increasingly restive Congress enacted the War Powers \n     Resolution over President Nixon's veto. The resolution laid \n     down a series of rules that require a president ``in every \n     possible instance'' to ``consult with Congress'' before he \n     commits our armed forces to combat or to places in which \n     hostilities are ``imminent.'' It also requires the withdrawal \n     of those forces if Congress fails to adopt an approving \n     resolution within 60 days.\n       President Nixon and all subsequent presidents have \n     challenged the constitutionality of these prescriptions, but \n     the Supreme Court has never accepted a case that would \n     resolve this dispute and is unlikely to do so in the near \n     future. When presidents ``consult'' with Congress before \n     committing forces, they are careful to avoid saying they do \n     so ``pursuant to'' the War Powers Resolution; they say they \n     do so ``consistent with'' the resolution.\n       There are obviously situations where modern technology \n     makes advance consultation with Congress impractical--most \n     notably the case where our sensor equipment indicates that a \n     missile attack has been launched on the United States or our \n     NATO allies, or where speed and secrecy are key factors, as \n     in the rescue of American hostages or reprisals against a \n     terrorist act abroad.\n       But presidents have continued to commit our forces to armed \n     conflict or situations where conflict was clearly \n     ``imminent,'' whether or not split-second timing was \n     imperative. President Ford, for example responded forcefully \n     to an attack on a U.S. vessel (the Mayaguez) off the Cambodia \n     coast; President Carter launched a military mission to rescue \n     our hostages in Iran; President Reagan put our forces into \n     Lebanon, the Sinai, Chad and Grenada and ordered bombing \n     attacks on Libya; President Bush sent troops into Panama, \n     Liberia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.\n       As for President Clinton, he has already ordered our forces \n     into Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti and Macedonia and has authorized \n     our air units to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia \n     itself.\n       Moreover, in the 22 years since the War Powers Resolution \n     became law, Congress has never undermined these presidential \n     uses of force by action (or inaction) in a way that would \n     have blocked the mission or required withdrawal within 60 \n     days.\n       All this does not mean that Congress must cede the power to \n     make national security decisions to the president. Congress \n     successfully forced Johnson and Nixon to limit and finally to \n     terminate the undeclared Vietnam War. Congress successfully \n     stopped Reagan's covert sales of weapons to Iran and his \n     covert and overt military aid to the contras. As these \n     examples show, presidents cannot effectively exercise their \n     separate constitutional powers over national security and \n     foreign policy over an extended period without the \n     cooperation of Congress. That is why Clinton, like Bush in \n     1990, has invited Congress to express its views before our \n     forces are committed to support the peace agreement in \n     Bosnia.\n       A week ago Friday, while the Dayton negotiations were still \n     going on, House Republicans passed a bill that would bar the \n     expenditure of any funds to sustain U.S. forces in Bosnia. \n     Fortunately, the Senate is unlikely to follow, and even if it \n     did, a presidential veto would be difficult to override. But \n     the House Republicans who launched this preemptive strike \n     would do better to emulate former Republican congressman Dick \n     Cheney.\n       In 1990, when we had a Republican president and Democratic \n     majorities in both houses of Congress, Cheney was the \n     secretary of defense. As he said before we entered the Gulf \n     War, ``When the stakes have to do with the leadership of the \n     Free World, we cannot afford to be paralyzed by an intramural \n     stalemate.'' The decision to act, he noted, ``finally belongs \n     to the president. He is the one who bears the responsibility \n     for sending young men and women to risk death. If the \n     operation fails, it will be his fault. I have never heard one \n     of my former [congressional] colleagues stand up after a \n     failed operation to say, `I share the blame for that one; I \n     advised him to go forward.' ''\n       This does not mean that Congress must approve the \n     president's proposed commitments without change. For example, \n     following the Lebanon precedent, Congress could require its \n     further approval if the forces were not withdrawn within, \n     say, 18 months, a period that expires after the next \n     elections. The president and Congress have the shared \n     responsibility of finding a solution that shows we can \n     function as a decisive superpower and as a responsible \n     democracy at the same time. The public expects no less.\n       It may be too late to help in the Bosnia debate, but there \n     is one change in our process for making national security \n     decisions that ought to be adopted. The National Security \n     Council (NSC), the statutory body created to advise the \n     president on national security affairs, consists entirely of \n     officials in the executive branch. When the NSC takes up \n     issues related to the potential commitment of our forces, the \n     president could invite the attendance of the speaker, the \n     majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate and the \n     chairman and ranking members of the national security and \n     foreign policy committees of each house. Since the NSC role \n     is purely advisory, no separation-of-powers issues would \n     arise. In this way Congress, in its own favorite phrase, \n     would be effectively consulted before the takeoff, rather \n     than at the time of the landing. The cooperation on national \n     security issues that the nation wants and expects might still \n     elude us, but the president would have done his part to carry \n     out George Shultz's admonition that trust between the \n     branches must be Washington's ``coin of the realm.''\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think that is a very good article to place \nin the Record. I thank the Senator from Virginia, my friend from \nVirginia, for his recollection, which is entirely consistent with my \nown.\n  Mr. President, during the cold war--in a long period of nuclear \nconfrontation--all of us and most Americans instinctively understood \nthat the Commander in Chief had to make a quick and decisive decision \nwith potentially fatal consequences if certain events took place.\n  In effect, every President of the United States from 1945 on has had \nthe acknowledged authority and responsibility to respond to aggression \nby using nuclear weapons, which could result in the destruction of a \nlarge portion of mankind, including most of the United States.\n  With this awesome authority being accepted for so long, recognizing \nthat, if the former Soviet Union attacked the United States, and \ncertainly if they used nuclear weapons, there would not be time for 30 \ndays of congressional debate or probably even 3 days. With that kind of \nreality having taken place for so long and that kind of assumed \nauthority being vested in the Commander in Chief, how then, in 1995, in \na totally different set of circumstances, does Congress exercise its \nconstitutional responsibility to ``declare war?'' And even more \nrelevant in my view, how do we exercise our responsibility in funding \nthese operations?\n  That is the ultimate power of Congress. Senator Byrd reminds us of \nthat frequently. The ultimate power of Congress is we pay the bills on \nbehalf of the American people. We appropriate the money.\n  Mr. President, in Grenada, in Panama, Congress played almost no role \nin those military operations. In Lebanon, we heard President Reagan \ndeclare that our military commitment in Lebanon was vital--he used the \nword ``vital'' several times--to our national security interests. \nCongress approved the deployment of U.S. military forces with a time \ncertain to perform an ill-defined and uncertain mission which I \nopposed.\n  It was almost the ultimate backward way of doing things. We put a \ntime certain on completion of the mission but did not define the \nmission. So we ended up with a time certain to perform something that \nno one knew really what it was. That was, I think, a backward way of \ndoing things.\n  To the credit of the Dole-McCain amendment--and I participated in \nhelping draft the final version of that \n\n[[Page S18681]]\namendment--I do think that the current approach is a much better \napproach than we have had in the past in the sense that, at least, we \nmake it clear what the mission is and there is an effort to define an \nexit strategy.\n  We did neither of those things in the Lebanon situation. I voted \nagainst it. But, nevertheless, in Lebanon we witnessed the tragic death \nof hundreds of our marines, uncertain as to why they were there or what \nthey were supposed to do. We saw President Reagan pull the troops out \nof this ``vital'' area overnight. Since then, we paid very little heed \nto events in this so-called vital country.\n  In the Persian Gulf, Congress, without speaking formally, acquiesced \nin the commitment of several hundred thousand ground troops to protect \nSaudi Arabia. We watched without taking any action as President Bush \ndeployed such a large force in November of that year, that its rotation \nwas infeasible, and made international commitments at the same time, or \nvery shortly thereafter, to go to war against Iraq on a date certain. \nThose international commitments to go to war on a date certain were \nwithout congressional approval.\n  By a close vote on the eve of the war, Congress gave President Bush \nthe authority to do what he had committed to do with or without \ncongressional approval.\n  Mr. President, I do not blame the Presidents for acting and \nexercising leadership. They can make mistakes like anyone else. That is \nwhy we have three branches of Government. That is why the Founding \nFathers very carefully separated the right to declare war from the \nCommander in Chief and placed it in the legislative branch of \nGovernment. That is also why all funds have to come from the Congress.\n  So, the President, whether President Bush or President Reagan or \nPresident Clinton, is, when making these decisions, exercising \nExecutive leadership. And they are doing it too many times with a \nvacuum, a void, coming from the Congress in terms of a response.\n  So, it is our job to say what the congressional role is. We put up \nthe money, and it is our job to say what we demand in terms of a role. \nAnd, so far, I do not think we have done it.\n  I believe this is the time for the Congress to acknowledge formally \nwhat is plain for all to see, and that is the War Powers Resolution \ndoes not work. Furthermore, it is not going to work. The longer this \noutmoded and unworkable legislation remains on the books in its present \nform, the longer we will continue the illusion--and it is an illusion--\nthat Congress has a meaningful role in the commitment of U.S. military \nforces to these types of missions.\n  Certainly, we can come along and we can take an action after the \nmission is already well underway to cut off funds. That is always a \nvery difficult, very painful way to do business. We have done that only \non one or two occasions. We did it in Somalia, in effect, and we do not \nthink we should have to rely on that as the way we do business. We may \nhave to do it again, but it is certainly not the desired way for this \nGovernment to function, certainly not in international affairs.\n  No President will allow U.S. forces to be withdrawn from a military \nmission because of congressional inaction, as set forth in the War \nPowers Resolution, nor, in my opinion, should they. The War Powers \nResolution provides that if the President commits forces in a hostile \narea, then Congress, by its inaction, can require those forces be \nbrought home by doing nothing.\n  That has never worked. I voted for the War Powers Resolution. I wish \nnow I had not because it will never work. It is not sensible. It defies \nreason. Congress sitting on its hands requiring a President who has \ncommitted our military forces to a foreign area where they are in \nharm's way--maybe even in a war or conflict--and we do not do anything. \nAnd the War Powers Act presumes the President will then bring them \nhome. That has never worked. It never will work. The longer we continue \nto keep this legislation on the books, the more impotent the Congress \nof the United States will be in exercising its real authority under the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, we should either amend the War Powers Act to make it \nworkable or we should repeal it and replace it with legislation that is \nrealistic and workable. That is long overdue.\n  In the post-cold-war world in which the United States is called on to \nintervene in ethnic, religious and other conflicts in areas that may be \nimportant but less than vital, we must find a way to create regular, \nfrequent and comprehensive consultation between the President and the \nCongress before the President makes concrete commitments and before \nU.S. troops are committed to harm's way.\n  Such consultation can, in theory and in reality, take many forms. My \npreference is the formation of a Congressional Consultation Group, as \nwas proposed almost 7 years ago, by myself, Senator Byrd, Senator \nMitchell, Senator Cohen, Senator Warner, Senator Boren and Senator \nDanforth in a bill to amend the War Powers Resolution. I believe \nSenator Biden from Delaware had a similar resolution which he \nsponsored.\n  Under that bill, the congressional leadership, including the chairmen \nand ranking members of the Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign \nRelations and Intelligence Committees would meet on a regular and \nfrequent basis with the President to discuss real-world situations that \ncould lead to the involvement of the United States forces. Some have \nsuggested having that group meet on a regular basis with the National \nSecurity Council, chaired by the President. It seems to me that thought \nis worthy of pursuit. I certainly believe that would be one form that \nthis could take.\n  But whatever the form of consultation, I believe there also needs to \nbe an attempt to forge an executive-congressional consensus on a set of \nprinciples that will guide the use of United States forces in the \nfuture. This approach starts with the proposition that the United \nStates is the world's only superpower and that we have certain \nresponsibilities that no other nation on earth can fill.\n  Too many times, when we get into a Third World situation or a \nsituation like Bosnia, or a humanitarian mission like Somalia, or a \nmission like Haiti, or a mission in other areas of the world, we \nforget--as our allies urge us to come in and play our role--we forget \nthat we are the only country in the world that can do certain things. \nToo many times our allies forget that, too. They, of course, want us on \nthe scene every time there is a problem.\n  But, Mr. President, we need to keep in mind that we are the only \nnation in the world that can deter the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We are the only nation in the world that can lead and \ncoordinate the worldwide effort to avoid the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction to the Third World and to terrorist groups. We are the only \nnation in the world that can help preserve the stability in Europe by \nthe presence of American forces that, although dramatically reduced in \nnumber, are still very significant in terms of their psychological and \ntheir political impact.\n  We are the only nation in the world that, with our allies in South \nKorea, can deter and defeat the aggression of North Korea or come to \nthe rescue of nations in the Middle East that are the world's primary \nsource of oil.\n  We are the only nation that can perform those key and vital \nfunctions.\n  By our military presence, we are the only nation in the world that \ncan give the Japanese the confidence to resist any urge they might have \nin the future to develop nuclear weapons and go on a real rearmament \nprogram that would have a profoundly destabilizing effect in northeast \nAsia and beyond.\n  And we are the only nation in the world that can keep open the sea \nlanes of communication on which not only our trade but also the trade \nof the world and the economy of the world depend.\n  Mr. President, these are all key functions. That does not mean we \ncannot perform other functions like Bosnia, but it does mean that, when \nwe undertake this kind of mission, we and our allies should understand \nthe United States should not be expected to continue a large ground \nforce in an area like Bosnia for a prolonged period of time, because if \nsomething goes wrong in Korea, if something goes wrong in the Middle \nEast, if something goes wrong elsewhere in the world, who is going to \nplay the role of superpower? There is no one else on the block.\n  I believe we can divide America's interests into three broad \ncategories: one \n\n[[Page S18682]]\nis humanitarian; two is important; and three I would call vital. There \nis other terminology that people might want to use, but I would like to \nstimulate at least some discussion and thought about the areas where \nthe United States may be involved.\n  A humanitarian interest is an interest in which we want to see an \nalleviation of suffering, but where we do not have a significant \nstrategic interest. This includes cases like Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, \nBangladesh, Sudan--places where people are going through tragic turmoil \nand, in many places, actually starving.\n  We see them on television. It brings tears to our eyes. We want to do \nsomething about it, but, in my view, this does not mean we should \nautomatically think about sending military forces. In those cases where \nwe want to alleviate suffering, I think our responsibility--again \nkeeping in mind the other responsibilities we have as a superpower that \nno one else can perform--our responsibility, generally speaking and in \nmost cases, is to say to our allies: we will help you with logistics, \nwe will help you with airlift, we will help you with sealift, we will \nhelp you with intelligence, and we will help you with communications, \nbut we want you to do your job by putting in ground forces where \nnecessary for peacekeeping or peace enforcement purposes. Not only to \nour allies in the traditional sense, but also to nations in the region \nwhere the tragedy is occurring.\n  In other words, on most such occasions, we should do the things only \nwe can do and let others do things they can do.\n  Mr. President, this probably does not meet the definition of a \nnational security strategy, but I believe we need to start thinking \nalong those lines.\n  America cannot deploy military forces in all of these humanitarian \nareas, and when we do, we can get into serious and severe difficulty. \nSomalia is the best example of that.\n  To me, a vital interest is one that we are willing to fight for and, \nif necessary, willing to send our young people off to die for. This is \nan awesome responsibility. There are not many of those interests in the \nworld, by the very definition of that word, and we have to be very \ncareful in designating an area as a place where we have a vital \ninterest. That word ought to be used very carefully.\n  Korea is a place where we have vital interests. Without any doubt, we \nwould fight in Korea, if necessary. We have already demonstrated that. \nWe continue to demonstrate it with the presence of thousands of \nAmerican military forces. We have already demonstrated we have a vital \ninterest in the Middle East in the Persian Gulf war and by the \ndeployment we had--a couple of deployments--just in the last 2 years \nwhen the Iraqis again started threatening Kuwait.\n  Mr. President, we also have had a vital interest in Europe since \nWorld War II, and we continue to have a vital interest in Europe. We \nare a party to the North Atlantic Treaty, which provides for a \ncollective defense in the case of an armed attack against one or more \nof the parties.\n\n  The United States also has entered into bilateral defense treaties \nwith Japan, the Philippines, and the Republic of Korea. We have entered \ninto a multilateral defense treaty with Australia and New Zealand--\nalthough in the latter case, our obligations under that treaty have \nbeen suspended with respect to New Zealand since September of 1986 \nbecause of differences on the question of port visits of nuclear-\npowered warships. Mr. President, under that treaty, we have committed \nto meet the common dangers of an armed attack on our treaty partners in \naccordance with our constitutional processes. That is the case in most \nof these treaties.\n  And, of course, the area Senator Lugar and I have emphasized more \nthan any other in the last 2 or 3 years, and where we have the most \nprofound and difficult national security challenge in the next 10, 20 \nyears, or even longer, is that we have a vital interest in preventing \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--not simply nuclear \nweapons, but chemical as well as biological weapons, which can \nliterally kill tens of thousands of people in an instant. That is also \na vital interest because it could be a direct threat to our Nation and \nto our friends in the world.\n  Now, the most difficult of all of these areas is the third category, \nthe one that fits between vital and humanitarian, and the term that I \nuse is ``important interest.'' An important interest is an interest \nthat is more than a mere humanitarian interest, but does not rise to \nthe level of a vital interest. There are overlaps between these \ncategories. They no longer come in a neat package. The most difficult \ncan be exemplified by Bosnia, where I have long believed we have had an \nimportant interest but not a vital interest. I do believe that we have \na strategic and even a vital interest in preventing that conflict from \nspreading. If it spreads to other areas, then it could indeed become \nvital. When an important but not vital interest becomes a test of NATO \nsolidarity--as has happened in the case of Bosnia--when an important \ninterest becomes a test of United States leadership in NATO and of \nUnited States credibility and commitment in the world, it moves into a \ncategory beyond important. Such is the case in Bosnia.\n  We must also bear in mind when considering the deployment of our \nforces for other than a vital interest that the cumulative impact of \nsuch deployments may interfere with our responsibilities as the world's \nlone superpower in areas which are truly vital to U.S. security and the \nAmerican people.\n  Returning, briefly, to the subject of Executive-Congressional \nconsultation, I note that the majority leader, Senator Dole, introduced \nS. 5, the Peace Powers Act of 1995 earlier this year, which, in part, \nwould have repealed the War Powers Resolution but re-enacted the \nconsultation and reporting provisions of the War Powers Resolution.\n  Mr. President, I also note that the May 1994 White Paper entitled \n``The Clinton Administration's Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace \nOperations,'' stated that the administration would support legislation \nalong the lines of that introduced by myself, Senators Mitchell, Byrd, \nWarner, and Cohen, to amend the War Powers Resolution to introduce a \nconsultative mechanism and to eliminate the 60-day withdrawal \nprovisions.\n  Based upon these developments, Mr. President, I believe it is very \nimportant in the next year that we have a chance to forge a bipartisan \napproach that would meet the needs both of the Congress and of the \nadministration and that would foster a more cooperative approach \nbetween the two branches on important national security decisions. When \nour military forces go into harm's way, they have every right to expect \nthat both the executive branch and the legislative branch have been \ninvolved in the decisionmaking and are behind the mission. That is \nsomething we owe the military men and women who serve in our forces \nabroad.\n  Mr. President, I intend to introduce legislation early next year to \naddress this very important issue. It has been delayed too long in \nterms of dealing with it. I repeat, the longer we pretend that we have \non the books legislation that covers congressional responsibility in \nthis important, crucial area, the longer we deal with an illusion which \nhas no basis in reality. Mr. President, I solicit input from all \nMembers of the Senate on both sides of the aisle on this issue. I hope \nwe can address it before the next crisis arises.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18679-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18682-S18683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

It depends on the meeting, which will take place here in a few \nmoments with White House representatives and Members of the House and \nSenate, on the budget. It is my understanding that if a serious budget \nis proposed and presented by each side, then the House will be prepared \nto send us a short-term continuing resolution that would \n\n[[Page S18683]]\ntake us through at least next Tuesday.

If not, we might be able to \nadvise our colleagues within the next hour as to what the program will \nbe.\n  It is also my hope that on the defense authorization bill, even \nthough the House does not take up the conference report until 4 \no'clock, we might reach some time agreement on that bill to permit us \nto start debate earlier than 5 p.m.--in fact, early afternoon--and we \ncan debate it on Monday and have that vote sometime around 11 o'clock \non Tuesday morning.\n  So what I am suggesting is that if everybody wants to cooperate, we \nmay be able to work it out so there might not be any votes for the \nbalance of the day or on Monday, and a vote will occur on Tuesday at \naround 11. But I cannot make that statement definitely at this time.\n  So that is what we are working on. If my colleagues have ideas or \nobjections or suggestions, I hope they will be in touch with me or \nstaff between now and, say, 12:15.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall speak longer than 5 minutes, but I \ndo not think I will be longer than 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may speak as long as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, \ndeclared, ``The world is my parish.'' In a like fashion, Dr. Richard \nHalverson might have declared that the Senate side of the United States \nCapitol, the city of Washington, DC, and the United States of America \nwere his parish.\n  No one who ever passed Dr. Halverson in the hallways or in the \nstreets of this Federal community had any reason to doubt that Dr. \nRichard Halverson was a man in whom the Light of God's Love shone \nbrightly. From the men and women who clean our offices at night to the \nmen and women who prepare the meals in our dining rooms and cafeterias, \nto the men and women who deliver the mail throughout the office \ncomplexes, to the men and women who police the streets of Capitol Hill, \nto the men and women who serve in the offices of Senators and on the \nelevators and in committee staffs to the men and women who sit on the \nFloor of the United States Senate as elected officials of the fifty \nsovereign States, no one was beyond Dr. Halverson's love, his ministry, \nand his care. If one followed Dr. Halverson throughout his daily \nroutine, one would not find a man more possessed by, as well as \nanimated by, the Capitol Spirit of the Living God. I have met few men \nin any ordained order of the clergy or any denomination, who fit the \nphrase ``Men of God'' so well as did Dr. Halverson.\n  Dr. Richard Halverson was a man of plain speech and honest demeanor. \nHis eloquence was often in his simplicity. No problem brought to him by \none of us or by anyone on Capitol Hill was too small for his attention \nor too menial to call forth from him a prayer or a blessing. Having \ncome from a major Washington parish--The Fourth Presbyterian Church on \nRiver Road--a church numbering among its members thousands--Dr. \nHalverson, on assuming the chaplaincy of the U.S. Senate, shouldered \nhis duties without missing a beat. During his years of service among \nus, he was in much demand nationwide to share his spiritual maturity \nand the depth of his insights with thousands upon thousands of people \nin conferences across our country. In spite of the demand upon his \ntime, however, Dr. Richard Halverson never neglected his primary duty \nhere in the United States Senate. Working as one man among ordinary men \nand women--the men and women elected to the high position of United \nStates Senator, Dr. Halverson seemed to grasp instinctively our needs \nas human beings first and our needs as Senators second. In all of the \nyears of his service here, Dr. Halverson sowed seeds of faith, and \nkindness, and love that will continue to bear fruit in all of our \nlives, and in the life of this institution long after all of us have \ndeparted its halls.\n  I am particularly grateful to Dr. Halverson for the pastoral care \nthat he lent to me personally during the ordeal of the loss of my \nbeloved grandson in a truck accident. And I remember with thankfulness \nhis ministry to my wife during her seasons of illness and debility. And \nI shall never forget the witness that Dr. Halverson shared with me of \nhis own faith as he and I opened our hearts to one another and searched \nthe deeper things of life in sometimes casual conversations or in \nmoments of profound insight. If ever there were a model of the \n``Priesthood of all Believers,'' Dr. Halverson was a priest of that \norder of ``Melchisedec'' spoken of in the Holy Scriptures. Dr. \nHalverson had the enviable ability to share his faith in God as one \nmight recommend to another his Best Friend. For Richard Halverson, God \nwas no abstraction, but the first reality of waking in the morning, \ntraveling forth into the world by day and returning home at night to \nhis slumber.\n\n     I saw the sun sink in the golden west;\n     No angry cloud obscured its latest ray.\n     Around the couch on which it sank to rest\n     Shone all the splendor of a summer day.\n     And long, though lost to view, that radiant light,\n     Reflected from the sky, delayed the night.\n\n     Thus, when a good man's life comes to a close,\n     No doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom,\n     But faith triumphant on each feature glows,\n     And benedictions fill the sacred room.\n     And long do men his virtues wide proclaim,\n     While generations rise to bless his name.\n\n  I have no doubt that Dr. Halverson has indeed now gone to his reward \nin that Eternity for which each of us yearns in his heart of hearts. \nDeath can be no victor over the life of a man like Richard Halverson--a \nman whose daily walk and whose wisdom were rooted in the Eternal Word \nof God. Indeed, as Jesus said, when he saw Nathanael coming to him, we \nmight also say of Dr. Richard Halverson, ``Behold an Israelite in whom \nthere is no guile.''\n  My wife and I extend our deep deepest sympathies to Mrs. Halverson \nand to the family of Dr. Halverson. He was not slick; he was not even \nparticularly polished, perhaps, but neither was the Jesus Christ whom \nhe served. This was not just a vocation, it was an avocation, and what \nyou saw was what you got.\n  As I said to his son after Dr. Halverson's passing, I have no doubt--\nand I had no doubt that Dr. Halverson knew--of his son's grief. I felt \nthat way when my own foster father passed from this earthly life. I \nfelt that way when my grandson was taken at the age of 17. I felt that \nhis spirit still lived, and that he knew of my grief.\n  Dr. Halverson knows today of his family's grief. They can take solace \nin the promise that he still lives, and that they can one day be \nreunited with him.\n\n                    rose still grows beyond the wall\n\n     Near a shady wall a rose once grew,\n       Budded and blossomed in God's free light,\n     Watered and fed by morning dew,\n       Shedding its sweetness day and night.\n\n     As it grew and blossomed fair and tall,\n       Slowly rising to loftier height,\n     It came to a crevice in the wall,\n       Through which there shone a beam of light.\n\n     Onward it crept with added strength,\n       With never a thought of fear or pride.\n     It followed the light through the crevice's length\n       And unfolded itself on the other side.\n\n     The light, the dew, the broadening view\n       Were found the same as they were before;\n     And it lost itself in beauties new,\n       Spreading its fragrance more and more.\n\n     Shall claim of death cause us to grieve,\n       and Make our courage faint or fall?\n     Nay! Let us faith and hope receive:\n       The rose still grows beyond the wall.\n\n     Scattering fragrance far and wide,\n       Just as it did in days of yore,\n     Just as it did on the other side,\n       Just as it will forevermore.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday my good friend and colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Simpson, made some comments, and particularly \nmade reference to the so-called Lautenberg refugee program. Though \nSenator Simpson and I agree on some things and disagree sharply on some \nthings, there is, on balance, mutual respect and I might even say \naffection. So where we disagree on this issue, it is because of a \nperspective on the issue.\n  However, during his presentation on the floor, he used references \nsuch as the so-called Lautenberg refugee bill. He used adjectives like \nderelict or deficient, that this bill was no longer of any value, and I \njust would like to clear the record.\n  Current law, under our immigration code, facilitates the granting of \nrefugee status for certain historically persecuted groups. The existing \nlaw formally recognizes the historic experiences of certain persecuted \nreligious minorities in the Soviet Union and Indochina, and the pattern \nof our denial of refugee status to members of those minorities entitles \nthem to a relaxed standard of proof in determinations about whether \nthey are refugees. The law lowers the evidentiary standard required to \nqualify for refugee status for Evangelical Christians, for Jews from \nthe Soviet Union, certain Ukrainians, and some categories of \nIndochinese.\n  Once a refugee applicant proves that he or she is a member of one of \nthese groups, he or she has to prove a credible basis for concern about \nthe possibility of persecution. Refugee applicants normally must \nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution. The law has had a real \nand positive impact on refugee adjudication for persecuted individuals.\n  In his comments to the Senate yesterday, Senator Simpson said that \nthere is evidence that members of the Russian mafia are using the \nprogram to enter the United States. I want to be perfectly clear that \nthe refugee program was not intended to enable criminals to enter our \ncountry. It was not designed to facilitate entry into the United States \nby those not qualified under the description of refugee status.\n  Further, Mr. President, in my former life I was in the computer \nbusiness and still have a lot of contact there. I have seen many of \nthese people who have come, under the refugee exclusion, into the \ndesign and programming phases of the computer industry, many of them \nentrepreneurs. I have met those who, in a very short period of time, \nhave learned enough of the English language to practice law and become \nphysicians. So we dare not accept one generalization that those who are \nusing the program are principally members of the Russian mafia, that \nthe gangsters are using this, because if they are, then it is not the \nfault of those who are coming.\n  It is my understanding that under United States law an applicant \nshould be denied refugee status if our Government knows that he is a \ncriminal, or for some reason or other is excluded from entry into the \nUnited States. So where does the responsibility lie? It lies with the \nINS or the State Department. They have to do a better job in weeding \nthose people out based on current law.\n  The refugee program was intended to help historically persecuted \nreligious minorities, certainly not criminals.\n  My friend, the Senator from Wyoming, also said the program is no \nlonger necessary because we have good relations with Russia and that \nthe program has been abused. As a matter of fact, I was stunned when I \nheard the Senator from Wyoming describe Russia as our best friend. I \nwould say that is hyperbolic at least. Russia, our best friend? We want \nthem to be a good friend, we want them to be an ally, but certainly one \ncannot say that they are now our best friend and that they are behaving \nlike a democracy as we know it. And although he describes the program \nas being discredited, the fact is that it has served as a useful \nopportunity for those who are very concerned about what is going to \nhappen and what has taken place in terms of their relationship with \nRussia and the former Soviet Union countries.\n\n  There is still a tremendous amount of instability in that area, and \nalthough antiSemitism is no longer officially State sponsored, its \nroots run deep throughout the culture and its effects are felt in \nincidents across Russia and many of the other former Soviet Union \ncountries. And now we are all made abruptly aware that on this coming \nSunday, when elections are going to be held in Russia, there is a \nstrong belief that those who are most likely to win seats are members \nof the Communist Party, avowed reformists. But the fact is we know that \nif people are looking fondly back to electing Communists to Government, \nwith it goes a standard that has been set by those people for decades \nin that area. And so those who have been harassed in the past, who are \nlikely to run into problems are very worried about what the future \nholds.\n  So if there are some who seek to abuse the program, as Senator \nSimpson claims, it is the responsibility of our Government to weed out \nthat abuse. We do not stop collecting taxes in this country if someone \nabuses the Tax Code. What we do is we go after them vigorously. And the \nsame thing is true here. Our Government should eliminate the abuse if \nthere is any in the program. It is not a reason to say that a program \nthat has helped legitimate refugees is discredited.\n  Mr. President, the House version of the State authorization bill \nincludes a 1-year extension of this program, a program that has \nprovided a useful escape valve for historically persecuted people who \ncome to this country and make a contribution to our society. In light \nof existing instability in the former Soviet Union, I believe that this \nprogram ought to be extended for another year. What it takes is our \nconferees in discussion to agree with the House.\n  I hope that will take place to give this program another year to work \nuntil we see what the conditions are going to be like in Russia in \nparticular and some of the other countries of the former Soviet Union.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18684-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18684-S18686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REFUGEES FROM FORMER SOVIET UNION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Immigration Subcommittee, spoke against the Lautenberg \namendment which assists refugees from the former Soviet Union and which \nis reauthorized under the House version of the State Department \nreauthorization bill.\n  I support the amendment because it works. It has facilitated the \nrescue of more than 250,000 persecuted Jews and other minorities from \nthe former Soviet Union since Congress adopted it in 1989. For decades, \nthe United States led the world in seeking the release of the \nrefuseniks and urging freedom of emigration under the Jackson-Vanik \namendment. Having come this far, we should not abandon this historic \ncommitment by bringing this humanitarian program to a premature end.\n  Clearly, major political changes have occurred in the region. The \nSoviet Union is now the former Soviet Union. And most people there \nenjoy greater freedom today than they did a decade ago.\n  But we only need to read the headlines to know that the region \ncontinues to face great upheaval. Jews and other minorities in the \nformer Soviet Union are still the victims of persecution and deep-\nseated hatred and antisemitism.\n  When Senator Simpson and I met with the U.N. High Commissioner for \nRefugees earlier this year, she said she considered the former Soviet \nUnion to be the most explosive part of the world for refugees. And \nvisitors to the region over the past year have discovered alarming \nlevels of anitsemitic persecution.\n  An American delegation to the Ukraine in March found that Jews were \nvictims of an organized harassment campaign. Many Ukrainian Jews \nreceived anonymous notices that read, \n\n[[Page S18685]]\n``We give you the last opportunity to leave our Ukraine. Get out if you \ndon't want to die.'' The fact that Jewish families in the former Soviet \nUnion can be threatened repeatedly, denied employment, have their \nchildren mocked and beaten in school, and receive death notices like \nthis one--all because they are Jews and all with the authorities \nstanding idle--is ample evidence that these families need America's \ncontinuing support to provide a lifeline. That is what the Lautenberg \namendment does.\n  If there are abuses in the program, as Simpson states, we are \nprepared to work with him to address them, and I know that Senator \nLautenberg joins in that commitment.\n  Those who come to the United States under this program are checked \nagainst lookout lists and criminal databases, as are others who seek to \nenter the United States. As in all immigration programs, we deny entry \nto known criminals and any others excludable under the law. The numbers \nrequiring help and rescue under the Lautenberg amendment are declining. \nBut we must not bring this historic help to a hasty and premature end.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles which \ndescribe some of the problems facing Jews in the former Soviet Union be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles are ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Jan. 27, 1995]\n\n            Liberators of Auschwitz Yet To Learn Its Lesson\n\n                           (By Wendy Sloane)\n\n       In the last few years, Alexander Kleiman has witnessed a \n     series of attacks on the Moscow Choral Synagogue, one of only \n     two synagogues left in the capital after a third burned down \n     in unexplained circumstances.\n       Two years ago, vandals smashed several windows of the \n     dilapidated building in central Moscow. This winter, ``Save \n     Russia, Kill the Zhids [a derogatory word for Jews]'' was \n     scrawled in bright paint across the building. A week later, \n     the front facade was shot up with bullets.\n       ``Russians learn to call a Jew a zhid from the moment \n     they're born. Anti-Semitism is in their blood,'' says Mr. \n     Kleiman, the synagogue's chief administrator.\n       ``If the American president and Congress allowed all \n     [Russian] Jews to immigrate,'' he says, ``I can guarantee \n     that 90 percent would leave.''\n       As the world commemorates the 50th anniversary of the \n     Soviet Army's liberation of the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp \n     in Poland today, anti-Semitic sentiments are increasingly \n     common in Russia, and the government is doing little to stem \n     the tide.\n\n\n                            scant attention\n\n       While Russians have complained that the world community has \n     made little mention of the fact that it was largely Russians \n     who liberated the camp, they have done little to commemorate \n     the event themselves.\n       Alla Gerber, a Jewish deputy to the State Duma (lower house \n     of parliament), said no ceremony would have been held in \n     Russia had she not organized an event. Neither President \n     Boris Yeltsin nor his closest aides will attend the \n     ceremonies in Poland.\n       ``The current period of economic crisis, combined with an \n     absence of real power and a spiritual vacuum, is giving rise \n     to fascism and anti-Semitism here,'' says Ms. Gerber, who \n     represents the liberal Russia's Choice parliamentary faction \n     and is one of the few deputies--who are both Jewish and non-\n     Jewish--to speak out against anti-Semitism.\n       ``What will happen depends on how the government decides to \n     use the idea of Russian nationalism, either as a patriotic \n     idea or as a totalitarian fascist one,'' she says.\n       President Yeltsin marked the anniversary Wednesday by \n     rehabilitating millions of gulag prisoners who were \n     imprisoned by Josef Stalin after World War II for suspected \n     collaboration with Nazis. But he did not mention that most of \n     the estimated 1.5 million people who died in the Auschwitz-\n     Birkenau death factory were Jews.\n       In a speech to the United Nations last September, Yeltsin \n     officially condemned anti-Semitism. But he has yet to do so \n     on Russian soil.\n       ``Both the authorities as well as leaders of democratic \n     parties presume that if they make an official statement it \n     will reduce their authority in the eyes of their \n     electorate,'' says Mikhail Chlenov, chairman of the Vaad, an \n     umbrella organization that brings roughly 275 Jewish groups \n     together.\n       ``I would say that anti-Semitism has become an integral \n     part of Russian politics,'' he adds.\n       Politicians ranging from local deputies to ultranationalist \n     Vladimir Zhirinovsky have risen to prominence on anti-Semitic \n     platforms, and some senior bishops in the Russian Orthodox \n     Church routinely accuse Jews of exerting undue influence.\n       Some Jewish leaders have received death threats, and \n     members of anti-Semitic groups are often seen at public \n     rallies, holding placards accusing Zionists of ruining the \n     country as part of a ``Jewish-Masonic conspiracy.''\n\n\n                            a step backward\n\n       Russia has ``returned to a period of anti-Semitism, \n     ultrareactionary [attitudes], and chauvinism, patronized by \n     law-enforcement bodies,'' said Sergei Gryzunov, chairman of \n     Russia's State Press Committee, at an international \n     antifascist forum last week.\n       He referred in particular to the ``huge number'' of legally \n     issued nationalist and chauvinist publications that have \n     sprung up since the Soviet collapse.\n       But Viktor Korchagin, director of the Russian Patriot's \n     Library publishing house, says he has a simple solution to \n     what he terms the ``Jewish question.'' To rid Russia of anti-\n     Semitism, he says, Russia must simply rid itself of its \n     estimated 750,000 Jews.\n       ``We're not advocating the return of pogroms,'' he says, \n     referring to the organized persecution and massacre of Jews \n     in czarist Russia. ``We just want President Yeltsin to decree \n     that all Jews be deported.''\n       Mr. Korchagin insists that he is targeting the ``Jewish \n     mafia''--which in his view includes all government ministers, \n     all of Yelstin's aides, and all the top editors of Russia's \n     major newspapers--not the Jewish people.\n       ``The most powerful mafia in Russia is the Jewish mafia. \n     They steal from the people, but the editors don't write about \n     it because they themselves are all Jews,'' he says. ``If we \n     don't want anti-Semitism to exist in Russia, then all Jews \n     should leave.''\n       According to a poll conducted by the respected National \n     Center For Opinion Research, 45 percent of Russians believe \n     that other nationalities should be expelled, while another 31 \n     percent spoke out against equal rights for other races.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Jewish Advocate, May 12-18, 1995]\n\n                 Synagogue Bombing Rocks Riga Community\n\n                       (By Debra Nussbaum Cohen)\n\n       New York (JTA).--One day before Riga's Jewish community \n     celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II \n     and the Holocaust, a bomber planted explosives at the Latvian \n     city's sole remaining synagogue.\n       The bomb exploded at 4 a.m. local time in the early hours \n     of the Sabbath day, shattering the Peitavas Synagogue's glass \n     windows and light fixtures and ruining its basement \n     sanctuary, according to Mordechai Glazman, one of two \n     Lubavitch rabbis at the synagogue. There were no injuries.\n       Most of the community's Jewish residents, who number \n     between 14,500 and 20,000, think that the bombing is related \n     to what is known in Latvia as the Day of Freedom, which marks \n     the end of the war, Glazman said in a telephone interview \n     from Riga.\n       It is considered an especially significant holiday in the \n     Jewish community, he said.\n       In the wake of the attack, Latvia's president and prime \n     minister made unscheduled visits to the synagogue and Riga's \n     Jewish cemetery to mark the holiday Monday.\n       The officials had originally planned to honor the Latvian, \n     Russian and German soldiers who died in the war at their \n     respective cemeteries, Glazman said.\n       They joined the Jewish community's leaders, Holocaust \n     survivors and Jewish army veterans in a ceremony to honor the \n     dead.\n       Latvia's president, Guntis Ulmanis, put flowers on a mass \n     grave of Jewish soldiers, in the cemeteries and told the \n     hundreds of people gathered that the government would do \n     everything it can to apprehend and punish the perpetrators, \n     Glazman said.\n       ``The prime minister said that it's probably people with an \n     interest in making a bad name for Latvia in the world who did \n     this,'' he said.\n       There has been a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in Riga, \n     the rabbi said.\n       Last week, the police confiscated 1,000 copies of Mein \n     Kampf and arrested the printer, who had produced Adolf \n     Hitler's autobiography in Latvian. Four thousand copies had \n     already been sold, said Glazman, and 5,000 more were \n     scheduled to be printed.\n       Hundreds of the city's Jewish residents visited the \n     synagogue Sunday to witness the damage for themselves.\n       The blast left the first-floor sanctuary, used for worship \n     twice a day, unusable, said the rabbi's wife, Rivki Glazman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Jewish World, Mar. 3-9, 1995]\n\n                 Freedom To Hate Jews in Today's Russia\n\n                            (By Walter Ruby)\n\n       A top leader of ex-Soviet Jews in the United States \n     believes that Jews in Russia face greater peril from an \n     explosion of anti-Semitic violence today than at any time in \n     memory.\n       Leonid Stonov, a longtime refusenik who emigrated to the \n     U.S. in 1990 and today serves as president of the American \n     Association of Russian Jews, told members of the Long Island \n     Committee for Soviet Jewry (LICSJ) that he returned from a \n     recent visit to Moscow fearful that a fascist takeover of \n     Russia may be only weeks or months away.\n       Stonov, a leading representative of the Union of Councils \n     for Soviet Jews, spoke recently by telephone from his home in \n     Chicago with LICSJ members gathered at the North Woodmere \n     home of Murray and Rhoda Dorfman.\n       ``Russia is moving rapidly toward fascism in the same way \n     that Germany did in the 1930s,'' said Stonov, ``and, as in \n     Germany, anti-Semitism is an integral part of the fascist \n     movement.''\n     \n[[Page S18686]]\n\n       According to Stonov, when the Russian State Duma--the lower \n     house of Parliament--held hearings on fascism, \n     ``[ultranationalist leader Vladimir] Zhirinovsky said that \n     the real danger to Russia came from `democratic fascism,' \n     while others spoke of the perils of `Masonic fascism.' Never \n     before in Russia--even during Czarist time--had there been \n     such open, animal expressions of anti-Semitism during \n     parliamentary discussions.''\n       Stonov was speaking to LICSJ members who had gathered to \n     view a screening of Freedom To Hate on WLIW-TV (Channel 21), \n     together with the film's director, Ray Errol Fox. The hour-\n     long documentary, narrated by Dan Rather and introduced by \n     Jack Lemmon, explores the upsurge of anti-Semitism in the \n     former Soviet Union.\n       Freedom To Hate includes extensive interviews with leaders \n     of the neo-Nazi Pamyat movement, discussions of fascism and \n     anti-Semitism with such prominent Russians as poet Yevgeny \n     Yevtushenko and commentator Vladimir Posner, and interviews \n     with Russian Jews victimized by anti-Semitic violence.\n       Though filmed mainly in 1990 and 1991, the documentary \n     closes with a recent scene of Zhirinovsky delivering a \n     menacing speech, showing that the conditions portrayed in the \n     film still exist.\n       Although Stonov noted that the fear of imminent pogroms in \n     1990-1991 has largely abated, he said that ``the situation is \n     far more dangerous for Jews today than it was when this film \n     was being made. In those days, it was only Pamyat . . . a \n     relatively small organization . . . that was openly espousing \n     anti-Semitism. Today in Russia, there are 137 open anti-\n     Semitic newspapers being sold on the streets . . . and the \n     influence of the anti-Semitic organization is growing \n     rapidly.''\n       He added, ``The danger is not only from Zhirinovsky. There \n     is Alexander Barkashov, who heads his own growing anti-\n     Semitic organization with its own private army. Another \n     prominent anti-Semite is Nikolai Lysenko, who argues that \n     Russians should be particularly afraid of Jews who forego \n     involvement in Jewish affairs, but instead are active in \n     Russian politics, business and cultural life.''\n       Lysenko is a former Pamyat member now in the Duma. \n     Zhirinovsky's Liberal-Democratic party won about 25 percent \n     of the vote in the parliamentary elections of 1992.\n       Stonov said he is concerned that with the collapsing \n     popularity of President Boris Yeltsin in the wake of the \n     brutal war in Chechnya, the heir apparent may be former vice \n     president Alexander Rutskoi. Rutskoi was jailed by Yeltsin in \n     October 1993 for inciting to rebellion, but the nationalist-\n     dominated Parliament ordered him set free in early 1994.\n       Stonov noted that Rutskoi, formerly considered sympathetic \n     to Israel and Russian Jewry, has in the past several years \n     forged close political ties with the coalition of former \n     Communists and Russian nationalists who believe Jews are \n     responsible for many of Russia's ills.\n       Asked about Rutskoi's declaration during a 1992 visit to \n     Israel that his mother was Jewish, Stonoff wryly noted that \n     during a visit to Warsaw, the former vice president had also \n     declared his mother to have been Polish, In any event, said \n     Stonov, Rutskoi's comments in Israel were barely mentioned in \n     the Russian media.\n       Queried as to why Russian emigration to Israel has dropped \n     to one third the level of 1990-1991 if the peril to Jews has \n     increased, Stonov responded. ``One might also ask why, after \n     the Los Angeles earthquake, people began rebuilding their \n     houses.\n       ``Many of the Jews who have remained in Russia have deep \n     psychological roots there. Others have gone into business in \n     Russia. They don't want to believe the situation there will \n     end like it did in Germany. Still, with the rapid worsening \n     of the situation, I am expecting a major new wave of \n     emigration.''\n       In the wake of Yeltsin's Chechnya misadventure and \n     increasing movement toward the right, Stonov contended that \n     ``the political situation in Russia is dramatically changing \n     for the worse and the West seems to be unaware of what is \n     happening. America doesn't seem to understand that the \n     democratic order in Russia is again under threat.\n       ``I think the Clinton administration should be pressing the \n     Russian government to move faster toward a market economy,'' \n     continued Stonov. ``Credits should be given to Russia only if \n     real privatization is carried out there. When the West gives \n     credits without privatization, all the money just ends up in \n     Swiss bank accounts.''\n       While attending an anti-fascist forum during his Moscow \n     visit, Stonov found that all the democratic leaders feel \n     extremely threatened by what is happening. ``[Human Rights \n     Commissioner] Sergei Kovalyov had very sad words. He said, \n     `We Russians are ruled by scum and we are scum for allowing \n     that to happen.' ''\n       Noting that Yeltsin has never directly denounced anti-\n     Semitism in Russia, Stonov said, ``Anti-Semitism is \n     flourishing as never before, in part because there are no \n     official constraints.'' He added, ``If there were free \n     elections tomorrow, the fascists would probably not win in \n     Moscow, but they would do very well in provincial areas like \n     the Urals, parts of Siberia, and Krasnodar in southern \n     Russia. The political position of the fascists is very \n     strong, and they are now in a position to stimulate a pogrom \n     from the podium in the State Duma.''\n       Stonov praised Freedom to Hate as ``a very important work \n     that will hopefully help to get across the message of how \n     perilous the situation of Jews in the former Soviet Union \n     really is.''\n       But, he said to the LICSJ group, he has had a hard time \n     getting the film screened. ``Many people, including prominent \n     Jews, have accused me of exaggerating the situation.\n       ``Despite everything that has happened recently, there is \n     still a kind of euphoria in this country among American Jews \n     about the situation in Russia.\n       ``The way that I present the situation is intense,'' said \n     Fox, ``but everything I show is true. I don't know how else \n     to show the situation in order to get the message across.''\n       Lynn Singer, longtime executive director of LICSJ, \n     remarked, ``All people of good will need to redouble our \n     efforts to get out the word about the deadly peril facing \n     Jews in the former Soviet Union.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke here about the Interior \nconference legislation. I talked some about the issue of child abuse, \nparticularly with respect to native Americans, and about some of the \ndifficulties that I have witnessed and held some hearings about.\n  I described Tamara DeMaris, who was placed in a foster home at age 3 \nand severely beaten. Her nose was broken, her arm was broken, her hair \npulled out by the roots. Why? Because one person was handling 150 cases \nand did not have time to check where they were putting this 3-year-old \nkid, so this poor 3-year-old was put in an unsafe foster home where \ndrunken brawls ensued and this child was beaten severely.\n  We need to do better than this. That was the point I was making \nyesterday. Children cannot deal for themselves. They are not \nresponsible for themselves. We are responsible to help children in this \ncountry who are helpless, to give hope to children who are hopeless. It \nis our responsibility.\n  I read a few days ago a piece in Time magazine that I wish to read to \nthe Senate, not in its entirety, but I would ask all of you to read the \narticle in its entirety, because it, too, relates to the question of \nwhat are we doing to protect children in this country. I am not talking \nabout the children that go to bed safe and secure at night in a good \nhome, that is warm, having just had a good meal. I am talking about \nchildren who come from circumstances of poverty and neglect and abuse, \nand who cannot help themselves.\n  On the cover of Time magazine was a picture of a young girl named \nElisa Izquierdo. Let me read part of the magazine article to you \nbecause it describes something we all must understand--behind all of \nthese discussions about policies and numbers are people, some of whom \nare desperately reaching out for help.\n  ``Little Elisa Izquierdo liked to dance, which is almost too \nperfect,'' the article says, this article written by David Van Biema in \nthe December 11 Time magazine. It says:\n\n       Fairy tales, especially those featuring princesses, often \n     include dancing, although perhaps not Elisa's favorite \n     merengue. Fairy-tale princesses are born humble. Elisa fit \n     that bill: she was conceived in a homeless shelter in the \n     Fort Greene section of Brooklyn and born addicted to crack. \n     That Elisa nevertheless had a special, enchanted aura is \n     something that the whole city of New York now knows. \n     ``Radiant,'' said one of her preschool teachers, remembering \n     a brilliant smile and flashing black eyes. ``People loved \n     her,'' adds another. ``Everybody loved her.'' And, unlikely \n     as it may seem, there was even a prince in Elisa's life: a \n     real scion of Greece's old royalty named Prince Michael, who \n     was a patron of the little girl's preschool. He made a \n     promise to finance her full private school education up to \n     college, which is about as happily ever after as this age \n     permits.\n       Fairy tale princesses, however, are not bludgeoned to death \n     by their mothers. They are not violated with a tooth brush \n     and a hair brush, and the neighbors do not hear them moaning \n     and pleading at night. Last week, two months before her \n     seventh birthday, Elisa Izquierdo lay in her casket, \n     wearing a crown of flowers. The casket was open, which was \n     an anguished protest on someone's part; no exertion of the \n     undertaker's art could conceal all Elisa's wounds. Before \n     she smashed her daughter's head against a cement wall, \n     Awilda Lopez told police, she had made her eat her own \n     feces and used her head to mop the floor. All this over a \n     period of weeks, or maybe months. The fairy tale was \n     ended.\n\n\n[[Page S18687]]\n\n  This is a story of desperation and a story of one murder. Twenty-\nthree thousand people are murdered in this country every year. This \nlittle 6-year-old girl is one, murdered by her mother. But let me read \nsome of the description of what the girl went through. The reason I am \ndescribing this is that we failed, the system failed, the child welfare \nagency failed, and the programs failed to help this girl.\n\n       ``Drugs, drugs, drugs--that's all she was interested in,'' \n     says neighbor Doris Sepulveda, who watched the Lopezes trying \n     to sell a child's tricycle outside their building. Another \n     neighbor, Eric Latorre, recalls seeing the whole family out \n     at 2 a.m. as Awilda [the mother] sought crack. . . . [Her \n     mother] reportedly had come to believe that little Elisa, \n     whom she called a mongoloid and a filthy little whore, had \n     been put under a spell by her father--a spell that had to be \n     beaten out of the child. Neighbors, some of whom say they \n     called the authorities, later told the press of muffled \n     moaning and Elisa's voice pleading, ``Mommy, mommy, please \n     stop! No more! No more! I'm sorry!'' Law-enforcement \n     authorities have provided a reason for those cries: they say \n     Elisa was repeatedly sexually assaulted with a toothbrush and \n     a hairbrush. When her screams became too loud, [her mother] \n     simply turned up the radio.\n       Elisa stopped attending school, and neighbors say they saw \n     less and less of her. On November 15, Carlos Lopez was jailed \n     again for violating his parole agreement. On November 22, the \n     day before Thanksgiving, all that was twisted in Awilda \n     apparently snapped. One of her sisters, quoted in the New \n     York Times, reported a chilling phone conversation with her \n     that night: ``She told me that Elisa was like retarded on the \n     bed, not eating or drinking or going to the bathroom. I said, \n     'Take her to the hospital, and I'll take care of your other \n     kids.' She said she would think about it after she finished \n     the dishes.''\n       The next morning Awilda called Francisco Santana, a \n     downstairs neighbor. ``She was crying, `I can't believe it, \n     tell me it's not true,' '' he says. When he arrived at her \n     apartment, she showed him Elisa's motionless body. He put his \n     hand to the child's cold forehead, pronounced her dead and \n     spent the next two hours pleading with Awilda to call the \n     police. When he finally called himself, he says, she ran to \n     the apartment roof and had to be restrained from jumping. \n     When the police arrived, she confessed to killing Elisa by \n     throwing her against the concrete wall. She confessed that \n     she had made Elisa eat her own feces and that she had mopped \n     the floor with her head. The police told reporters that there \n     was no part of the six-year-old's body that was not cut or \n     bruised. Thirty circular marks that at first appeared to be \n     cigarette burns turned out to be impressions left by the \n     stone in someone's ring. ``In my 22 years,'' says Lieutenant \n     Luis Gonzalez, [the police lieutenant], ``this is the worst \n     case of child abuse I have ever seen.''\n       . . . an aspect of the tragedy's aftermath [according to \n     this magazine article] . . . has also dumbfounded the [people \n     of New York who shared in this tragedy]. The people of New \n     York could do nothing about Awilda's drug-induced delusions \n     or her timid neighbors. But they wanted an accounting from \n     the CWA [Child Welfare Agency].\n\n  This story describes report after report after report that was made \nto the Child Welfare Agency.\n\n       Instead, Executive Deputy Commissioner [of the Child \n     Welfare Agency] Kathryn Croft has steadfastly maintained that \n     the state confidentiality laws designed to protect \n     complainants prevent her from revealing any details of the \n     case. Thus the public may never know how many cries for help \n     the agency actually recorded or what it did about them. It \n     may never know whether the CWA really made an extended effort \n     to observe Awilda before [returning that child to this \n     mother].\n\n  Mr. President, I have not read all of this article, but it is \nsufficient to describe what happens to some children in this country. I \ndescribed several of them yesterday. This is another, a little 6-year-\nold girl from New York who was failed by our system.\n  I am investigating at the moment to find out why a child welfare \nagency would not be willing to disclose what exists in these files. Who \ncontacted them? When did they contact them? Who failed this child? Who \ndid not follow up? Why did they not take this child away from a mother \nwho was torturing her? Why is this child dead?\n  Confidentiality laws apply to protect people from disclosure of \nsensitive information about a family that is dealt with by the child \nwelfare agency. It is not a confidentiality statute designed to protect \nthe agency from an investigation. I am trying to find out what kind of \nFederal circumstances exist that can pry open the child welfare \nagency's records to find out, how did this happen?\n  At the end of this story, it describes again a common problem. It \ndescribes city, State, and Federal Government budgets that have cut \none-sixth from the child welfare agency's budget. The head of the child \nwelfare agency estimates that her caseworkers' caseload is going up. \nThey simply cannot do enough investigations.\n  It is what I described yesterday. The caseload on the reservation in \nNorth Dakota was so high that the social worker who was in charge of \nthose cases put Tamara DeMaris, a young and innocent 3-year-old girl, \nin a home where she was beaten severely, in a foster home that was not \nsafe. Here, we have a caseload apparently that does not permit a \nwelfare agency to deal with issues of life or death for 6-year-old \ngirls in New York City.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong. The reason I bring this to \nthe floor is because we are talking about all of these spending areas, \nall of these areas of Federal spending, and we get phone calls and my \ncolleagues get phone calls saying we have got to cut Federal spending. \nI do not disagree with that. We have to balance the budget. I do not \ndisagree with that.\n  Does anybody in this Chamber under any circumstances, or any anybody \nin any State legislature or in any city council, believe that a 6-year-\nold does not deserve the protection that society must give her when she \nis being sexually abused and beaten, and, yes, threatened with murder? \nDoes anybody believe that is not our responsibility?\n  This country fails these children when we do not decide to debate \nthese kinds of issues in the context of what we must do to protect \nthese kids? It is not a question of anybody that thinks it does not \nmatter or whether you have enough social workers to protect these \nchildren. In my judgment, we are not doing any service to public \nservice in this country. We must, it seems to me, ask the question: How \ndo we do this job? Not whether, but how do we do this job? What does it \ntake to make sure we protect these children?\n  I hope everyone reads this article. There are dozens and dozens and \ndozens of cases like this all over the country. My only point is, we \ncan do much better and must do much better. When systems fail, we must \nfind out why. When children, innocent victims, find themselves in \ncircumstances like this, someone ought to be willing to stand up and \nassume responsibility, to say we are going to help.\n  I told the Senate yesterday about a stack of folders on a floor, \nwhere I saw reports of sexual and physical abuse against children on an \nIndian reservation that had not even been investigated because they did \nnot have the investigators to go out and investigate. I was appalled, \njust appalled to understand that in that stack is a young child living \nin a circumstance where they have been sexually molested. There is an \nallegation of sexual misconduct or allegation of physical misconduct by \na guardian, and it has not even been investigated. We must do better \nthan that.\n  I hope that as we discuss and think our way through this notion of \nhow do we balance the budget, we ask, what are our priorities? Is it B-\n2 bombers, is it the school lunch program, is it a dozen or 100 \ndifferent things? I hope none of us will ever decide that it is \ndiscretionary on our part whether we protect children like Elisa.\n  Elisa did not have to die. We failed. We all failed Elisa, and I hope \nas we develop our priorities for the years ahead, we will decide, at \nthe very least, that those who cannot help themselves, those children \nin harm's way, those children whose lives are threatened deserve and \nrequire our help. I hope there is no disagreement on any side of the \npolitical aisle on that question.\n  I recognize the Senator from Minnesota has been waiting. I appreciate \nvery much his indulgence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Time, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n                         Abandoned to Her Fate\n\n                          (By David Van Biema)\n\n       Elisa Izquierdo liked to dance, which is almost too \n     perfect.

The casket was open, which was an anguished \n     protest on someone's part; no exertion of the undertaker's \n     art could conceal all Elisa's wounds. Before she smashed her \n     daughter's head against a cement wall, Awilda Lopez told \n     police, she had made her eat her own feces and used her head \n     to mop the floor. All this over a period of weeks, or maybe \n     months. The fairy tale was ended.\n       America dotes on fairy tales and likes to think it takes \n     action on nightmares. When the story of Elisa's death hit the \n     news last week, New Yorkers and people across the \n     country remembered the Kitty Genovese murder in 1964, and \n     took to task all the neighbors who had known too much and \n     said nothing. But, it turned out, many others had not been \n     silent: Elisa's slow, tortured demise had been reported \n     repeatedly. Over the six years of her life, city \n     authorities had been notified at least eight times. And so \n     outrage focused on the child-welfare system. How did it \n     happen, the public wondered angrily, that Elisa's case was \n     known to the system, and yet the system so shamefully \n     failed her?\n       The Child Welfare Administration, which handles cases of \n     abuse in New York City, first heard of Elisa on Feb. 11, \n     1989, the day of her birth. Her mother was a crack addict \n     whose addition was indirectly responsible for her pregnancy: \n     she had lost her apartment, and in Brooklyn's Auburn Place \n     homeless shelter she began a romance with Gustavo Izquierdo, \n     who worked at the shelter as a cook. As her pregnancy \n     progressed, Awilda was so lost in the pipe that relatives \n     managed to wrest custody of her first two children, Rubencito \n     and Kasey, from her. The social workers at Woodhull Hospital \n     took one look at Elisa's tiny, crack-addicted body and \n     immediately assigned custody to the father. Following \n     standard procedure, they also alerted the CWA.\n       Perhaps to his own surprise, Izquierdo--who had emigrated \n     from Cuba hoping to teach dance--turned out to be a wonderful \n     father. At first there were panicky calls to female \n     acquaintances about diapers and formula, but eventually he \n     mastered the basics. Every morning he would iron a dress for \n     Elisa and put her beautiful hair into braids or pigtails. \n     When she was four, he rented a Queens banquet hall for a \n     party marking her baptism. Says a friend, Mary Crespo: ``She \n     was his life. He would always say Elisa was his princess.''\n       It was through her father's efforts that the princess found \n     her prince. Izquierdo took parenting classes at the local \n     YWCA, and he enrolled one-year-old Elisa in the Y's \n     Montessori preschool. She was a favorite pupil. Says the \n     school's then director, Phyllis Bryce: ``She was beautiful, \n     radiant. She had an inner strength and a lot of potential for \n     growth.'' So fond of both father and daughter were the \n     Montessori staff members that when Izquierdo fell behind on \n     tuition, they recommended his daughter to Prince Michael of \n     Greece.\n       Michael will probably never ascend his country's throne, \n     since the monarchy was abolished in 1974. But he still \n     dispenses royal charity. After an aide established a \n     connection with the Montessori school, the faculty introduced \n     Michael to Elisa. On the day he arrived in Brooklyn, he would \n     later remember, ``[Elisa] jumped into my arms. She was a \n     lively, charming, beautiful girl. She was so full of love.'' \n     The prince visited several times, bringing stuffed animals or \n     clothes; the little princess responded with thank-you notes \n     and pictures. Michael's most handsome offer arrived in late \n     1993: he would pay Elisa's full tuition, through 12th grade, \n     at the Brooklyn Friends School.\n       In 1991 Awilda petitioned for, and was granted, \n     unsupervised visitation rights with her daughter. The mother \n     had already regained custody of her two older children; she \n     seemed to have effected a miraculous recovery. In December \n     1990 social workers signed an affidavit stating that she had \n     given up drugs, married a man named Carlos Lopez and settled \n     at a permanent address. ``Both [Lopezes] are willing to go \n     for random drug tests,'' the affidavit read. ``They never \n     miss appointments with the agency, and they are always on \n     time. Mr. Lopez is supportive . . . He appears to be gentle \n     and understanding.''\n       That last was a grave misjudgment. Carlos Lopez, who did \n     maintenance work, was solicitous only in public. At night \n     neighbors heard dishes, pots and pans crashing against walls. \n     In January 1992, a month after Awilda gave birth to his \n     second child, Carlos stabbed her 17 times with a pocketknife, \n     putting her in the hospital for three days. According to a \n     neighbor, the attack occurred in front of Elisa, during a \n     weekend visit. Carlos served two months in jail and then, \n     neighbors say, resumed beating his wife--and his visiting \n     stepdaughter.\n       Elisa's life became an excruciating alternation of \n     happiness and horror. The four-year-old took the Friends \n     School's screening examination and passed. But according to \n     Montessori teacher Barbara Simmons, she also began telling \n     people that her mother had locked her in a closet. On one \n     occasion she volunteered, ``Awilda hits me. I don't want to \n     go to Awilda.'' Montessori principal Bryce says she reported \n     suspected abuse to both the Brooklyn Bureau of Community \n     Services and a child-abuse hot line--the CWA's second \n     warning about Elisa. In response, Bryce has said, child-\n     welfare workers made several visits to the Lopez home, \n     ``and then stopped, as they usually do.''\n       Izquierdo apparently knew about the mistreatment. A \n     neighbor told the New York Times that Elisa would wake up \n     screaming in the night, that although toilet trained, she had \n     begun to urinate and defecate uncontrollably and that there \n     were cuts and bruises on her vagina. In 1992 Izquierdo \n     petitioned the family court to deny Awilda custodial rights, \n     but fate intervened before the court could act on his \n     request. By late 1993, already ill with cancer, he was \n     planning to take Elisa to Cuba, and perhaps hoping to leave \n     here there permanently. Tickets were bought, but he became \n     too ill to travel and on May 26 Izquierdo died.\n       Awilda immediately filed for permanent custody. A cousin of \n     Izquierdo's, Elsa Canizares, challenged the petition, \n     alleging that Lopez was insane and abused the child. Bryce \n     wrote in a letter to family court judge Phoebe Greenbaum that \n     ``Elisa was emotionally and physically abused during the \n     weekend visitations with her mom. Teachers' observation notes \n     are available.'' Bryce also enlisted the help of Prince \n     Michael, who added his own letter.\n       Canizares arrived for the June 1994 custody hearing alone. \n     Awilda, by contrast, brought a small army. Her lawyer that \n     day was from the Legal Aid Society, which maintained that its \n     caseworkers had visited the Lopezes and found that ``Elisa \n     expressed a strong desire to live with her mother'' and her \n     siblings. Also backing Awilda was the CWA, which Judge \n     Greenbaum has indicated had been monitoring the family for \n     more than a year--the agency's third contact with Elisa. \n     Finally there was Project Chance, a federally funded \n     parenting program for the poor run by a man named Bart \n     O'Connor.\n       When O'Connor met her in 1992, Awilda had seemed ``an \n     easily excitable woman,'' but one who was ``very lively, very \n     vibrant and loved her children beyond belief.'' She dutifully \n     attended parenting classes and sought extra advice. There \n     were setbacks, during which she returned to drugs and \n     abandoned the children. But she recovered--``The kids seemed \n     happy, and the house was immaculate.'' When Awilda asked \n     O'Connor to help her get Elis back, he had his doubts: ``She \n     was just learning to handle five kids. I thought another kid \n     might be too much.'' But, after all, he had just given her a \n     progress award, so he vouched for her to the court. In \n     September Judge Greenbaum awarded full custody to Awilda, \n     directing the CWA to observe the family for a year. Last \n     week, hounded by the press, Greenbaum released a statement \n     that read in part, ``It is any judge's worst nightmare to be \n     involved in a case in which a child dies.''\n       Especially, it can be assumed, when a child dies slowly, by \n     torture. In September, Awilda removed Elisa from the \n     Montessori school and enrolled her in Manhattan's Public \n     School 26. The Daily News reports that on arrival, she \n     seemed a fairly happy girl, one who shared make-believe \n     bus trips with other children during lunch hour. But she \n     soon folded up into herself. The school's principal and \n     social worker, noting that she was often bruised and had \n     trouble walking, reported the matter directly to a deputy \n     director of CWA's Manhattan field division, in what would \n     be CWA's fourth notification. School district spokesman \n     Andrew Lachman says the official allegedly replied that \n     the case was ``not reportable'' owing to insufficient \n     evidence. School staff then visited the Lopez apartment. \n     To their surprise, Awilda ``was very happy to see them,'' \n     says Lachman, and there were no signs of abuse.\n       O'Connor, however, was regretting his recommendation to the \n     judge. He received a series of hysterical phone calls from \n     Awilda complaining that Elisa was soiling herself and \n     drinking from the toilet and had cut off her hair. Finally \n     she asked O'Connor to take Elisa away. Convinced the girl's \n     symptoms had existed prior to her contact with Awilda but \n     were now driving her mother over the edge, he rushed to the \n     apartment. ``You could smell urine and see she had defecated \n     everywhere,'' he says. ``Her toys were thrown around. There \n     were feces smeared on the refrigerator.''\n       O'Connor claims he called Elisa's CWA caseworker, who told \n     him he was ``too busy'' to come by. Moreover, O'Connor says \n     the caseworker never responded to this fifth appeal to CWA, \n     despite repeated subsequent calls. O'Connor took the Lopezs \n     to a city hospital for psychiatric counseling, and Awilda \n     seemed to calm down somewhat. To O'Connor's dismay however, \n     she repeatedly avoided signing a release that would allow him \n     to send his observations to the city agency. By last July she \n     had dropped out of touch entirely.\n       There was a reason for that. ``Drugs, drugs, drugs--that's \n     all she was interested in,'' says neighbor Doris Sepulveda, \n     who watched the Lopezes trying to sell a child's tricycle \n     outside their building. Another neighbor, Eric \n\n[[Page S18689]]\n     Latorre, recalls seeing the whole family out at 2 a.m. as Awilda sought \n     crack. Awilda had reportedly come to believe that Elisa, whom \n     she called a mongoloid and filthy little whore, had been put \n     under a spell by her father--a spell that had to be beaten \n     out of the child. Neighbors, some of whom say they called the \n     authorities, later told the press of muffled moaning and \n     Elisa's voice pleading, ``Mommy, Mommy, please stop! No more! \n     No more! I'm sorry!'' Law-enforcement authorities have \n     provided a reason for those cries: they say Elisa was \n     repeatedly sexually assaulted with a toothbrush and a \n     hairbrush. When her screams became too loud, Awilda turned up \n     the radio.\n       Elisa stopped attending school, and neighbors say they saw \n     less and less of her. On Nov. 15, Carlos Lopez was jailed \n     again for violating his parole agreement. And on Nov. 22, the \n     day before Thanksgiving, all that was twisted in Awilda \n     apparently snapped. One of her sisters, quoted in the New \n     York Times, reported a chilling phone conversation with her \n     that night: ``She told me that Elisa was like retarded on the \n     bed, not eating or drinking or going to the bathroom. I said, \n     `Take her to the hospital, and I'll take care of your other \n     kids.' She said she would think about it after she finished \n     the dishes.''\n       The next morning Awilda called Francisco Santana, a \n     downstairs neighbor. ``She was crying, `I can't believe it, \n     tell me it's not true,'' ' he says. When he arrived at her \n     apartment, she showed him Elisa's motionless body. He put his \n     hand to the child's cold forehead, pronounced her dead and \n     spent the next two hours pleading with Awilda to call the \n     police. When he finally called himself, he says, she ran to \n     the apartment roof and had to be restrained from jumping. \n     When the police arrived, she confessed to killing Elisa by \n     throwing her against a concrete wall. She confessed that she \n     had made Elisa eat her own feces and that she had mopped the \n     floor with her head. The police told reporters that there was \n     no part of the six-year-old's body that was not cut or \n     bruised. Thirty circular marks that at first appeared to be \n     cigarette burns turned out to be impressions left by the \n     stone in someone's ring. ``In my 22 years,'' said Lieut. Luis \n     Gonzalez, ``this is the worst case of child abuse I have ever \n     seen.''\n       O'Connor sits in his Brooklyn office and fields calls from \n     the media. ``We made a mistake,'' he says grimly. ``We will \n     try to make sure this never happens again.'' Looking back, he \n     says, ``I should have thrown bombs in the CWA's doorway.'' \n     The initials themselves infuriate him. At least, he says, \n     ``we will say our mea culpa. We're not going to run behind \n     confidentiality laws and not admit we've made a mistake.''\n       He is referring to an aspect of the tragedy's aftermath \n     that has dumbfounded the city. The people of New York could \n     do nothing about Awilda's drug-induced delusions or her timid \n     neighbors. But they wanted an accounting from the CWA. \n     Instead, Executive Deputy Commissioner Kathryn Croft has \n     steadfastly maintained that state confidentiality laws \n     designed to protect complainants prevent her from revealing \n     any details of a case. Thus the public may never know how \n     many cries for help the agency actually recorded or what it \n     did about them. It may never know whether the CWA really made \n     an extended effort to observe Awilda before making a \n     recommendation to Judge Greenbaum--or whether a caseworker \n     was really ``too busy'' to return a call.\n       What the public could surmise, however, was that something \n     was amiss. Last week someone leaked an Oct. 10 letter from \n     CWA Commissioner Croft to Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, complaining \n     that city staff cuts make it impossible for her to train \n     child-abuse caseworkers or even measure their competence. And \n     that is the least of it. The city, state and Federal \n     Government have cut one-sixth from CWA's $1.2 billion budget. \n     While Croft estimates her average staff member's case load at \n     16.9, some workers at the agency's Queens branch put theirs \n     at 25, a number that almost precludes meaningful long-term \n     investigations. ``There are no bodies available to do the \n     work,'' says Bonnie Buford, a supervisor in a Queens child-\n     protective-services unit. Claims Gail Nayowith, executive \n     director of the Citizens' Committee for Children: ``Case \n     loads are rising. Investigations take longer, and some very \n     important programs don't exist . . . This child and her \n     family should have got services. With appropriate \n     interventions, services and follow-up, [Elisa] would be \n     alive.''\n       But she is not alive. At her funeral, the Rev. Gianni \n     Agostinelli told mourners that ``Elisa was not killed only by \n     the hand of a sick individual, but by the impotence of \n     silence of many, by the neglect of child-welfare institutions \n     and the moral mediocrity that has intoxicated our \n     neighborhoods.'' Later, Elisa was laid to rest in the Cypress \n     Hills Cemetery in Queens. There had been discussion about her \n     body: the Izquierdo side of her family wanted to determine \n     its fate, but so did the Lopez side. And it seems that \n     mortuaries, like city bureaucracies, have rules for such \n     situations. Regardless of the circumstances, the custody of \n     the body goes to the mother.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit this afternoon \nabout budget numbers and budget dollars.\n  To hear the talk on Capitol Hill, you would think that Christmas came \nearly this week and that the Congressional Budget Office was playing \nthe part of Santa Claus, because on Monday, the CBO released its \nrevised revenue predictions for the next 7 years, producing an \nunexpected $135 billion windfall over the life of our 7-year plan to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  And would you not know it, like kids let loose under a package-packed \nChristmas tree, President Clinton and Congress are scrambling to snatch \nup the dollars for their own holiday spending spree.\n  Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to be the Grinch Who Stole \nChristmas, but let's take a step back and ask ourselves just what we're \ndoing here. We've got a deficit today of $164 billion and a national \ndebt of nearly $5 trillion.\n  We are dangerously overextended on the Government's credit card. Yet \nwhen the revenue forecast says we will have $135 billion more than we \nthought we would have by the year 2002, what are we thinking when the \nfirst thing we want to do is rush out and squander it on a taxpayer \nfinanced holiday spending spree?\n  If that is how this Congress is going to conduct itself, we are no \nbetter than the 40 years of past Congresses that got us into this \nfiscal mess to begin with.\n  Where is the commitment to changing Washington's free-spending ways \nwe like to brag about to our constituents back home? What kind of \nmessage does this send to the taxpayers, who entrusted their dollars--\ntheir hard-earned tax dollars--to us in the first place?\n  Anybody can spend a dollar, Mr. President, or in the case of \nCongress, a great, great many of them. But it takes discipline to save \nthose same dollars, and what I am seeing today is a disturbing lack of \nthe kind of discipline it will take to finally balance the budget.\n  What should we do with the $135 billion found by the CBO? Exactly \nwhat legislation introduced last week by myself and my good friend, \nSenator McCain, instructs us to do: lock it away on behalf of the \ntaxpayers for deficit reduction or additional tax relief.\n  The Taxpayer Protection Lockbox Act of 1995 precisely spells out the \nprocess Congress must undertake when actual Federal revenues exceed \npredictions. Our legislation ends the abuse of taxpayer dollars and \nreturns honesty to the budget process by creating a new revenue \nlockbox.\n  As we all know, Congress acknowledges the CBO as Government's voice \nof authority when it comes to accurate, conservative, nonpartisan \neconomic projections.\n  Congress relies on those CBO projections when we estimate the amount \nof tax revenues that will come into the Treasury over the life of our \n7-year balanced budget plan, and then we use those revenue estimates to \ndetermine the extent to which Federal spending can grow without \nresulting in a budget deficit in the year 2002.\n  While these estimates by the Congressional Budget Office are \ngenerally on the mark, they are only estimates, of course, and the \nrevised forecast issued by the CBO this week illustrates the inherent \nproblem with forecasts: Changing conditions mean forecasts need to be \nupdated.\n  And as we move closer to a balanced budget, they will need further \nupdating to take into account the additional dollars our balanced \nbudget plan will generate for the Treasury. After all, we are including \ntax relief designed to stimulate economic growth, create new jobs, and \nturn tax users into productive taxpayers.\n  Any additional dollars, however, should not be used to feed Congress' \nappetite for spending. Instead, any additional revenue that results \nfrom our balanced budget plan ought to be returned to the taxpayers in \nthe form of tax relief or deficit reduction.\n  These dollars were born of the hard work and productivity of the \nAmerican people--it makes sense to give those dollars back to the \ntaxpayers and encourage even greater productivity.\n  And that is just what our revenue lockbox does. It requires that any \nrevenues above and beyond current estimates be used for tax cuts and/or \ndeficit reduction.\n  It ensures taxpayers that their hard-earned dollars will no longer be \nautomatically spent by Congress, ending \n\n[[Page S18690]]\nthe misguided notion here in the beltway that tax dollars belong to the \nGovernment, rather than the taxpayers.\n  Imagine the dramatic deficit reduction we could achieve if, instead \nof plowing the CBO's $135 billion into more social spending, against \nthe wishes of the taxpayers, we dedicated it toward eliminating the \ndeficit.\n  How much sooner would we balance the budget and start down the road \ntoward a debt-free future for our children and grandchildren if we \ninvested that $135 billion in their future, and not on another quick \nfix for the big spenders in Washington?\n  After all, if the politicians have their way, how much of that $135 \nbillion will truly be spent meeting needs, and not simply offering \ndessert?\n  Or imagine what we could do for the taxpayers of this Nation--who \nhave been forced every year to finance the political agenda of a \nCongress that simply never learned to say ``no''--if we handed them \nback that $135 billion in the form of tax relief?\n  Have we forgotten that it is their money to begin with, not the \nGovernment's? Mr. President, it is as if you and a friend were walking \ndown the street and happened across a wallet plump with cash. For most \nof us, there is no moral dilemma--it is not our money.\n  We would return it to its rightful owner, no questions asked. Well, \nthere is apparently no moral dilemma for Congress, either--it would \nspend the money, even $135 billion dollars, long before the wallet's \nowner even realized it was missing.\n  By dedicating it toward tax cuts, Congress could do a lot of good \nwith the CBO's $135 billion in unexpected revenue. What about expanding \nthe tax relief provisions already called for in our Balanced Budget \nAct?\n  We could make the $500 per child tax credit be retroactive back to \nJanuary 1, 1995, and help offset the devastating effects of President \nClinton's retroactive tax increase in 1993.\n  We could make the $500 per-child tax credit refundable against \npayroll tax liability, enabling lower-income, working Americans the \nopportunity to keep more of the dollars they so desperately need to \nkeep their families fed and clothed, with a secure roof over their \nheads.\n  We could eliminate the marriage penalty this year--not 7 years from \nnow.\n  We could empower senior citizens to once again become productive \nmembers of the workforce by repealing the Social Security earnings \nlimit--another tax increase imposed by President Clinton in his 1993 \nbudget.\n  We could index the capital gains tax back to an earlier date as well.\n  Mr. President, by intelligently utilizing the CBO's new forecasts, \nthere are a great many things we could do to expand on our promise to \nthe American people to cut their taxes while we are balancing the \nbudget.\n  But blocking our way is a White House intent on financing more and \nmore Federal spending at the taxpayers' expense, and you won't find a \nmore vivid illustration of just why we need the deficit lockbox and the \nprotections it would provide.\n  If there are any extra dollars in the Federal budget, they should be \nreturned to the millions of American taxpayers who finance this \nGovernment every day with sweat and blood, not to Congress or the White \nHouse for bigger Government.\n  I do not know what it will take to convince me that President Clinton \nand the big spenders on Capitol Hill are truly serious about getting \nGovernment spending under control, but I do know they will never do it \nby trying to compete with Santa Claus.\n  If they want to don red suits and beards and finance more Government \nagencies, more bureaucrats, and more Federal programs, they will have \nto cut spending somewhere else to pay for them. The holiday season may \nbe a time for giving, but the taxpayers have already given until it \nhurts.\n  You can call me old fashioned, but a gift that reflects the true \nspirit of Christmas is not about giving in the hope of getting \nsomething back in return. It is about giving something from the heart.\n  A balanced budget is that kind of gift, Mr. President. You cannot \nwrap up a balanced budget, or engrave it, or put it under a Christmas \ntree. It is not the kind of gift that will score you points with \nrelatives looking for a holiday handout or get you in good with the \nboss or impress a neighbor.\n  You cannot really hand it to anyone and get a thank you in return. \nYou can, however, look into the faces of those who will someday \nappreciate this gift most of all--our children and grandchildren, \nbecause once the Federal budget is balanced, they will finally be \nfree. That, Mr. President, will be the greatest Christmas gift Congress \ncould deliver this holiday season--that is, to work out a balanced \nbudget before we leave on December 22.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that two of my colleagues \nspoke in opposition to direct lending this morning on the floor of the \nSenate. I will respond to what I had been told by my staff was said on \nthe floor.\n  First, just by way of background, let me just say there are 1,350 \ncolleges and universities that now have direct lending. I do not have \nthe list in front of me, and I cannot tell you, Mr. President, what \nschools in Wyoming are using direct lending. I know that in every State \noutside of Alaska there are schools using direct lending.

We just received a report \nfrom the Colorado State auditor saying that the University of Colorado \nis saving $192,000 a year under direct lending in bookkeeping and other \npersonnel costs.\n  Let me respond to the specific charges or statements. It said under \nthe plan that the President vetoed, all students could get flexible \nrepayment. Under direct lending if you want to, you can have income-\ncontingent repayment, that a percentage of your income can be set aside \nfor repaying a loan. That was not the case under the old program. The \nactual language of the bill is, Mr. President, that a lender ``may,'' \nat the discretion of the lender, offer the borrower the option of \nrepaying the loan in accordance with an income-contingent repayment \nschedule. That is very different from saying they ``shall.'' In other \nwords, banks ``may'' do it. But, of course, banks could do it before. \nThe reality is very few banks are going to do it except if they are \nunder competition from direct lending and they think they have to.\n  Also, added in conference on the income contingent, on income \ncontingent, you repay for 25 years. At the end of 25 years if you \nbecome a nun or if you enter some work where you do not receive income, \nat the end of 25 years it is forgiven. In conference, it kept that \nforgiveness, but said the interest would be paid to the banks no matter \nwhat. The claim was that the plan the President has vetoed would double \nthe direct loan program from 5 percent to 10 percent. The reality is 10 \npercent of the schools had it the first year. We are in the second year \nnow and almost 40 percent of the schools in the Nation now have direct \nlending. It is just universally popular. We have, in Illinois, 67 \nschools using direct lending now. I have yet to hear anyone say that it \ndoes not work.\n\n  One of our colleagues cited an op-ed piece in the Washington Post \nsaying there is no cost difference to the Federal Government between \ndirect lending and the old system. Now, if there is no cost difference, \nthen give colleges and universities the choice. The reality is the op-\ned piece in the Washington Post did miss several points that Secretary \nRiley mentioned in the letter to the editor. One of the very \nfundamental points is that under direct lending, when the Federal \nGovernment issues bonds, we collect income tax on those bonds, on the \ninterest on those bonds. When guaranty agencies issue bonds, those are \nnontaxable bonds. The difference, over a period of 7 years, is about \n$1.3 billion. The Congressional Budget Office says if you apply the \npresent law--not the cooked books of the budget that was passed--to \nboth \n\n[[Page S18691]]\nprograms, direct lending saves $4.6 billion.\n  The claim is that the direct lending transfers the loan program from \nthe private sector to the Government. Now, it is true that some of the \nbanks clearly are private sector, though as our former colleague, \nSenator David Durenberger--and the Presiding Officer did not have the \nchance to serve with him here in the Senate, but he was a very \nthoughtful Member of this body,--Senator Durenberger, in comments to a \ngroup of bankers when they said, ``Let's use the free enterprise \nsystem,'' said, ``This is not free enterprise; this is a free lunch.''\n  When you build into the law what the profit is and you say we will \ngive you 98 percent to 100 percent of the profit, that is a pretty good \ndeal. The average bank makes more money percentagewise on a student \nloan than on a house mortgage or a car loan--more than any other \ntransaction other than a credit card transaction.\n  Then the guaranty agencies operate with our money. The Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Education says there is $11 billion worth \nof Federal money at risk with the guaranty agencies. There is one in \nIndiana, for example, where the chief executive officer of that \nguaranty agency set up with Federal funds--and I fault myself for not \nbeing more careful, along with others, in setting this up--his pay is \n$627,000 a year. Not bad when we pay the President of the United States \n$200,000 a year. That guaranty agency spent $750,000 to lobby against \ndirect lending. This is, indirectly, Federal money.\n  The claim was made that the Education Department has to hire 400 new \npeople to run the direct loan program. The reality is that a fraction \nof the number of people are required because you are not dealing with \n7,000 different credit agencies--banks and guaranty agencies. It is a \nmuch more efficient system.\n  I mentioned the University of Colorado. They testified before us, and \nthey said they have been able to use two less personnel to advise \nstudents, and they have canceled four computers that they had leased, \nand they saved substantial amounts of money.\n  The statement, ``We should balance the budget without cooking the \nbooks''--I could not agree more. And the budget, unfortunately, as the \nChicago Tribune mentioned, does ``cook the books.''\n  The simple reality is sometimes Government does something that is \nright. Sometimes Government does something that is wrong. The old GI \nbill, that the Presiding Officer may be too young to remember, the old \nGI bill was a Government-run program that was a great program. Direct \nlending is a Government-run program. It simplifies things. It cuts out \nthe middleman. If we want to have an ``assistance to banking act,'' let \nus call it that. Do not label it assistance to students and then have \nan assistance to banking act.\n  It was noted in the newspapers the day before yesterday that the \nbanks of America had their best quarter ever this last quarter. I am \npleased with that. Maybe like the Presiding Officer, I have a mortgage \non my home. I want those banks to stay in good health. I want these \npages, in the years to come, to be able to get mortgages. I want banks \nto be healthy. But I do not want to subsidize banks and call it student \nassistance. I want to give colleges and universities the choice.\n  If there is no cost to the Federal Government, as the Congressional \nResearch Service says, by having the choice, or if, as the \nCongressional Budget Office says, we save money, by all means we ought \nto give colleges and universities the choice. I think it will mean the \ndifference between hundreds of thousands of people going to college or \nnot going to college.\n  One of the other great advantages of direct lending that I did not \nmention earlier is it is open to everyone. Under the old open loan \nprogram, you have to fall below a certain income level and you have to \nmeet other criteria. This is open to all American citizens and all \npeople who are legally in our country. It is much more simple, reduces \npaperwork--it is a great program.\n  Sometimes Government does things that, frankly, embarrass us who \nserve in Government. Here is an instance when Government does something \nwe can be proud of. I hope, when the dust settles on all this, we will \nkeep the option of direct lending for the colleges and universities of \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, I note no one came rushing to the floor to hear my \nremarks. I do not see anyone here requesting the floor, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18690-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18691-S18692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GRAZING REGULATIONS ON PUBLIC LANDS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me bring up a subject that is very \nclose to my heart, to my State of Wyoming, and to the West. This is an \nissue that I hope we will be dealing with in the next week or so, and \nit has to do with regulations on grazing on public land. That is not a \ntopic that is of great interest to everyone, but it is one that is of \ngreat interest to that region of the country. You have to sort of get a \nlittle feel for what that means to public land States before you go \ninto the details.\n  The State of Wyoming is 100,000 square miles, half of which is owned \nand controlled by the Federal Government. In that, of course, are \nparks, forests, wilderness, and a substantial amount of Bureau of Land \nManagement [BLM] lands which are the lands that were residual lands \nthat were never taken up in homesteading but remained in Federal \nownership--never withdrawn for any particular purpose, as was the case \nwith the forests or the parks or the wilderness areas--but, all in all, \nmore than half of Wyoming. And it is much higher in other places. \nNevada, as I recall, is 87 percent federally owned.\n  So the management and the economic decisions that are made with \nrespect to these lands are very important to these multiple-use lands. \nSome of the land, such as Yellowstone Park, Teton Park, and Devil's \nTower, of course, are set aside for a very specific and peculiar \npurpose because they are unique lands. We are talking about those that \nare for multiple purposes managed by the BLM or managed by the Forest \nService.\n  One of those purposes is grazing. There are many others, of course, \nsuch as hunting, fishing, recreation, mining, oil and gas, and coal. \nMuch of the coal in Wyoming, which is the largest producer of coal in \nthis country, is on public lands. Of course, those activities produce \nroyalty fees that are paid both to the Federal and State Governments.\n  The reason for our bill is something of a response to the problems \nthat have been created, I believe, by the efforts of the Secretary of \nthe Interior over the last 3 years to reform rangeland regulations, \nwhich is basically, we believe, to bring more and more of the decisions \nto Washington, while our purpose is to bring more of the decisions \ncloser to the people who are governed.\n  For the first 2 years that this administration was in place, \nparticularly this Secretary of the Interior, there was a great deal of \ncontroversy going on. The ``war on the West,'' which most of us believe \nis a genuine war on the West, has been staged. There were many visits \nthere by the Secretary and people related to the Interior Department in \nan effort to talk and to come to some conclusion. And, quite frankly, \nnone was ever agreed to. The longer the talks went on, the more \ncontroversy there was.\n  So in the Congress we have sought to put together a grazing bill, and \nhave passed one. The purpose of it is to react to these regulations put \nforth by the Secretary which were generally unsatisfactory to the West.\n  Let me talk just a moment about some of the things that are involved.\n  One is public participation. This is public land. We understand it is \npublic land. The decisions that are made there should provide \nopportunities for people to participate, not only those who will be \ninvolved in the activity, whether it be grazing, or whether it be oil, \nor whether it be fishing, but anyone who has an affected interest. This \nbill provides for that.\n\n  This bill was passed last summer, and there was a good deal of \ndiscussion \n\n[[Page S18692]]\nabout it in the country. We went back again several weeks ago and did \nit again in the committee and, hopefully, will have it on the floor. \nPublic participation was broadened and ensured.\n  There was a notion, when the bill came forth, that it made grazing \nthe dominant use over other uses in multiple use. Not true, nor was it \nintended to. However, as we came back we specifically put language into \nthe bill that says there is no dominant use. Grazing is not a dominant \nuse. It is a multiple use, and these uses should have a full \nopportunity.\n  Environmental protection. The environmental protection under this \nwill continue to be there as it has been before. Laws like endangered \nspecies, NEPA, and others will apply, of course, as the decisions are \nmade by the Department.\n  Standards and guidelines--which does not mean a lot to most of us--\nhas been the core of much of the problem. Standards and guidelines \nmeans the rules that will be laid down in Washington for the conduct of \nthis whole issue. We believe, those of us in the West, that the main \nthrust of the Babbitt operation was to bring these standards and \nguidelines more to Washington and that we would have a one-size-fits-\nall kind of a thing that was sent out from Washington to all of the \nWestern States. Our bill provides that local universities, local State \nagriculture departments, would be involved in the establishment of \nstandards and guidelines. We think that is important.\n  Fees. The secretary does not deal with fees. We have set up a fee for \nthe grazing program that is based on the value of cattle in the \nmarketplace at a particular time and raise the fees over what have been \npaid by about 30 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, we hope that this bill will come before Congress. \nWe think it is a reasonable bill that, again, provides for multiple use \nand provides for the economic future of the West.\n  It has always been curious to me that States who came into the Union \non an equal basis, according to the Constitution that there should be \nequity among the States, but that a Cabinet Member in Washington can \nhave more impact on the economic future of Wyoming than anybody in \nWyoming, to make rules for 50 percent of the State, a State that is \nvery oriented to minerals, very oriented to agriculture, and \nagriculture is based on cattle and sheep.\n\n  So we think this is a reasonable, bipartisan effort which will be \nbrought before the Senate, hopefully before the end of the year, and \nwill give some stability to a way of life.\n  It is also important--and I hope later when I come back, and I know \nyou are anxious to hear more--that we will have a map. It is important \nto see the way ownership patterns exist in the West. For example, one \nof the things that happened in the development of the railroads is that \n20 miles on either side of the Union Pacific Railroad, which was \nencouraged to develop the West, every other section was given to the \nrailroad to do this, and the other sections remain public. They are \nstill that way. It is called the checkerboard.\n  These are lands--this is not Yellowstone Park--that are arid, high \nplains, not particularly productive. So there are no fences, of course. \nIndeed, you really cannot afford to fence it because it takes anywhere \nfrom 50 to 60 acres for an animal unit, and it is shared with antelope, \ndeer, and with elk in some places.\n  So what I am saying is that these lands are not independently able to \nfunction. The same is pretty much true with the whole State in terms of \nranches. When the lands were settled under the various settlement acts, \nthe homesteaders, of course, took up the riverbeds, streams, water, the \ntrees, and took up the best of the land, obviously. That which was left \nis now in Federal ownership. It is very difficult to separate those two \nthings both from the standpoint of livestock and from the standpoint of \nwildlife. Livestock needs to have the winter feed, the water, and the \ncover, but in the summertime needs the grass to be able to graze on \npublic lands.\n  The other side of that, of course, is that the wildlife, which \nbasically lives on the public lands, needs in the winter to have the \nwater and the water developed by the ranchers in their private land.\n  Mr. President, we look forward to finding a way in which these public \nlands can be managed to the benefit of the public, to the benefit of \nthis country, and to the benefit of those users in Wyoming.\n  I thank you very much. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, according to a familiar advertisement in the \nNation's Capital, ``If you don't get it, you don't get it.'' Anyone who \nread the December 12 editorial in the Washington Post entitled ``Budget \nSticking Point,'' now gets it and understands there is, indeed, a \nhistoric struggle being waged over Medicaid.\n  Over the past several months, the local liberal spin on the \nRepublican proposals on welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare, has been that \nwe were not really interested in reforming these programs.\n  According to the critics, the Republicans were only hunting for \nbudget savings without regard to sound public policy. And to its \ncredit, the Post realizes this is empty campaign rhetoric and there is, \nindeed, much more at stake.\n  But while the Post concludes the Federal mandates in Medicaid must be \npreserved, Republicans believe they must end precisely for the same \nreason. Who should decide how much more than $1.5 trillion should be \nspent on health care over the next 7 years, the bureaucrats in \nWashington or the Governors and State legislatures?\n  Spending $1.5 trillion represents tremendous power. The Republican \nproposal to invest this responsibility in the States represents a sea-\nchange in how Government works. This realization shakes Washington to \nits very core. If we are successful, Washington will no longer be the \ncenter of this power and that is precisely why so much effort is being \nmade to scare people about the Republican proposals.\n\n  This debate over Medicaid is just one chapter in the larger struggle \nover our system of federalism. The debate goes to the heart of our \nbeliefs about 50 sovereign States united together as a nation. The \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States in running \nthe current welfare system has been a pretense in the recent past. Over \nthe past few years, the partnership has, in fact, been an adversarial \nrelationship, based on mutual distrust, suspicion, and threats. \nPresident Clinton understand this when, as a Governor a few years ago, \nhe joined 47 other Governors to petition Congress for a moratorium on \nnew Medicaid expansions.\n  Despite the pleas of the Governors, there was no moratorium. Medicaid \ncosts tripled between 1985 and 1993. In 1980, Medicaid spending \naccounted for about 9 percent of all State spending. In 1990, it \naccounted for about 14 percent of State spending. Medicaid now consumes \n20 percent of State spending.\n  This trend is a threat to our system of federalism. As Medicaid \nplaces greater fiscal demands on States, they have been forced to \nreduce their percentages of spending on education, transportation, and \nother vital governmental services. For example, the General Accounting \nOffice reports that Medicaid nearly equals the State expenditures for \nelementary and secondary education combined. This is a very important \nyardstick as education has generally been the largest segment of State \nbudgets. Without reform, there will be no choice about how States will \ndetermine priorities among important services, the funds will simply go \nto Medicaid. Washington has seized the power of decisionmaking from \nthose elected officials closest to the people.\n  The significance of reversing this quiet coup has been distorted by \nthose who share in the power gained by it. The argument that the poor \nand the institutions which serve them will be \n\n[[Page S18693]]\nstranded by the States is simply wrong. As the power is drained from \nWashington, all Americans, including those who depend on others for \ntheir access to health care, should eagerly anticipate the reciprocal \nactions to take place in the States.\n  Freed from the current adversarial system, the States will be able to \ndesign their own unique methods to help families overcome adversity. \nStates will find more innovative ways to use this money to help \nfamilies than Washington ever imagined. Under the Republican proposal, \nState governments will be empowered to use Medicaid dollars to act in \nthe same manner as the private sector to lower costs while at the same \ntime improve quality.\n  Medicaid reform will trigger a series of benefits throughout the \nStates. Last year, President Clinton was right when he stated that \n``the health care issue is an important part of welfare reform.'' \nAlthough his solution was fatally flawed, he correctly identified the \nreal issue before us now. The President said,\n\n       The biggest problem we've got with welfare for a lot of \n     people is that--remember if you're poor, on Medicaid and no \n     welfare, your children get health care. If you take a minimum \n     wage job in a business that doesn't have health insurance, \n     you have to give up your kid's health care to go to work.\n\n  Mr. President, this is precisely why Medicaid reform is so vital. The \npresent system traps families into welfare dependency. The current \nscheme is laden with perverse disincentives. Many families will return \nto work and no longer need cash assistance, if the power of Medicaid \ndollars is used in the marketplace to secure health care for low-income \nfamilies. For example, the General Accounting Office recently reported \nthat Tennessee has extended coverage to several hundred thousand newly \neligible individuals while increasing expenditures by less than 1 \npercent. State officials in four States with demonstration waivers \nestimate as many as 2 million previously uninsured individuals can be \nprovided with coverage while yielding savings of about $6 billion over \n5 years.\n  Over the past several years, large private employers have used their \nmuscle in the marketplace. Private sector employers and, I might add, \nthe Federal Government for its own employees, have been using \ncompetition in ways to simultaneously lower costs and increase quality.\n  In Medicaid, however, we have witnessed the opposite effect. The \nBoren amendment, for example, has been used to actually bid the price \nof nursing home care up higher. Between 1980 and 1985, Medicaid \npayments for nursing home care increased by an average of 7.8 percent \nannually. In 1989, payments had increased by 8.8 percent from the \nprevious year. But after a key Supreme Court decision on the Boren \namendment in 1990, Medicaid payments for nursing home care increased by \n17 percent in 1991.\n  Utah's Medicaid Program provides 30 percent more benefits than these \nprovided to the average worker in the private sector. Yet the Federal \nGovernment has prohibited Utah from leveling the Medicaid benefits to \n118 percent to the average private sector plan. The Governor would have \nused the savings to extend coverage to people who are currently \nuninsured, but the Federal bureaucracy refused to approve this \ninitiative.\n  Through a decision by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nworking families of Utah are required to support a system which \nprovides better benefits than they purchase for themselves. This is the \nsystem the administration insists it must safeguard. This has nothing \nto do with protecting the vulnerable.\n  Medicaid reform is needed to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary \nduplication. Under current law, States, are required to screen \nindividuals entering nursing homes to prevent inappropriate placement. \nCalifornia has performed 80,000 such screenings each year since 1989 at \na total cost of $28.5 million. Only five individuals have been \nidentified by this mandated program as having been inappropriately \nplaced. That is a cost of $5.6 million per individual identified as \nneeding a more appropriate placement. What interest does this serve? \nCertainly not the interest of the taxpayer nor the recipient. Finding \nthe right nursing home setting just takes plain common sense, not the \nFederal bureaucracy.\n\n  Those who insist on maintaining the status quo are scaring the \nelderly and disabled. In truth, these needy citizens have nothing to \nfear from the Republican proposal. The Post editorial is rooted in the \npast. For a glimpse at the future, I recommend an article by \nMassachusetts Gov. William Weld entitled, ``Release Us From Federal \nNonsense,'' which appeared in the Wall Street Journal this past week. \nGovernor Weld states that:\n\n       Before we privatized mental health services, patients were \n     warehoused in state institutions; now we save $60 million a \n     year, and the patients live in less intrusive settings that \n     almost everyone agrees are much more humane. In case after \n     case, not only did we not hurt the poor, the elderly, and the \n     vulnerable, we managed to do a lot better by them than \n     previous administrations.\n\n  It has been the States which have protected the dignity of so many by \nhelping disabled individuals to live with their families. The States \nunderstand disabled individuals need a continuum of care and a variety \nof services including medical care, income support, nutrition \nassistance, education and training, transportation, and social \nservices. Devolution of authority will improve the coordination and \nquality of services. Advocacy is strongest at the closest point of \nservice. While Washington works to protect programs, the States are in \na superior position to protect the interests of people. It is the \narrogance of Washington, as Governor Weld describes, that prevents the \nStates from serving our citizens even better.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post was correct to point out that the \nMedicaid debate is not just about money, although we must not overlook \nthe importance of our securing our economic future through achieving a \nbalanced budget. The Post prefers to promote the current Medicaid \nsystem above the interest in restoring the balance of power between the \nStates and the Federal Government. In doing so, it has failed to \nrecognize that Medicaid is drawing resources away from education and \nother vital services. Moreover, the future ability of the States to \npreserve their constitutional role in our system of federalism should \nnot be so lightly dismissed. In a landmark case about federalism, \nSupreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor warned, ``all that stands \nbetween the remaining essentials of State sovereignty and Congress is \nthe latter's underdeveloped capacity for self-restraint.'' Our system \nof federalism is truly reaching in crossroads and Medicaid is one of \nthe landmarks which will guide our choice.\n\n  At its core, the Republican proposal to reform Medicaid is about \nrediscovering our fundamental principles about Government by consent. \nFranklin Roosevelt once stated that:\n\n       It must be obvious that almost every new or old problem of \n     government must be solved, if it is to be solved to the \n     satisfaction of the people of the whole country, by each \n     state in its own way.\n\n  Mr. President, this simple statement captures so clearly and so \nprecisely what the Republicans are proposing to the American people. \nThere is no greater threat to our democratic institutions today than \nthe consolidation of power in Washington. It is time to free the States \nand our citizens from the chokehold of the Federal Government. The Post \nhas this much right--the fight is not just about the Federal budget. \nThere is indeed so much more at stake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of the Washington Post \neditorial and a column by Governor Weld be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 12, 1995]\n\n                         Budget Sticking Point\n\n       If the current budget talks break down, the hang-up likely \n     won't be money. The parties will split instead on the ancient \n     question: To what extent should the federal government \n     guarantee a minimum standard of living, or minimum level of \n     benefits, to the poor? The crucial battle-ground in this will \n     be Medicaid, by far the largest federal ``welfare'' program \n     through which the federal and state governments together help \n     pay the health care bills of lower-income children and the \n     needy elderly and disabled--all told, about a seventh of the \n     population.\n       The money issues won't be easy. But Congress deals with \n     money issues all the time, and the differences between the \n     parties are already starting to melt. The Congressional \n     Budget Office has freshened the economic and programmatic \n     assumptions on which its \n\n[[Page S18694]]\n     estimates of future deficits are based, and more than $100 billion of \n     the problem has disappeared. An agreement to adjust Social \n     Security benefits and such features of the tax code as the \n     personal exemption and standard deduction by less than the \n     full inflation rate for a number of years could raise many \n     billions more. If the Republicans will then backoff their tax \n     cuts a little while the Democrats ease their opposition to a \n     Medicare cuts, you're close to home. Except for the basic \n     question: What should be the future federal role, \n     particularly with regard to assisting the poor.\n       The Republicans basically think the federal government \n     should do less, and the president has already done a fair \n     amount of retreating on the issue. The current welfare \n     program embodies a federal guarantee of aid to needy single \n     parents and their children; he has indicated he would sign a \n     welfare bill dropping that. He has indicated a willingness to \n     limit future housing aid by capping the appropriations on \n     which it depends as well.\n       That leaves three other major federal programs for the \n     poor--Medicaid, food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, \n     which stretches the wages of lower-income workers with \n     children. On these the president has said to Democrats and \n     advocacy groups unhappy with his welfare and housing \n     concessions that we will not give major ground but will hold \n     the line. The Republicans, though they've proposed deep cuts \n     and assorted structural changes in all three of these \n     programs, have indicated that on food stamps and the tax \n     credit they don't care that much; they themselves are \n     divided.\n       On the structure of Medicaid, though, they have said there \n     will be no give, and there you are. They want to go to a \n     system of block grants, cut projected federal spending \n     sharply, cut what the states must put up to get their federal \n     funds, and largely let the states decide how and on whom the \n     money will be spent. This would pretty well eliminate the \n     federal guarantee that the needy young and elderly could \n     count on a certain level of care. The President rightly wants \n     to preserve the guarantee. He would meanwhile cut projected \n     costs by capping the annual increase per beneficiary--the \n     right way to do it.\n       Much more is at stake in this than just a balanced federal \n     budget and the balance of power between the federal \n     government and the states. Medicaid is not just a major \n     federal cost and major source of aid to state and local \n     governments; it is the insuror of last resort in the health \n     care system. Especially if even costlier Medicare is to be to \n     shaken up and cut, Medicaid needs to be preserved to protect \n     the vulnerable. The alternative is even more people \n     uninsured; the poor, the states and the hospitals and other \n     institutions that serve the poor would all be stranded. This \n     fight is not just about the federal budget and the federal \n     role. It's about that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n                    Release Us From Federal Nonsense\n\n                          (By William F. Weld)\n\n       Right now, America is well on the road to block-granting \n     welfare, Medicaid, and job training, and allowing the states \n     to shape these programs to fit their own ends. And most of \n     the nations' governors say a mighty hurrah.\n       Washington Democrats, however, talk about this shift of \n     power from the federal government to the states as if it \n     represents a return to a more primitive time--to an America \n     without indoor plumbing or electric lights or a conscience.\n       We governors find this highly ironic. Because from our \n     perspective in the state houses, it's Washington that has \n     been living in the Walker Evans photographs from the \n     thirties. We embraced the future some time ago.\n       Most of us already have cleaned up our budgets to eliminate \n     deficits; we've cut taxes; and within the handcuffs the \n     federal government has put on us, we've improved our social \n     services while cutting the bloat.\n       For example, it's been clear for years that the federal \n     welfare system is an abomination that lays families to waste; \n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's been saying this almost \n     since he was in short pants. But year after year welfare \n     bills have been passed without Congress doing anything about \n     the most glaring problems in the system, until finally the \n     states gave up on Washington, applied for waivers, and took \n     things into their own hands as far as the federal government \n     would permit.\n       So when Washington Democrats characterize our enthusiasm \n     for block grants as naivete--or worse, a perverse desire to \n     begin some race to the basement--they've missed the point \n     entirely. If the federal government would just release us \n     from its bureaucracy and nonsense, we'd make these programs \n     better for those they serve, and we'd do it for less money.\n       I think our experience in Massachusetts is instructive.\n       By the time I was elected governor, Massachusetts had \n     achieved a high state of refinement. Our Department of \n     Corrections was under the wing of the Human Services Office--\n     as if it were the taxpayers' obligation to help them have \n     more children they couldn't support. We had a new sales tax \n     on business services--as if that were the best way to \n     celebrate a thriving service economy.\n       And our economy was falling to pieces; we were regularly \n     releasing violent criminals back to the streets to continue \n     their mayhem; and we managed to achieve the highest rate of \n     out-of-wedlock teen births in the country.\n       We began getting Massachusetts' fiscal house in order by \n     taking on the ``budget-busters,'' and many of them were the \n     same ugly mugs the federal government is facing right now.\n       In the four years before I was first elected governor \n     (1990), Medicaid costs in Massachusetts rose by 20% a year. \n     With Managed Care Medicaid, we brought that down to 3% a \n     year.\n       We took on welfare, too--a state entitlement program known \n     as General Relief, and it was mighty general indeed. The \n     conditions that got you on the rolls were so loose that if \n     you were over 45 years old, overweight and without a stable \n     work history, you qualified. In other words, I qualified.\n       We replaced General Relief with an emergency aid program \n     for the elderly, the disabled and children, and managed to \n     save $100 million out of a $14 billion budget, just by \n     targeting the help to those who really needed it.\n       Advoctes predicted a ``bloodbath.'' They said we'd have \n     people starving in the streets. But nothing of the sort ever \n     happened, and the doomsday scenarios faded away. In fact, a \n     quarter of our General Relief customers didn't even bother to \n     reapply.\n       All along the way, we stepped on special interests who used \n     the same scare tactics we're seeing today in Washington. But \n     these tactics are far less effective when they are used in \n     one's own district, because voters can more easily see how \n     their money is being spent and, often, misused--another \n     argument for letting states take care of their own.\n       When we cut taxes, we heard that we were reverse Robin \n     Hoods. What the protectors neglected to mention was that our \n     frugality not only allowed us to phase out the long-term \n     capital gains tax, it also allowed us to lift the tax burden \n     on low-income working people.\n       When we made changes to Medicaid, we heard that we were \n     abusing the poor. But before we put Managed Care Medicaid in \n     place, most poor children had no primary care physician, and \n     many weren't getting their shots. Now a little girl with an \n     earache doesn't have to report to an emergency room to get \n     medical attention; she has her own doctor who knows her by \n     name. And we've got advocates praising our Medicaid program \n     in public.\n       Before we privatized mental health services, patients were \n     warehoused in state institutions; now we save $60 million a \n     year, and the patients live in less intrusive community \n     settings that almost everyone agrees are much more humane. In \n     case after case, not only did we not hurt the poor, the \n     elderly and the vulnerable, we managed to do a lot better by \n     them than previous administrations.\n       Our experience is not unique. All across the country, \n     creative governors are aggressively dealing with problems \n     Washington is just beginning to wake up to. So if the \n     question is whether state governments are responsible enough \n     to dispense welfare and Medicaid funds in our own way--we're \n     more than ready.\n       Not only can we handle that responsibility, it's rightfully \n     ours. The 10th Amendment of the Constitution says quite \n     plainly that the powers not expressly given to the federal \n     government are reserved to the states and to the people. And \n     common sense dictates the same thing.\n       Government ought to be as local as possible, as close to \n     the people as it can be, because generalities rarely get the \n     story straight. So in my operation, we're doing some \n     devolving ourselves, putting all the regulatory functions of \n     government under a single office and sunsetting the entire \n     25,000 pages of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, so \n     our cities no longer have to apply to a half-dozen state \n     agencies every time they want to put up a stop sign or a \n     curb cut.\n       When it comes to social programs, the states shouldn't have \n     to beg Washington for the right to put up a stop sign. The \n     welfare reform law my state passed this year is full of badly \n     needed stop signs. It includes a family cap that will allow \n     us to cease subsidizing illegitimacy. It requires those with \n     school-aged children to go to work within 60 days. It \n     requires teenage mothers to live at home and finish high \n     school, so they'll have a shot at something better than \n     welfare. It puts a two-year limit on benefits, so welfare \n     will be what it should be--a temporary leg up, not a \n     permanent lifestyle. And it allows our Commissioner of \n     Transitional Assistance to make exceptions for hardship \n     cases.\n       For every change we wanted to make, we had to ask \n     Washington's permission for a waiver of federal law and then \n     put up with half a year of paper pushing and haggling. \n     Ultimately, the Clinton Administration refused to grant us \n     one of the cornerstones of our plan, the two-year limit.\n       The irony here is that our law passed with the overwhelming \n     support of a Democratic Legislature. It's sheer arrogance for \n     Washington to think it knows better than Massachusetts what \n     Massachusetts needs, but the current waiver system encourages \n     that arrogance. If President Clinton really wants to end \n     welfare as we know it, he should sign the bill ending welfare \n     as we endure it.\n       Washington has long tried to direct our life here at sea \n     level from the summit of Mount Everest. In the process, it \n     has turned entire communities into public sector hells. It \n     has made fatherlessness the norm for two generations of \n     inner-city kids and given birth to a frightening culture of \n     drugs and violence.\n     \n[[Page S18695]]\n\n       We know these communities. Washington doesn't.\n       It's time for President Clinton to allow the states to give \n     it our best shot. We couldn't do worse than Washington. I \n     know we'll do much, much better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18692-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I came out on the floor to \nspeak about the energy assistance program. I need not repeat most of \nwhat I said, yesterday. But I thought I would try to be brief and \nsummarize.\n  Mr. President, I am a Senator from a cold-weather State, Minnesota. \nBy cold-degree days, we have the third coldest days in the country \nbehind Alaska and North Dakota. Last year in my State about 330,000 \npeople received some energy assistance so that they would not go cold. \nMany of them were elderly households, many of them were households with \nchildren, and many of them were households with minimum wage workers \nwith an average rent of around $350. Let us think about this as a kind \nof cold weather lifeline program, almost more of a survival supplement \nthan an income supplement, designed to ensure that people will not go \ncold.\n  Mr. President, right now as I speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nin my State of Minnesota, without exaggeration I can say that there are \nsome people with no heat with the temperatures around zero. Last \nweekend when Sheila and I were home the temperature was about 50 below \nwind chill. There are people in the United States of America, in my \nState, and in other cold-weather States as well, I am sure, Mr. \nPresident, who are now living in one room. That is all they are able to \nheat--one room. There are some people with no oil or propane in their \ntank. Mr. President, there are some Minnesotans who are trying to heat \ntheir home by just turning on their oven. There are also people in my \nState--I am joined by my colleague from Iowa--who right now are not \nable to purchase the food they need or the prescription drugs they need \nbecause of the money they are now spending for energy maintenance to \nmake sure they do not go cold, because they have such limited means.\n  In the United States of America right now, in Minnesota, Iowa, and \nother cold-weather States, there are people who are cold, and I am \npositive, I am positive as I speak here today, that somebody will \nfreeze to death and then we will take action. It will be too late.\n  Mr. President, this is the problem. Last year, by the end of \nDecember, about $1 billion had been allocated out to our States for \nassistance. This is not a 1-year program. It does not do any good to \ntell people they will be able to receive some assistance so they do not \nget cold in June or July. Time is not neutral. The total cost of the \nenergy assistance program nationally was less than one B-2 bomber. It \nwas $1.3 billion last year, $900 million right now. This is the \nproblem. It was eliminated on the House side. But Senator Daschle--and, \nI might add, other Senators as well, Republicans included, Senator \nSpecter being one really good example, and I know Senator Hatfield \ncares fiercely about this, and I could list others as well; Senator \nSmith from New Hampshire--many people, many from the cold-weather \nStates. We know now what has happened. It has become a moral issue.\n  Last year by the end of December, about $1 billion had gone out, and \nI think this year about $230 million has gone out nationwide. In my \nState of Minnesota, by this time last year, about $25 million--right \nnow, $9 million. We have long waiting lists of people who have no \nassistance or people who have received only $100 when last year they \nreceived $350. What is going to happen to them next month or the month \nafterwards?\n  So, Mr. President, I will yield in just a moment for a question from \nmy colleague. I just want to make it clear where we are right now. It \nis extremely important that if there is a continuing resolution--and \nthere should be because there should not be any Government shutdown--it \nis extremely important that we have the language to accelerate the \nallocation of this money.\n  If you did just 75 percent of last year, I say to my colleague, that \nwould be over $900 million. We must get this out to our States now so \npeople do not freeze to death. There cannot be one Senator or \nRepresentative, regardless of party, that could really disagree with \nthis proposition. If this does not happen, Mr. President, with the \nwording of the continuing resolution at the end of this week, it has to \nhappen at the beginning of next week. And if there is no continuing \nresolution, I would say to the administration you have the authority \nbecause we already have the money. This is forward funded. We already \nhave the money. You have the authority to release that money.\n  However we get the job done, for God's sake, let us get the job done. \nThat is really what I am saying.\n  I feel very strongly about any issue, not because I believe this is \nthe only issue that our country is confronted with, not because I do \nnot fully appreciate the overall budget debate and the difficult \nchoices that all of us have to make, not because I do not care fiercely \nabout what will happen in Bosnia and for the safety of our soldiers and \nthat they will be able to make a difference there. Sometimes, in all \nthese statistics and all this alphabet soup, OMB, CBO, baseline \nbudget--you are familiar with what I am talking about--it is just \ndisconnected from the reality of people's lives.\n  This is such a time. I am a Senator from a cold-weather State, \nMinnesota, and I will do whatever I need to do as a Senator to get the \nfunding out to my State, and for that matter other cold-weather States, \nso that people, be they seniors, be they children, be they individuals \nwith disabilities, or be they low-wage families, are able to get some \nassistance so they can heat their homes now.\n\n  Right now, too many of our citizens are cold. Too many of our \ncitizens are without heat. This is wrong. This is a moral issue. We \nmust do something about this, and it is within our power to do \nsomething about this today. We have to take action.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa had a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wondered if the Senator will yield.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nbeing a leader on this issue. Both the other day when he took the floor \nand he spoke about it and again today--I did not catch all of the \nSenator's remarks; I was on my way over to the floor, but I wanted to \njust ask the Senator if he was aware of all of the ramifications in the \nStates that are taking place right now. I know the Senator spoke very \neloquently about what is happening in Minnesota and the fact that this \nmoney is not getting out. But there are some really kind of \ndisingenuous things going on out there. If the Senator will bear with \nme, I will explain it and then I will follow it with a question.\n  I am told that in some States in the Midwest, because of the fact \nthat they do not have the necessary funds for the heating program, the \nLow-Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, they put the word out \nthat they have just enough money to meet emergency situations, that it \nis being interpreted in some States as saying an emergency is if an \nelderly person has been notified by the utility that they are cutting \noff the utilities. That is the emergency. If you get your utility cut \noff, then you get it.\n  I ask the Senator, take a typical elderly person in Minnesota or \nIowa, from the Midwest, it is colder than the dickens. They are living \nin a small town of 900 people, 1,000 people like the small towns where \nI come from. They are living in a small house--usually it \n\n[[Page S18696]]\nis women--living by themselves, on Social Security; their total income \nis 400 or 500 bucks a month.\n  I wish to point out that 80 percent, 80 percent of this money in the \nLow-Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, 80 percent of the money \ngoes to people with less than $8,000 a year income. I ask the Senator \nto take an elderly person--as I said, many times an elderly woman--\nliving by themselves in a small house in a small town. The heating bill \ncomes in. They know they have to pay it. Would they just say, well, I \nam not going to pay it because then it will be a crisis and then I will \nget the money? What would that elderly person do?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague--and by the way, \nI would like to thank the Chair. Quite often we are speaking on the \nfloor, and the Presiding Officer is writing letters and not paying \nattention. He comes from a more warm-weather State. I thank him for his \ncourtesy.\n  I would say to my colleague from Iowa, we are getting all of these \ncalls from elderly people, and I will tell you exactly what they do, \nand then I would like to compare notes with the Senator and get his \nreaction.\n  What will happen, under that definition, it will not happen that \nelderly person will not pay his or her bill, but they will not purchase \nthe prescription drugs they will need that the doctor prescribed or \nthey will simply have less money for food. It is that simple. And by \nthe way, during the winter is not a time when you want to have less \nincome to be able to have a decent diet.\n  That is exactly what is going on, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator is correct. I think that is what is \ngoing to happen out there. So you may say, well, gee, you know, they \nare not in crisis circumstances; they are getting their fuel, they are \npaying their bills, but what is happening on the other side of the \nledger? This is a crisis situation in my State, and I know it is in \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I share the Senator's concern about this. We do have the \nopportunity, as the Senator pointed out. Now, again, for my benefit and \nfor others, would the Senator explain it. We forward funded this, $1.3 \nbillion.\n  Obviously that money has already been appropriated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was on the Appropriations Committee. That money has \nbeen appropriated. So why is it not going out? If we already \nappropriated the money, why is it not going out?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, I would say to my colleague that \nwhat has happened is by the terms of these continuing resolutions, the \nmoney cannot be appropriated right now by the administration. And that \nis what I was trying to explain earlier.\n  Right now we have a couple of different scenarios that are possible. \nFirst, I want to say to my colleague--he may or may not realize this--\nin the first draft of the continuing resolution from the House of \nRepresentatives, zero came out for LIHEAP for this year. There was \nactually language that said that no LIHEAP money could be spent, no \nenergy assistance money could be spent, until the Labor-Health and \nHuman Services appropriations bill of this year was passed. This would \nhave effectively guaranteed that there would be no money going out.\n  We saw that and we said that if that came to the floor, we would \namend it. And it was ultimately amended. With the support of the White \nHouse and others, that was dropped. But my understanding, I say to my \ncolleague, is right now by the terms of the continuing resolution that \nwe are under, that money cannot be spent. The only money that could be \nspent has been spent--about $230 million.\n  One of two things has to happen. If we get a continuing resolution, \nwe have to have language which essentially says that we have to \naccelerate the allocation of this money which exists. Even if it was 75 \npercent of last year's level, that would be over $900 million, which we \nneed to get out. But if there is no continuing resolution, I say to my \ncolleague, the administration then has the legal authority--and we were \nin touch with legal counsel at OMB to confirm this--they could release \nthe money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me get this clear from the Senator. If a continuing \nresolution--that expires today. I do not know what time it expires.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Midnight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Midnight tonight. If there is no continuing resolution, \nthen tomorrow the administration could release the remainder of the \nmoney that was appropriated last year for this program?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is absolutely correct. And we have urged the \nadministration to do that, absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to join the Senator in making that request. I do \nnot know if there will be a continuing resolution today or not. Who \nknows. I know they are negotiating right now.\n  Let me further ask the Senator, if a continuing resolution comes to \nthe floor today, let us say for a short period of time, a 3-day--I \nheard some talk about a 3-day, 4-day continuing resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is that amendable? Could an amendment be offered on that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague and good \nfriend from Iowa, absolutely. Here is what we do not know. My hope is \nthat since this continuing resolution would originate from the House, \nthat on the House side they would have put into the resolution the \nlanguage, the authority, for us to go forward with accelerated funding \nright now.\n  There are many Representatives, Democrats and Republicans, who are \nvery uncomfortable with where we are at in this Nation. Thank God they \nare. There are people who feel--they are saying, ``Look. We don't just \nwant to be here while people go cold.'' All right.\n  So my hope would be that you would have a resolution that would come \nover here with a formula that would allocate the funds that we need to \nget out to the States so people do not go cold. People are cold now.\n  If that does not happen, then certainly we can amend that. That is \none possibility, we can amend that, and we would insert wording that \nwould make sure that we would get the allocation of funding out. We \ncould do that. I say to my colleague that that is a possibility.\n  Now, if it was for 2 days, over the weekend, then another \npossibility--though we have to see--would be, depending upon \ncommitments that are made, that it would be done in the beginning of \nnext week.\n  But we have to get it done. Right now I feel very strongly we have to \nget it done today. We have to do everything we can to make sure that we \nget this funding out to families in our States so people do not go cold \nthrough a continuing resolution today or through a continuing \nresolution Monday or through the administration, if there is no \ncontinuing resolution, releasing the funds. It has to happen.\n  It makes very little difference to the people out in our States who \nare cold, who are really frightened, many of whom are desperate, what \nway the funding gets to them and what way they get the energy \nassistance. We can do it a number of different ways. But I have gone on \nrecord all week saying--I believe we have some amendments that we \ndrafted to this continuing resolution. I certainly know my colleague \nfrom Iowa will be with me. If that is what we need to do, that is what \nwe will do. If we can do it another way, we will do it another way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for bringing this out and answering \nthose questions. And I look forward to working with him. The Senator is \nabsolutely right, Mr. President, we have a crisis situation out there. \nWe hear all the talk about shutting down the Government and the impact \nthis would have on people who work and, with the Christmas season \ncoming up, what it might mean for their families. And we ought to be \ncognizant of that. I hope there is not a shutdown of the Government. I \nhope that does not happen.\n  But for many of these elderly people--and we are talking about \nelderly people on Social Security, making $400 a month, $500, a lot of \ntimes living by themselves--when you do not get that Low-Income Heating \nEnergy Assistance Program, that is more than the equivalent of a \nGovernment person losing their job for a few days. It could, indeed, be \na very bleak Christmas for a lot of these people out there, too.\n  So I am sorry this has gone on this long. I guess we hoped against \nhope \n\n[[Page S18697]]\nthere would be warm weather. But we have had some really bad weather, \nreally cold.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, Mr. President, that the other \nproblem that my chief legislative analyst, Colin McGinnis, reminded me \nof is it takes about 10 days or so for OMB and HHS to run the computer \nformulas, cut the checks, and get the money out to the States. We have \na long waiting list in Minnesota already who would be served by that \nfunding.\n  So we really are again--time is not neutral. For God's sake, I would \nsay to every single one of my colleagues, Democrat, Republican, let us \ndo this before Hanukkah. Hanukkah is Sunday night. I am Jewish. \nHanukkah is Sunday night. Then we have Christmas. Let us do this before \nHanukkah. Let us do this before Christmas. Let us please make a \ncommitment as Senators to make sure that people at least do not go cold \nin America. This is wrong. We can do much better.\n  There is no reason in the world for us not to be able to reach out. I \nmean, if you want to talk about family values, I think the most \nimportant family value there is is to reach out with a helping hand. I \nthink everybody agrees with that. So we have to get this job done.\n  I thank my colleague. I thank my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I am just going to finish up. This just is one \nexample. I have many examples from Minnesota, but this is an example of \nwhat can happen when people are without heat, from right here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Three years ago around this time, a fire burned \ndown a small apartment building in the Mount Pleasant region of the \nDistrict of Columbia, burning to death two little girls, Amber and Asia \nSpencer, ages 6 and 5. The girls were killed by a fire when one of the \ncandles that was used to heat the apartment fell over. The electricity \nhad been turned off 2 months earlier when the girl's grandmother, their \nguardian, could not afford to pay the heating bill.\n  It is my understanding that every winter, children across the country \nare killed or injured by fires caused by desperate attempts to keep \nwarm--to keep warm.\n  I have said to my leader, Senator Daschle, I have said to the \nRepublicans--again, I know Senator Smith from New Hampshire, another \ncold weather State, said he really wants to be on the floor, wants to \nfight hard for this; Senator Abraham has been very committed to this; \nSenator Specter has been very committed to this; Senator Jeffords and \nany number of Republicans on the other side of the aisle.\n  I do not view this as a partisan issue. I think it was a huge mistake \nfor the House to eliminate this. I have been fighting for this for 6 \nmonths because I know it is so important to people.\n  But I think right now the issue is not to have a fight. That is not \nthe point. The point is to bring people together and to at least make \nthe small change. We already have the money. It is already there. All \nwe have to do is make sure that in a continuing resolution, if the \nGovernment is not shut down--and I hope it will not be shut down; I do \nnot think it should be--to make sure in the continuing resolution that \nwe are able to allocate the funds out to the States.\n  If we just do it on the basis of 75 percent of last year, Mr. \nPresident, so that now as the winter weather is upon us in our States, \nthen we could get adequate short-term funds out fast. It can be \nallocated out to the communities and we can protect people. We should \ndo that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to make it clear, I mentioned \nthe other day the work of the Senator from Vermont. He has spoken on \nthis several times. I want to thank the Senator and Senator Jeffords as \nwell. I believe that those of us from cold-weather States know what \nthis means in human terms. We know from the phone calls and the people \nwith whom we visit.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I spoke, as did the Senator from Minnesota, \non the issue of LIHEAP yesterday. I commend him for what he has said. \nThis is an issue that is joined certainly in the northern tier States \nwith Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate.\n  We should restore these LIHEAP funds. Frankly, I strongly urge our \ncolleagues and leadership in the other body, if need be, to simply pass \na LIHEAP appropriations so we can take it up, pass it here and send it \ndown. We would not have this issue were all the appropriations bills \nnow passed. We can pass that one, if need be.\n  This is a matter of urgency. It is not an answer to say we will have \nthe money in June of next year. It was 8 or 9 degrees below zero at my \nhome in Vermont 2 days ago. It was way below zero last night. We had \nabout a foot of snow in the last few days. The good news, of course, is \nnothing slows down with only a foot of snow in Vermont. The bad news is \nthat the people who are without money are now faced with the question \nof whether they will eat or heat. Many of them are elderly. The \nmajority of them are disabled.\n  There is no question we should try to get this through. It will be \ncolder next month. It always is in January. Last year, we had about a \nweek and a half that did not go above zero. During that time, it hit 25 \nto 35 degrees below zero, depending where in the State it was.\n  If you are living in a residence that needs the help of LIHEAP or \nweatherization for heating, that cold goes through pretty quickly. This \nis not a case of being uncomfortable. This is a case where people die. \nPeople die in their own homes. They die in their own homes from the \ncold. They die in their own homes sometimes when efforts are made to \nheat. They die in their own homes when they have actually been pulling \nboards out of the floor or furniture to burn to keep warm, because they \nknow exposure to that weather for just a matter of, sometimes, minutes \ncould bring about hypothermia and death.\n  Mr. President, I do not see other Members seeking the floor, so I \nwill talk about another issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18697-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18697-S18698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL--ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand this afternoon at some point, \nwe will have a vote on whether to proceed to the conference report on \nDepartment of Defense authorization. I am strongly opposed to several \nprovisions in that bill. I will not ask the clerks to read the bill in \nfull when it comes up, as I could. It is my way of saying ``Merry \nChristmas'' to them, I suppose, and to the rest of the staff. But I \nwill express very strong concerns about it and, of course, will ask for \na recorded vote on the issue of proceeding.\n  I do not want to hold up the issue, though, of course and as soon as \nit comes over here--I see the distinguished chairman, my good friend \nfrom South Carolina on the floor--I would not want to hold him up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is one issue that I intend to talk about at \nconsiderable length. This body voted by better than a 2 to 1 margin, \nnearly 3 to 1 margin, to put some limitation on antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  For some reason a provision that was not even considered by either \nthe House or the Senate on antipersonnel landmines ended up in the \nDefense authorization bill, which would have the effect of undermining \nmy amendment. It is an absolute disregard and repudiation of the intent \nof the Senate.\n  At a time when every member of the military is talking about the \ndanger to our men and women in Bosnia from landmines, at a time when \nthe President of the United States talks about the potential casualties \nfrom landmines, at a time when every press report talks about the \npotential of landmine casualties in Bosnia, at a time when virtually \nevery Member of this body and the other body are concerned about the \npotential American casualties from landmines, we let somebody from the \nPentagon write in a provision in the DOD bill, a provision that was \nnever voted on by the House, never voted on by the Senate, never \nconsidered by either body suddenly showed up in the conference report. \nA provision that would ensure that the plague of landmines continues \nunabated. \n\n[[Page S18698]]\n\n  I call on the Pentagon, out of a sense of morality, at least, to stop \nthe hypocrisy of saying they worry about our people being injured by \nlandmines, and then do nothing to stop their use around the world. And \nit is not only our troops who are threatened, it is hundreds of \nmillions of people who are killed and maimed by these indiscriminate \nweapons every day. Over 26,000 people every year, and most are innocent \ncivilians.\n  This, Mr. President, is a landmine. It is an antipersonnel landmine. \nIt has been disarmed. If it were active, with just the slightest \npressure it would take my arm and most of my face off.\n  There are millions of landmines in Bosnia, many of which are made of \nplastic and virtually impossible to detect, and others are designed to \nspring up and explode at waist level, sending out horrendous shrapnel \nthat would disembowel or cut in half somebody within 50 or 100 feet.\n  When we vote on the Department of Defense authorization bill, we \nought to send a very clear message to the Pentagon that it is not \nenough to say you want to protect our men and women when they go in \nharm's way on peacekeeping of rescue missions or anything else. It is \ntime to say we will take steps here, to show leadership, to set an \nexample, to stop this senseless use of landmines worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this year the American people have been \ntreated to what can only be referred to as political theater of the \nabsurd. The Republicans took control of Congress in January touting \ntheir so-called Contract With America as the vehicle for change and as \nthe vehicle for the end of business as usual. Well, they weren't \nkidding. This year has truly defied all legislative logic. In some \nrespects 206 years of process have been literally thrown out of the \nwindow.\n  There have been lots of talk and press events and, of course, photo-\nops galore. Creative gimmicks have been used to highlight the grandiose \nplans of this new crowd. We have seen ostriches and bloodhounds and \neven golf clubs used to represent various points of view. Through all \nthese shenanigans, the Nation has waited with bated breath for some \nreal results.\n  To put it bluntly, the grinch seems to have stolen Congress' \nsensibilities. Here it is December 15, and the Nation is still waiting. \nThe Nation has already lived through one record-breaking Government \nshutdown, and now we are facing the very real possibility that Federal \nworkers will be furloughed for Christmas and Government services will \nonce again be curtailed.\n  Today's deadline for keeping the Government running is looming and \nstill there are no assurances that an agreement can be reached. While \nwe in Congress jockey from one position to another seeming to be \nconcerned only with protecting our collective political hides, the \nAmerican people are wondering if we ever stop to worry about them or \nabout the fate of the Nation.\n  Under the Constitution, the only real responsibility we elected \nMembers of Congress have to worry ourselves with is that of ensuring \nthe passage of the 13 appropriations bills that fund the Federal \nGovernment. That is all we really have to do. This year while Members \nof Congress have spent months and months raising the public's \nexpectations for an end to legislative gridlock and a new blueprint for \ngoverning, we seem to be more preoccupied with one petty political \nnuance after another. Instead of ensuring that the people's needs are \nmet, we are arguing over the size of the negotiating table, how many \npeople can attend, and which door of the airplane we can use.\n  All of this is an unnecessary and unwarranted diversion. This year, \nas always, there are differences in priorities between the Democrats \nand the Republicans and between the Congress and the White House.\n  What is disturbing about our current situation is that we seem to \nhave forgotten the concept of legislative compromise. No legislative \nproduct ever embodies the wishes and desires of all involved. \nUnfortunately, the political give and take that make our system of \ngovernment work are sorely lacking. There is no give and take. Instead, \nmembers seem more concerned with sowing the landscape with political \nseeds that can be cultivated and harvested during next year's election \ncampaigns. As I have often said, there really are matters that are \nsimply more important than political party--more important than either \npolitical party. Responding to our elected responsibility to the people \nis one of them. We cannot let the American people down again or we all \nsurely risk the wrath of the voters. And I say this to those who are \nfocused more on November 1996: You will surely reap what you have sown!\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18698-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18698-S18699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, on behalf of the \nmajority leader, I will move that the Chair lay before the Senate a \nconference report to accompany H.R. 1530, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  It is anticipated that there will be an objection. Since this is not \na debatable motion, then at such time as the majority leader \nindicates--I believe it will be shortly after the motion to oppose \nmoving forward--there will be a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia and the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, both \nof whom are dear and respected friends of mine, and I have had some \ndiscussion on this. I anticipate asking for--and there may be others \nfor that matter--a vote on the motion to proceed.\n  I tell the Senate and my distinguished colleagues that if I had \nintended to hold up the motion to proceed, of course, I would use the \nparliamentary tactic, instead, of asking for a vote on the motion to \nproceed requiring the reading of the bill which--it is about this big \nfor anybody who cares. That is about 1\\1/2\\ feet high, and it would \ntake a very considerable time to read. I am not going to request that, \nof course. I have never engaged, in my 21 years here in the Senate, in \nsuch tactics. I will, however, ask for the vote on the motion to \nproceed, and I assume the majority of Senators will vote to proceed.\n  I do this because of my concern about one provision, as I said \nearlier, on landmines. This is a provision that was neither in the \nHouse bill nor in the Senate bill. We passed by a two-thirds rollcall \nvote in the Senate a provision on landmines. The House had nothing.\n  When it became contentious, I said to the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, ``Why don't we just \nremove the Senate provision?'' In other words, recede to the House, \nwhich is no provision.\n  It is my understanding that was going to be done. It was my \nunderstanding in the conversations with the Senators involved that \nwould be done.\n  I was then told by Senate staff--not by Senators, but by some Senate \nstaff--that they could not allow their Senators to go along with such a \ncommitment. I find that frustrating, of course, because Senators are \nthe ones elected. And I have found that the Senators I have dealt \nwith--especially those whom I have just talked with--have always been \nextremely truthful with me, as I have always tried to be with them. But \nmy concern was--and \n\n[[Page S18699]]\napparently sometimes we are considered merely constitutional \nimpediments by our staff. In this case, the staff did not want us any \nlonger to be impediments. In any event, this is a matter that could be \nsolved, and could be solved easily before the conference report comes \nto a final passage.\n  I made suggestions to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, \nfollowing a suggestion made by the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, of a way that we could solve this problem. That would require \ncooperation from the other body, and I hope that cooperation might be \nforthcoming.\n  I just thought this explanation, for Senators wondering what is going \non, would be required.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18698-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most serious effects of the \ncurrent stopgap funding bill for the Federal Government is its \ntreatment of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps \nneedy families pay their winter fuel bills.\n  Under this program, the States receive the full amount of their \nLIHEAP benefits in October and November--the benefit levels that are \nset to deal with the emergencies.\n  It is bad enough that the current stopgap funding cuts these funds 25 \npercent below last year's levels. Even worse, it pays out those funds \non bases that are prorated for a full year. So the States are receiving \nless than the usual share in October and November to plan for the \nwinter.\n  This chart illustrates it. Last year, on December 15, 1994, some $800 \nmillion out of approximately a little over $1 billion had been \ndistributed in LIHEAP. This year it is down to $231 million.\n  The total amount in the LIHEAP has been reduced by 25 percent. But, \nnonetheless, this is what is currently distributed under the continuing \nresolution because of the way that continuing resolution is drafted.\n  All we have to do is see what have been the temperatures of the last \nfew days. In Boston it was 18; Duluth, MN, it was 22 below; Milwaukee, \n1 below; even down in New Orleans, 26; Des Moines, IA, 7; Burlington, \nVT, 13--an enormously cold snap.\n  I know my good friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, has talked \nabout that issue as has the Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18699-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18699-S18700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LIHEAP PROVISIONS IN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most serious defects of the \ncurrent stop-gap funding bill for the Federal Government is its \ntreatment of LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that \nhelps needy families pay their winter fuel bills.\n  Under that program, States receive most of their full-year LIHEAP \nallocation in the 2 months of October and November so that they can \nprepare for the winter, set benefit levels, and deal with emergencies.\n  It's bad enough that the current stop-gap bill cuts these needed \nfunds by 25 percent from last year's level. Even worse, it pays out \nthose funds on a basis that is prorated on a full year, so that States \nare receiving far less than the usual share in October and November to \nplan for the winter.\n  By this time last year, Massachusetts had received $32 million of its \nannual $54 million allocation. This year, however, Massachusetts has \nonly been allowed to draw down $9.5 million.\n  In fact, all States had received $800 million of last year's $1.3 \nbillion LIHEAP appropriation by December 15 of last year. Under the \nstop-gap bill, however, that level has dropped to only $230 million--a \n71 percent cut--even though the bill is supposed to impose only a 25 \npercent cut at most.\n  States have found it extremely difficult to serve their needy \ncitizens without access to these up-front funds. In fact, many States \nhave had to establish triage policies to meet only the most dire \nemergencies.\n  Massachusetts energy agencies have said that they will respond only \nto cases where a utility terminates services, or where homes have less \nthan one eight of a tank of fuel oil. The State has cut annual LIHEAP \nbenefits from $430 to $150 per household to ensure that they have \nenough funds for emergencies throughout the winter.\n  In Gloucester, the agencies have been faced with a choice of spending \nnonauthorized LIHEAP funds or letting some families freeze to death.\n  In Salem, the local government has dipped into its own scarce funds \nto provide needed assistance.\n  In Springfield, Patricia Nelligan, the fuel assistance director for \nthe New England Farm Workers' Council, said that unless more LIHEAP \nfunds are made available soon, their program will have to shut down by \nthe end of next week.\n  It may not officially be winter yet, but winter has already arrived \nwith a vengeance in many parts of the country. For the 6 million \nrecipients of LIHEAP assistance across the Nation, it will be a \ndesperate Christmas unless more aid is available.\n  Ninty five percent of the households receiving LIHEAP assistance have \nannual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18 \npercent of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented the heat or eat \neffect, where higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-\nincome families to spend less money on food. The result is increased \nmalnutrition among children.\n  We had a very interesting hearing the other day about the impact of a \nseries of cuts on children. The most moving part of the testimony was \nsome of the schoolteachers who talked about the fact of the loss of \nweight that is taking place with small children 7, 8, 9, 10-years-old \nduring the wintertime and particularly during the coldest months. It is \nreally unthinkable that that would happen here in America, but yet it \ndoes. We have an opportunity to do something about that hopefully this \nafternoon.\n  The study also found almost twice as many low-weight and \nundernourished children were admitted to Boston City Hospital's \nemergency room immediately following the coldest month of the winter. \nNo family should have to choose between heating and eating.\n  But it is the poor elderly that will be at the greatest risk if more \nLIHEAP funds are not made available, because they are the most \nvulnerable to hypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted for more \nthan half of all hypothermia deaths in 1991.\n  In addition, the elderly are much more likely to live in homes built \nbefore 1940 which are less energy efficient and put them at greater \nrisk.\n  Low-income elderly who have trouble paying their fuel bills are often \ndriven to rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and wood-burning \nstoves to save money. Between 1986 and 1990, such heating sources were \nthe second leading cause of fire deaths among the elderly. In fact, \nelderly citizens were up to 12 times more likely to die in heating-\nrelated fires than adults under 65.\n  Over 50 Senators have signed a letter urging the budget negotiators \nto allow States to draw down LIHEAP funds at the up-front rate if a \nfurther stopgap funding bill is enacted. I urge the Senate to support \nthis provision, so that families can receive the urgent assistance they \nneed.\n  Christmas is approaching, and in many parts of the country, \ntemperatures have dropped to levels close to those at the North Pole. \nBut Santa Claus does not release LIHEAP funds to the States--Congress \ndoes, and we must act quickly to avoid tragedy.\n  Let me summarize, Mr. President. This is not a question of increasing \nthe fiscal year 1996 appropriation for the LIHEAP Program, although I \nhope that the program will be fully funded in the next budget \nresolution.\n  What's at stake is the State's access to the LIHEAP funds that are \nalready available so that the elderly, disabled, working poor, and \ntheir children can be served before the temperature drops even further.\n  That is not a heavy lift for Congress. Over half of the U.S. Senate \nsigned a letter urging that States be allowed to draw down LIHEAP funds \nat the normal rate.\n  In October, 180 House Members signed a letter circulated by \nRepresentative Joe Moakley which requested that LIHEAP be funded at the \nlevel proposed in the Senate version of the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill--$900 million.\n\n[[Page S18700]]\n\n  In Massachusetts last winter, 42,000 out of the State's 137,000 \nLIHEAP households were elderly; 30,000 of the households also received \nsupplementary security income; 32,000 of the households were working-\npoor; 69,000 of the households received food stamps; 50,000 of the \nhouseholds received Social Security; and 45,000 of the households \nreceived Aid to Families with Dependent Children.\n  Cold weather does not play partisan politics. When the temperature \ndrops, it affects all people--Democrats and Republicans, Northerners \nand Southerners alike. It does not discriminate--it is an equal \nopportunity discomfort.\n  Mr. President, if we have an opportunity for the continuing \nresolution this afternoon, I know that Senator Wellstone will offer an \namendment to permit the expenditure of vitally needed funds to be \navailable to those 6 million Americans who today are in very difficult, \ndire circumstances because of the cold snap. If it is not, I join with \nthose who urge the President to use his Executive powers to be able to \nmove ahead with front end funding of those funds in an orderly way. \nClearly, the overwhelming sense of the Members of this body and of the \nHouse of Representatives is that of supporting getting these scarce \nresources out to the public. It will make absolutely no sense because \nof a technicality to restrict the flow of these funds over a 12-month \nperiod when the greatest need is now during the wintertime and where it \nhas been the wintertime since the establishment of this program, but \nbecause of a technical glitch we find ourselves under these \ncircumstances. This circumstance cries out for action.\n  So, Mr. President, I know I speak for all the families in \nMassachusetts that are dependent upon LIHEAP. They are facing a \ncritical situation. We cannot let this situation continue to go without \naction here in the House of Representatives and the Senate. We have \nserious business obviously in terms of the budget and the budget \npositions in terms of preserving Medicare and Medicaid and education \nand environmental issues, but this is an emergency situation that cries \nout for action. Whatever we are going to do on the budget will not be \naffected if we move ahead with advance funding to take care of the \nemergency needs of our elderly. It will not be affected. So we have to \ntake this action, and we welcome the bipartisan support that we have \nreceived here. It has been bipartisan in the Senate. It has been \nbipartisan in the House. And I am pleased that the President has \nindicated his strong support for getting this problem resolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18699-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18700-S18701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Now, according to estimates just released by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the deficit news is $1.1 billion \nworse.\n  Under the revised estimates, the negative budget impact of the \nRepublican student loan provisions has more than doubled--from $900 \nmillion to $2 billion in additions to the deficit if the Republicans \npersist in their misguided scheme to dismantle the highly successful \n``direct loan'' program for college students.\n  The bill vetoed by the President last week would have limited the \ndirect loan program to 10 percent of all loans, and earmarked 90 \npercent of student loans for banks and other middlemen.\n  Mr. President, what we had done in recent years was to develop a \ndirect loan program and permitted the guaranteed student loan program \nto go into effect. The total volume of direct loans is about 40 percent \nof all the student loans; 1,350 colleges and universities are \nparticipating in direct lending, accounting for 40 percent of loan \nvolume. Under the Republican compromise, it will be reduced to 10 \npercent.\n  We made efforts on the floor of the Senate to let the schools in \nMontana and throughout this country make their own judgments whether \nthey wanted to go to the direct loan program or go to the guaranteed \nloan program. Not one college or university in this country selected to \ngo from direct loan programs to guaranteed loan programs. Not one. It \nis a success with the students and with the administrators.\n  The Republican provision is among the most notorious and \nobjectionable special interest giveaways in the entire Republican \nbudget plan. Its obvious motive is to divert billions of dollars in new \nbusiness and higher profits to the banks and guaranty agencies in the \nguaranteed student loan program.\n  According to CBO, if direct lending is limited to 10 percent of \nloans, the banks and guaranty agencies would gain $103 billion in \nadditional business over the next 7 years, and an estimated $6 billion \nin higher profits.\n  This arbitrary Republican ceiling on the direct loan program would \nforce 2 million students and 1250 colleges out of direct lending and \nback into the bureaucratic maze of the guaranteed student loan program. \nRepublicans are asking Congress to swallow this blatant special \ninterest giveaway in the name of deficit reduction. But as the CBO's \nlatest estimate makes plainer than ever, there is no deficit reduction, \nand the addition to the deficit is greater than ever.\n  This problem began when the Republican budget adopted last May \ncontained a biased requirement for estimating the cost of direct \nstudent loans. The requirement was designed to make loans to students \nby banks under the guaranteed loan program appear cheaper than loans \nissued directly to students by the Federal Government. According to \nCBO's new estimate, the use of this biased procedure will add $6.5 \nbillion to the deficit over the next 7 years. Other student loan \nprovisions in the Republican budget save $4.5 billion over the same \nperiod, according to CBO's most recent calculations. Thus the net \neffect of the Republican student loan provisions is to add $2 billion \nto the deficit.\n  Under the previous CBO estimate, the biased budget rule added $5.8 \nbillion to the deficit, and was offset by $4.9 billion in savings, for \na net addition to the deficit of $900 million. Clearly, Republican \ndeficit concerns go out the window when corporate welfare like this is \nat stake.\n  Republicans would like us to believe that their attack on direct \nlending is designed to eliminate Government bureaucracy and stimulate \nthe private sector. But the guaranteed student loan program is hardly a \nmonument to corporate efficiency and free enterprise. It is a bloated \nbureaucracy consisting of 7,000 lenders, 41 guaranty agencies, and 25 \nsecondary markets who employ more than 5,000 people. That is 25 percent \nmore than the entire U.S. Department of Education and 10 times more \nthan the number of employees who actually administer the direct lending \nprogram.\n  In the private sector, companies take risks in the hope of making \nprofits. But there's no risk in the guaranteed student loan program. \nIt's all gravy. It's all corporate welfare. The banks and guaranty \nagencies reap all the profits and take none of the risks, because Uncle \nSam is guaranteeing payment of the loans. It's not free enterprise at \nall. It's a Government-sheltered industry that's grown up like Topsy \nunder the umbrella of Uncle Sam.\n  William Niskanen, who is now president of the Cato Institute, and was \nformerly a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President \nReagan, put it this way:\n\n       These guaranteed loans are a sweet deal for the banks; \n     unless they choose to collect on the loans, the banks provide \n     no services other than to make a loan guaranteed by the \n     federal government at a substantial premium above the rate if \n     they made the same loan to the government. Moreover, because \n     lenders have little incentive to be diligent collectors of \n     guaranteed loans, the government has set up a complex and \n     costly system of nonprofit guaranty agencies to manage these \n     loans.\n\n  Larry Lindsay, a member of the Federal Reserve Board appointed by \nPresident Bush, put it even more bluntly: ``As long as it is necessary \nto provide a profit to induce lenders to guarantee student loans, \ndirect lending will be cheaper.''\n  The cost-effectiveness of direct lending was confirmed just this week \nin a study by the audit committee of the \n\n[[Page S18701]]\nColorado Legislature. At the University of Colorado at Boulder and \nColorado State University, the implementation of direct lending saved \nthe universities $192,000 and $133,000, respectively, in a single \nacademic year.\n  Direct lending also works better for students and colleges than the \nguaranteed loan system. According to colleges participating in direct \nlending, it provides excellent service. The application is simpler and \nthe disbursing process is more prompt. Students spend less time filling \nout paperwork and waiting in lines. Loan funds get to students more \nquickly.\n  In 1993, when the University of Colorado at Boulder was using the old \nguaranteed loan program, only 3,000 checks were available to students \nby the first day of class. This year, under direct lending, 6,600 \nchecks were ready for students to buy needed books and supplies. One \nstudent called it ``the best thing since microwave brownies.''\n  Colleges and universities across the country share this view. In a \nsurvey by the Education Daily, more than 90 percent of participating \ncolleges and universities called direct lending ``excellent.''\n  Direct lending has also created more flexible repayment terms. It \ngives students the option of paying their loan back as a percentage of \ntheir income. When graduates are starting a family, working in their \nfirst job, starting a business, or going into public service work, they \ncan make smaller payments.\n  Our Republican colleagues claim that their budget bill would extend \nflexible repayment terms to students in the guaranteed loan program. \nBut under the Republican plan, the availability of flexible repayment \noptions, such as income-contingent repayment, would depend on whether a \nparticular guaranteed loan holder chooses to offer it.\n  Ask colleges and universities what they think. They're outraged at \nbeing forced out of one of the most successful reforms in the history \nof Federal aid to education. Some colleges and universities across the \ncountry have written urging Congress to reject this arbitrary limit on \ntheir ability to choose the loan program that best serves their \nstudents.\n  Over a hundred of the colleges that signed the letter are not in \ndirect lending. But they too recognize its benefit for their students. \nAs they put it:\n\n       Those of us who represent institutions that are satisfied \n     with the guaranteed student loan program also support the \n     continued availability of the direct loan program to \n     institutions. The competition created by direct lending has \n     induced banks and guarantors to improve the efficiency of \n     their delivery process, and has, for the first time, provided \n     the student loan industry with market-based incentives to \n     provide better service. The guaranteed student loan system \n     has improved more since the phase-in of direct lending two \n     years ago than it did over the more than two decades of \n     existence prior to 1993.\n\n  The message doesn't get much clearer. Colleges and universities \nacross the country are unanimous. The student loan system needs more \ncompetition, not less. With direct lending, both of loan programs have \nbeen working more efficiently because of the competition. What we \nsaying is let competition rule. Let colleges and universities make the \njudgment themselves, not have that dictated from Washington.\n  What are our Republican friends afraid of? Why not let the two \nsystems compete fair and square? Let the marketplace pick the winner, \nnot Congress.\n\n  It is hard to find a more vivid or disgraceful example of the \nprostitution of Republican principles. When a special interest's \nGovernment-guaranteed profits are at stake, Republicans are more than \nwilling to sell out free-market competition, and continue the heavy \nhand of a Government-guaranteed monopoly.\n  It's obvious what's happening here. Direct lending is taking colleges \nand universities by storm. It's one of the best new ideas in higher \neducation in years. It's good for colleges and good for students, and \nit saves Federal dollars.\n  Direct lending has already established its solid appeal to the \ncountry. It's already captured 40 percent of the market in 2 short \nyears.\n  So the guaranteed loan industry has mounted a desperate last-ditch \nlobbying campaign to persuade Congress to roll back direct lending.\n  Republicans should scrap their cynical attack on direct lending. They \nshould let competition work. They should allow colleges and \nuniversities to choose the kind of loan program they want. And if they \ndo, they'll find $2 billion more to put into deficit reduction at this \nstage of our balanced budget negotiation.\n  CBO has finally come out on this issue and found that this will be \nmore costly to the Federal taxpayers, something that we have known for \nsome period of time, and they have come out with that report at the \npresent time. That, I think, gives the administration strong arguments \nto stand by their position to give choice to the States and the \ncolleges and universities on which way they want to go, direct loans or \nguaranteed loan program.\n  We hear so much rhetoric, do not let Washington dictate what is good \nback home in Montana or Massachusetts.\n  If there is ever an example of that, Mr. President, it is permitting \nthe colleges and universities in our 50 States to make their own \njudgments which direction to go in, what we do now. When they go to the \ndirect loan, it saves the overall taxpayers billions of dollars. That \nhas been reaffirmed once again this afternoon with the Congressional \nBudget Office review of these figures and statistics which are the best \nevidence.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Virginia for permitting me the \nopportunity to address the Senate.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18700-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we have had very little \nsuccess in the first, what we thought would be a serious negotiation on \nthe budget. Apparently they were not serious. The offer by the \nPresident was filled with smoke and mirrors. I said earlier we might \nnot be around here this weekend. Now I think there is a great \nlikelihood we will be in session tomorrow and maybe unavoidably on \nSunday.\n  The House will probably send us a continuing resolution with some \nattachment. I am not certain quite what that would be. Maybe welfare \nreform. And that might take some debate, unless we get consent that \neverything passes by voice vote. So I need to alert my colleagues not \nto get too far away. And I will keep my colleagues informed as soon as \nI have further information.\n  But it appears that there is not much prospect, not much reason to \ncontinue trying to negotiate with the White House when they do not want \nto really get serious about balancing the budget over the 7 years \nwithout falling back on the old smoke and mirrors and things that we \nthought maybe had changed.\n  I think our next step would be to try to negotiate with some of our \nDemocratic colleagues who are concerned about the budget and welfare \nreform and saving Medicare and tax cuts for families with children. And \nthat will be pursued later this afternoon.\n  So I can only say that we will be here some time yet today, and \ndepending on when the House acts on the CR, probably tomorrow. But I \nwill try to give my colleagues the specific times. And maybe some may \nnot come in until afternoon depending again on how the House acts. I \ncannot give anybody more specificity, but as soon as I have information \nI will come to the floor and make an announcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18701-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18701-S18702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n\n                           Motion To Proceed\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 1530 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1530) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for fiscal year 1996, \n     and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 13, 1995.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the conference \nagreement on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1996 for approval by the Senate.\n  This conference agreement contains a broad range of authorities that \nare essential for the men and women who now serve in our Armed Forces, \nand for the effective operation of the Department of Defense. It is my \nhope that the Senate will pass this conference report, and the \nPresident will have the wisdom to sign it into law, because the \nimportant authorities it contains will significantly benefit our Armed \nForces and the failure to enact these authorities will significantly \ndisadvantage our troops. I am pleased that the House passed it today, \n267 to 149.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues and the administration clearly \nunderstand that this is a period of high risk and exceptional danger \nfor our military men and women. This is not the time to make defense a \npolitical issue. I want to caution my colleagues and the administration \nin the strongest terms not to politicize this bill at a time when the \neffects of such an action will be amplified to a high degree for every \nindividual soldier, marine, sailor, and airman who is now deploying as \npart of the implementation force in Bosnia.\n  The authorization bill contains abundant important elements of \nauthority for programs, systems, acquisitions, administration, and \noperations, and its passage will ensure that the Department will have \nthe best possible chance to conduct its work as efficiently as \npossible. Likewise, failure to pass the authorization bill will \nencumber and disadvantage the Department unnecessarily.\n  The President has committed more than 30,000 uniformed men and women \nto a hazardous and lengthy operation in the former Yugoslavia. I \nbelieve no one doubts that he is sending our troops in harm's way. Some \nof these people may lose their lives in hostile actions and accidents. \nThe President and the Congress must make every effort to ensure that \nnothing--absolutely nothing--is done to jeopardize or impede them in \nany way.\n  The Senate just passed a resolution to support these men and women \nunequivocally. The Senate has committed itself to providing our troops \nwith all the necessary resources and support to carry out their mission \nand ensure their security. Although the dollar resources for defense \nare addressed in part in the appropriations bill, which has been \nenacted, the detailed guidance and authority to conduct the business of \nthe Department of Defense, and to implement badly needed improvements, \nand to award new contracts and take care of families, are all contained \nin the authorization bill.\n  I would agree with the recent observation of my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, who commented during the debate on veterans \nappropriations that he found ``a number of ironies, as I speak, \nAmerican troops are being deployed in Bosnia. Every Senator who came to \nthis floor, debating the deployment of our troops pledged support for \nthem.'' Mr. President, I find it ironic that any Senator would consider \nblocking or voting against the defense authorization at this time or \nattempt to use this bill for political purposes. Politics must stop at \nthe water's edge when our forces are deployed to a hostile fire area.\n  Mr. President, it had been my impression that the Committee on Armed \nServices spent the last 3 months working in what had been its \ntraditional bipartisan manner to reach a mutually acceptable conference \nagreement. I am now disappointed to learn at this late date that the \nminority have felt excluded from the conference negotiations. I want to \nassure my colleagues that was not my intent. I am disappointed that the \nbipartisan atmosphere of the committee may be about to be compromised \nand jeopardize the defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to turn to the substance of this \nbill. This agreement is in line with the priorities we established last \nJanuary. I would summarize these priorities by saying there is a \nserious need to revitalize our Armed Forces in order to ensure our \nNation remains clearly able to deter and, if necessary, to counter any \nfuture threat to stability and security. This legislation provides the \ndirection and authority for that revitalization.\n  The conference agreement authorizes a 2.4 percent pay raise for the \nuniformed services, including the 20,000 men and women who will be \ndeployed in Bosnia and the thousands who will support them. If this \nagreement does not become law--and I want to repeat this, if this \nagreement does not become law--they will not receive this increase, and \nmilitary pay will lag even more than it does already. I find it \nunfortunate that the administration would choose to block this pay \nraise for the men and women it is now sending to Bosnia.\n  This agreement authorizes badly needed quality of life projects that \nare essential to family life and the retention of high quality people. \nIt authorizes important improvements to military family housing, \nbarracks, dining facilities, and work areas. Some critics of this bill \nwould have us believe these authorities are unnecessary or extravagant. \nMr. President, as we stand here today in the comfort of this Chamber, \nthere are military men and women who are standing in the mud, exposed \nto rain and snow while they maintain their vehicles, because they do \nnot have concrete hardstand in their motor pools. There are military \nmen and women who are living in barracks that are \nsubstandard. Improvements will not be available unless this agreement \n\n[[Page S18703]]\nis enacted. I want to repeat that: Improvements will not be available \nunless this agreement is enacted.\n\n  This bill also contains the authority to reform the acquisition and \nprocurement processes in accordance with the general effort to \nstreamline government. These reforms will enable the services to obtain \nnew equipment, supplies, and commercial products quickly and \nefficiently, instead of having to wait for the bureaucracy. It also \nreforms the process for managing the procurement of the information \ntechnology which provides our front-line troops with the latest and \nbest information about their situation.\n  I would like to point out that all the acquisition reform provisions \ncontained in sections D and E of the bill will be lost if the \nconference agreement is not enacted. Federal agencies will not be able \nto acquire technology from the commercial sector rapidly. The \nadministration will take the blame for failing to enable reform, \ndespite their extensive rhetoric about how such reforms are needed.\n  I am pleased that the conferees agreed that the military services \nhave been underfunded and, in many cases, overextended, and that these \nproblems had to be corrected. It is difficult to make the case, as some \nhave tried, that the budget proposed by the administration is adequate \nin light of testimony by the Comptroller of the Department of Defense \nthat defense is underfunded by approximately $50 billion. The General \nAccounting Office has concluded that the shortfall is actually closer \nto $150 billion. This legislation takes a step toward correcting this \nshortfall by authorizing $7 billion above the budget request. This is \nonly a small amount of the deficiency.\n  The additional budget authority is also necessary because the demands \nplaced upon our military in the past 2 years have been greater than \ntheir budgeted requirements. These demands came at a time when the \nforce was being reduced in the most dramatic drawdown since the end of \nthe Second World War, and often exceeded the operating tempo of the \ncold war years. As a result, current readiness declined late last year \nand funds were moved or budgeted by the administration from future \nreadiness accounts to current readiness accounts in order to prevent \nfurther movement toward a new hollow force.\n  The Committee on Armed Services took note of the decline and added \nfunds in this agreement to some current readiness accounts. However, I \nwould like to stress again to my colleagues that the greater problem in \nreadiness is not in the current readiness accounts but in modernization \nand procurement. These accounts remain significantly underfunded, and I \nam concerned that our Armed Forces may not have the modern, up-to-date \nequipment they will need to overmatch any potential adversary.\n  Procurement funding has declined by 44 percent since 1992 and \nprocurement is at the lowest level as a percentage of the budget since \nthe years prior to the Second World War. This means that many basic \nessentials are not being bought in sufficient quantities to meet \nrequirements and we are not investing today to achieve savings in the \nfuture. This also means the services must spend more of their budgets \nto keep older systems in operating order. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff has stated there is a serious deficiency in \nprocurement, and this agreement takes a step toward resolving that \ndeficiency.\n  Our Armed Forces were able to prevail in the Gulf war because they \nhad superior equipment that had been developed, built, and fielded long \nbefore the threat of an Iraqi invasion emerged. Our military men and \nwomen were superbly trained because we recognized the inherent value of \nkeeping our military trained and ready, not because we planned to fight \na war with Iraq. This experience serves to reinforce the lesson that \nyou cannot sacrifice future readiness in order to save current \nreadiness. Both must be funded adequately, or both will be lost.\n  That is the situation we confronted as we approached our work this \nyear, and we took our time in order to get it right. By proceeding \ncarefully and deliberately, the conferees ultimately achieved a \nresponsible, thoughtful, and effective authorization bill. Although \nthis legislation will serve as a roadmap to guide our national security \ninto the 21st century, it is not all that I had hoped for, and our task \nis not yet finished. However, this legislation addresses future \nreadiness requirements by adding substantial funds to procurement so \nthat our forces will have superior, modern systems ready for any future \nconflict.\n  The budget request raised grave concerns about the Navy's future \nforce structure, but the conferees addressed the most serious shortages \nin the area of seapower. The funds requested for shipbuilding were at \nthe lowest level since before 1950 and the number of ships, three, was \nthe lowest number since the Great Depression. Next year's shipbuilding \nbudget is even lower, and the Navy's 6-year shipbuilding plan will not \nsustain a fleet of 200 ships, let alone the 335 needed to meet the \nadministration's own bottom-up review force structure goals. \nShipbuilding budgets in the period beyond the 6-year plan will have to \nreach historical highs of $13 to $15 billion just to catch up.\n  By utilizing the additional resources made available for defense by \nthis year's budget resolution, the conferees were able to add $1.5 \nbillion in order to double the number of ships that will be bought this \nyear. There is now authority to procure six Arleigh Burke class \ndestroyers, two amphibious ships, and a Seawolf submarine. Ships that \nwere added are in the Navy's shipbuilding plan; those ships had been \nsqueezed into the outyears by the severe constraints of near-term \nbudgets.\n  Buying these ships now will: save money through more efficient \nproduction quantities; resolve severe deficiencies in amphibious lift; \nsustain the industrial base; provide combatants needed for fleet and \nballistic missile defense and long range land attack; and relieve \nextraordinary pressures on future shipbuilding budgets. This is a \nresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.\n  The committee also sought to sustain Marine Corps modernization. \nThere is authority to procure essential components such as: LHD-7 and \nLPD-17; the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle; additional AV-8B \naircraft; and the V-22 aircraft. Mine clearance and surface fire \nsupport are also strongly supported in this conference report, as is a \nwide spectrum of basic Marine Corps needs.\n  Since the end of the cold war, the committee has emphasized programs \nthat would counter the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. The conference report would authorize funds for the \ncounterproliferation support program. The nerve gas attacks in Japan \nand the bombing in Oklahoma this year highlight the need to protect not \nonly our military personnel, but also our citizens within the United \nStates, against the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist \norganizations or trans- national groups.\n  Now more than ever, our U.S. military relies on space to sustain a \nbroad mix of space- and ground-based capabilities to meet multiservice \nand joint warfighting requirements. These funds would accelerate the \ndevelopment and deployment of essential military technologies and \ncapabilities to combat nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological \nweapons.\n  The conference report would require the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Energy and other appropriate Government agencies to \nreport to Congress on their military and civil defense preparedness to \nrespond to these emergencies. The conference report would also \nauthorize the Department of Defense to provide assistance in the form \nof training facilities, sensors, protective clothing, antidotes, and \nother materials and expertise to Federal, State, or local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  In the area of arms control, the conference report authorizes funds \nthat would enable the United States to meet its treaty obligations to \ndestroy or dismantle chemical and strategic nuclear weapons and \nmaterial, as well as provide $300 million for the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, to aid the destruction of nuclear and chemical \nweapons in the former Soviet Union.\n  On the question of theater missile defense demarcation, the \nconference outcome is virtually identical to the Senate-passed \nprovision. This should alleviate concerns about constraining the \nPresident's prerogatives in negotiations while fulfilling the \nconstitutional responsibility of Congress to review the \n\n[[Page S18704]]\nresults of those negotiations. I believe we have addressed all the \nconcerns of the administration and the minority conferees.\n  On national missile defense, the conference agreement strikes a \nbalance between opposing views. The administration and others have \nargued that requiring deployment of a multiple-site national missile \ndefense system by a date certain would constitute an anticipatory \nbreach of the ABM Treaty. Although I do not agree with this argument, \nthe conferees attempted to satisfy this concern. The conference \nagreement requires the Secretary of Defense to develop an NMD system \nthat will achieve an initial operational capability by the end of 2003. \nHowever, we do not require that this be a multiple-site system, \nalthough it is clear that our ultimate goal is a multiple-site system.\n  I am very disturbed to hear some talk about vetoing this agreement \nover the ballistic missile defense provisions, because I believe the \nconference outcome is balanced and fair. If this veto comes to pass, it \nwill become clear that the administration's arguments over the ABM \nTreaty were merely attempts to block the deployment of any type of \nnational missile defense system, to include one that complies with the \nABM Treaty. At a time when we are about to deploy 20,000 Americans to \nBosnia, I find it hard to believe that the President would veto this \nimportant bill simply because he does not want the American people to \nhave a modest defense against ballistic missiles.\n  In matters relating to readiness, the conferees agreed to an approach \nto reform the process of allocating and performing depot-level \nmaintenance and repair. If this bill is not enacted, the administration \nwill be throwing away its best chance to reform the process by which \ndepot maintenance work is allocated and performed. The conferees also \nauthorized funds above the budget request for base operations, real \nproperty maintenance, and recruiting.\n  The section on Department of Energy national security programs \ncontains numerous important provisions to strengthen the U.S. nuclear \nweapons program. These include $118 million above the request for \nstockpile management. It also directs DOE to modernize its remaining \nmanufacturing plants in Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, and South Carolina. \nModernization is necessary to meet the near-term infrastructure \nrequirements of the nuclear posture review and signals that the United \nStates will maintain the capability to repair and refabricate our \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  The bill provides $50 million for the first year of an initiative to \nprovide a new source of tritium gas. Because tritium decays, and since \nwe ceased production in 1988, we must complete a new production \nfacility early in the next decade.\n  The bill authorizes several stockpile stewardship initiatives at the \nthree nuclear weapons laboratories in California and New Mexico, \nenabling us to determine whether DOE can maintain long-term confidence \nin our nuclear weapons without conducting underground nuclear testing.\n\n  The bill also focuses resources on cleaning up the highest priority \nnuclear waste problems at the former nuclear materials production \nsites, and accelerating certain clean up schedules. It also funds the \nisolation and reduction of spent nuclear fuel rods, some of which are \nbeginning to corrode.\n  This legislation sends the message to DOE that the maintenance of a \nsafe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile, sized to defense \nrequirements, continues to be the DOE's core mission and the primary \nreason for its existence. It also tells DOE to get on with real clean \nup at the highest priority nuclear waste problem sites.\n  To continue on the topic of environmental stewardship, the agreement \nestablishes uniform national discharge standards for vessels of the \nArmed Forces. This important environmental initiative will be lost if \nthe bill is not enacted.\n  Quality of life for military personnel and their families was an \nimportant priority for the committee. In the areas of personnel, \ncompensation, and health care, the conferees authorized a 2.4-percent \npay raise for members of the uniformed services effective January 1, \n1996. We also authorized a 5.2-percent increase in the basic allowance \nfor quarters to close the gap between the current allowance and actual \nhousing expenses.\n  The conferees changed the 1996 military retired pay cost-of-living \nadjustment to be effective March 1, 1996 and paid on April 1, 1996. In \n1997, the COLA will be effective December 1, 1996 and paid on January \n1, 1997. In 1998, military COLA will conform to the civilian COLA date. \nI am delighted that we were able to restore the alignment of the \nmilitary retiree and Federal civilian retiree COLA dates. This has been \na priority of the committee since 1993.I want to acknowledge the \ncontributions of my friend Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, for his help in making the COLA adjustment possible.\n  However, neither the full pay raise nor the retiree COLA equity \nprovision will take effect unless this agreement is enacted.\n  We directed the Secretary of Defense to establish a dental insurance \nplan for members of the selected reserve, similar to the active duty \ndependent dental plan, with voluntary enrollment and premium sharing. \nWe also authorized an income protection insurance plan for members of \nthe ready reserve.\n  With the cooperation of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we were able \nto adjust the automatic level at which service members enroll in the \nServicemen's Group Life Insurance Program to $200,000, effective April \n1, 1996. The last time we adjusted SGLI was during the Persian Gulf \nwar. Ironically, we need to make another adjustment to SGLI as we again \ndeploy U.S. forces in harm's way. I sincerely hope that no family finds \nitself in a position to receive this increased benefit, but I am \npleased that we were able to authorize the increase. However, it will \nnot take effect unless this bill is enacted.\n  The conferees also recommend $480 million above the budget request \nfor military construction, particularly for military housing, mission-\nrelated facilities, and revitalizing infrastructure. The conference \nagreement establishes new authorities for the construction and \nimprovement of military housing that will permit shared public-private \nfunding in order to maximize opportunities at the lowest cost possible.\n  This agreement also takes a major step toward a more streamlined \ngovernment acquisition process. Provisions of the bill will enable \ngreater access to commercial technologies for Federal agencies. These \ninclude relieving burdens on contractors who supply commercial items as \nwell as giving agencies the ability to acquire new commercial products \nfrom the marketplace. This will result in savings to the taxpayer and \ncreate new opportunities for businesses. We have taken this major step \nin acquisition reform while maintaining the requirement that contracts \nbe awarded using full and open competition.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues on the Committee on Armed Services for their cooperation and \nwisdom in developing and approving this agreement. I extend my \nappreciation to the distinguished ranking minority member of the \ncommittee, Senator Nunn, for his bipartisan work during the conference. \nI want to thank my staff director, Gen. Dick Reynard, and the majority \nstaff for their fine work. I would also thank General Arnold Punaro and \nthe minority staff for their contributions. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a list of the staff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Majority Staff\n\n       Charlie Abell, Tricia Banks, Les Brownlee, Dick Caswell, \n     Monica Chavez, Chris Cimko, Greg D'Alessio, Don Deline, Marie \n     Dickinson, Shawn Edwards, Jon Etherton, Pamela Farrell, \n     Melinda Koutsoumpas, Larry Lanzillotta, George Lauffer, \n     Shelley Lauffer, Steve Madey, John Miller, Ann Mittermeyer, \n     Bert Mizusawa, Joe Pallone, Cindy Pearson, Connie Rader, \n     Sharen Reaves, Dick Reynard, George Robertson (GPO staff), \n     Steve Saulnier, Cord Sterling, Eric Thoemmes, Trey Turner, \n     Roslyne Turner, Deasy Wagner, and Jennifer Wallace.\n\n                             Minority Staff\n\n       Dick Combs, Chris Cowart, Rick DeBobes, John Douglass, Andy \n     Effron, Jan Gordon, Creighton Greene, P.T.

The Senator from Georgia. \n  \n[[Page S18705]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, Senator Thurmond has shown great patience \nand endurance through a long and difficult negotiation with the House. \nI have great respect for Senator Thurmond and for his leadership. I \ncommend him for his diligent efforts. Without his strong efforts we \nwould have never been able to get this report out of conference.\n  It has been a very difficult year. I signed the conference report out \nof my great respect for Senator Thurmond, and I have also voted in \nfavor of the motion to proceed. This will give the Senate the \nopportunity to consider this conference report. As I said this morning \non the floor of the Senate, contrary to one newspaper article, I am not \nlobbying Senators to vote against this bill. To the contrary, I am \nmaking sure that everyone understands my position. I do have serious \nreservations. I will vote against the bill. But everyone will have the \nconference report before them and they can make up their own minds.\n  I think this bill deserves to be voted on. I have urged everyone on \nour side not to cause any kind of undue delay. There are a number of \nMembers who want to speak and there are a number of Members who will \nspeak, I am sure. But it is certainly my hope that we will be able to \ncome to a conclusion on this bill. I will do everything I can to \ncooperate in bringing this bill to a vote and in making sure the \nconference report is sent to the President for whatever he may decide \nto do.\n  As I said on the floor of the Senate this morning, and as I said when \nI signed the conference report earlier this week, I have serious \nreservations about the conference report and I will vote against the it \nwhen we vote. I also made it clear this morning that, in my judgment, \nthe report speaks for itself. Each Senator can readily make his or her \nown judgment as to whether the conference report merits their support.\n  On Monday I will give a detailed speech outlining my concerns--\nassuming we are on the conference report on Monday, or whenever we are \non it. For now, I will just highlight my major objections.\n  The ballistic missile defense legislation contains national defense \nlanguage which goes well beyond the mandates both of the House-passed \nand of the Senate-passed bill. As Senators will recall on this subject, \nduring the debate on the Senate bill, Senator Thurmond asked that \nSenator Levin and I join Senator Warner and Senator Cohen to work on \nthe missile defense language because there were obviously a great \nnumber of Senators who were very concerned about that language. A \nnumber of us had voted against that language in the committee. I was \nconcerned about it. It was apparent that the bill on the Senate floor \nwas going to have a hard time being brought to a conclusion without \nsome consensus on ballistic missile defense.\n  We spent about 4 or 5 days working very carefully with every word of \nthat language. We made very substantial changes from what had come out \nof the Senate committee. We worked closely with the White House to make \nsure that whatever product we presented as a compromise would be \nsomething that the President would be able to sign. We achieved that \nthrough a great deal of effort. In the conference to work this out, I \nagain worked with Senator Thurmond and others, including Congressman \nCurt Weldon on the House side, and Members on our side, to try to \nachieve a compromise between the Senate and the House versions in a way \nthat would not lose the approval of the administration. The \nadministration had been reluctant to move as far as we did on the \nSenate bill but did agree with it before we passed that bill.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line of all this is that the missile \ndefense language in this act goes well beyond the mandates both of the \nHouse-passed bill and the Senate-passed bill. I will go into more \ndetail on Monday on this, or whenever I speak again. But this is not an \nissue to be taken lightly. This is not an issue that is a question of \none word or two words or one sentence. This is enormously important.\n  We have achieved, under Republican Presidents primarily, an arms \ncontrol agreement called START II. That arms control agreement, I \nbelieve, has come out of the Foreign Relations Committee now. Although \nI am not certain, I believe the vote was unanimous.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that all the defense experts that I know \nhave concluded that this agreement is in the best national security \ninterests of the United States and Russia. This START II Treaty has not \nbeen approved by the Duma in Russia and it is much more controversial \nthere than it is here. The one thing we know is that if we convey the \nimpression in this bill or in this conference report that the United \nStates Senate is going to breach in any way or disregard or have an \nanticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty, that action will make it \nextremely unlikely that the Russian Duma will ratify the START II \nTreaty.\n  In the name of protecting our own country against missiles that may \nbe aimed against this country in the future, it would be the supreme \nfolly if we passed a piece of legislation that is going to unwind the \nefforts made by several Presidents to get to the point where we have \ndramatically reduced the number of Russian missiles that are aimed at \nthe United States. Those reductions are going to occur in START II, if \nthat treaty is ratified. If we do something in this legislation, \nwhether we intend it or not, that inadvertently causes that treaty not \nto be ratified in the Russian Duma, then we would have taken probably \nthe most gigantic step backward in arms control that we have taken in \nmany years.\n  I emphasize, this START II Treaty basically requires dismantling \nliterally thousands of missiles that for years have been aimed at the \nUnited States, including missiles that we called MIRV'd, multiple \nwarhead missiles. We have feared for years that these missiles could \ncause tremendous problems in terms of the nuclear balance and could \nlead to an incentive for one side to strike first.\n  This is not trifling. This is not picking at words. Every word in \nthis Missile Defense Act is of great importance and the White House, \nthe Department of Defense, and the National Security Council and the \nState Department have every reason to examine every word. And, \nregarding things to which we do not completely attach the same \nsignificance, we must remember that they are the ones negotiating with \nthe Russians. They are the ones in touch with the Russians on a day-by-\nday basis, and it is the executive branch that really has to work on \nthis matter. So we have to have, I think, some deference to their \njudgment.\n  This conference struggled and tried. We tried to get it worked out. I \nthink it was a good-faith effort by Senator Lott, the Senator from \nMississippi, Congressman Weldon, myself and others. But we did not \nachieve that goal, primarily because the House insisted we continue to \nwork from the House language. Every time we worked out one problem with \ntwo or three words here, two or three words there, instead of working \noff the Senate language so we would have known what the underlying \nfundamental provisions were, it came back in some sort of a new \nconglomeration of House language. All of this is in multiple pages, \nanywhere from 10 to 20 pages. Therefore, we had to go over every word \nagain.\n  This went on and on and on. Finally, I had suggested many times that \nwe should work off the Senate language, which would have narrowed the \nscope of what we had to examine. But, finally the time came when I know \nSenator Thurmond had to make a decision, as did his counterpart, \nCongressman Spence, to complete this conference report. I understand \ntheir position. But this is enormously important. The Department of \nDefense and the White House disagree with this language. There are \nlegitimate and sincere fears that this kind of language could end up \nbeing extremely counterproductive to our Nation's security. I share \nthose apprehensions and I will urge all Senators to take a close look \nat this language.\n  My second problem with this bill is that it includes a specific \nlegislative provision that would abolish the statutory requirement \nwhich came from the Congress of the United States--Senator Cohen and I \nled the way on this--for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special \nOperations in Low Intensity Conflict.\n  I believe that abolishing that statutory authority could undermine \ncivilian oversight of special operations. Special operations forces are \nabsolutely necessary. These are the specialists. These are the people--\nthe SEALS \n\n[[Page S18706]]\nand the special forces--who go into very dangerous situations in almost \nevery area. They are the best trained military individuals we have. \nThey take the most risk. They are in many types of activities, \nincluding activities of a highly classified nature.\n  The Special Operation Force was begun by a legislative act which \nSenator Cohen and I co-authored. We decided at that time--and I think \nthat the wisdom of that decision has been demonstrated very clearly--\nthat, if we are going to have those kinds of special forces, we need \ncivilian control not just in the general sense but in the sense of \nhaving an Assistant Secretary of Defense who is responsible for the \nSpecial Operation Forces. The issue is civilian control. We do not want \nto lose the civilian control of those forces.\n  But this legislation, in my view, mistakenly abolishes the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict. \nThat does not mean, in theory, that there will not continue to be \ncivilian control with the Secretary of Defense in charge. It means that \nthe focus of civilian control over special operations on a daily and \nweekly basis is likely to be eliminated with the abolishment of the \nstatutory requirement for that position. I think this is a mistake. It \nis a fundamental mistake.\n  There is legislation in the conference report in which I know many \npeople will be interested on the floor of the Senate because, again, it \naddresses another position that was created by the Congress. I know the \nSenator from Arkansas and the Senator from Iowa were very involved in \nan effort that language in this conference report that would abolish: \nthe statutory requirement for an independent Director of Operational \nTest and Evaluation. Many fear--and I share this fear--that abolishing \nthe statutory requirement for this position could undermine objective, \nunbiased testing of major weapons systems. In other words, it would \nabolish the statutory requirement to get testing and evaluation away \nfrom the program managers who have been somewhat generous in seeing \nthat it worked which many times resulted in a lack of objectivity \neither in reality or in perception.\n  Another problem I have with this conference report is that the Naval \nPetroleum Reserve sale provision establishes a 1-year timeframe for the \nsale even though the budget reconciliation bill no longer mandates sale \nwithin 1 year. Originally, this was mandated in the reconciliation bill \nin order to raise revenue. The Naval Petroleum Reserve is a complex \noperation, and compressing the timeframe for sale to within 1 year, I \nbelieve, is insufficient time. I fear that the taxpayers will not get \nthe maximum value through knowledgeable competitive bidding. It could \ngive one or two companies a real inside position on an enormous amount \nof value in terms of competitive bidding. So, that is also a provision \nabout which I am concerned, Mr. President.\n  I also have problems with the directive for procurement of specific \nships at specific shipyards that are not tied to any clear industrial \nbase requirement. Sometimes it is justified, but when there is no \nindustrial base requirement, it undermines the cost-saving potential of \ncompetition. This is micromanagement in a sense that costs the \ntaxpayers money in almost every case.\n  Mr. President, I think this bill has a vast number of certifications \nand reports, and it gets into micromanagement. We have had some of that \nin past bills. I do not say that it is unique in this one. But it is of \nconcern.\n  I am also concerned about Buy American provisions for ships and naval \nequipment which will result in significant cost increases for naval \nvessels and which could produce an unfavorable reaction against U.S. \nmilitary sales abroad.\n  Mr. President, military equipment is one of the areas where we have a \ntrade surplus. If we start putting numerous provisions in here saying \nyou can only buy this product from America, the people who are going to \nend up paying the price are the workers for aerospace companies and for \nother companies that now have very strong export business. Believe me, \nwhen you put a Buy American provision in here, you pay a price for it. \nOther countries retaliate, and there we go in terms of restricting \ntrade and increasing prices.\n  Mr. President, I also am concerned about something which I know the \nappropriators have felt keenly about in the past. I am not sure how \nthey feel about it at this point in time. But Senator Byrd and I have \ntalked about this on numerous occasions in relation to this bill. There \nare mandated spending floors in the shipbuilding language; that is, \nrequirements that say you have to spend this much money--not an \nauthorization saying you can spend this much money, but a floor saying \nyou have to spend this much money.\n  Mr. President, this directly contravenes a longstanding agreement \nbetween the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committees \nwhere I, at least as chairman, pledged not to place floors in the \nauthorization bill. We put the ceiling on. We say you cannot spend any \nmore in this area or that area. But, in this conference report, we \nbecome the floor. If we say you cannot spend any less, that in effect \ncuts out the appropriations process in that particular area.\n  The reason I object to this is because I think the appropriators must \nrespect that we are the ceiling. If they do not pay attention to our \nceiling, if they go over those ceilings, there is no point of an \nauthorization process. In other words, if we say that we are not only \nthe ceiling but we are also the floor, you cannot spend more but you \nalso cannot spend less than this for a certain item, then it undermines \nthe appropriations process.\n  The only way authorization and appropriations can work together is if \nwe are the ceiling on weapons systems and on major considerations and \nif the appropriators have the ability to come and cut under our amount \nas they see in their discretion.\n  Finally, there is an earmark for noncompetitive ship maintenance \ncontracts for a specific shipyard. I do not know that the amount of \nmoney involved is vast. I am not sure how much the amount of money is. \nI will find out by the time of my next speech on this subject. But I \nthink the principle of having an earmark for a noncompetitive \nmaintenance contract for a specific shipyard is a very bad practice \nthat will cost the taxpayers money. It certainly does away with \ncompetition. And that can, as we have seen in the past, cause a \ncontainment problem. If one shipyard has it, another shipyard wants it. \nAnd if another shipyard has it, the other shipyard wants it. Pretty \nsoon you have eliminated competition and you have gone to a very \nserious erosion of stewardship in terms of the taxpayers' money.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is the creation of a special \ncongressional panel on submarines. This probably will not concern other \nSenators. It concerns me because that is our job on the Armed Services \nCommittee. But, this bill creates a congressional panel, and I think \nthat needlessly duplicates the oversight role of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement I released \nwhen this conference report came out be printed in the Record, and I \nwill make further remarks at a later point in time during this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                December 13, 1995.\n\n\n senator sam nunn (d-ga), ranking member of the senate armed services \n           committee, today released the following statement\n\n       I congratulate Senator Thurmond upon the completion of the \n     House-Senate conference on the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1996. Senator Thurmond has shown great \n     patience and endurance through a long difficult negotiation \n     with the House.\n       Out of respect for Senator Thurmond, particularly in his \n     first year as chairman, I have signed the conference report. \n     This will give the Senate the opportunity to consider the \n     report. I want to make it clear, however, that I have serious \n     reservations about the conference report, and I plan to vote \n     against the report when it is considered by the Senate.\n       During the conference, the Administration raised a number \n     of important objections to the bill:\n       The Administration identified constitutional problems with \n     the restrictions on the President's foreign policy and \n     Commander-in-Chief powers imposed by the provisions on \n     contingency funding and UN Command and Control.\n       The Administration also raised serious objections to the \n     ballistic missile defense legislation, which contains \n     National Missile Defense language that goes well beyond the \n\n[[Page S18707]]\n     mandates of both the House-passed and Senate-passed bills.\n       The Administration has expressed serious concerns about the \n     impact of the proposed conference report language on Russian \n     consideration of the START II Treaty, which is designed to \n     produce a major reduction in Russian nuclear weapons.\n       The Administration is also concerned that the language \n     could lead the Russians to abandon other arms control \n     agreements if they conclude that it is U.S. policy to make \n     unilateral action to abandon the ABM Treaty.\n       I have serious reservations about these provisions and \n     numerous other provisions of the conference report, \n     including:\n       Legislation that would abolish the statutory requirement \n     for an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations \n     and Low Intensity Conflict, which could undermine civilian \n     oversight of special operations.\n       Legislation that would abolish the statutory requirement \n     for an independent Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation, which could undermine unbiased testing of major \n     weapons systems.\n       The Naval Petroleum Reserve Sale provision, which unwisely \n     establishes a one-year time frame for the sale, even though \n     the budget reconciliation bill no longer mandates sale within \n     a year. The one year period is insufficient to ensure that \n     the taxpayers get the maximum value through knowledgeable \n     competitive bidding.\n       Directed procurement of specific ships at specific \n     shipyards without a clear industrial base requirement, which \n     undermines the cost-saving potential of competition.\n       Buy American provisions for ships and naval equipment which \n     will result in enormous cost increases for naval vessels and \n     which could produce an unfavorable reaction against U.S. \n     military sales abroad--one of the strongest elements of our \n     export economy.\n       Mandated spending ``floors'' in the shipbuilding language--\n     requirements to spend specified amounts for particular \n     programs--which directly contravene the longstanding \n     agreement between the Armed Services and Appropriations \n     Committees to not place ``floors'' in the Authorization bill.\n       An earmarked non-competitive ship maintenance contract for \n     a specific shipyard.\n       Creation of a special congressional panel on submarines, \n     which needlessly duplicates the oversight role of the Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       Failure to include Senate-passed provisions which should \n     have been non-controversial, such as U.S.-Israeli Strategic \n     Cooperation, the Defense Business Management University, and \n     a North Dakota land conveyance that meets all of the Senate's \n     objective criteria.\n       Weakening the Senate-passed formula for equity in cost-of-\n     living adjustments for military retirees.\n       Designating every single line of National Guard and Reserve \n     procurement funds, rather than providing generic categories \n     that can be used by the Department of Defense to meet \n     priority Guard and Reserve requirements.\n       Earmarking Department of Energy defense funds for numerous \n     unrequested projects and programs at designated sites.\n       Restrictions on access of servicewomen and dependents \n     overseas to privately-funded abortions, and the imposition of \n     special discharge procedures for HIV-positive \n     servicemembers--a small fraction of our military population--\n     which needlessly inject domestic political issues into \n     military manpower policies.\n       I recognize that the Senate could not prevail on all \n     issues. There are many other compromises within the \n     conference report which I do not particularly support but \n     which I understand in the context of the give and take of \n     conference. The issues I have raised in this statement, \n     however, represent fundamental flaws in the conference \n     agreement.\n       If the conference report is not approved by the Senate, or \n     if the legislation is vetoed by the President, we will have \n     an opportunity to correct these flaws. The conference report \n     contains important legislative authorities, such as:\n       A variety of military pay and allowance provisions.\n       Approval of Secretary Perry's family and troop housing \n     initiative.\n       Detailed acquisition reform legislation that complements \n     last year's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act.\n       Senator Thurmond and the Committee worked long and hard to \n     develop these important provisions, and I pledge to work \n     towards their enactment in a subsequent bill if the \n     legislation in this conference report is not enacted into \n     law.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I repeat for all Senators that I think we \nought to have a good debate on this bill. I think there are things that \nare serious here that ought to be discussed. Voting against this bill \nis certainly not something that I relish.\n  There is military pay in here for our troops. I hope we can find some \nother way because I do not want to go through the process of replacing \na number of provisions in this bill. But, on the matter of military \npay, I will do everything I can, if this bill does not become law, to \nsee that we find another vehicle. I think it is enormously important \nthat we be able to resolve that problem before we go home.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \ncouple of questions. I do not want to take the time of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, but the committee report on the B-2 bomber is mildly \nconfusing.\n  I just wonder if the distinguished ranking member could enlighten us \nas to what discretion the Pentagon has on how it spends the additional \n$493 million that is authorized for B-2's?\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Arkansas that is a good question. I \nthink that ought to be directed to the majority. I was not in on that \nnegotiation. I have read that language and I would be hesitant to try \nto interpret it. I think Senator Cohen has been involved in it, and \nalso Senator Lott. I am sure Senator Thurmond is familiar with it. So, \nI think you would be better served to direct the questions to them.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. For the benefit of the majority, who apparently crafted \nthis report, I would like to say there is something here that is \n``passing strange,'' as we say in Arkansas. The report says, \n``Therefore, the Senate conferees believe that the increased \nauthorization of $493 million provided for the B-2 bomber program may \nbe expended only for procurement of B-2 components, upgrades, and \nmodifications that are of value for the existing fleet of B-2 \nbombers.''\n  At another place, it says, ``The conferees agree to authorize the \nbudget request for research and development and to increase the \nauthorization for procurement.''\n  So, I do not know whether the Pentagon has the authority to start \nbuying 20 additional bombers or not. The thing that is strange to me \nabout this is it says, ``Therefore, the Senate conferees believe.'' It \ndoes not say the House conferees believe. I was curious as to how this \ncould be written with the Senate conferees believing one thing and the \nHouse conferees believing something else. Both sides usually have to \nconcur, do they not?\n\n  On another matter. Let me say to the distinguished ranking member \nalso, he touched on the plan to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk \nHills, which really hit a nerve with me. I think it is the height of \nfolly financially and economically to be selling off such assets and \ntake credit for it under the Budget Reconciliation Act. Until this year \nit was specifically prohibited to count the sale of assets in budget \ndeficit reduction. In other words, CBO was not to score asset sales.\n  I thought that was a good rule. I have tried to reinstate it a couple \nof times and came within a couple of votes of getting it done. I think \nit was Mr. Bowsher who used to be at CBO who said that selling assets \nto reduce the deficit reminded him of the lawyer that came home from \nwork one day and told his wife he had a great day, and she said, ``What \nhappened?'' He said, ``I sold my desk.'' That is what we do when we \nsell off assets.\n  One other question, because the Senator from Georgia was very active \nin crafting the so-called ABM language when that bill was in this \nChamber. My staff has indicated to me that this bill would torpedo the \nABM Treaty. Could the Senator from Georgia comment on that?\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Arkansas, I would not go quite that \nfar. I would say that is the apprehension that the interpretation of \nthis language could lead some, perhaps all in the Russian Duma that \nwill be considering this, to believe that this is in the nature of what \nI would call, for lack of a better term going back to law schools days, \nan anticipatory breach.\n  I do not think anyone could say that this is a direct breach because \nnothing has happened. Passing a law does not make it happen. But there \nis an old story from law school I recall well in a course on contracts \nin which the professor was trying to explain what anticipatory breach \nmeant, and he said:\n\n       Let's assume that a man goes from Atlanta, Georgia, to New \n     York and negotiates for 2 weeks to sell the Hurt Building. \n     This was a big building in downtown Atlanta. Now it is not \n     one of the big ones, but it was well known back when I was in \n     law school.\n       He finally concludes the contract. They sign the deal, and \n     the buyer agrees to buy it for a certain amount and the \n     seller agrees to sell it. And so the buyer says, ``Let's go \n     out to dinner and celebrate. We have been negotiating long \n     and hard.'' But the seller says, ``No, I can't do it. I've \n     got to rush back to \n\n[[Page S18708]]\n     Atlanta.'' The buyer then said, ``Why? You have been here 2 weeks. Why \n     don't you relax and celebrate. You have just sold a big \n     building. I don't see why you have to go back to Atlanta.'' \n     To which the seller replied ``Because I have to go back down \n     there and buy that building.''\n\n  Well, he just sold something he did not own. Now, the contract did \nnot call for performance for another 30 days. So it was not direct \nbreach, but it is in the legal terms an anticipatory breach. And that \nis what the fear is here, that this could be taken as anticipatory \nbreach.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think the Senator describes the situation perfectly.\n  I might say, Mr. President, this is not particularly apropos of the \nstory he just told, but it is one that might introduce a little levity \nhere on a Friday afternoon.\n  Chet Lock, who used to be Lum, in Luck and Abner, became a very good \nfriend of mine when I ran for Governor the first time, and he told me a \ngreat story about a fellow who owned a horse and another fellow who \ncame by one afternoon. The visitor said, ``What would you all take for \nthat horse?'' He owner said, ``I'd take a hundred dollars.'' And the \nvisitor said, ``I think I'll buy him.'' So he paid a hundred dollars \nand took his horse home. And the original owner could not sleep that \nnight. He got to thinking: If that horse is worth a hundred dollars to \nhim, certainly it would be worth more than that to me.\n  So he called the guy the next morning and said, ``Listen, that horse \nis pretty dear to me. I raised him from a foal and I really hate to \npart with him. I will give you $200 to buy him back.'' The other said, \n``Well, come and get him.'' So he went over and gave the guy $200. And \nthe other fellow got to thinking that night: He knows something I don't \nknow or he wouldn't have given me a hundred dollars' profit on that \nhorse. The next day he called him back and said, ``I will give you $400 \nfor to buy that horse back.'' This kept going on until they got the \nhorse up to about $3,000, and one morning one of them called the other \nand said, ``I've called to make you an offer on the horse. Can I come \nand get him? I will pay you $200 more than you paid me.'' The other man \nsaid, ``I can't do that. I sold the horse.'' He said, ``You sold the \nhorse?'' The other said, ``Yes, sold him to somebody else.'' And the \nfirst man said, ``Why would you do that? We were both making a good \nliving off of him.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas leaves the floor, I hope to make some reply about this Elk \nHills situation. Is the Senator aware that the sale of this was \nproposed by the President and one of his Cabinet officers?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am sorry; will the Senator repeat the question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Is the Senator from Arkansas aware that the proposed sale \nof Elk Hills was initiated by President Clinton and one of his Cabinet \nofficers, Secretary O'Leary.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was aware of that, and I said earlier in the Chamber \nthe President has a right to be wrong just like everybody else.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I think that concludes my rebuttal to the Senator.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that I can place into the Record \na letter from the Secretary of Energy dated May 4, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill to authorize \n     privatization of the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves. \n     This legislation, which is proposed in the President's FY \n     1996 Budget, is part of the Administration's ongoing effort \n     to reinvent the Federal Government.\n       The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, consisting of \n     Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3 and Oil Shale \n     Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3, were designated by Executive \n     Order near the start of this century to provide an emergency \n     source of fuel for the Navy's fleet as it converted from coal \n     to oil. In response to the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, \n     Congress passed the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act \n     of 1976, which significantly altered the mission of the Naval \n     Petroleum Reserves, requiring that these Reserves be produced \n     at their ``maximum efficient rate'' in order to ensure a \n     reliable fuel supply for national security.\n       Since 1976, oil and gas from the Naval Petroleum and Oil \n     Shale Reserves have been sold on the commercial market, to \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or to the Department of \n     Defense. The program has been highly successful, returning \n     approximately $16 billion to the U.S. Treasury, against total \n     costs of just over $3.1 billion. The program continues to be \n     a revenue generator, still returning in excess of $200 \n     million in net revenues to the U.S. Treasury annually.\n       The enclosed proposal has several elements. First, the \n     proposal would authorize the Department to privatize the \n     Government's interest in the Reserves (excluding Oil Shale \n     Reserve Numbered 2) by the end of FY 1997. The Administration \n     believes sale of the Reserves will generate proceeds of $2.6 \n     billion, which is the current estimate of the discounted \n     value of the revenues to the Federal Government from the \n     properties. A percentage of proceeds from privatization would \n     be paid to the State of California to benefit the Teachers' \n     Retirement Fund. This payment would resolve a long-standing \n     land dispute with the State of California. Second, the \n     proposal would modernize the statute governing the operation \n     of the Naval Petroleum Reserves to ensure that the benefits \n     to taxpayers are maximized pending privatization.\n       Finally, if privatization of the Reserves is disapproved by \n     the President or Congress, the proposal would transfer the \n     management of the Reserves to a for-profit, wholly owned \n     Government corporation, authorized to maximize net revenues \n     through commercial management and operating decisions. In \n     keeping with the Administration's emphasis on protecting the \n     environment, we also recommend that appropriate portions of \n     Oil Shale Reserve Numbered 2 be studied for possible \n     inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers system.\n       The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 \n     directed the Secretary to ``study management alternatives for \n     the Reserves, including the concept of corporatization.'' The \n     proposed legislation would respond to that directive and \n     allow the Administration to maximize the value of the Naval \n     Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves.\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985 (the ``Balanced Budget Act'') requires that all revenue \n     and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-you-go \n     requirement through FY 1998. That is, such a bill should not \n     result in an increase in the deficit, and if it does, it \n     would trigger a sequester if not fully offset. The Naval \n     Petroleum Reserves Privatization Act will result in proceeds \n     of approximately $2.6 billion in FY 1997. A provision of the \n     Balanced Budget Act generally prohibits counting the proceeds \n     of asset sales as offsets to spending. However, the enclosed \n     legislation includes a provision (Sec. 202) to allow the \n     proceeds to be counted as offsets to spending. This provision \n     is patterned after the waivers of emergency spending provided \n     by the Balanced Budget Act and is being proposed for several \n     asset sales being recommended by the Administration for FY \n     1996.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     enactment of this proposal would be in accord with the \n     President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n\n       Enclosure.\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could make a brief observation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Whatever time is necessary.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would say two things on that point. One is in the \noriginal reconciliation bill there was a mandate for sale, so when we \nbrought this through the committee we debated it, we put safeguards in \nit, and there were many of us who were concerned that the timeframe was \ntoo compressed. When the President originally proposed this, he \nproposed it over a 2-year period.\n  The difficulty, I say to my friend from Virginia, is not so much the \nsale itself. But if there is going to be a sale of this very large \nasset, the feeling has been that it ought to be over a period of time \nsufficient so that other companies that may bid, so they can go in and \nstudy it, and so forth.\n  The provision in this bill is 1 year. So it is a move from the \nadministration request of 2 years to 1 year, and that greatly \ncompresses the schedule and puts on a whole lot more pressure. That was \nnot put in by the Senate, but the House. I understand the House \nconferees insisted on it, and I think it is a mistake.\n  There is a safeguard here that the Secretary of Energy can negate the \nsale, but there will be great pressure for her not to do so because, if \nshe negates the sale saying she cannot do it in 12 months, then there \nwould be no authority to make the sale. So the pressure is going to be \nthere for an early, quick sale of this asset, particularly if this bill \nbecomes law, and particularly with the pressure on the budget. That is \nwhat the problem is. \n\n[[Page S18709]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might reply to my distinguished \ncolleague, I am advised that senior DOE officials have stated that the \n1 year period as required by the Senate bill was reasonable in their \njudgment. And I would like at this point to put a second letter into \nthe Record from the Deputy Secretary of Energy, dated November 13, \n1995. I read one paragraph:\n\n       In general, with the exception of Senate provisions related \n     in the treatment of the State of California ``school lands'' \n     claim, the Administration prefers the NPOSRs privatization \n     provisions included in the Senate bill. In addition to \n     congressional sale notifications and procedural safeguards \n     included in both the House and Senate bills, the Senate bill \n     provides enhanced safeguards guards against ``fire sales'' of \n     the reserves, by authorizing the Secretary of Energy to \n     notify Congress if it is not proceeding in the best interests \n     of the United States and by authorizing the Secretary of \n     Energy to notify Congress of any slippage of the sales \n     schedule.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               The Deputy Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: As the Conferees on the FY 1996 \n     Defense Authorization bill meet to resolve differences. I \n     would like to emphasize the Administration's support for \n     privatization of the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves \n     (NPOSRs) including Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk \n     Hills). The Elk Hills Reserve is by far the largest and most \n     valuable of the NPOSRs. This commercial oil and gas operation \n     is most appropriately and efficiently owned and operated by \n     the private sector.\n       In general, with the exception of Senate provisions related \n     in the treatment of the State of California ``school lands'' \n     claim, the Administration prefers the NPOSRs privatization \n     provisions included in the Senate bill. In addition to \n     congressional sale notifications and procedural safeguards \n     included in both the House and Senate bills, the Senate bill \n     provides enhanced safeguards against ``fire sales'' of the \n     reserves, by authorizing the Secretary of Energy to notify \n     Congress if any proposed sale is not in the best interest of \n     the United States, by requiring congressional approval of any \n     sale for which there is only one offer, and by authorizing \n     the Secretary of Energy to notify Congress of any slippage of \n     the sale schedule.\n       Regarding the treatment of the State of California ``school \n     lands'' claim, while the Administration recognizes that \n     California has not been successful in its legal claim, the \n     Administration believes that it is appropriate to provide a \n     portion of the proceeds from the sale of Naval Petroleum \n     Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk Hills) to the State of California for \n     payment into the California Teachers' Retirement Fund. This \n     position, as was the position reflected in the \n     Administration's bill, is based on equitable considerations.\n       I reiterate the Administration's support for inclusion of \n     privatization of the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves \n     in the Conference report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles B. Curtis.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, as he \nrecalls in the committee, there were a number of us who voiced \nobjections, and the administration at that stage was in favor of the 1-\nyear provision. I think the Senator is right. They, too, were seeking \nmoney. I did not agree with the administration on that.\n  I am not here speaking for the administration on this. I am saying I \nthink it is shortsighted, whether it is the administration or whether \nit is Congress, to compress the timeframe for the sale of this to a 1-\nyear period because I think it puts enormous pressure on it and it \ngives undue leverage to the oil companies that are most familiar with \nit.\n  It takes quite a while for an oil company to go out and find out \nenough about Elk Hills to make a reasonable bid. I thought it was a \nmistake to put it in the form of a mandate. If it is going to be sold, \nit should not be on the pretension it helps balance the budget. It does \nnot matter whether it is sold in 1996 or 1997, it will supply the same \namount of money.\n  It will be the height of folly if we try to sell it in 1996 and get a \nlot less money for the taxpayers, and not give 2 or 3 years to the oil \ncompanies to make the kind of assessment needed for a confident and \nvigorous competitive process.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may reply, the provision of the bill in the \nconference report provides a number of safeguards to ensure the \ntaxpayers' interests will be preserved. First, the provision \nestablishes a minimum price based on an average of five independent \nexperts' assessments of the value of the field; and, second, the \nprovision provides the Secretary of Energy the authority to suspend the \nsale if she and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \ndetermine that the sale is proceeding in a manner that is inconsistent \nwith the achievement of the sale price that reflects the full value of \nthe reserve or a course of action other than immediate sale of reserve \nis in the best interest of the United States.\n  And, Mr. President, I really feel those safeguards adequately protect \nthe taxpayers' interests.\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could just respond. I say to my friend from Virginia, \nlet me tell him a little bit more about why this is a problem. The \nCongressional Budget Office issued a report--I am not trying to quote \ntheir exact words here, but this is a memo based on that report that \nthe estimated net proceeds from that sale anticipated were $1.5 billion \nand the estimated revenue foregone by the Government over 7 years was \n$2.5 billion. Overall, this means that this sale that was supposed to \nreduce the deficit was scored by CBO as increasing the deficit over 7 \nyears by $1 billion.\n  That is the kind of thing you get into in an asset sale. And that is \nwhy those of us involved in this need to be very conscious of \nprotecting the taxpayers. Sure, you can say it drives down the deficit \nby $1.5 billion over the next 2 years if you sold it, but if it loses \nanother $2.5 billion in revenue, it does not drive down the deficit; it \nincreases it. So that is the problem. And that is why you need to give \nmore time here, notwithstanding what the administration's position was \nat an earlier date. I think the Senator is correct on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to point out that the CBO \nnumbers did not include approximately $1 billion of savings in \noperating costs that will result from the privatization of Elk Hills. \nIn addition, these numbers did not include the increased tax revenues \nthat will result from the sale. I think that my good friend from \nGeorgia will find that these two figures, taken together with the \nestimated sale price of $1.5 to $2.5 billion, will result in much more \nsignificant revenues for the Federal Treasury than would continued \nGovernment ownership of Elk Hills.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator Nunn has mentioned about the \nentire conference report being placed in the Congressional Record. That \nis correct. It was placed in the Congressional Record on Wednesday, \nDecember 13, 1995.\n  I just wonder if we could not debate this bill tomorrow and Monday \nand have a final vote on Tuesday. Is there any objection to that? I \njust wanted to know.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from South Carolina, this \nSenator would agree with that. I think that is a very reasonable \nproposal, and I would support it. I urge our colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Limit it to 6 hours.\n  Mr. NUNN. That would be very reasonable to my point of view. We have \nthe Senator from Vermont with strenuous objection to provisions here. \nHe has to be heard. I am not in a position to agree to that on behalf \nof the Democratic side now, but from a personal point of view, I will \nsay I would certainly work with the Senator in trying to get that kind \nof an agreement. I think it is a very reasonable proposal, and I would \nsupport it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. If we can limit debate to 6 hours equally divided, I \nthink that will give ample time to debate it tomorrow and Monday, and \nthen have a final vote on Tuesday.\n  Mr. NUNN. Actually we could perhaps have a longer period of debate. \nIf we are going to have tomorrow and Monday, we might want to make it 8 \nhours. That would give people a lot of time. But with all day Monday \nfor debate, I am sure that we could accommodate whatever Senators want \nto talk.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Would 8 hours suit the Senator all right?\n  Mr. NUNN. I think that is completely adequate. We may not need to \nlimit the time, though, if we just have a time certain Tuesday for the \nvote. That would be just up to----\n  Mr. THURMOND. What time would the distinguished Senator suggest? \n  \n[[Page S18710]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I would have to check with the Democratic leader, but I \nwould be glad to do that and get back to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I just wonder if we could not get some agreement as to \nwhen the final vote will come.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will be glad to work toward that end. It is a good \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. THURMOND. If the distinguished Senator will get back in touch \nwith us.\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during the course of this debate on the \nconference report, I will address a number of sections. I will see that \na reply is made to the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from \nGeorgia, with respect to the concerns that he has expressed here today \nregarding the section of the bill that relates to missiles; that is, \nboth the long range and short range. I am prepared to do it, but after \nthe expressions of Senators Lott and Cohen and Senator Smith who worked \non that in some detail.\n  Likewise, the questions relating to the B-2 program, we will see that \nthe Senator from Georgia has an opportunity to give the expressions on \nthis side. I likewise am prepared to do that, but I want to make sure \nthose Senators who--for example, the subcommittee chairman--who dealt \nwith that be given the first opportunity. However, Mr. President, I \nwould like to address the section of the bill relating to submarine \nconstruction and, in particular, new construction.\n  The United States today--let there be no mistake about this, Mr. \nPresident--is in competition with Russia as it regards underseas \nstrategic systems. The reports that the Russian Navy are tied up at the \ndocks, rusting away, both in the Black Sea and in the North Sea and \nother areas relate to the surface fleet.\n  Indeed, the Russians have decided not to put the short assets that \nthey have, supposedly, into surface naval operations of any \nconsiderable extent. But, Mr. President, they are pursuing, \nrelentlessly, a program of research, development, and construction of \nsubsurface systems, primarily submarines. It was reported in the media \nhere of recent days that several of these submarines matched in many \nrespects the quietness of the U.S. fleet. I cannot go into further \ndetail, but a number of Senators have sought and received the briefings \nfrom the Intelligence Committee on these important points.\n  But it is a well-known fact, publicly, that for some reason which is \nnot entirely clear, Russia is putting a disproportionate amount of \ntheir funds for their overall national defense in subsurface strategic \nsystems. And this places on the United States a very strong affirmative \nburden to go forward with our submarine programs and, in particular, \nnew construction programs.\n  I mentioned quietness. Submarines operate in various waters of the \nworld which have various temperatures, have various ambient noises. And \nthe noise level that emanates from a submarine is the Achilles heel \nbecause in waters of certain temperatures, ambient noises are different \nthan in others. And, of course, it varies with depth and water \ntemperature and currents and all sorts of conditions.\n  But we have got to make progress in making our submarines quiet. And \nthe new generations of submarines now on the drawing boards are key to \nour Nation's having an adequate deterrence subsurface, not only against \nRussia, but there are other nations of the world--and I will amplify in \nmy statement other nations which are building diesel submarines.\n  A diesel submarine can operate very quietly. It may not have, as we \nsay, the sea legs to operate for long periods of time because of fuel \nrequirements and battery requirements and other limitations, but it can \noperate very quietly.\n  A diesel submarine poses a threat to both nuclear submarines and \nsurface ships as well as through its ability to lay mines. Take the \nStrait of Hormuz, a quiet diesel submarine could slip into those \nstraits, place mines and, once again, the world would be faced with a \ncutoff of one of the largest sources of petroleum which, in turn, is \nconverted into energy.\n  Therefore, submarine construction, research and development is \nabsolutely essential to the security interests of our Nation.\n  Some years ago, the decision was made to embark on a new class of \nsubmarines. The Seawolf was the interim class. The Congress this year \nwill be completing, by and large, the authorization and funding \nrequirements for the third and final submarine in the Seawolf class.\n  It is now time to move on to another class. The plans have been made, \nand the initial work has begun. I do not wish to be political, but it \nis a statement of fact that the President of the United States--about 2 \nyears ago--indicated that he desired that all new submarine \nconstruction of this new class of submarine be performed at the Groton \nShipyard operated by a very fine company, General Dynamics.\n  That message was received in Virginia and across the Nation with \ngreat concern. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock in Virginia has \nbeen building submarines for the U.S. Navy for many, many years. To \nhave a decision suddenly announced which would terminate construction \nof new submarines at Newport News, in my judgment, was not predicated \non sound national security interests, nor sound financial interests. \nThis decision was contrary to the best interests of this country.\n  Needless to say, this decision was potentially devastating in terms \nof the economy of my State, Virginia, and, indeed, a range of \ncontractors in many, many other States which worked in partnership with \nNewport News to build new construction submarines.\n  This Senator, along with other Members of the Virginia congressional \ndelegation, and indeed other Senators, embarked on a long mission to \nreverse that decision. I am pleased that, with this conference report, \nthat decision has now been reversed. The President has agreed that it \nis in the best interest of the Nation to have competition once again \nbetween the two leading yards in America on new nuclear attack \nsubmarine construction.\n  It enables the designers and engineers that are affiliated with both \nyards in research and development, as well as construction, to produce \nnothing but the best nuclear attack submarines for the United States of \nAmerica. It helps the American taxpayer in terms of competition. \nCompetition drives down cost, and the cost of the program envisioned \nfor this follow-on attack submarine is in the billions of dollars, \nspread over many years, extending well beyond the year 2000.\n  I am pleased that the President has reversed his decision, backed up \nby the Secretary of Defense and now implemented by the Congress in this \nreport in very specific language, which I will address momentarily.\n  I want to thank many who have worked in seeing that this decision was \nreversed. The Virginia congressional delegation, in particular, my \ncolleague, Congressman Bateman. I wish to thank my junior colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Robb, who also worked on this effort. It was a \nconcerted effort, and we are very pleased with what has been worked out \nin this conference report. It is in the interest, the security \ninterests, of our country. It is in the fiscal interests of our country \nthat this very substantial investment by the American taxpayers be the \nproduct of competition.\n  Let me provide the Senate with a summary of this very important \nprogram.\n  Submarine legislation in the current fiscal year 1996 defense \nauthorization bill includes in law the essential elements of the \nSenate-passed bill with Seawolf funded at the appropriated level of \n$700 million; one submarine in fiscal year 1998, which will go to the \nElectric Boat Co. in Groton, CT; one submarine in fiscal year 1999 to \nNewport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, and if the decision is made to \nbegin to produce a new class attack submarine with the third boat, then \nthe third and all future boats of this class will be competed based \nsolely on price.\n  I want to underline that, competed based on price. That formulation \nallows these two real national assets, these two new construction \nyards, to be on an equal footing.\n  If the decision is made to build additional R submarines--and the \nfirst two are characterized as R submarines--then price competition \nwill \n\n[[Page S18711]]\nbegin with the fifth boat. That is a decision that will have to be made \nsubsequently by the Secretary of Defense and joined in by the Congress.\n  The key differences are that a new class of submarine previously \ndesignated as a new attack submarine will not begin until the third \nboat, the fifth boat, or later, if the Secretary of the Navy decides \nthat additional R submarines should be built before beginning serial \nproduction of a new class.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan \nleading to production of a more capable, less expensive submarine than \nthe submarine previously designated as the new attack submarine.\n  Legislation on attack submarines includes the following provisions:\n  (1) Authorizes $700 million for the construction of the third Seawolf \nattack submarine. This, essentially, incrementally funds the ship with \n$700 million of the $1.5 million that is yet to be required.\n  (2) Authorizes $704.5 million for long-lead and advance construction \nand procurement for the fiscal year 1998 submarine to be built at \nElectric Boat.\n  (3) Authorizes $100 million for long-lead and advance construction \nand procurement for fiscal year 1999 submarine to be built at Newport \nNews. Also authorizes $10 million for participation by Newport News in \ndesign of the submarine previously designated as the new attack \nsubmarine.\n  Those sums and those provisions were carefully worked out with the \nSecretary of Defense, together with the Secretary of the Navy and the \nChief of Naval Operations. May I commend particularly Admiral Boorda \nfor the help and assistance that he gave this Senator and other Members \nof the Senate in working out this formula.\n  I also wish to thank the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Perry. I \nremember so well when the pivotal decision was made by him when he came \nto my office in June and said that the President agreed that we would \ngo back to the time-tested method of building new submarines and let \ntwo yards compete. That was the turning point and, thereafter, the \nSecretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, working with \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, devised this plan. I also \nwould like to say how much I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, whose interest, of course, rests with the Electric \nBoat, his constituent. Senator Lieberman has worked out with me as we \nworked out the provisions in the Senate bill.\n  Those provisions are essentially the blueprint that remained intact \nas this went on to the House and was worked on in conference.\n  Last, this bill restricts spending to no more than $200 million on \nthese programs until the Secretary of the Navy certifies that \nprocurement of nuclear attack submarines to be constructed after the \nfirst two boats will be competed on price, unless the decision is made \nto construct additional submarines, in which case all submarines after \nthe fourth boat will be competed based on price whether they are R \nsubmarines or submarines of a new class.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, earlier in the debate, a question came \nup about the Naval petroleum reserves, and I would like to make a \nstatement on that.\n  The conference agreement on the sale of the naval petroleum reserves \ncontains a number of safeguards to ensure that the Federal Government \nreceives full value. Among these safeguards are the following two \nclauses which clearly spell out the conferees intent that the reserves \ncan be sold only if this will result in the highest return to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The first is the mandated minimum acceptable price. This price will \nbe established by five independent experts who shall consider: all \nequipment and facilities to be included in the sale; the estimated \nquantity of petroleum and natural gas in the reserve; and the net \npresent value of the anticipated revenue stream that the Treasury would \nreceive from the reserve if the reserve were not sold. The Secretary \nmay not set the minimum acceptable price below the higher of the \naverage of the five assessments; and the average of three assessments \nafter excluding the high and low assessments.\n  This requirement ensures that the minimum acceptable price has to be \nat least as high as what the Government would receive for these \nreserves if any other course of action is taken including the \nestablishment of a Government corporation, the leasing of the reserves, \nor the continuation of the current operation of the field.\n  The second key clause is the authority to suspend the sale. This \nclause gives the Secretary the authority to suspend the sale of Naval \nPetroleum Reserve No. 1 if the Secretary and the Director of OMB \njointly determine that the sale is proceeding in a manner inconsistent \nwith achievement of a sale price that reflects the full value of the \nreserve; or a course of action other than the immediate sale of the \nreserve is in the best interests of the United States.\n  Mr. President, these two clauses essentially mean that Naval \nPetroleum Reserve No. 1 cannot be sold unless the Government gets a \nprice for the field that exceeds the value that would be achieved by \nany other option, and that the entire sale proceed in a manner that is \nin the best interests of the United States.\n  The sale will provide an estimated $1.5 to $2.5 billion to the \nFederal Treasury. This does not include the several hundred million \ndollars that the Government will receive in increased tax revenues. \nWhat's more, the Government will save about $1 billion in operating \ncosts over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, the sale of these reserves was initiated by this \nadministration, and, in fact, the administration has come out in \nsupport of this provision. We have worked in a very bipartisan manner \nto draft this provision so as to incorporate the maximum safeguards \npossible. I hope that we can continue this bipartisanship and vote to \napprove the conference agreement which includes this provision.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what I had sought recognition for relates \nto the appropriations bill on Labor, Health, Human Services, and \nEducation. The purpose of my seeking the floor is to see if we might \nmove that bill along.\n  In light of the fact we are not going to have a continuing \nresolution, at least as it appears at the moment, I thought it \nimportant to put on the record that there are a very substantial number \nof jobs which are involved here, and layoffs, if we do not have a \ncontinuing resolution; that the Social Security Administration has some \n60,000 jobs, the Department of Health and Human Services has some \n100,000 jobs, the Department of Labor has 18,000 jobs, the Department \nof Education has 5,000 jobs. We have been trying to work out a \nunanimous consent agreement to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I understand that the Members of the other side of the aisle have \nbeen unwilling to give consent because of the provisions on the bill \nabout striker replacement. There have been a number of other items. \nBut, for the record I wanted to see if we might possibly move the bill \nahead.\n  I full well understand the likelihood of objection. But, on behalf of \nSenator Dole, I do ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 189, H.R. 2127, the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, at this moment I would have to object to \nthat unanimous-consent request.

Mr. President, I see my colleague from Florida is seeking \nrecognition. The Senator from Arkansas has just about a 3-minute \nstatement, if he will permit me to go forward. I will just take a few \nmoments of the Senate's time this evening.\n  I rise tonight to voice my very, very strong opposition to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization conference report that is now \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  This conference report takes the unthinkable step of actually \nrepealing a bipartisan piece of legislation which was written in 1983, \nby Senators Roth, Kassebaum, Grassley, myself and many others in this \nbody. We set up a process for an office to test new weapons, in an \nindependent, unbiased, untainted, and a very, very, realistic \nenvironment.\n  If enacted, this conference report that we are now discussing would \nbe a gigantic step backwards in the war against $600 hammers, thousand-\ndollar toilet seats, guns that do not shoot, bombs that do not explode, \nand planes that do not fly.\n  I truly believe, Mr. President, that if this conference report is \nenacted in its present form, the lives of our men and women who serve \nthis country in the Armed Forces will be put needlessly at risk.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate are aware that this conference \nreport contains a provision that would virtually eliminate the \nPentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation \nby absolutely revoking its charter. Mr. President, no one has yet \nexplained any reason whatsoever to take away the office and the \ndepartment in that area of our Department of Defense that tests weapons \nbefore we go into mass production. It simply does not make sense.\n  Over the past 12 years, this testing office has been an unparalleled \nsuccess. It has saved time, money, and, most importantly, it has saved \nthe lives of our fighting forces by making weapons better and by \nkeeping flawed systems out of the hands of our soldiers.\n  Support for the testing office has always been bipartisan, Mr. \nPresident. Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that an \nindependent weapons testing office ``saved more lives'' during \nOperation Desert Storm than perhaps any other single initiative. The \ncurrent Secretary of Defense, William Perry, recently described this \noffice as ``the conscience of the acquisition process.''\n  Mr. President, I was shocked to learn that this conference report \nrevokes the charter for independent testing of our weapons. I could not \nbelieve it.\n  Because of this provision, I cannot and I will not vote for this \nconference report. I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that I do not fault my \nvery good friend from South Carolina, the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for this language \nthat undermines independent testing. From all reports that I have, he \ntried to keep the office of independent testing alive. I have always \nknown that this flawed initiative originated not in the Senate but in \nthe House of Representatives. In fact, the Senator from South Carolina, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, supported \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution approved by this Chamber as recently \nas August that voiced the Senate's strong opposition to revoking the \ncharter for independent weapons testing.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Senate's position did not prevail \nin the conference committee. The wishes of the U.S. Senate to uphold \nand to support and to continue this office of independent testing were \nnot granted.\n  I want to thank the chairman at this time for doing what he could in \nconference to stop, or at least to delay, the elimination of the office \nof independent testing. I only wish that he had been more successful in \nkeeping the conference committee from endorsing an absolutely terrible \nidea.\n  As we begin sending American troops into Bosnia, it is wrong, it is \ndangerously shortsighted, for this Congress to propose eliminating that \nvery office that has been so helpful, so successful in making sure that \nour weapons work properly in combat.\n  Mr. President, I will be voting against this conference report.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to point out an inadvertent \nomission in the conference agreement statement of managers with respect \nto Air Force Program Element 602601F, Advanced Weapons. The conference \nagreement increased the authorization of the requested amount of $124.4 \nmillion by $11.0 million. Of that increase, $5.0 million was intended \nby the conferees to authorize the continuation of the High Frequency \nActive Auroral Research Program. As pointed out in the statement of \nmanagers accompanying the conference report, the conferees intend the \nremaining $6 million of the increase to authorize the rocket propulsion \ntechnology program described in the House Report 104-131.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18712-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18712-S18713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could just take a minute here, let me \nindicate that I still do not know for certain what the program will be \ntoday, tomorrow, and Sunday. I had hoped we would have some serious \nbudget negotiations.\n  I have just listened to the President of the United States. I must \nsay I do not know who gives him advice, but I do not think he is \ntelling the American people the truth. If he thinks he is engaged in \nserious budget discussions, then he ought to take a look at the budget.\n  I must say that this administration is for a one-way street. It is \nall right to cooperate with them, but they are not going to cooperate \nwith anyone else. And I have made an effort to do that as recently as \n48 hours ago on this floor.\n  I am a little frustrated that we have been 26 days now waiting for \nthe administration to give us a legitimate offer to balance the budget \nin 7 years, using Congressional Budget Office estimates. It was my \nunderstanding, in talking with the President yesterday, that there \nwould be a serious offer given to Republicans today. Anyone with any \nknowledge of the budget process could look at the offer made and tell \nyou very quickly that it was not a serious offer. But here the \nPresident of the United States is getting on television saying that \nRepublicans are recommending devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, \nthe environment and student loans after we put money back into those \nprograms in our legitimate offer earlier today.\n  So I am almost convinced that there is no real desire on the part of \nthis administration to do anything except to play politics with the \nbudget--and play politics with senior citizens and play politics with \nevery other interest group in America. We have made an effort time \nafter time to meet the President halfway.\n  I believe the American people want a balanced budget in 7 years. They \nhave indicated that. The President agreed to it, but we cannot do it \nwith the same old smoke and mirrors.\n  In fact, $54 billion of the savings today was ``baseline \nadjustments,'' which is one example, and there are other examples in \nthe President's bill. Tax cuts--he has tax cuts in his bill, too, I \nthink--in what, the 5th year. If everything was not in balance, you \nwould trigger over those tax cuts. That is another way of how they save \n$23 billion. That is something that even Darman had not thought of when \nhe was here. So they thought of a lot of good things down there.\n  But I would hope the President of the United States would contact \nthis Senator and the Speaker of the House of Representatives--the three \nof us sit down and get serious. This is serious business. If we do not \nhave some agreement, if we do not pass the continuing resolution by \nSunday evening, the Government will shut down again.\n  One way to avoid that is to let us bring up the Labor-HHS bill, which \nthe Democrats twice have objected to. We are going to ask consent--I \nguess we \n\n[[Page S18713]]\nhave already asked consent. That has been objected to. There are about \n180,000 Federal workers. But, again, the Democrats will not agree to \nbring it up unless we agree to everything they want--take out striker \nreplacement, do not vote on the abortion amendments. In other words, \nwhat we will do as the minority, and then we will accept or let you \nbring it up on the floor.\n\n  So we would like to bring it up tonight and be on it all day tomorrow \nand all day Sunday. By Monday morning, maybe we could have it passed \nand go to conference and bring it back. That would be 180,000 Americans \nwho could go to work.\n  We are going to send down to the President now State, Justice, \nCommerce. VA-HUD will be sent down to the President; Interior \nappropriations tomorrow. All he has to do is sign those bills, and that \nwill take care of nearly all of the Federal employees. That will leave \nremaining the District of Columbia bill and Foreign Ops. If we can get \nan agreement to bring up Labor-HHS, let us pass that tomorrow or Sunday \nin the Senate.\n  So if the President is not willing to negotiate the balanced budget \nexcept on his terms, and he is not willing to sign the appropriations \nbills we send him except on his terms and is not willing to let us \nbring up one of the largest bills with the most Federal employees--\nLabor-HHS, we have been prepared for the past 2 or 3 months, but it has \nbeen objected to by the Democrats.\n  So I hope the American people understand, if people who are covered \nby that bill are not working on Monday, why they are not working on \nMonday.\n  So, again, I would say to the President of the United States, tell \nthe American people the truth. Do not come on television, Mr. \nPresident, and say that we are devastating this and devastating that, \nbecause, in fact, you know that in our budget we added back billions of \ndollars in Medicare and Medicaid and made other real adjustments.\n  Maybe it is impossible. Maybe we are not going to get anything done.\n  If that is what the President wants, he ought to just tell us that so \nwe can make alternative plans, pass a very stringent continuing \nresolution and assume that is all we are going to get done. But in the \nmeantime, we are still working on our side. We are still trying to \nresolve the differences on the DC appropriations bill and on the \nforeign operations bill. And I hope that they would be ready for \npassage, if not today or tomorrow, on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18712-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18713-S18729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I would only seek the floor if the majority leader is \ncompleted.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield the floor.\n\n           BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AND THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \nall of the comments of the majority leader. Obviously, there are \nlegitimate points of view that are very different as we consider the \ncircumstances we are in right now.\n  The majority leader said we ought to have the truth about what is \nhappening right now. His version of the truth and mine could not be \nmore different. My version of the truth is--and I think it is shared by \nvirtually every Member on this side of the aisle--it was the \nRepublicans this afternoon who got up and walked out of the room. They \nwere the ones to say, ``It's over. We don't want to deal with you any \nmore. You're not acting in good faith.''\n\n  My version of the truth is that there is absolutely no reason why we \nshould connect the continuing resolution with our effort in the \nreconciliation bill, none at all. There is absolutely no connection. \nAnd the reason why we are going through this charade right now with the \nappropriations bills is because they know that we are way overdue in \ncompleting these appropriations bills. We should have done them a long \ntime ago.\n  And I will tell you one of the reasons we are overdue. Because they \nare putting stuff that does not belong in appropriations business on \nthat bill. What does striker replacement have to do with health and \nhuman services? Absolutely nothing. We know that. They know that.\n  And on so many of these pieces of legislation there is absolutely \nirrelevant, completely unassociated matters legislatively that have \nnothing to do with appropriations, and that is the hangup, and they \nknow it. If you want to pass that appropriations bill, we can do it by \n6 o'clock, and it is now 5 to 6. We could do it by 6 o'clock if we \nwould sit down in a serious way and take the extraneous things out and \nbegin dealing with it.\n  That bill is going to be vetoed. We do not have to talk about it a \nlong time. But we are not willing to do that because of those \nextraneous issues and everybody knows it.\n  So let us be clear. We do not have to shut the Government down \nbecause there is a pick with the President about whether he has been \nworking in good faith or not. There is no reason to tell people one \nmore time that they are out of work for whatever length of time. That \nis not necessary. We want a clean continuing resolution. We ought to \nhave it tonight. We ought to pass it, and we ought to get serious about \nnegotiations.\n  Now, we know as well that one of the biggest differences between \nRepublicans and Democrats all through this reconciliation process has \nbeen the tax cut. And for whatever reason, the Republicans continue to \nsay that is a nonnegotiable item; that we want to hold on to that tax \ncut virtually at all cost.\n  But that is not where we started. Where we started was the Republican \ninsistence that we go to a 7-year balanced budget. The majority leader \nsaid it has to be on the President's terms. Well, the President said he \nhad a 10-year balanced budget. And many of us supported the idea of \nbalancing the budget in 10, 7, it does not matter, but the President \nhad 10 years. The President said, ``As an indication of my good faith, \nI will go from 10 to 7.''\n  That is what he said. Now, the President also said we have a very big \ndifference in our projection on what the economy is going to do when we \nbalance the budget than what CBO does. There is a profound difference. \nCBO is saying that once we go through all the pain, there is really no \ngain. Once we cut all these programs as deeply as the Republican budget \nproposes and we balance the budget, interest rates are actually going \nto go up, unemployment is going to go up, corporate profits are going \nto go down, overall economic growth is going to do down, but we still \nthink it is a great idea to get out there and balance the budget. \n\n[[Page S18714]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, we do not buy that. You cannot tell me after NAFTA and \nafter GATT and after balancing the budget and after doing all the \nthings that we said we were going to do we cannot look forward to a \nbetter economic picture than that.\n  Now, why is it that the Republicans continue to insist on holding to \nthat scenario before we even sit down and talk about our disagreements \non policy? I do not know. OMB said it is not that bleak; we ought to be \nable to look at the next 7 years with a little more optimism than that.\n  So that is a fundamental disagreement that we ought to be able to \nwork through. We should not just take our papers and walk out of the \nroom saying, ``It's over; forget it.'' That is not how we do things \naround here. That is a legitimate difference of opinion that ought to \nbe discussed.\n  And when it comes to the policy questions themselves, we are not \nprepared to go beyond where we said we were on Medicare and on Medicaid \nand on education and on taxing working people. We are not prepared to \ndo that as long as the Republican position is tax cuts are sacrosanct, \nwe cannot touch them.\n  So that is where we are. We thought that after the second proposal \nany objective person would say we are working in good faith.\n  That has not happened. I am disappointed. The Republicans have taken \ntheir papers and walked out of the room and now have threatened to shut \ndown the Government because they did not get their way.\n  It does not have to be this way. We can go back in that room. We can \ndiscuss and negotiate and get the job done. There is still time. We are \nwilling to do it tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday. It does not matter \nhow long. We are there. We will be there. Call the meeting. Let us get \nthis job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that I have talked to both \nSenator Domenici and Congressman Kasich. There was never any mention of \nthe word ``walkout.'' They suggested if we got serious, we would all \ncome back together. And that is precisely where it is. We are prepared \nto come back. When the President of the United States gets serious, \nthen we are prepared to come back and start negotiations.\n  I think most of us made plans to be here all weekend just for that \npurpose. We thought they were going to start this afternoon. We did \nstart the meeting at 11:30, another meeting at 3 o'clock.\n  And it seems to me that as I watched events unfold, I think maybe \nthere is a split not on our side. I do not know of any. But I think the \nDemocrats are split. Some want to resolve the problem and some want to \ngo into next year so there can be an election issue on a balanced \nbudget. Maybe that is a legitimate concern.\n  We sent a balanced budget to the President. He vetoed it. We spent 10 \nmonths, 10 long, hard months putting that together. For the first time \nin my memory, we sent a balanced budget to put us on a path for a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 to the President of the United States, \nand he vetoed it. So he has already vetoed a balanced budget.\n  And now he says that even though he has vetoed one and wants one--we \ndo not want one, or do we want one? And I would hope that--there is \nstill plenty of time. It is only 6 p.m. Friday. I would hope that the \nPresident of the United States would contact those of us who have the \nresponsibility, the leadership, and say, ``Let us sit down and try to \nwork this out.'' If we cannot work it out, let us stop kidding the \nAmerican people.\n  You cannot have it both ways, Mr. President. You cannot go out and \nattack us for trying to save Medicare, which you call a cut, and go \nback and take a look at Mrs. Clinton testifying on health care: ``You \nare going to need to lower the rate of growth of health care down to 6 \nor 7 percent,'' she testified, went before a committee. That is \nprecisely what we are doing. That is what we are doing.\n  We finally had an accurate reflection of what we are doing on \n``Nightline'' last week. Everybody ought to watch it. They took all the \nrhetoric and all the politics and wrung it out. And now they told the \nAmerican people, separate the politics, we are trying to save, preserve \nMedicare.\n  And I will say to my friends on the other side, part B Medicare is \nvoluntary. It does not come out of the trust fund. It comes out of \ngeneral revenues. So the people working in the Senate, anywhere in the \nSenate, in the kitchen, anywhere, take their tax money and pay premiums \nfor millionaires, multimillionaires. And the President says you cannot \ncharge those millionaires--the Government is paying 68.5 percent--you \ncannot charge them 31.5 percent. It has got to drop down to 25 percent.\n  That is the President of the United States who ought to say we are \nafter all these people. He is protecting the people who could pay more. \nI do not understand it. He wants to keep it at 25 percent so everybody \nelse in America can help pick up the premiums, part B, which is \nvoluntary, for people who can afford to pay a lot more than the people \npaying the taxes in the first place. Yet he is out rapping us every \nday, as he just concluded, saying we are trying to devastate Medicare.\n  It is not true, Mr. President. You know it is not true. So it seems \nto me that--I just look in the calendar. We have had this \nappropriations bill on the calendar since September 15, 3 months today, \nand we have tried twice to take it up. We failed on a party-line vote. \nI think I counted--somebody counted--about 160,000, 170,000 people \nwould be able to go to work Monday morning had we passed that bill. But \nthe Democrats--every Democrat opposed us on cloture so we could not get \nthe bill up. So I filed cloture again. It will not get the vote until \nMonday. So it will be at least 1 day off or 2 days off.\n  But I want the workers to know, the Federal workers to know, \nRepublicans did not prevent this bill from coming up. This is the big \none. This is the big one, as far as Federal employees are concerned.\n  And maybe we can work out some consent agreement and pass it tonight \nby consent, go to conference, get it back here tomorrow or Sunday, in \ntime so that the people--if you cannot get a CR--then they can go back \nto work.\n  So, Mr. President, let me also state, as I said to my colleagues \nearlier, a list of the possible remaining items for Senate \nconsideration prior to Christmas. It includes nominations and Executive \nCalendar items, subpoena for Whitewater, if that is going to be debated \nor necessary, whatever, the budget negotiation, whatever, continuing \nresolution, remaining appropriations bills, DOD authorization \nconference report, other available conference reports, rangeland \nreform.\n\n  This is all assuming that we take up and pass the defense \nauthorization bill on Tuesday, that we can do all these next week and \nthe following week. I have the feeling that there may be a few \nabsentees around here between Christmas and New Years. But it does seem \nvery likely we will be in session, unless we can reach a framework of \nan agreement by the 22d of December, which appears to me to be fairly \nremote after what I thought was an indication from the President, 2 \ndays running, that he was serious about it, he was prepared to come \nback here Friday and was prepared to get involved himself.\n  I am certainly prepared to get involved myself. I know the Speaker is \nprepared to get involved. I know the Democratic leader indicated his \nreadiness. And I assume the same is true for Congressman Gephardt. We \nought to be doing it now--now.\n  We ought to be doing this away from the press. I like the press. They \nare great people. But we are not going to negotiate if every 30 minutes \neach side has a press conference, as we did this afternoon, everybody \nout putting their spin on it. And now look where we are now. We are \nnowhere. We are right where we started.\n  So, hopefully, if we ever do sit down, we will sit down somewhere \nwhere we cannot be found, where we can discuss the issues and not what \nspin we put on it after it fails.\n  So I am still prepared to meet the President. I am still prepared to \nwork with the President.\n  The Democratic leader mentioned GATT. He mentioned NAFTA. They would \nnot have passed without Republican support. The President knows \n\n[[Page S18715]]\nthat. Oh, it was fine to cooperate on those things because that is \nsomething he wanted. Well, the American people want a balanced budget \nby a big, big percentage. And we believe that we ought to have some \nreal effort made by the President of the United States.\n  So one thing I did not add to this would be welfare reform will be up \nnext week, the conference report we will send to the President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was not present on the floor the last 15 or 20 \nminutes, but I was in transit, and I seem to have heard something which \nthe Senator kind of corroborates that I heard, that the distinguished \nminority leader said on the floor of the U.S. Senate--he is here, \nSenator Daschle--that the Republicans broke off negotiations on the \nbalanced budget today. Did I hear that correctly? He said that?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from South Dakota is here. But I think that is \nthe general feeling I had. And I do not think it is accurate, but that \nis what the statement was.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if you would permit me, and the Senator \nmight respond, because I have been reporting to the Senator regularly, \nthe truth of the matter is that the President of the United States and \nthe Democrats sent nothing to the conference. They put nothing on the \ntable. And if they would like me to go through details, I will go \nthrough details.\n  They found $54 billion worth of savings, I say to my friend from the \nState of Florida, without turning a stitch. They did not change a \nsingle program. They said, ``We disagree on economics.''\n\n  I am not talking about $54 billion over 7 years, I am talking about \nit in the last year. They want to balance a budget so they say, ``Look, \nwe do not agree that the CBO is right on this and this and this.'' So \nthey find 54 billion dollars' worth of savings. And they want us to sit \nthere and say, ``Hooray. You have really made some changes.'' No \nchange. Not one thing changed. Not one program altered. And then they \nsay, ``Well, look, we think the CBO is wrong on some estimates, so why \ndon't we get the estimates right?''\n  And $21 billion. They have not changed a program. They have not had \nto bite a bullet and have not had to do a thing. That is $21 billion. I \nthink if you add them up, that is $75 billion of movement toward a \nbalanced budget in the last year without having to do anything. Is that \nnot a marvelous, marvelous way to fix the budget of the United States? \nIt is as if spending does not really matter.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, is the Senator from New Mexico asking a \nquestion at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I am still asking the question. I will get to the \nquestion very shortly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will get to the question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would appreciate it if the Chair would advise the \nSenator I am entitled to finish my question. They have had plenty of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And he is not objecting at this point. The President \nhad the airwaves across all of America. He talked about what we had in \nmind. I want the Americans to know and the Senators to know what he had \nin mind. He had in mind that he could come to a conference and do \nnothing, offer nothing, change nothing, and then blame us. So that is \nwhat they did.\n  They said, ``We found 121 billion dollars' worth of savings.'' I have \njust given you $75 billion of it. ``And we have not changed anything. \nWe haven't cut a pea. We haven't reduced spending.''\n  Then we go up and--let me tell you a neat one the President \nrecommended today. If you want to understand the pickle we are in in \ntrying to get a balanced budget for America, they take 23 billion \ndollars' worth of savings in the last year by saying, ``We don't want \nany tax cuts.'' Got it? You save $23 billion. But they say that really \nis not the case. ``We do want the tax cuts. We just want to say, if we \nare wrong on the economics, we will cancel the tax cut.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will not ask for the regular order, \nbut----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will ask my good friend, Senator Dole, who I have \ngone through this with regularly: Do you really believe, Senator, when \nthe President of the United States signed a bill, and it says we will \nhave a balanced budget using the Congressional Budget Office economics, \nand you and I have been asking the President to send us a proposal, do \nyou think that it is a credible proposal to have absolutely no savings, \nno changes, and say to us, ``If you don't sit down and negotiate, \nsomehow you're to blame for this?'' Could you give us your view on \nthat?\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, let me say to the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nas I have indicated earlier, I am very disappointed because I \nunderstood the President--we have had a lot of talks the last few days \non a number of issues--he indicated to me he was serious about this, \nbecause I asked him on the telephone, ``If you're not serious and we're \nnot serious, why are we doing this? Why don't we do something else and \ngo home?''\n  He indicated he was serious.\n  I know that was not the final offer. Neither was ours the final \noffer. But we actually did things in our offer, real things in our \noffer that made a difference: Put money back into Medicare and \nMedicaid, more money for discretionary spending, whether it is \neducation, environment, whatever. We thought we were in good faith.\n  So I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I am disappointed. It seems \nto me we had an opportunity. This is now the 15th of December. This \nyear is going to be over before long, and we are probably going to be \nright here to be able to see it leave.\n  The question is whether or not we are serious about getting down to \nbusiness. We ought to be meeting right now. The meeting ought to be \ngoing on right now. We ought to be talking about the 82 areas where we \nhave a difference--82 areas, according to White House sources, major \nareas--plus probably dozens and dozens of others.\n  So it would take all the energy we could muster between now and the \n22d of December to even put together a framework of agreement, which I \nassume we would have to come back a couple days in January to pass \nunder some expedited procedure.\n  So I know it is not easy. It is not easy making tough decisions. It \nis easy doing, as I said, things Darman had not even thought of when he \nwas around. Smoke and mirrors, they used to say in those days. Just \nsave $54 billion there, but baseline----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fifty-four right there just changing the economics. I \nsay to the leader, did you not tell me to go back to the conference \nwith the Democrats and say we will continue to negotiate, we will be \nthere any hour, any time, provided you make some headway in moving the \nbudget in the direction of making some changes that bring us closer \ntogether and bringing us a balanced budget according to the \nCongressional Budget Office? That is what you told me to do.\n  Mr. DOLE. In fact, I can say very honestly, we had a discussion after \nthe first session, and the question was whether or not we ought to call \nthe President of the United States by telephone and say, ``Mr. \nPresident, we can't negotiate with what was sent up here under your \nname, and if you're not serious, we don't see any reason to go back a \nsecond time.''\n  We said, ``No, let's go back again.'' We instructed Congressman \nKasich and the Senator from New Mexico, ``Go back again. Nobody is \nblaming us for this not succeeding. Go back again and see if you get \nsome serious statement or effort from Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta, or \nsomebody else.'' And that never happened. We did not walk out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, sir.\n  Mr. DOLE. As far as I know, I guess everybody left; they had to walk \nout, but nobody left saying, ``This is it; it's over.''\n  Now the President is on all the stations saying, ``Oh, well, they \nbroke off talks, broke off talks, cutting education,'' cutting this, \ncutting that, same old propaganda that has been used in the past 60 to \n90 days.\n  So we are prepared to do whatever is necessary, and we are prepared \nto be here tomorrow and Sunday and Monday and all next week trying to \npass the Labor-HHS bill, which would put some 100,000 people back to \nwork, 180,000. \n\n[[Page S18716]]\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, made a unanimous-\nconsent request just 25 minutes ago to bring it up right now, and it \nwas objected to. Not on this side. We have tried since September 15 to \nbring it up. It has been objected to. We cannot invoke cloture. We have \nevery vote on this side, but not on that side. We do not have 60 \nMembers. So I do not know how--we can bring it up if we agree to \neverything the Democrats want to do, then, ``Oh, we'll bring it up if \nyou take out striker replacement, and you can't have any votes on your \namendments or one vote.''\n  To me, that is not the way it ought to be. We are prepared to bring \nit up right now. They can move to strike striker replacement. We can \nmove to strike some other committee amendments, and then finish the \nbill. It might take a day or two or three, but it will be completed.\n  So I want the Federal employees to understand, whatever they may read \nin the paper or hear on the television from the President of the United \nStates or somebody else putting the White House spin on it, this bill, \nH.R. 2127, has been on the calendar since September 15. We have \nattempted to bring it up time after time after time. You would all be \nworking Monday had we completed action on this bill, but it was \nobjected to not once, twice, three times and we could not invoke \ncloture. We had no problem on the Republican side. All the problems \nwere on the other side.\n\n  So if somebody is out there disappointed and in any of the agencies \ncovered by this particular bill, they should understand precisely why \nit has not passed, why it has not gone to the President. We will take \nthe rap on a couple of the others, as the minority leader indicated. On \nforeign ops, yes, it is held up on an abortion issue. DC is held up on \na scholarship issue. We are trying to resolve that yet tonight. And the \nothers have gone to the President or will go to the President.\n  So my view is, this is a big one, talking about Federal employees. \nThis is a big one. We have been trying to get it up for 90 days. So I \nhope the President mentions that the next time he speaks and asks the \nDemocrats to cooperate. Of course, he is for striker replacement and \nissued an Executive order which we think went beyond his authority. We \nrepealed that in the bill. That is why he objects, that is why \nDemocrats object to our bringing it up.\n  We are still around. We will be here this evening. We are prepared to \nreconvene if our colleagues are serious about it. If not, we will do \nthe best we can to try to find some resolution between now and Monday \nmorning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, there are many people who want to \nspeak, and I do not want to take more time. Let me respond to a couple \nof points that were raised.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico made a great speech. It was \njust all wrong. All wrong. We will not resolve it on the floor, and we \nwill leave it to others to decide who is right and who is wrong.\n  This President has now provided not one, not two, but three bona fide \noffers to sit down and reach a balanced budget. He did it first with \nhis 10-year budget last spring. He did it, second, about 2 weeks ago \nwith yet another effort to bring us to the table in good faith, cutting \nover $150 billion in real cuts. And today, whether you accept all of \nthe numbers or not, $121 billion in more changes than what he offered \njust last week.\n  Listen to the language. We were again told tonight that we will \nconvene if we think the Democrats are serious. Madam President, if that \ndoes not make my point, I do not know what does. We, frankly, do not \nthink they are serious. We do not think they are willing, really, to \nbring down this tax cut so we do not have to cut so deeply in Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n\n  And let me just say, I do not know how you describe what happened at \nthe meeting, except to say that before Leon Panetta even had the words \nout of his mouth, the Republicans had stood up and were working their \nway out of the room.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Were you there? I ask, were you there, Senator? Were \nyou in the room, Senator?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. What do you do with a case like that----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Were you there, Senator?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regular order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Regular order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield the floor and allow others to speak.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me say this. We all know that the most immediate \nthing we have to do is the continuing resolution. It expires tonight at \nmidnight. We know that.\n  We know that we are not going to resolve our differences on all these \nappropriations bills and pass them by midnight. The distinguished \nmajority leader made a point, and he is right: The majority of people \nsupport a balanced budget. I think a majority of the people--the vast \nmajority--also want us not to shut the Government down, in spite of our \ndifferences.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 1410\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed \nto the consideration of calendar No. 240, S. 1410, a clean continuing \nappropriations bill, that the bill be read the third time and passed, \nas amended, with a date change until December 22, with the language \nthat will permit the expenditure of funds for low-income energy \nassistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I have objected, and I hope the time will \ncome in the next couple of days where we can do something like this. \nBut we cannot do it now. Obviously, we have made no headway.\n  I have been in a lot of negotiations around here, and I can tell when \nthey are serious, I can tell when they are not. I can tell when they \nare posturing, and I can tell when they ought to end. I was not in the \nroom, so I cannot make a judgment on this particular negotiation. But I \ndo know that we made significant changes. I went over every one of the \nchanges for hours and hours yesterday. We talked about the changes in \nmy office with the Speaker and a number of Senators, and they were real \nand they were genuine and they were serious changes. We sought to \naddress some of the concerns raised by the President and the Democrats \nin the House and the Senate.\n  So I just say that I think we made a good-faith effort. It is all \nabout good-faith efforts. We do not believe the President did. Maybe \nthey thought, ``We will shoot them a blank the first time, and maybe \nthe second or third time we will put a little something in it.'' But I \nthink we have already gone beyond that point.\n  It has been 26 days since we passed the last continuing resolution, \nand we are supposed to work all this out during that time. Well, \nnothing has happened, and we are here again. If there is no CR passed \nby midnight--and I am certain there will not be one passed--certain \npeople will be affected over the weekend. If we do not pass one Sunday \nevening, a lot more people will be affected Monday morning. It will not \nbe as many as last time because a number of the bills have been signed. \nThe President can reduce the number because State, Justice, Commerce is \nat the White House, and he can sign that. That will take care of a \nnumber of employees if he signs that. HUD-VA is on the way; that will \ngo to the President tomorrow. We will try to finish the DC \nappropriations sometime over the weekend, and we will try to figure out \na way to get Labor-HHS. That would leave Foreign Ops, which we think we \nmay have an agreement on, based on language from the Senator from \nColorado, Senator Brown. That would be it.\n\n  There would not be any more debate about a CR, but we would still \nhave--Interior is going down tomorrow, too. That is another one. The \nPresident has all kinds of opportunities here to put people to work on \nMonday, without relying on a CR. He does not need one. That is the \npoint I make.\n  I might ask, Madam President, since I interrupted the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, if he could be recognized at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, about 26 days ago, when we were in similar \n\n\n[[Page S18717]]\ncircumstances, there were negotiations between the White House and the \nHouse and the Senate about what to do to solve the impasse. An \nagreement was reached with a continuing resolution, signed into law by \nthe President of the United States, with language included which said \nthat he committed himself to a balanced budget in the first session of \nthe 104th Congress--a balanced budget scored by CBO.\n  As the majority leader indicated a moment ago, it has been 26 days, \nand there has not been one single proposal made by the President of the \nUnited States that complies with that commitment. I must tell you that \nthose of us who thought that 26 days ago, that there may have been an \nopportunity to move forward with a balanced budget proposal, we were \nhopeful that there would be an opportunity in these last 3\\1/2\\ weeks. \nIn fact, we anticipated that this Friday, today, we would see, for the \nfirst time, a true proposal from the President of the United States to \nbalance the budget. The minority leader referred to the number of plans \nthat were sent here by the President of the United States.\n  I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you had an \nopportunity to vote on one of those plans, and every single one of you, \nas far as I can recall, turned your backs on the President because you \nknew it was a phony budget. And every proposal he has sent to us since \nthen has been phony. It has been an absolute positive phony.\n  We come here this evening with a sense of utter disappointment \nbecause we are serious in this effort to balance the budget. We feel \nlike you are playing games with us, you are playing games with the \nAmerican people, and you are playing games with the future of this \ncountry and our children and our grandchildren. And, yes, we are a \nlittle bit angry and upset. We feel betrayed.\n\n  Let me be real plain about how I feel about this President. The \nPresident of the United States has, once again, proven that his \ncommitment to principle is nonexistent. He gave his word; he broke his \nword. It is a habit he does not seem able to break. It is unfortunate \nto have to say that, but that is an accurate statement about this \nPresident. To imply that the offer made today was a serious offer is an \ninsult to us. To come down here with a proposal that virtually does \nnothing with respect to making additional reductions in spending is an \ninsult to the Congress of the United States and an insult to the people \nof this country.\n  If you look over this proposal, in the year 2002, they put on the \ntable a suggestion that they were going to eliminate the deficit in the \nseventh year to the tune of $121 billion. And the reason they came up \nwith that number is because the Congressional Budget Office scored the \nlast proposal that the President sent down here. It was a proposal that \nhe said would balance the budget. After all, all we are doing is using \nthe Congressional Budget Office, which, if you will recall, in January \nof 1993, the President of the United States reminded all of us that it \nwas important to use the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate budget \nplans, because he did not want to be accused of estimating his way out \nof the problem.\n  Well, I say again, very plainly, it is pretty obvious to me and \npretty obvious, I think, to the American people, that the only thing \nthis President wants to do is estimate his way out of the problem. When \nyou look at the proposal they sent down to us today, out of that $121 \nbillion, $54 billion is in economic baseline differences--estimating \nyour way out of the problem. And $21 billion more, a proposed \nresolution of scoring differences--estimating your way out of the \nproblem. And then another $23 billion, which I will say is a tax \nincrease. What it says, in essence, is if you get to the 7th year and \nyou are not in the balanced budget range, then you eliminate the tax \ncuts he has in his budget, which amounts to $23 billion. He has, in \nthis proposal, about $98 billion out of $121 billion, which is \nestimating his way out, and the other is raising taxes.\n  That is an absolute phony proposal. I must say, I admire Senator \nDomenici for his willingness to go back into the meeting for the second \ntime today after this phony piece of paper was put on the table.\n  Madam President, I agree with the minority leader that we do have \nlegitimate differences. But you do not have the guts to put those \nlegitimate differences on the table. The reason for the last 26 days \nthat you have avoided coming down here and putting a proposal on the \ntable is because you will not tell the American people what you are \nwilling to do. You will not make the tough decisions. You just refuse \nto put a legitimate offer on the table. And then you have the gall to \ncome to us and tell us that we ought to put another proposal on the \ntable.\n  So, Madam President, this President of the United States vetoed a \nbalanced budget proposal. It was a proposal that would have balanced \nthe budget, and it was the first time in decades that I know of where a \nPresident of the United States received a plan that would balance the \nbudget--and this President vetoed it.\n  This is the same President who is opposed to the balanced budget \namendment. This is the same President who has been opposed to every \nplan that has been put forward to balance the budget. When he vetoed \nit, he took on the responsibility of providing a legitimate \nalternative. He has, in fact, refused to do that. I think it is very, \nvery clear to the American people that, in fact, he has broken his word \nonce again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I was listening with great interest to the \ngoings on the Senate floor. I have been involved in all of the meetings \nthat have been held, both the joint meetings with the conferees to try \nand come up with a role, and I have been involved in many meetings on \nthe Democratic side. In 5 minutes I am going back to another meeting.\n  We, the Democrats in the House and the Senate, will try once again to \ncome up with something that would get the Government back working \nagain. I bear my share of the responsibility for what I think is the \ntotally ridiculous position we find ourselves in. Grown men and women, \nhere at 6:30 or so on a Friday evening, with the Government ready to \nshut down in another 5 hours, and we are quibbling. We cannot even get \nthrough a continuing resolution just offered by the minority leader to \nkeep the Government going for a few days. They turned that down.\n  You heard the objection by the majority leader to the Democratic \nleader's reasonable offer. How could any reasonable person object to \nkeeping the Government going for another 3 or 4 days? I do not think \nthis is the proudest moment in the history of the U.S. Senate. We all \nhave to bear our share of the responsibility for that failure.\n  When I have been hearing all of these remarks about the President of \nthe United States not being sincere, not making a legitimate offer, \nMadam President, I will not dignify that kind of talk with a lengthy \nstatement except to say that I do not agree at all with that kind of \nrhetoric.\n  I say, Madam President, in conclusion, that if those on the other \nside of the aisle are suggesting that we get real, then I suggest that \nthey get real by coming up front with what we all know has to be the \nmajor ``give'' to reach a balanced budget in 7 years, and that is the \nridiculous, outlandish tax cut that basically affects the wealthiest \namong us in America, $245 billion worth that is the centerpiece, I \nsuggest, of the Republican balanced budget amendment.\n  The main reason that the President of the United States properly \nvetoed the reconciliation bill which would have allowed that--how \nanybody on the Republican side of the aisle can in good conscience \nstand up and criticize us for not being real when they are insisting on \nthe centerpiece of their whole budget, unfortunately which is the $245 \nbillion tax cut basically weighted to the wealthiest people in the \nUnited States of America. Until they come off of that in a realistic \nfashion, we are not going to bend.\n\n  Fortunately, we have the President of the United States on our side \nwith a veto pen. Maybe I should stand corrected, Madam President. I \njust said they have a $245 billion tax cut that basically goes to \nprotect the wealthiest among us. I stand corrected. It is $242 billion, \nbecause in all good conscience the Republican conferees came to that \nmeeting today and they agreed to cut $5 billion--a total of $5 billion \nout of a $245 billion tax break for the wealthiest \n\n[[Page S18718]]\namong us, and they claim that we are not being reasonable.\n  I simply say, Madam President, while I am not particularly proud of \nwhat is going on in the U.S. Senate tonight, and for the life of me I \ncannot understand how reasonable people with legitimate differences of \nopinion on how we reach the balanced budget cannot agree to a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the Government running while we continue \nthe frustrating process of trying to come up with a balanced budget.\n  Madam President, there is no way that the Democrats can, should, or \nwill give up our insistence of at least a measure of protection for the \nMedicare recipients and the Medicaid recipients. The latter, I point \nout, is not welfare, it is health care. Most or all of the billions of \ndollars that we spend in the Medicaid Program, over half of it goes to \nthe senior citizens, the oldest and frailest among us who are lying in \nbeds, many of them never getting out of beds, in our nursing homes.\n  The Republicans are making draconian cuts in that program. Like it or \nnot, we will not have it. We will not put up with it. We are willing to \ncompromise, but we will not move until they get realistic on \neliminating that gross $242 billion tax cut for the wealthiest among us \nand the American people know and the American people by a vast majority \nstand with us, even though we stand in the minority.\n  I remind all in closing, Madam President, this Senator has been for a \nbalanced budget for a long, long time, worked hard for it. I voted for \nthe Republican constitutional amendment to balance a budget in 7 years. \nMy credentials are pretty hard to argue with. I simply say that I, once \nagain, emphasize that I am not particularly proud of what we are doing \non either side of the aisle this Friday night on December 15. I simply \nsay that if you are looking for someone to blame, we Democrats are \nwilling to take our share of the blame when and if the people on the \nother side of the aisle would get off their kick which is the \ncenterpiece of their budget proposal to throw away $242 billion in a \ntax break on the rich while savaging Medicare and Medicaid and other \nsocial programs that we think are very important. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I have had an opportunity to listen to \nthis whole discourse between the leaders and the chairman and now \nranking member of the Budget Committee, and the excellent statement \nthat came before.\n  Sometimes I wonder what country I am in, how much revisionist history \nthat we are going to be subjected to on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I \nhave come to expect it out of the White House. I turn on the White \nHouse now and I expect to hear the latest version of nonreality. It \njust comes up every day. As the Senator from Florida said, this \nPresident just does not know how to tell the truth anymore. He just \nmakes a promise and breaks it every day. Changes it every day. What is \nthe story today? What does the poll read today? How can I flip-flop \nagain today?\n\n  One time he is out criticizing the Republicans for gutting Medicare, \nand his wife and himself just 2 years prior to this were advocating the \nexact same reductions in Medicare. I will show you the videotape. The \nSenator from Kansas, the majority leader, is absolutely right. All of \nyou who can get a chance to watch ``Nightline''--this is not exactly a \nRepublican, GOP ``Rising Tide'' program, this is ``Nightline,'' ABC \n``Nightline'' on December 12--watch it. Get a copy of it. Get the \ntranscript. Find out the truth. Find out the truth.\n  Mrs. Clinton, in front of a committee I happen to serve on, the Ways \nand Means Committee, testified she wanted Medicare to grow between 6 \nand 7 percent. Our program under this bill grows Medicare at over 7 \npercent each year. And that is a slash? That is destroying? ``That is \nhorrible. You hate seniors.''\n  As his press secretary said, ``Oh, Republicans want these seniors to \ndie.'' That is the kind of rhetoric we get out of the White House--the \nWhite House, the President of the United States, not some two-bit \npeddler on the corner trying to hawk his wares, who can make any kind \nof outrageous statement he wants to, to try to sell the goods. No, the \nPresident of the United States, to the American public--bald-faced \nuntruths. Every day. Just like his press conference a little while ago. \nNot true. Not true.\n  Is his offer legitimate? Oh, how do you walk into a budget \nnegotiation that you say you are going to live up to what the \ncontinuing resolution, the last spending bill, said--and what did he \nsign into law? He signed into law a balanced budget, that we would \nbalance the budget in 7 years using the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers--into law. Not another one of his promises on the campaign \ntrail, which he broke, like cutting taxes for the middle class, but \nsigned something into law with a pen--not Lyndon Johnson's pen, maybe \nit wasn't Lyndon Johnson's pen--but into law.\n  So, where does he come, the day of the shutdown? He comes into a room \nwith a budget that does not even come close to balancing.\n  We have had the President's budgets before. In fact, we voted on them \non the floor of the Senate. The last one that was supposedly balanced \nin 10 years--96 to nothing. Not a single Democrat voted for his \nbalanced budget. Another phony, another untruth that even the people on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle could not stomach--this untruth. We \nare tired of stomaching untruths over here. We are downright getting \nangry over here. We are not angry because we feel betrayed. I disagree \nwith the Senator from Florida. I do not feel betrayed. I expect it. I \npredict it. This guy is not going to tell the truth. Just believe that. \nGo into negotiations believing that.\n\n  What I am upset about is I think we are missing an opportunity here \nto do something good for America. We can balance the budget of the \nUnited States. We can improve the economy of this country, create more \njobs, lower interest rates, give some of that money back to the \nAmerican families across this country.\n  Oh, I know these people who do not need the money, according to many. \nOh, you know, these working families making $30,000 a year who do not \nneed the money, who would waste it if they did not give it to us. We \ncan use it better than they can.\n  Oh, this is the tax break for the wealthy that we have been hearing \nabout. Let us talk about this tax break for the wealthy. Over 80 \npercent of the tax break for the wealthy goes to people who earn under \n$100,000 a year. That is the tax break for the wealthy--targeted. This \nis wonderful rhetoric, targeted at the wealthy, primarily the wealthy.\n  Let me tell you about targeting. Do you know who pays 50 percent, \nroughly 50 percent of the taxes in this country? The top 5 percent of \nincome earners in this country pay 50 percent of the taxes. So, if you \nwere going to give an across-the-board tax cut based on how much you \npay, obviously 50 percent of the benefit will go to the top 5 percent, \nbecause they pay 50 percent of the taxes. Yet, in this case, 80 percent \nof the benefits go to people who pay well under 50 percent of the \ntaxes.\n  How, is that targeted toward the wealthy? In reality, how can you \nmake the argument, based on those facts--nobody argues those facts, \nwhere this money is being allocated, who the tax cuts benefit. How can \nyou stand up on the floor of the Senate and make a factual statement, \nas the President has done--not on the floor of the Senate but in other \nplaces--and many Senators, make the statement that we have tax cuts \ntargeted for the wealthy, when they know that is a lie?\n  I am using strong terms like ``lie,'' but I do not think anybody \nunderstands these other sort of terms: obtuse, indirect, you know, not-\ncoming-forward. We have gone beyond that. We are just dealing with some \nsystematic disinformation campaigns that I have not seen in my \nlifetime.\n\n  I can tell you, we have not done a very good job--I will be self-\ncritical of myself and other Members on this side of the aisle and \nothers who are supporting a balanced budget--we have not done a very \ngood job of getting the facts out. In fact, if we do get the facts out, \nwe know we can succeed.\n  I will refer you to last Thursday's Wall Street Journal. There was a \npoll of Americans. The question was asked, ``Given the fact that under \nthe Republican budget, Medicare spending increases by 45 percent over \nthe next 7 years, do you think that is, A, too much; B, too little; or \nC, just about right as far as the increase is concerned? \n\n[[Page S18719]]\n\n  Madam President, 60 percent of the people said a 45 percent increase \nin Medicare spending was too much; 38 percent said it was just right; 2 \npercent thought it was too little. Two percent of the American public \nas surveyed thought that it was too little of an increase.\n  Now, with the recent changes that we have just made in our Medicare \nproposal, Medicare spending goes up at a higher rate than 45 percent. \nMaybe that would drop to 1 percent of people who think it is too \nlittle.\n  See, we believe that when we get the facts out--not rhetoric, not, \n``Oh, you are going to hurt this person or that person,'' or showing \nthe pictures, those graphic photos about how people are going to sleep \non grates, or your grandmother who is not going to be in the nursing \nhome.\n  We have a responsibility here to deal with the facts. The facts. We \nhave a responsibility here to base our decisions on what is good public \npolicy for today, tomorrow, and the future. We are standing up as \nRepublicans, doing what I believe is a very courageous thing. We are \ntaking on the sacred cows of Washington, DC. We are taking on Medicare \nand Medicaid and welfare. We are not doing it in a time of severe \nfinancial crisis or foreign crisis. We are doing it because we believe \nit is in the best interests of our children and their children, and \npeople living today to do just that.\n  I will never forget, as a Member of Congress, reading column after \ncolumn, expert after expert, people here on this floor and in the \nHouse, saying, ``When are we going to get statesmen again in this \ncountry? When are we going to get people who ignore the polls--who \nignore the polls--who ignore the moment, who forget about the next \nelection and think about the next generation? When are we going to get \nthese statesmen here in Washington again?\"\n\n  They are here. And they are willing to sit down and negotiate. They \nare willing to get serious about solving problems.\n  Maybe the White House should take a few days off from polling and \nquit worrying about what the public is saying tomorrow or the next day \nand think about what future generations are crying to us to do.\n  Senator Coverdell, from Georgia, comes to the floor on a frequent \nbasis and puts up a chart showing how, within 15 years, five programs \nwill consume every dollar of Federal spending. Five programs: Welfare, \nMedicaid, Federal retirement, Medicare, and Social Security. Those five \nentitlement programs will consume every Federal dollar, with the \nexception of payments for interest.\n  You can trot around here all you want about: You should not touch \nMedicare. You should not do this. If we do not control the rapid growth \nof all of these programs, you will not have to worry about Head Start \nfunding. We will not have to worry about Labor-HHS. There will be no \nLabor-HHS bill. We will not have to worry about continuing resolutions. \nWe will not have any money to appropriate. We will have all entitlement \nspending. We can go home. We do not have to pass any bills around here. \nEverything will be on automatic pilot. We will just spend away.\n  To suggest by our efforts to reform Medicare and Medicaid that we, \nsomehow, do not care about your grandmother or grandfather in a nursing \nhome or do not care about people who are indigent getting care is the \nlowest form of demagoguery.\n  Do you not care about people today and tomorrow? Do you not care \nabout the future? Do you not really care that unless we make changes, \nthese programs are doomed? You can whistle through the graveyard at \nnight all you want, but eventually, folks, we face the music. We must \nface the music. And when the President of the United States walks in \nwith his negotiators in a budget negotiation today to present an honest \nbudget, he does not even nick either of those programs, Medicare or \nMedicaid, does not even talk about reforms of either of those programs, \nwhen he knows that we have to make fundamental changes.\n  They did not walk out, but I would not have blamed Senator Domenici \nand Congressman Kasich to walk out. There comes a time in every \nnegotiation when one side just has to call the bluff, and right now the \nPresident is bluffing. He has been bluffing for months. He is hiding \nthose cards. He has not shown them to anybody. All he is doing is \nlooking at those cards and telling the American public: Oh, my cards \nare great. They protect our values. I sometimes quiver at what his \nvalues are. But they protect them.\n  Our cards are all laid out on the table. They are all face up. You \ncan see every one of them. You can see our good cards and you can see \nour bad cards. You know what we have said? We are willing to negotiate \nall of those cards. I do not know where the Senator from Nebraska or \nthe Senator from South Dakota are coming from in saying that we are not \nwilling to negotiate the tax cuts. I have not heard one remark from any \nof the negotiators or any of the leaders or anyone on this floor who \nsaid we are not willing to negotiate the tax cuts. We are certainly \nwilling to negotiate the tax cuts.\n  We have already, as the Senator from Nebraska said--and it may not \nhave been as much as he would like to have seen--we have already \nchanged the tax cut a little bit. We knocked off $5 billion. But \nremember, this is money that you work for. You would think around here \nthat a tax cut is money that we have in Washington that we may want to \ngive to you.\n  Let me remind you that you have to pay it here first. You have to \nwork hard to earn it and then pay it here. We do not have a right to \nit. This is not a Government where you say, well, 100 percent of what \nyou own is ours and whatever we are willing to give you back you can \nkeep. That is not the way it works. Over the next 7 years, taxes will \nincrease above the level today by over $3 trillion. Americans will pay \n$3 trillion more in taxes over the next 7 years. What are we \nsuggesting? Well, instead of increasing it $3 trillion, it will \nincrease a little less than that, about $240 billion less than that. \nBoy, what a giveaway. Boy, what a steal here. We are just throwing \nmoney out of Washington, are we not? You are going to give us $3 \ntrillion more and we will give you a couple hundred billion and we will \ntarget it specifically.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is, $141 billion of the $245 billion targeted \nspecifically at middle-income working families.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield as far as time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It has nothing to do with substance, but could I ask the \nSenator how long he expects to continue?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Just a few more minutes. I will be done in 5 more \nminutes, I would suggest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So we have a tax cut proposal targeted at middle-income \nworking families. I had done a few fundraisers last year when some of \nour local candidates were running, and there were people out there who \nexpressed to me the same sentiment that I hear from many Members on \nthis side at these fundraising events saying, ``We really don't need \nthese tax cuts.'' That is what these people at fundraisers were saying: \n``Well, we really don't need these tax cuts.'' And my response to them \nwas very simple. ``That's right, you don't need these tax cuts. But \nthere are millions of working families who do, who can't afford to be \nat these fundraisers because they have to feed children on two \nincomes.''\n  We want to give them a little break so maybe they do not have to work \ntwo jobs. Maybe they can just work one extra job to make ends meet. And \nwe want to reform Medicare so Medicare will be here not just for this \ngeneration of seniors but for future generations. It absolutely amazes \nme how anyone could stand up here and say we are for seniors but we are \nnot for touching Medicare in the face of a report that says it goes \nbankrupt in 7 years. How can you say that? How can you say you are for \nseniors?\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. What budget has the Senator seen that has not reduced \nMedicare?\n  What budget has the Senator seen that does not reduce Medicare?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The President's budget--\n  \n[[Page S18720]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. I just asked the Senator a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. --weakly addresses the issue of Medicare.\n  Mr. FORD. The budget that was presented reduced it $89 billion, the \nfirst one out of the box.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I take my time back.\n  Mr. FORD. Take it back, but be careful and be accurate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to be accurate. The President's budget, \nI will concede, reduces slightly the growth of Medicare.\n  Mr. FORD. What about the second offer?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But nowhere near the amount needed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Be happy to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator explain to me how increasing Medicare \nat the rate of 7 percent is described as a reduction in any budget? I \nhave not seen a single budget anywhere that reduces the level of \nspending in Medicare. I have only seen a budget that reduces it from \nproposals. So I would ask the Senator why he uses the term \n``reduction'' when in fact the amount of money being spent goes up each \nand every year?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator caught me in my own inaccuracy, and I \napologize for that, and I apologize to my Democrat colleague. I should \nnot use the term ``reduction.'' The Senator is absolutely right. I \nshould fill that in--reduction in the rate of growth of Medicare, \nbecause that is all we are doing. We are reducing the rate of growth.\n  As I said earlier, Medicare increases by over 45 percent over the \nnext 7 years. And so while the President wants to reduce the rate of \ngrowth a minimal amount, less, I might add, than his original proposal \nwhen he was advocating universal health reform, all of a sudden from \none year to the next he has decided that Medicare does not need to be \nreformed as much as he first thought it would.\n  Now, I do not know what has led him to that conclusion other than the \nfact that now we want to do it and he does not.\n  What he wanted to do before was reduce Medicare so we could get \nanother big Federal program started--universal health care, Government-\nrun health care. He was willing to sacrifice seniors, using his term, \nsacrifice seniors to fund a big new entitlement program, more health \ncare, Government run, but when it comes to balancing the budget, no, it \nis not worth that sacrifice then to balance the budget--if that is what \nit is, a sacrifice.\n  I guess it is a matter of your priorities. If your priority is to \ngrow the Government, create new entitlements, create new programs, oh, \nit is worth taking a little bit out of one Government program to fund a \nbrand new one. But if it is about balancing the budget, if it is about \nhelping working Americans, if it is about creating a better economy, if \nit is about giving up some power here in Washington, oh, no. No, that \nis not a high priority in this administration. What is a high priority \nis scare tactics. Scare tactics. Oh, no, we are not scaring 25-year-old \nfolks who are getting out of school and ready to take on the world. Oh, \nwe would not scare them because, you know what, you probably cannot \nscare them. Oh, let us scare our grandmothers. Let us scare the golden. \nLet us scare the people in nursing homes. Let us scare the people who \nrely on Federal Government checks. Let us scare those people. They are \nthe most vulnerable. We can get them. Oh, they rely on us. We can get \ntheir votes. We can swing their votes. It is pathetic. It is pathetic.\n\n  If the Senator from Kentucky is right that the President wants \nmeaningful Medicare reform, well, let us talk about it, do not run \naround the country, do not run around the country scaring seniors. Let \nus sit at the table and discuss it, and let us come forward with some \nreal reforms, let us come forward with some movement. We have not seen \nany movement.\n  The President's budget remains as it has at the same Medicare figure. \nHave we seen any changes in Medicare? No. Has he moved? No. Has he \nmoved on Medicaid? No. Has he proposed a balanced budget? No. Why? Why? \nMaybe that is the fundamental question we sort of have to end with \nhere. Why is it that the President of the United States, who promised--\nI know that is not necessarily a big thing around here--who promised to \nbalance the budget using honest numbers in 7 years, why has not he put \non the table a balanced budget? Why?\n  Why do you think that is? Do you think it is because that is not \npossible? No. It is not because it is not possible. We know it is \npossible. We actually did it in the U.S. Senate. We passed a balanced \nbudget. I give credit, 19 Democrats had a balanced budget, using \nCongressional Budget Office scoring, so I give them credit. They put \nforward a balanced budget. I did not agree with its priorities. It \nmight be a good place to start working from.\n  But why has not the President put forward a balanced budget? I think \nthe answer is pretty simple. Because if he was going to put forward a \nbalanced budget, keeping true to what he said he wanted to do, balance \nthe budget, provide middle-income tax cuts for families, which he said \nhe wanted to--promised during his election. I know that does not mean \nanything anymore. We do not believe candidates anymore, some more than \nothers, but he said he wanted to do that. He wanted to save Medicare, \nend welfare as we know it. That was part of his election campaign--end \nwelfare as we know it.\n  Why could he not come up with that balanced budget? The answer is \nvery simple. If you want to do what the President says he wants to do, \nhe has to make changes to his Medicaid and Medicare proposal. And if he \ndoes that, then he cannot run around the country scaring seniors \nanymore. I mean, let us cut to the chase here, folks. That is the \nbottom line.\n  We all know where the savings have to come from. It is no secret \nhere. If you take Social Security off the table, if you take Federal \nretirement off the table, and you are going to reform entitlements, \nwhere do you get your savings from? Where are you going to get your \nreforms from? We all know the answer. The President knows the answer.\n\n  And why it is he is so reticent to come forward and put it on the \ntable? Because he loses his political cards if he does it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield? I wonder how much time the \nSenator is going----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was interrupted, and it threw off my train of \nthought. I will do my best. If I am not continued to be interrupted, I \nwill do my best to close up pretty soon.\n  Mr. FORD. We would love for you to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I know the Senator from Kentucky would love to have the \nopportunity to have the floor and say some things. And I do not think \nwe are going to close down shop here any time soon, so I am sure you \nwill have plenty of chances to talk for quite some time.\n  But the reason that the President has not come forward with a \nbalanced budget is simple--because he does not want to make the hard \nchoices, he does not want to make the politically difficult choices of \nbalancing the budget, he does not want to lead. It is much easier to \nsit up in the gallery and throw stones at the players.\n  Oh, it is easy to be a fan. It is easy to be a critic. It is easy to \nbe condescending. It is very hard to get on the field, put the pads on, \nand hit the line, make the tough choices. The President would rather \nstay off the field.\n  Well, unfortunately, when you become President, you have to make some \nof the tough choices. That is why you get paid the big bucks because \nyou have to make tough choices. And the reason that the Republicans are \nsaying, ``Call me when you are ready,'' is because the President is not \nready yet. He has not made the tough choices. And this is not the \nSenator from Pennsylvania talking, this is just about every major \npublication in this country who are beginning, slowly beginning, to \nunderstand that the President is not playing from the top and dealing \nfrom the top of the deck.\n  It is about promises. And I will conclude with this. No applause \nnecessary. We promised--we promised, those of us elected in 1994 and \nhere in the Senate, and many others who were elected in their elections \neven prior to 1994, we promised that we would balance this budget. We \npromised. And I know promises are not thought a lot of down here. In \nfact, they are just sort of made to get elected. I know that is the \ncommon thing. You say things to get elected. Say you are for a balanced \nbudget \n\n[[Page S18721]]\nand vote against it on the floor; say you are for tax cuts and vote \nagainst on it the floor or do not propose it in your bills. But you \nknow what? We promised.\n\n  I will tell you a story of a man who was the head of a Bible college \nin South Carolina, something he always wanted to do. His father started \nthe college, and he always thought of his life's vocation as taking \nover the college from his father and leading that school. And he did. \nHe did for several years and was terrific at it. Loved his work.\n  Unfortunately, his wife came down with Alzheimer's. And, as you know, \nAlzheimer's is a very debilitating disease. Over time she got worse and \nworse and worse to the point where she needed around-the-clock care. \nShe was completely incapacitated, did not know who anybody was, did not \nknow who he was. And he made the decision to quit his job at the Bible \ncollege and give up his vocation.\n  The members of the board of the Bible college came to him and said, \n``What are you doing? You are giving up something you have always \nwanted to do, and you are doing it so well. Look at the number of \npeople you are going out to educate, to spread the Lord's word all \nthroughout the country. And you are giving that up to go home and take \ncare of your wife? She does not even know who you are.''\n  And he said two things. First he said, ``She may not know who I am, \nbut I know who she is. And, second, when I married her, I promised till \ndeath do us part. And there is something more than a calling from God; \nit is a promise.''\n  We promised. And we are going to stay here every day, all day if \nnecessary. And yes, we will storm out of rooms and maybe they do not \nstorm out but they should have for the demagoguery that is going on. \nBut we will be here every day ready, willing and able to negotiate \nbecause we promised. And I have told the leader I will be here \nChristmas Day. If we are going to vote on the floor of the Senate to \nsend American men and women to be in tents and around kerosene heaters \nin Tuzla, then I can be away from my family on the floor of the Senate \nto save the next generation of Americans.\n  We will be here. And we will win. The President will eventually \nunderstand that our resolve to balance this budget is greater than his \nto get away with not doing it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Before the Senator leaves the floor, I disagree with him on many of \nthe things he said; and on a couple I agree. When he said we need more \nstatesmen in the U.S. Senate and in Government, he is right. We need \nmore statesmen and we need more stateswomen in politics.\n  But I want to say to my friend that statesmen do not show disrespect \nto the Office of the Presidency and statesmen do not use the word \n``lie'' on the floor of the Senate. And I think it is very important \nfor the sanctity of this institution that we respect each other and \nthat we respect the Office of the Presidency.\n  And I have to say that I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania will read \nhis remarks in the Record and will have an opportunity to go over those \nremarks.\n  Perhaps when he reads those remarks, he will understand the \ndifference between making a point in a way that is disrespectful and \nmaking a point in a way that is respectful.\n  I will say to him further that he talks a lot on this floor about \nchildren. Children watch us debate. Children need to learn respect, and \nI hope that he will think about what I have said, and perhaps the next \ntime he comes on to this floor of the U.S. Senate to disagree with the \nPresident of the United States, because he happens to believe the \nPresident is wrong to stand up against $270 billion cuts in Medicare \nand change the nature of Medicaid, he thinks the President is wrong to \nstand up against tax cuts which, in fact--in fact--benefit the \nwealthiest among us--as a matter of fact, if you earn over $350,000 in \nthis Republican budget that they are so proud of, if you earn over \n$350,000, you will get back thousands of dollars each and every year. \nAs a matter of fact, over a 10-year period, you will probably get back \nmore than $80,000 in taxes, and that is why the President is making the \nSenator from Pennsylvania so angry. That is why the President of the \nUnited States is making the majority leader so angry. And that is why \nthe President of the United States caused the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Mack, to say, ``I'm angry.''\n  You know what? That is just fine with me. That is just fine with me. \nIf you are angry because the President is standing up for the people of \nthis country, not the special powerful few, but the people of this \ncountry, then go ahead and be angry.\n  To talk about, as the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, did that \nthe Democrats have no guts, let us talk about that for a minute. When \nwe started here on the floor of this U.S. Senate talking about the \nbudget of Newt Gingrich that was the centerpiece of the Contract With \nAmerica, we were not popular. We were not popular at all. As a matter \nof fact, the polls said the Republicans were flying high. But we stood \non the floor of the U.S. Senate and we said we will not allow the power \nof Government to stand behind the wealthiest few and abandon the middle \nclass and the people in nursing homes and the people on Medicare; we \nwill not allow that.\n  And suddenly, the people in this country woke up, and they heard us \nand they heard this President. Yes, they want a balanced budget, and so \ndo we, and we voted for several of them. They agree with us. Yes, they \nwant a balanced budget, but they want a balanced budget that does not \nhurt the elderly, that does not hurt the middle class, that does not \nhurt the children, that does not hurt the environment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, the Republican budget, every one \nthey put forth, raises taxes on anyone making less than $10,000 a year, \nwhich includes the majority of people in America?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is accurate, a majority of people who earn less \nthan $10,000 a year are hit with a tax increase in the Republican \nbudget.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will just let me again ask another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Anyone in the United States, which includes a majority of \nthe people in America, under the budget proposals we have gotten from \nRepublicans, every one of them, everyone making less than $10,000 a \nyear, will have a tax increase, is that not right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is true, a majority of those earning under $10,000 a \nyear will be hit with a tax increase and the tax cuts go to the \nwealthiest. That is a fact. And as I serve on the Budget Committee, I \nsay to my friend, I tried. We offered amendments that said if there \nwill be any tax breaks or cuts it should be aimed at the middle class, \nnot at the wealthy.\n  I know that my friend from North Dakota has been wanting to speak, so \nI am going to sum it up in about 3 more minutes, and I want to make a \npoint. There is no reason to shut this Government down, no reason in \nthe world to shut this Government down. It is childish, it is stamping \nyour feet, it is saying, ``I'm taking my books and I'm going home.'' \nBut more than that, it is selfish, and it is cruel to do it.\n  I want to talk to you in my remaining moments about a couple of \npeople in California. Ken Takada, a veterans claims examiner in Los \nAngeles. His job is to make sure veterans receive the health and \npension benefits to which they are entitled. If the Government shuts \ndown, Ken will not be there to see that our veterans get what they \ndeserve. Even after the shutdown ends, its effects will be felt for a \nlong time, because while the VA is closed, new files are piled on his \ndesk, lengthening the case backlog that is already too long.\n  So the veterans will get hurt and the shutdown will hurt Ken. He is \nnot independently wealthy. He lives like most Americans, from paycheck \nto paycheck. If his pay does not come in, he could default on his \nstudent loans.\n  But when Senator Daschle stood here and offered a continuing \nresolution that was clean that said keep the Government going, let \nthese people go to work, let them do the work they are paid to do, let \nthem have some sense of \n\n[[Page S18722]]\nsecurity, the Majority Leader Dole objected.\n  So let me tell you, my friends, it is an ugly situation here. \nSenators who will not lose a day's pay--there is no corner on anger in \nthis Chamber, and I know the Presiding Officer and I tried hard to make \nsure that we sacrificed something when we cannot get our act together \nand the Government shuts down.\n  We have a bill that simply says we should be treated like the most \nadversely affected Federal employee. But, no, the majority leader \nobjects when the Democratic leader says, ``Let's keep the Government \ngoing just for a few days.'' And what is the price that Senators and \nCongressmen and Newt Gingrich get to pay? Zero, because Newt Gingrich \nhimself has blocked that bill from coming before the House.\n  It has passed here three separate times. I think it is an utter \ndisgrace, it is despicable. I hope every single person in this country \nwill let Speaker Gingrich know and call him on the phone 225-0600--it \nis a 202 area code--and tell him that he does not deserve to get his \npay as long as Federal employees are not getting theirs.\n  Let me just say this. They can put any spin they want on the other \nside of the aisle. They can do it. But it comes down to the bottom \nline: This President is not going to allow Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation, or the environment to suffer in order to give a huge tax \nbreak to the wealthiest people. That is the issue and they do not like \nit. They will spin it their way and tell you they are going to save \nMedicare.\n\n  I will ask you to look at Newt Gingrich's speech made 2 months ago \nwhen he said, ``We cannot kill Medicare outright. We are going to let \nit wither on the vine.'' Those are his words, not mine.\n  The majority leader, Senator Dole, who says they are going to save \nMedicare--and he bragged about it in a recent speech that when it was \nbrought up in the U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress, he was here to fight \nagainst it. So if the American people believe the Republican Party is \ngoing to save Medicare, either, first, they do not know their recent \nhistory and past history, or, second, they must think that Jack the \nRipper is Mother Teresa, because there is no way that this Republican \nParty, given its history and given this budget, can stand with a \nstraight face and say they are the party that is trying to save \nMedicare, and, oh, they are the party that is going to make sure the \nmiddle class and the poor are brought along. It just is not true.\n  So there is a lot of anger around here. There is a lot of \ndisappointment around here, and it permeates through this Chamber, but, \nfrankly, it is for different reasons.\n  I stand with President Clinton in standing up against a budget that \nwould be put in balance at the expense of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I appreciate the recognition. I say to \nmy friend, I know he has been on his feet. I have been in the Chamber \nfor some time, also. I will not go on as long as my colleague from \nPennsylvania, and I assure him he will get an opportunity to respond as \nquickly as I can make a few points.\n  I will not use words like ``lie.'' I will not use ``despicable'' and \n``disgraceful.'' I came over here a little bit angry, but I will not \nuse the word ``anger.'' I will do my best to try to analyze what I \nthink is really going on here and hope it might make a modest \ncontribution to the dialog.\n  I do not believe that anybody is proposing savaging Medicare. That \nwas a phrase that was used earlier on this floor. I am willing to \nstipulate, for this Senator, right this moment, that I will accept the \nPresident's number for Medicare. It happens to mean, in terms of \nincreased premiums--one of the things the President has been most upset \nabout--that I am now sacrificing Federal revenue of 39 cents per day \nper recipient by going to the President's number.\n\n  I know enough about forecasting to know that I am perfectly safe in \nsaying I will take the President's number as to what the premiums will \nbe 7 years from now, because anyone who really thinks we can make a \nforecast within pennies that is good for 7 years is kidding himself or \nherself. So I am willing to stipulate that the Medicare debate over \nnumbers is off the table because I am willing to accept the President's \nnumbers as the target numbers rather than the Republican numbers \nbecause they are literally pennies apart. There is no point in fighting \nover it. If that means that I am now redeemed from savaging Medicare, I \nappreciate the redemption. But what it really means, Madam President, \nis that the phrase savaging Medicare is a misplaced phrase because the \nPresident, himself, has proposed a number that is, as you go over the \nlife of the program, simply pennies away from the number we have been \nattacked for in these many months.\n  I would like to talk about the tax cut for the wealthiest among us. \nOne of the most serious problems we face in this country--which we \nsometimes lose sight of, but occasionally turn to--is the fact that \nreal wages among people who work for salaries and work for wages, who \ndo not have investment income and interest income, have been stagnant \nfor many years. The stagnancy goes back into past administrations. It \nhas not changed under this administration. It is one of the economic \nproblems we face--real wages for what we call ordinary people have been \nstagnant.\n  I will confess that I approached the tax cut for children with some \nconcern because I looked at it solely in economic terms, and I said to \nmyself that this particular tax cut is not going to increase the rate \nof growth in the economy, which is the root problem. There are now \neconomic studies that challenge that conclusion that demonstrate that \nthis tax cut will, in fact, stimulate economic growth. But I will leave \nthat debate for another time.\n  I will simply raise this point. If, in fact, one of our more serious \ndifficulties is stagnant real wages for ordinary people, and it is a \nfact that--being the father of six children, I know this one--the \nbiggest impact comes upon those who have kids. They have to worry about \nclothing them and educating them and taking care of them. What could be \na better way of attacking that particular economic problem than saying \nto those ordinary people, who have children, that we will allow you to \nkeep an extra $500 per year for each one of your children, while we \nwork on this long-term problem of solving our growth difficulties?\n\n  The Senator from California was talking about people who are earning \n$350,000 a year who are going to get $100,000 in tax benefits. My \nreaction is that they are sure going to have an awful lot of kids if \nthey are going to get $100,000 a year, because the tax break comes at \n$500 per child. That is going to require more children than I know of \nanybody having had to get to the full $100,000. We are talking about \n$500 per child for the man, or the woman, or the couple, who has a \nchild, who is working for wages at $20,000 or $30,000 or $40,000 a year \nand is having financial problems, because his or her real income has \nbeen stagnant for years.\n  So I have revised my position on the tax cut, as I have looked at it \nin those terms, and said that this makes sense. It certainly makes a \nlot more sense than taking that $500 and bringing it to Washington and \nspending it on some kind of job retraining program in the hope that you \ncan do something about the stagnant real wages of that wage earner. \nThis is not a tax cut for the rich. The statistics demonstrate it. The \ndemagoguery goes the other way. We need to keep our focus elsewhere.\n  What is this really all about, Madam President? Why are we facing \nthis kind of a crisis here tonight? Some would summarize it by saying \nthe Republicans are willing to risk shutting down the Government in \norder to get a balanced budget.\n  The President is willing to risk shutting down the Government in \norder to prevent a balanced budget.\n  I prepared to say that and I decided, no, I better go farther than \nthat; that is too glib a summary. This is what I think this is all \nabout. Let us go back to the 1992 campaign. My friend, Senator Dorgan, \nwho is probably going to be recognized next, and I both ran for the \nSenate in 1992. So did Bill Clinton run for President in 1992. I do not \nknow what the Senator's campaign slogan was, but I know what mine was. \nIt was change. \n\n[[Page S18723]]\n\n  I had a little trouble with that because somebody said, ``That is \nGovernor Clinton's slogan. He is running on change.'' The woman elected \nto the second congressional district in Utah, Karen Shepherd, a \nDemocrat, ran on change. We all got elected. President Clinton got \nelected on change, I got elected on change, and Karen Shepherd got \nelected on change, Republicans and Democrats, on the wave was change. \nThen the President put forth his first serious financial proposal. It \nwas a $19 billion stimulus package saying we had to stimulate a \nsluggish economy by spending $19 billion in an emergency appropriation.\n\n  Why do I point that out, Madam President? For this reason: Emergency \nappropriations do not go through the budget process. Emergency \nappropriations go directly to the deficit. We have an emergency, we \nhave to bypass the budget process. We stood here on this floor \nrecognizing that the procedure of taking emergency appropriations to \nbypass the budget and taking care of your political constituency in an \nemergency appropriations bill was not changed, it was the ultimate \nexample of business as usual in this town.\n  We Republicans like to say we brilliantly executed a strategy \nblocking that. As a matter of fact, we stumbled into it. There was not \nany brilliant strategy. It just kind of happened. Then we discovered \nsomething. The American people liked the fact that we blocked the \nstimulus package which was really business as usual.\n  So the 1994 election, in my view, turned on this issue and this issue \nprimarily: Which party is really the party of change? The American \npeople had no change--what they wanted. They voted for change in 1992. \nThey felt they did not get it, so they voted for it in 1994.\n  What are we talking about tonight, Madam President? We are talking \nabout change. We are talking about which party is most dedicated to \nchanging the way the Government works. We are cloaking that debate in \nconversation about the rate of growth in Medicare, or slashing Medicare \nif you prefer that rhetoric. We are cloaking that debate in talks about \ntax cuts for the rich, and then others respond saying it is not for the \nrich. We can have that debate. What we are really talking about is \nwhether or not the Government is going to fundamentally change the way \nit does business and the way it keeps its books--the balanced budget \namendment, the balanced budget bill, a balanced budget in 7 years.\n  Let me conclude by telling you Government as usual--and why I think \nwe need change. I have been around this town or observed this town for \nover 30 years, even though I have been a Senator for only 3 years. I \nhave seen politicians of both parties and of all political stripes--\nliberals, conservatives, moderates--all stand up and claim their \nundying allegiance to a balanced budget. When?\n  It reminds me of the old Wall Street advice by a wise old broker who \nsays, ``When somebody asks you about a stock price, give them a number \nor give them a date but never give them both.'' Stocks going to \ndouble--do not tell them when. Give them a number, give them a date, \nbut never give them both.\n\n  That has been Government as usual with balanced budget--Republicans \nhave done it, Ronald Reagan has done it, Democrats have done it, Jimmy \nCarter did it--give them a number, give them a date, but never give \nthem both. We have to give a date here.\n  When is the date that the budget will be balanced? It is always in \nthe outyears. That is a phrase that the American people do not \nunderstand. The budgeteers tell you outyears means the years out there \nsomewhere in the future. I discovered that outyears means never. The \nbudget is going to be balanced in the outyears. That means never.\n  What this fight is all about is whether or not we are going to take \nGovernment as usual and procedure as usual that promises a balanced \nbudget in the outyears, or whether we will take the first steps this \nyear and in this budget.\n  President Clinton sent us a budget. It was put on the floor. It was \ndefeated 99 to 0. I hope the people that are guiding the President in \nthese budget negotiations remember that under law he has to send us a \nbudget for fiscal year 1997. His budget for fiscal year 1996 was \ndefeated 99 to 0. He has to send us a budget for fiscal year 1997. If, \nindeed, what we are proposing is too draconian for fiscal year 1996, \nand he really does want to get the budget balanced by 1997, he has to \nbe far more draconian in 1997 than the Republicans will be, because we \nhave a head start on him by virtue of what we are willing to undertake \nin fiscal year 1996. Of course he would prefer 10 years--10 years gives \n3 more outyears in which to make his projections.\n  I think with all the rhetoric that is going on, the real core problem \nhere that is dividing the two parties and that has created the anger \nand the excitement and the specter of certain portions of the \nGovernment being shut down tomorrow is more fundamental than the \nrhetoric around. It is over the question of where is the Government \ngoing, and are we finally going to undertake the hard choices of doing \nit now rather than giving us the rhetoric of doing it in the outyears.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, I offer this summary which may be a \nlittle irreverent but that I think helps us understand what we are \ntalking about. The Presidency of John F. Kennedy has been summarized in \nshorthand now by virtue of a comment his wife made after his death when \nshe said his favorite musical was Camelot. She described how she and he \nwould listen to records in the evening as they were falling asleep. \nThey would put a record on it and listen to it, and his favorite \nmusical was Camelot. She said--referring to the Kennedy Presidency from \nthe language of that musical--``Let the word go forth and let it never \nbe forgot that once there was a place that was known as Camelot.'' And \nthat name has stuck.\n\n  If I may, with I hope appropriate respect, suggest that for this \nadministration, the musical should not be Camelot but Annie because the \nhit song in Annie is ``Tomorrow.'' ``Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you \ntomorrow, you're always a day away.'' I suggest that this debate is \nabout whether or not we attack the difficulty of balancing the budget \ntoday or whether we leave it for the outyears--``Tomorrow, tomorrow, \nalways a day away.''\n  I side with those that say tomorrow is never going to come. If we are \ngoing to deal with the problems of the balanced budget we must deal \nwith it now. We must deal with it here no matter how difficult and \nproblematic it becomes and how angry it makes us. We must step out to \nthat hard choice and deal with it today instead of waiting for the time \nthat is always a day away.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have stayed on the floor for some while \nbecause I felt a number of things need to be said in this debate, and \nthe longer I stay the more I regretted having stayed, listening to some \nof the debate.\n  I must say the Senator from Utah is, I think, one of the most \nthoughtful Members of this Senate, and I admire him and respect his \nviews. He has, as he usually does, expressed his views with great \nrespect tonight on the floor of the Senate.\n  I say to him, however, that his use of the song from Annie is \nprobably an appropriate starting point because the implication of the \nsong that is sung in Annie, ``Tomorrow, tomorrow,'' is the \npostponement. He says that there is not today, there is always the \npostponement. Actually, the lyrics of that song are ``The sun will come \nup tomorrow,'' and so on, and it seems to me that that does represent a \nkind of a difference here.\n  If your notion is there is only today, we are only dealing with \ntoday, I guess you sometimes forget about the tomorrow--the 5-year-old \nthat will be in first grade next year; the kid who is 3 that might get \na chance to go to Head Start next year. Really, the difference in \npriorities among many of us is to look to tomorrow, look to the future, \nlook to what this country is going to be, in 2 years, 5 years 7 years, \n10 years, look about what we will do for our children, what we will do \nwhen people reach retirement age, what we will do about those who want \nan education. Yes, it is really about tomorrow. Let us do what we \nshould do today. Let us meet our responsibilities today and also decide \nto care about tomorrow, to care about our children, to care about our \nelderly, and to do the right thing.\n\n  You will not hear me in discussing our differences use the terms \n``liar,'' \n\n[[Page S18724]]\n``dishonest,'' ``untruthful.'' And I must say, having sat and listened, \nnow, this evening, that this, because of the circumstances of this \nbudget debate and the breakdown of the negotiations and the potential \nof another shutdown of the Government, is not a proud day in the 104th \nCongress. I am not proud of the debate I have heard here in the Senate \nover the last couple of hours, with pejorative terms about motives of \nothers.\n  It seems to me that we can disagree without being disagreeable with \neach other. We can talk about fundamental policy differences--Medicare, \neducation, agriculture, veterans, Medicaid and so many others--without \ndeciding that because you are on one side or the other of the debate, \nyou are unworthy or you are not able to think or you are not honest. \nThat is not, in my judgment, debate that advances the interests of the \nSenate or the interests of this country.\n  I put my hand on a Bible when I was sworn into the U.S. Senate, and \nit was one of the proudest days of my life. I did not come here to want \nto create problems. I came here because I wanted to solve problems. I \nwant this country to be better. I have children who are in school. I \nwant life to be better for those children. I want the world to be \nsafer. I want our schools to be better. I want their job opportunities \nto be broader. That is what I want to participate in.\n  We might reach those goals in different ways because we have \ndifferent philosophies, but I expect most of us want the same thing. \nThe question is, why can we not decide to sit down and reason together \nwithout the threats and without the language and without the punitive \nkind of approach that some here would take; to say: In order for me to \nwin I must make you lose?\n  I want to talk just a little about the pieces to this puzzle, this \nissue of a Federal budget. We talk a lot about numbers, and it is true \nit is a puzzle with pieces that deal with numbers. The question is, How \ndo you make them all fit together? The numbers all represent \ninvestments or expenditures for one reason or another. We do not often \nenough talk about what it is this country has tried to do.\n  I was on a radio program some while ago. Someone asked me of my \nheritage, and I explained about my great grandmother Caroline who, with \nsix children, after her husband died, left Saint Paul, MN, and took her \nchildren to the prairies of Hettinger County, ND, and pitched a tent. \nThis woman, born in Norway, whose husband died, went to Hettinger \nCounty, ND, to pitch a tent, build a house, and build a farm, and raise \nher kids.\n  Someone called the radio show and said, ``I wonder what she would \nhave done had there been a welfare program back at the turn of the \ncentury? Would she not have been enticed, probably, just to go on \nwelfare?''\n  I said, Who do you think gave her the 160 acres of land? What do you \nthink the Homestead Act was? Do you think that was the largesse of \nChase Manhattan Bank? Do you think it was the Rockefeller Trust that \nsaid, ``Here, if you will do this, we will provide you 160 acres of \nland''? No. It was the Federal Government. It was the Homestead Program \nthat said, ``Here is an incentive for you to do the right thing.''\n\n  And this sturdy Norwegian woman--Lord only knows the courage it must \nhave taken to take her children and go to the prairies of North Dakota \nand pitch a tent and start a farm by herself. This sturdy woman said, \n``I am going to do that.'' But it was the Homestead Act that helped her \ndo that as well.\n  I am proud of a lot of those things. I am enormously proud that we \ndecided to have an REA program that lights up the farms in America. I \nam proud of the fact that we have a Medicare Program. Over half the \nsenior citizens of this country 35 years ago had no health care at all. \nMr. President, 99 percent of them are covered for health care these \ndays. I am proud of that. If someone stands up here and says, ``Why \ndon't you decide to start defending these things?'' To put us--I am not \ndefensive about it. I am proud of what we have done. We have made this \na better country because of it.\n  Do we have to balance the books in this country? Do we have to \nbalance the budget? Of course we do. That is not at odds. Of course we \nmust. The question is how do we do that? How do we do it in the right \nway that serves this country's interests?\n  I come to this floor and I hear people stand up all the time and they \npoint a finger at somebody and say, ``You, you are the one. You are the \nbig spender. You are the obstacle. You never want to cut spending.''\n  The Presiding Officer knows what the business of the Senate is \ntonight. The business of the Senate is the Defense authorization bill, \nthat is what is on the floor right now. Let us talk just for a second \nabout some of the facts.\n  You know, you spend money not in some aggregate, hypothetical scheme \ncalled a budget debate; you spend money by authorizing it in a Defense \nauthorization bill and an appropriations bill. I just want to show, for \nthose who are interested, what is on the floor tonight: A Defense \nauthorization bill. Mr. President, $7 billion was added to this bill \nbeyond what the Air Force, the Army, the Marines and the Navy said they \nwanted or needed to defend this country. They said, here is what we \nneed. Here is what we ask you for. Here are the trucks, the ships, the \nplanes, the submarines we need to defend our country.\n  And then this Congress, this body says, General, Admiral, Mr. \nSecretary--you are wrong about that. You need $7 billion more. You need \n17 more T-39 jet trainers. And we insist you buy them. You need six EA \nstrike aircraft. You need an LHD-7 amphibious ship that costs $1.3 \nbillion, and you need another ship. You did not ask for them, but you \nalso need a second amphibious ship for $900 million. You need six more \nF-15's that you did not ask for. You need six more F-16 jet fighters \nthat you did not want and we insist you buy them. We want, we insist \nyou order three C-130 cargo aircraft. B-2 bombers? We think you are \nwrong when you say you do not want B-2 bombers. We want you to buy 20 \nof them, at $35 billion.\n  Star wars? We insist you buy it. We increase 100 percent of the \nfunding for star wars, and we demand you begin to build it in 1999. By \nthe way, we want multiple sites and we want it to be space-based.\n  I could go on at some length. This is a long list of what people who \nsay they want to balance the budget have decided they want to add to \nthis bill. After all, this is a specific bill. This is where you really \nbegin to balance the budget, in day-to-day individual decisions.\n\n  In fact, when this bill came to the floor of the Senate, do you know \nthere was a little provision tucked away in it calling to spend $60 \nmillion for blimps? Yes, blimps. I went on a short scavenger hunt, \nasking who would want to buy blimps in the defense budget? Could \nsomeone tell me who the blimp is for? Will there be a name on the \nblimp? Will that identify the author? There were no hearings--$60 \nmillion for blimps.\n  My point is this: The next time someone stands up and points at \nsomeone else and says, ``You are the big spender,'' I ask them how did \nyou feel about this? Do you want to balance the budget? Let us start \nwith the first step right now, 10 minutes to 8, let us decide we do not \nneed B-2 bombers the Air Force says it does not want. Let us decide we \nshould not build a star wars program the Secretary of Defense says is \nunwise to build at this point. This is where budget cutting starts. \nThis is where balancing the budget starts. And the fact is, the folks \nwho are here busting their buttons, bellowing, often the loudest--not \neverybody bellows, but there are some bellowers--bellowing the loudest \nabout they are the ones who would solve America's problems and balance \nthe budget, are the very ones who come to the floor with this set of \npriorities.\n  The Treasury Department did a story about the numbers that I think \nmakes it pretty clear. It says, picture it this way: Spending and \ntaxing priorities in the budget that has been offered and that the \nPresident vetoed, take a roomful of people--my hometown was 400 \npeople--a roomful of 400 people. Get them all in the room, and you have \na community meeting. You say to them: Here is the way we divide this up \nin this approach to balancing the budget. We want the 20 percent of you \nin this room who have the lowest incomes to move all your chairs to \nthis side of the room. And so you get the 20 percent \n\n[[Page S18725]]\nwith the lowest income moved over to this side of the room. And we say: \nWe have news for you. We have to cut the budget. We just have to \ntighten our belts. We have to cut back. You 20 percent with the lowest \nincomes, you get 80 percent of the burden of the spending cuts in the \nbudget.\n  Now, we know that is bad news, so we do not want the entire room to \nbe filled with bad news. We do have some good news. We would like the \n20 percent with the highest incomes in this room to move their chairs \nover to this side of the room, and they do. So the 20 percent with the \nhighest incomes are all sitting on this side of the room. We say: Now, \nwe have some good news for you. You 20 percent with the highest incomes \nget 80 percent of the tax benefits in this bill.\n  And that is the problem with the priorities.\n  I am not here to point fingers but neither am I willing to allow \npeople to stand in the Chamber of the Senate and say it is the \nDemocrats that have misrepresented what the majority party has done.\n  I wish to hold up a chart that I held up before. It is Kevin \nPhillips, whom all of you know, a noted author. He is a Republican \npolitical analyst. He has been a Republican all of his life. And here \nis what he says about it. Not me, a Republican, Kevin Phillips, has \nwritten:\n\n       Spending on Government programs--\n\n  He is speaking about the reconciliation bill to balance the budget \nthat the President said was unfair and he vetoed it.\n\n     from Medicare and education to home heating oil assistance is \n     to be reduced in ways that principally burden the poor and \n     the middle class, while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in \n     ways that predominantly benefit the top one or two percent of \n     Americans.\n\n  That is not me saying that. This is the writing of a Republican \npolitical analyst. And frankly, he is right and that is the problem \nwith the priorities. We can do better than that. We can do better than \nthat. The common interest of Republicans and Democrats in the Congress \nto come together and compromise can produce a result that is more fair \nto the American people.\n  We, I think, should solve this problem. There is no reason for there \nto be a shutdown of Government services tonight. That is a failure by \nany standard, a failure shared, in my judgment, by both political \nparties. I do not deny that. But there is not any reason that we ought \nnot have negotiations that reach a result which is good for the future \nof this country.\n  Tomorrow, tomorrow, the sun will come up tomorrow. There is a \ntomorrow. There are people who will experience the joys of being an \nAmerican tomorrow, hopefully benefit from the fruits of what being an \nAmerican is--going to good schools, having a nutritious lunch for a \nlow-income child in the middle of the day at a school lunch program or \nfor a 4-year old to be able to show up with hope in their heart because \nwe have a Head Start Program that says you come from a troubled family \nand you come from circumstances that you were not selecting when you \nwere born; you did not select to be born into poverty, but we are going \nto give you a head start. We are going to give a head start in life.\n\n  I saw 60 of them out here in the Capitol this morning; a group of 60 \nHead Start kids came in with parents and teachers, and I stopped and \ntalked to them because I love the Head Start Program. It works. We know \nit works. It works well. It invests in young kids. It invests in the \nfuture. And we are saying with the priorities in this Congress that we \nwant to increase star wars by 100 percent; we want to increase the \nfunding for star wars by 100 percent, but we want to say to 55,000 \nkids, each one of whom has a name and hope in their heart for a better \nday tomorrow, we do not have room for you in the Head Start Program; we \ncannot afford you. You have to be told you are going to have to leave \nthe Head Start Program. I am just saying to you that is not the right \nset of priorities.\n  Let me in just a final moment come to a specific piece that was \nraised by others because I think, to be fair to the President, we need \nto have the agreement that was entered into some 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago put \nin the Record, and I am going to read it because no one who has \nreferenced this agreement has read it out loud. This is a CR commitment \nto a 7-year balanced budget.\n\n       The President and Congress shall enact legislation in the \n     first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced \n     budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office. The President and the Congress \n     agree that the balanced budget must protect future \n     generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, \n     provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, \n     agriculture, national defense, veterans and the environment.\n       Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to \n     help working families and to stimulate future economic \n     growth.\n       B. The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office based on its most recent current \n     economic and technical assumptions following a thorough \n     consultation and review with the Office of Management and \n     Budget and other Government and private experts.\n\n  The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office. The President has agreed to that. I agree to that. I \nbelieve it should be so. But there is nowhere in this document that \nsuggests that the discussions at this point in the process can or will \nbe scored by CBO because the fact is CBO still has not scored the \noptions that are laying on the table. So you work from a series of \noptions to get to an end point where you reach agreement and that will \nbe scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The President agreed that \nthat is what it will be. But it also is an acknowledgement that it be \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office after consulting with OMB and \nother Government and private experts on economic growth, and so on, and \nalso that it will relate to the priorities--Medicare, Medicaid, and \nothers. And those are very important elements. I think to the extent \nthat I have heard this discussed tonight in the Chamber of the Senate \nit has not been related the way it was just read by me.\n  And so there is a lot to talk here with respect to what we are doing \nand where we are. We need to reach an end point, not with games but \nwith honest budgets that deal with priorities that are right for this \ncountry's future. Will Rogers once told a story that I thought was \ninteresting. He talked about what his daddy said to him about how to \nsucceed in life. Will said his dad told him to buy stock and then hold \nit till it goes up and then sell it. And he says, ``If it doesn't go \nup, don't buy it.''\n\n  I thought about it. That is pretty interesting advice, right? There \nis a lot of that kind of mechanical description of dealings here in the \nCongress, the so-called guarantees. We see from the majority side \ninterests that they have, legitimate interests. I understand them with \nrespect to balancing the budget. They say to us we want a $250 billion \ntax cut.\n  Personally, I think there ought not be a tax cut until the budget is \nbalanced. I think we ought to put it aside and say, let us do the heavy \nlifting first. Let us honestly balance the budget. When we are done \nwith that, then let us turn to the Tax Code and hopefully cut taxes for \nmiddle American families. But the majority party says, no, that is a \npriority. It is a legitimate thing. I understand that that is their \npriority. They came to the negotiating table today and said, OK, we \nhave changed our position on tax cuts. We said roughly $245 billion. We \nare going to come down from that $5 billion.\n  It seems to me that is not very much movement in terms of negotiating \na compromise. The tax cut includes, some will say--and I expect \nSenators who will speak afterwards will say--a $500 cut for children, \nknowing, of course, that nearly half of the children in this country \nwill not get any benefit or full benefit of the $500 because they come \nfrom poor families and this is not refundable. So a lot of kids are \nleft out of this, of course. But there are a couple other things that \nare in there that I will not expect anybody to stand up and support \ntonight because I think they do not want people to understand what is \nsort of slipped under there just below the surface of the water that \nnobody really should see. Let me give you an example.\n  A cut in the alternative minimum tax for the largest corporations in \nthe country that will mean each of 2,000 corporations will receive a $7 \nmillion tax reduction. It seems to me when you are short of money for \nHead Start but you say ``I have money to give 2,000 corporations $7 \nmillion each in tax reductions'' is not a right priority.\n  Another little one, a tiny little issue that I bet no one knows who \nstuck in--\n\n[[Page S18726]]\nin fact, about 3 days ago, I asked if anyone in the Senate knew who \nstuck this provision in. Would they please identify themselves so we \ncould debate the wisdom of it. It is a little provision. I think it is \ncalled 956A. I am not sure I have the right number on it, but it is a \nlittle provision that makes it more attractive to close your \nmanufacturing plant in the United States and move it overseas.\n  It deals with investment in passive assets on overseas income that \nwould otherwise be repatriated to the United States. In short, it says, \nlet us make it more attractive to move American jobs overseas. And $244 \nmillion is lost by increasing the tax break to corporations who would \nmove their jobs overseas.\n  I want to know who in this Chamber thinks it is a good idea for us in \nthis bill to decide, or that we ought to encourage even more the \nmovement of American jobs overseas? Anyone? Three days have passed \nsince I asked who wrote it, and no one has been willing to claim \ncredit. It is only $244 million. That is only a quarter of a billion. \nAnd some people think that is probably not relevant. But when you come \nfrom a town of 400 people, we are talking pretty big money when you \ntalk about $244 million.\n  I would like to find out who did that, and why, and how do they stand \nup and claim that one side does not bargain in good faith, but we have \na plan that says let us help move jobs overseas, let us help move \nAmerican jobs out of America. And we are upset that the President \nvetoed that?\n  See, I mean, the Senator from Utah, who I have indicated is a \nthoughtful legislator, I think, said it right. This is not a case where \none side is all right and the other side is all wrong. I would like to \nget to the point where we could recognize there are good ideas on both \nsides of the political aisle. Let us try to collect the best of both \nrather than get the worst of each.\n  Again, I think all of these things we will debate in the coming days \nagain. But my hope is that reasonable people can decide that we ought \nnot shut down the Government tonight. Why should we make the American \npeople pay the price? And that is who will pay the price of the \nshutdown--furloughed workers will get paid though they will not work--\nthe American people will pay the price of failure here in Congress.\n  So there is no reason that there ought to be a shutdown of the \nGovernment tonight. Those who think they want to let this Government \nshut down do no service to the American people, in my judgment. And I \nwould say to the majority leader and the minority leader and everyone \ninvolved in this--and I have been one of the negotiators for 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks--we have not, frankly, negotiated very much because people did \nnot want to sit down and go through this.\n  We should. It is time, I say to all of them, it is time right now. \nStart on page one and go through it. Let us reach agreement and \ncompromise, balance the budget, do it the right way, protect the right \npriorities and solve this country's problems.\n  President Clinton has a veto, and he used it because he said some \nthings are important. We are going to stand and fight for some things. \nElderly people who live with very little income and rely on Medicare do \nnot deserve to pay more and get less health care. We want to protect \nthat program. It does not mean there cannot be some cuts. There will be \nsome cuts, but we do not believe you ought to have a quarter of a \ntrillion dollar tax cut in order to make room for the cut in Medicare \nby a quarter of a trillion dollars. That is not fair. It is not \nbalanced. And it is not the right thing to do.\n  There is a better way to do it, and I think that reasonable people \ncould sit down and in a very reasonably--I should not say very \nreasonably--in a short period of time come to a reasonable compromise \nthat protects some of these things that are important for the future of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has been extraordinarily \npatient. I apologize for the length, but I appreciate having the \nopportunity to address some of these issues on the floor of the Senate. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for his remarks. I think they very correctly \nset the tone, the tone that should have been established out here this \nevening, not the tone that we were treated to earlier in the evening.\n  These remarks are not directed at the Chair. In fact, the Chair, the \nSenator from Utah, I thought very politely and effectively made an \nanalogy to a musical, ``Annie,'' and brought the debate back to an \nexchange of respect in an attempt to point out the differences we have. \nWhat I heard earlier on the floor was just rank partisanship. It was \nvery extreme. It was very harsh. It was very personal toward the \nPresident of the United States.\n  When it comes to voting, I think people should do whatever they can \nto vote their principles, as a rule. Of course, there is such a thing \nas party loyalty, but you should vote your principles as much as \npossible. I think the thing that frustrates the American people more \nthan any issue is their belief that this institution is just loaded \nwith partisanship.\n  You know what I tell them, Mr. President? I tell them that actually \nthe U.S. Senate is not as partisan as it looks on television, that the \ninterpersonal exchanges when the TV cameras are not on are really very \ncivil, most of the time, and that they would be proud of it.\n  But I think we went over that line tonight, and it troubles me \nbecause recently on a couple of occasions I have parted company with my \nPresident and my party and voted with the majority party here. This \nweek I was the only Democrat Member of the Senate to vote against my \nPresident on the Bosnia action. I voted with mostly Republicans, \nbecause I do not think you should just use partisan consideration when \nyou are doing something as significant as sending American men and \nwomen to a very dangerous situation in Bosnia.\n  And more than that, on the issue before us tonight, the budget issue, \nI was one of only seven Democrats to say, when the Republicans proposed \nthat the budget be balanced within 7 years, I voted, yes, that sounds \nreasonable. I disagree with the way the Republicans want to do it, but \nI thought it was reasonable to continue the Government with the \nagreement that we should balance it within 7 years according to \nCongressional Budget Office numbers.\n  So I have been giving the Democrat President some heartache lately. I \nam sure I am not No. 1 on his Hit Parade, as some people say back home. \nAnd I regret it when I have to disagree with him.\n  But I am very troubled by the personal attacks I heard on the floor \ntonight toward the President. I remember when I was a young teenager, \nthe Vietnam war was on. My father and I had a strong disagreement about \nwhether the Democratic President, President Johnson, was doing the \nright thing in Vietnam, and I said some things that were intemperate \nabout the President. My dad said to me, ``Remember, at any one time you \nonly have one President.'' And I have always remembered that as a basic \nstatement about the responsibility of every American, and especially \nthe Members of this body, about the personal way in which you refer to \nthe President of the United States.\n  The comments that he cannot keep a promise, and the other references \nseem to me undignified for this great body. In fact, I find it \nparticularly odd that he would be criticized for not keeping a promise \nwhen in fact the very issues now that he is being asked to compromise \non require him to move away from positions he has taken.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said that the President promised a tax \ncut, middle-class tax cut, but he broke his promise. In fact, what the \nmajority party is asking for is not simply a middle-class tax cut, but \na tax cut that is heavily skewed toward not the middle class, but \ntoward upper income people. So, in effect, he is being criticized for \nnot keeping his promises and at the same time being told to break that \npromise and spend the money even more so on folks who make more.\n  The fact is that this President is a doer. You may not like \neverything he is trying to do; he may change his mind sometimes and try \none thing and then try another, but he is not a do nothing. He is a \ndoer. And the people in \n\n[[Page S18727]]\nmy State are pretty positive toward him because they think more than \nanything else he is trying to solve the problems of this country. So \nlet me put a word in of respect and admiration for that President who I \nhave been forced, out of principle, to disagree with in the last 2 \nweeks.\n  I do think some of the points that the Members of the other party \nmade tonight about whether we should use Office of Management and \nBudget or CBO numbers are important issues. But those can be resolved. \nI think the American people should know tonight what the real roadblock \nis here on this budget. There is a real roadblock. And if we are going \nto have a Government shutdown in less than 4 hours, there is a reason \nwhy the Government will shut down. It is the same reason why we had the \nfirst shutdown. It is the reason we are going to have this shutdown. It \nis because there is one priority of the majority party here over \neverything else, one thing that is more important to them than anything \nelse. It is what the Speaker of the other House has called the crown \njewel of the Republican contract.\n  Now, you may think, given all the rhetoric of the last few weeks, \nthat crown jewel of the Republican contract would have been balancing \nthe budget. But it is not. That is not the crown jewel of the \nRepublican contract. Guess again. You may think it was passing the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is not what has \nbeen referred to as the crown jewel of the Republican contract.\n  Maybe you would have thought it was the flag burning amendment. Given \nthe rhetoric this week on the floor of the Senate about that, you would \nhave thought that would be what had been identified as the crown jewel \nof the Republican contract. But it was not.\n  How about the line-item veto? If I had to pick something that was \nreally popular out there in the 1994 elections, and I think was, in \nfact, one of the issues that drove the Republican victory, it was the \ndesire to give the President the line-item veto.\n  That cannot be the crown jewel, and I will tell you why. Because the \nHouse passed the line-item veto in February and we passed it in March \nin the Senate and guess what, the Republican leadership of this \ninstitution has not seen fit to resolve the differences and send it \ndown to the President. They are just sitting on it. This President \ncould have that line-item veto today and be vetoing stuff that he does \nnot believe in. But that, obviously, is not the crown jewel of the \nRepublican contract.\n  The crown jewel is a tax cut. The crown jewel is a $245 billion--I \nguess it is now down to $242 billion--tax cut, 50 percent of which \nwould go to people who make over $100,000 a year. That is the most \nimportant priority. Of course, it is completely and directly \ninconsistent with the priority of trying to balance the budget, which \nmany of the Senators who spoke on the floor tonight would suggest is \nthe real issue here.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said this party, the Democratic Party, \ndoes not care about future generations. Does anyone believe that this \ntax cut is going to future generations? They talk about the $500 per \nfamily per kid tax cut. Obviously, as the Senator from North Dakota \npointed out, it does not even go to all the families.\n  This is not going into some kid's bank account. This is not going \ninto a trust fund for their education. I hope the kids back home know \nthat some people are trying to suggest that they are going to get that \n$500 and they get to spend it or their children get to spend it. It is \nnot for that. The parents can take it and spend it on important family \nneeds, but, if they want, they could go spend it at the casino. This \ndebate isn't about money going to the kids and the grandchildren. It is \nabout a tax cut. Of course, we all would like to be able to vote for a \ntax cut. Everyone would like to have a tax cut. If the money was not \nneeded here to balance the budget, it would be a great idea, but it is \nnot.\n  What it really is is an obsession. The majority party here has an \nobsession with wanting a tax cut at a time when it obviously makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  Just before Christmas, it reminds me a little bit of the way they \nused to do things in the State to the south of us in Chicago. It used \nto be tradition to hand out a turkey to everybody in the wards, to make \nsure everybody got a little something around Christmastime to remember \nwho was running the show.\n  How in the world can handing out a tax cut at this difficult time \nwhen we are talking about Medicare cuts and Medicaid cuts and student \nloan cuts and veterans cuts and agriculture cuts, how can it be a \npriority to hand out tax cuts, 50 percent of which go to people who \nmake over $100,000 a year?\n  How do we get to this point? It has taken about a year. The election \nwas held a year ago November 8. The Contract With America called for \nthis tax cut. But I believe that the top priority had to be, given the \nmood of the electorate and the rhetoric on the floor during the \nbalanced budget debate, that we have to balance the budget first before \nwe have a tax cut. But that is just the opposite of what is being \nproposed here. This tax cut would go into effect right away, right as \nthe 7-year plan would begin.\n  I have tried, I was the first Member of the entire U.S. Congress, \nalmost a year ago today, to come out and say we just cannot afford this \ntax cut. And there are many other Members on the other side of the \naisle who have told me personally they do not believe we can afford the \ntax cut. In fact, at one point, one of them was cosponsoring an \namendment with me to eliminate the tax cut. He came over to me and \nsaid, ``I'm sorry, I can't stick with you on this anymore. We need our \nparty discipline.''\n  The party discipline of the majority party here requires that this \ntax cut be delivered now, even though it flies directly in the face of \nthe presumably principal goal of both parties, which is balancing the \nbudget.\n  So, Mr. President, the fact is, we can have a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002 without a great deal of difficulty. We can have it today, Mr. \nPresident, not tomorrow, as the song from ``Annie'' suggests.\n  We can have a balanced budget by the year 2002 without going to the \nextent of a $270 billion Medicare cut.\n  We can have a balanced budget by the year 2002 without $170 billion \nin Medicaid cuts.\n  We can have a balanced budget by the year 2002 without $10 billion \ntaken out of student loans.\n  We can have a balanced budget by the year 2002 without $8 billion \ntaken out of veterans programs, including health programs.\n  Mr. President, we can have a balanced budget on or before the year \n2002 without shutting down the Government in a few hours. We can have a \nbalanced budget without this acrimony. We can have a balanced budget \nwithout this partisanship, but it requires the elimination of this \nobsession with delivering a tax cut at the same time that you are \ntrying to move right in the opposite direction and when those dollars \nare needed to balance the budget.\n  I have the good fortune of having a few more words from the song I \nquoted. The words, I am told, are:\n\n       When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely, I just \n     stick out my chin and grin and say, The Sun will come out \n     tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar.\n\n  That is the question. What will we do with our bottom dollar? Will \nthe bottom dollar be used to balance the budget, or will that same \ndollar be used to give a tax cut to upper-income people? That is the \nchoice before us, and until the people on both sides drop the tax cut, \nwe cannot use that bottom dollar to achieve what I believe is the \nshared goal here: Balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that we can also have a \nbalanced budget without such rancor and without such disrespect for the \nChief Executive of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I know we can be sitting here and listening \nand what we are going to hear, I am afraid, starting tonight, which we \nalready heard and probably will for the next couple of days, is a lot \nof excuses, excuses of why this Government is going to shut down, as I \nknow Senators before me have pointed out, at midnight tonight. Why is \nthis going to happen? \n\n[[Page S18728]]\n\n  The basic reason, and what we keep hearing is people just want to \nchange the focus, change the direction, put the blame somewhere else, \nexcuse after excuse of why we cannot reach a balanced budget.\n  The fact of the matter is, the President has not come to the table \nwith a balanced budget. And in fact, the Democratic Party has not come \nto the table with a balanced budget scored by CBO to balance in 7 \nyears.\n  The President's budgets have been on the floor of this Senate debated \ntwice--Clinton I, Clinton II. It is too bad we have to start putting \nnumbers to this. Clinton I, Clinton II have been offered on the floor. \nNot one Democrat voted for it. In fact, it was zero in favor, 99 \nagainst.\n  The budget that was delivered again today that was supposed to be the \nlatest good-faith effort by this administration, called Clinton III, is \nabout the same as what we saw in Clinton I and II, and yet I still \ncannot, for the life of me, figure out how we can have Senators stand \non the floor tonight and defend the budget that they have failed two \ntimes previously to even take a vote for.\n  Now, they talked about $245 billion in tax cuts. Somehow Americans do \nnot deserve to keep some of their own money--money that they get up \nearly in the morning to earn. If you are in my home State of Minnesota, \nyou get up when it is 21 below zero, get out in the cold car and drive \nto your job, 7 days a week, 5 days a week, 6 days a week, and you make \n$300, $400, and the Government wants more of it. And somehow, Senators \nsitting in a warm Chamber here in Washington, DC, somehow do not \nbelieve they should be able to keep it.\n  It was not very hard for these same Senators, in 1993, to vote to \nincrease your taxes by $265 billion--the largest tax increase in \nhistory. That was easy for them because they are compassionate with \nyour money--not theirs, your money, the money you get up every day and \nwork hard for and want to provide for your children, your family. But, \nsomehow, they have first dibs, first claim on the money, somehow, that \nyou are out working for. What they want to do is bring it to Washington \nso they can be compassionate and somehow give it back to you--$245 \nbillion. Then they say, well, if we do not give you this tax cut, we \ncan balance this budget in 7 years without the pain.\n  I would like to ask taxpayers to look at it in this light: If we do \nnot provide the $245 billion in tax reduction over the next 7 years, \nwhere is that money going to go? I have not heard one person on the \nfloor say that if we do not provide this tax cut, we will balance the \nbudget faster. It will still be 7 years. In that respect, what are they \nsaying? They are saying Congress can spend that $245 billion wiser than \nyou can.\n  In other words, the $12.4 trillion that Congress is going to get its \nhands on in the next 7 years is not enough. They want that other 1.5 \npercent from you. They want that other $245 billion so they can spend \nit. They do not want to save it. They want to spend it. CBO revised \ntheir numbers, updating their forecast. They say, ``We believe there \nwill be another $135 billion.'' What is the first fiscal responsibility \nthat we hear? Spend it. Spend it.\n  The last 3 years of our balanced budget plan calls for deficits \ntotaling $131 billion. If they are really serious, why don't we take \nthat whole $135 billion in new spending and put it directly against the \ndeficit? We can balance this budget in 5 years, not 7, but 5 years, if \nwe want to do that. But I have not heard anybody say that.\n  They are saying: Let us spend it. On top of the $245 billion, now the \nPresident wants to, again, and the Democratic leadership wants to, \nagain, take away from American taxpayers the $135 billion on top of \nthat and spend that as well.\n  That sends a very clear message: Tax and spend. Tax and spend. That \nhas been the Democratic philosophy for the last 40 years, which has \nequated into a $5 trillion deficit. They talk about being worried about \nchildren. We want to provide for our children. They have names and they \nhave faces. We need to provide. But how do we provide? By robbing the \npiggy banks of those same children with those names and faces, so we \ncan spend that money today on programs that we think are important?\n  If our children had the right to vote on this floor--if my four \ngrandchildren could stand on this floor and vote on something that says \nwe are going to encumber your life to the tune of $5.5 trillion, how \nmany votes do you think they would give us? None. None.\n  I am glad to hear some of the Democrats tonight say they are willing \nto share the blame for the shutdown of the Government tonight at \nmidnight. They are willing to share the blame. They better have bigger \nshoulders than that, and they better be able to point to the very \nperson that that blame should be on, and that is the President himself. \nWe hear talk about being partisan, about personal attacks against the \nPresident, and that we should have more kindness on the floor.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I am not here to be polite. I am here tonight \ntrying to fight for the taxpayers of Minnesota and this country that \nsent me here. They say, ``We want to be polite and compassionate, as we \nhave for 40 years, so let us raise taxes.'' That has always been the \neasy answer.\n  Let us just look at it. In 1950, 2 percent of your income went to the \nFederal Government for taxes. So for every $50 you made, $1 went to \nWashington. It seemed to meet the needs. We were taking care of this \ncountry. We paid the debts. In fact, we paid for World War I and World \nWar II. For Social Security, they used to take one-half of 1 percent of \nyour incomes. That is what it used to be. Today, the Federal Government \ntakes 26 percent. So, now, for every $4 you make, you send $1 to \nWashington. And Social Security has risen to over 15 percent of your \nincome--not a half percent, but 15 percent. For your children, it is \ngoing to be 20, 25, and 30 percent, if we do not stop this growth.\n  So when they are saying, ``This is not fair, these are not American \nvalues,'' I would like to know whose values they are talking about. \nThey are not talking about my values or my fairness because I am \nlooking at those names and those faces of the hard-working taxpayers of \nMinnesota, their children and their grandchildren, and I am saying I am \nnot going to spend their inheritance into the ground so people here in \nWashington can pound their chest and say: ``Well, I am compassionate, I \nhave taken care of the problem. I have taken your money. Pat me on the \nback. Let us send out some franked mail to our constituents and say, \nlook what we did for you, look at how good we are for you. By the way, \nwhen you look at your check stubs and fill out your taxes next April, \nblame it on the Republicans.\n  Well, everybody wants to focus on the tax cut--that $245 billion. Let \nus focus on the tax cut. Boy, I will tell you, if there were two lines \nback in my State and one says, ``Line up here to pay $2,000 in Federal \ntaxes, or here to pay $1,000 in Federal taxes,'' I do not think there \nis going to be a very big decision made. I do not think anybody would \nbe at the $2,000 window.\n  We all want good Government and good services, but it does not come \nat any cost. There has to be some fiscal responsibility for the dollars \nthat this Congress takes in and the dollars that this Congress spends. \nThat is where the focus should be, not on the puny, little tax cut of \n$245 billion over 7 years, when we are spending over $12.5 trillion. \nThey say that we better take that extra 1 percent because you are too \ndumb to spend it. Oh, I heard we are going to spend it at casinos if we \ngive it to the parents. There is no such thing as a savings account, \neducation, food, clothing, maybe a movie or a pizza; no, that is not in \nthe realm of a smart parent. Oh, your children are not going to get \nthat money; it is going to go to the parents and it will go to the \ncasinos. Well, that is rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric.\n  Let us focus on the spending. How are we spending these dollars? \nWhere are they going? There are two big things. Tax cuts is one thing \nthey focus on, and the other is Medicare. As the Senator from \nPennsylvania was saying, they want to pick on the most vulnerable and \nscare them and scare them. The fact of the matter is that we are very \nclose to what the President has even proposed. When you look back at \nwhat Mrs. Clinton said in testimony before one of the committees in \nCongress, she said that we should hold Medicare spending to between 6 \nand 7 percent in order to get a handle on the \n\n[[Page S18729]]\ngrowth. That does not mean we are not going to provide the services \nthat we need. It is not going to mean Grandma is going to be out of her \nwheelchair and out in the street. But she said between 6 and 7 percent. \nOur plan calls for a 7.2-percent growth--from $4,800 this year to \nnearly $7,200 in 7 years. They know it. They have been written up in \nthe newspapers for demagoging Medicare. They have no shame. They \ncontinue to come and talk about it. Then they say we have to be polite \nand we cannot be partisan.\n\n  Personal attacks. I am not attacking individuals, I am attacking \npolicy. This is not the right policy. Fairness, American values. How do \nyou take more from our hard-working people and say you have to send \nmore to Washington because we need this, we have to have more money \nhere?\n  The fact again is that the President does not have a plan. The \nDemocrats do not have a plan. We have had a balanced budget on the \ntable for months. The President signed a pledge that said before the \nend of this year he would put a balanced budget on the table for 7 \nyears scored by CBO numbers. We hate to get into calling people liars, \nbut when we do not see the information here, I will let people draw \ntheir own conclusions of whether that pledge has been lived up to.\n  The Republican budget proposal that was put on the table today was \ndifferent. It was a movement in the other direction. It was trying to \nfind some common ground here. How do you find common ground when you \nare shadow boxing, when somebody will not come to the table and \nhonestly put on a budget?\n  Then they talk about no personal attacks. I do not know if people in \nthe gallery or people at home had a chance to watch the news tonight, \nbut the President did not take off his gloves when he came after the \nRepublicans and spewed more of this rhetoric. I cannot understand for \nthe life of me how people can stand on the floor here and defend this \ntype of action.\n  Talk about defense--defense is declining in actual dollars 20 percent \nover the next 7 years. It is not going up. Medicare is going up 53 \npercent; defense is going down 20 percent. Yet, they hang on to this as \nusing this as some kind of example.\n  Then we have some Senator saying 80 percent of the tax cuts are going \nto the wealthiest in the country. Then they have others that say 50 \npercent is going to the wealthiest. When you pull numbers out of the \nair and make up stories--maybe they should go back and get the stories \nstraight. The fact is, 80 percent of the tax reduction in this package \ngoes to families that make less than $100,000--not $100,000 tax credit \nfor someone making $350,000. It sounds good. It is rhetoric. It might \nget headlines, but it is not fact. Rhetoric, half-truths, distortions.\n  I have been the author of the $500-per-child tax credit and I have \nworked for it for 3 years because I thought it was important that \nfamilies were able to keep more of the money they made. Families out \nthere expect this. Republicans better remember it and the Democrats \nshould remember it because I think this is going to be one of the \ntelling tales in the election of 1996.\n  I will wrap up quickly. I see the leader on the floor. Americans know \nwhy they voted for Republicans in 1994. Why are there 11 freshman \nRepublicans in the Senate and not 1 Democrat? I think it is pretty \nclear. There was a clear message. Not one Republican freshman lost his \nseat in the House. It was pretty clear what Americans wanted. If they \nlistened to the Republican plan, the Contract With America--you might \nnot agree with everything in the contract--I think the majority of \npeople in this country agree with the majority of the contract, and at \nleast it is moving this country away from a bigger, faster growing, \nbloated, inefficient, money-wasting Government, to try to streamline it \nto make it more effective, more cost friendly for taxpayers, and to \nprovide the better services, to provide the Medicare, to provide the \nwelfare, to provide Medicaid, Head Start, and other programs to the \nkids that need it, but to also ensure that those programs are going to \nbe here tomorrow and the next day, and the next year and the next year.\n  If we are going to spend their money today, if you think we are \nfacing tough budget battles today, if we do not face this problem \ntoday, by the year 2000 this is going to be an animal that we will not \nwant to grab the tail of because it is getting away from us now and we \ndo not have much time to get it fixed. If we spend more money and \nincrease the size of this Government, it will make that problem harder \nand harder to control. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18713-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I do not believe there will be any votes tomorrow, but I am \nnot certain. I cannot promise anyone. We will have meetings tomorrow \nmorning on welfare reform on the conference report. There will be a \nmeeting tomorrow morning on the D.C. appropriations bill. There will be \ndebate tomorrow on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and we will again \nhopefully maybe get consent tomorrow to move to take that bill up. If \nthat is the case, we could be considering amendments that might bring \nabout some votes.\n  We will probably have to be in session late Sunday afternoon in the \nevent there should be a CR come over from the House. That may or may \nnot happen. It depends on whether we get back into serious discussions \non the balanced budget. If that happens, I assume the House would send \nus a 1- or 2-day continuing resolution. That would take us through \nMonday or Tuesday.\n  I just say to my colleagues, I do not anticipate votes, but if votes \nshould occur we will try to work out a way to give ample notice. It is \npretty hard if you are on the west coast or somewhere in the western \npart of the United States to get back very quickly. We will try to \nfigure out some way not to disadvantage anyone.\n  Let me say before I conclude, I will ask Senator Boxer have whatever \ntime she may need when I finish.\n  Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week, a new study was \nreleased which highlights the many benefits that immigrants bring to \nthe United States, It is vitally important that we be aware of the \ncontributions of immigrants to the American economy, to American \nfamilies, and to American communities as we debate the very difficult \nissue of immigration reform.\n  The study was published by the National Immigration Forum and the \nCato Institute with support from a wide array of business, civil \nrights, Hispanic, and religious organizations. It was conducted by \nProf. Julian Simon of the University of Maryland, who has published a \nnumber of works or immigration over the years.\n  This study joins the impressive group of other important studies \nwhich demonstrate that legal immigration is not a source of major \nproblems for our country. In fact, it brings significant benefits to \nthe Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the study and \nits opening chapter be printed in the Record, along with an article \nabout the study which appeared in the Los Angeles Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Immigration: the Demographic and Economic Facts\n\n                          (By Julian L. Simon)\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The following facts emerge from the data and material \n     examined in this volume:\n       The rate of U.S. immigration in the 1990s is about one-\n     third the rate of immigration at the beginning of the \n     century. The total number of immigrants--including illegals--\n     is about the same as or less than the number then, though the \n     country's population has more than doubled.\n       The foreign-born population of the United States is 8.5 \n     percent of the total population, which is significantly lower \n     than the proportion--13 percent of higher--during the period \n     from 1860 to 1930.\n       Immigrants do not increase the rate of unemployment among \n     native Americans, even among minority, female, and low-skill \n     workers. The effect of immigration on wages is negative for \n     some of these special groups and positive for others, but the \n     overall effects are small.\n       Total per capita government expenditures on immigrants are \n     much lower than those for natives, no matter how immigrants \n     are classified. Narrowly defined welfare expenditures for \n     immigrants are slightly more than for natives, but this has \n     been true in the past, too. These welfare expenditures are \n     only small fractions of total government expenditures on \n     immigrants and natives. Schooling costs and payments to the \n     elderly are the bulk of government expenditures; natives use \n     more of these programs, especially Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       The educational levels of immigrants have been increasing \n     from decade to decade. No major shifts in educational levels \n     of immigrants relative to natives are apparent.\n       Natural resources and the environment are not at risk from \n     immigration. As population size and average income have \n     increased in the United States, the supplies of natural \n     resources and the cleanliness of the environment have \n     improved rather that deteriorated. Immigration increases the \n     base of technical knowledge. That speeds the current positive \n     trends in both greater availability of natural resources and \n     cleaner air and water.\n\n\n            1. summary of important facts about immigration\n\n       These are the most important demographic and economic facts \n     pertaining to policy decisions about the numbers of \n     immigrants that will be admitted by law into the United \n     States:\n     The Quantities of Immigration\n       The total number of immigrants per year (including illegal \n     immigrants and refugees) now adays is somewhat less than it \n     was in the peak years at the beginning of the 20th century \n     when U.S. population was less than half as large as it now \n     is.\n       The rate of immigration relative to population size now is \n     low rather than high. Immigration as a proportion of \n     population is about a third of what it was in the peak years.\n       The foreign-born population of the United States is 8.5 \n     percent of the total population (as of 1990). The proportions \n     in the United States during the period from before 1850 to \n     1940 were higher--always above 13 percent during the entire \n     period from 1860 to 1930--and the proportions since the 1940s \n     were lower. The present proportion--8.5 percent--also may be \n     compared to the 1990s' proportions of 22.7 percent in \n     Australia; 16 percent in Canada; 6.3 percent in France; 7.3 \n     percent in Germany; 3.9 percent in Great Britain; and 5.7 \n     percent in Sweden.\n       Though the volume of illegal immigration is inherently \n     difficult to estimate, a solid body of research, using a \n     variety of ingenious methods, has now arrived at a consensus: \n     the number of illegals in the United States is perhaps 3.2 \n     million, pushed downward by the amnesty of 1987-1988, not \n     very different from a decade before. Many of these persons \n     are transitory. The million-plus persons who registered for \n     the amnesty verify that the total was and is nowhere near the \n     estimates that often have been given in public discussion.\n       The rate of illegal immigration is agreed by all experts to \n     be about 250,000 to 300,000 per year.\n       More than half of illegal aliens enter legally and overstay \n     their visas and permits. ``Less than half of illegal \n     immigrants cross the nation's borders clandestinely. The \n     majority enter legally and overstay their visas'' (Fix and \n     Passel 1994, 4).\n     The Economic Characteristics of Immigrants\n       New immigrants are more concentrated than are natives in \n     the youthful labor-force ages when people contribute more to \n     the public coffer than they draw from it; natives are more \n     concentrated in the childhood and elderly periods of economic \n     dependence when the net flows are from the public to the \n     individual. Of all the facts about immigration relevant to \n     its economic effects, this is the most important, and the one \n     which is most consistent in all countries, in all decades and \n     centuries.\n       Taken altogether, immigrants on average have perhaps a year \n     less education than natives--much the same relationship as \n     has been observed back to the 19th century.\n       The average education of new immigrants has been increasing \n     with each successive cohort. The proportion of adult \n     immigrants with 8 or fewer years of education has been \n     trending downward, and the proportion of adult immigrants \n     with 16 or more years of education has been trending upward.\n       The proportion of adult new immigrants with eight or fewer \n     years of education is much higher than the proportion of \n     adult natives.\n       The proportion of immigrants with bachelor's or \n     postgraduate degrees is higher than the proportion of the \n     native labor force.\n       Immigrants have increased markedly as a proportion of \n     members of the scientific and engineering labor force \n     (especially at the highest level of education). Immigrants \n     also have increased rapidly as proportions of the pools of \n     U.S. scientists and engineers. Scientific professionals are \n     especially valuable for promoting the increased productivity \n     and growth of the economy.\n       Immigrants, even those from countries that are much poorer \n     and have lower average life expectancies than the United \n     States, are healthier than U.S. natives of the same age and \n     sex. New immigrants have better records with respect to \n     infant mortality and health than do U.S. natives and \n     immigrants who have been in the United States longer.\n       New immigrants are unusually mobile geographically and \n     occupationally, in large part because of their youth. Such \n     mobility increases the flexibility of the economy and \n     mitigates tight labor markets.\n       First-and second-generation immigrant children do unusually \n     well in school. They win an astonishingly high proportion of \n     scholastic prizes.\n     The Effects of Immigrants in the Labor Market\n       Immigrants do not cause native unemployment, even among \n     low-paid or minority groups. A spate of respected recent \n     studies, using a variety of methods, agrees that ``there is \n     no empirical evidence documenting that the displacement \n     effect [of natives from jobs] is numerically important'' \n     (Borjas 1990, 92). The explanation is that new entrants not \n     only take jobs, they make jobs. The jobs they create with \n     their purchasing power, and with the new businesses which \n     they start, are at least as numerous as the jobs which \n     immigrants fill.\n       Re wage effects, one recent summary concludes, \n     ``Immigration has no discernible effect on wages overall. . . \n     . Wage growth and decline appear to be unrelated to \n     immigration--a finding that holds for both unskilled and \n     skilled workers'' (Fix and Passel 1994, 48). My \n     interpretation of the literature is slightly different: a \n     minor negative effect.\n     Welfare Use and Taxes Paid\n       Immigrants who enter legally through regular quotas are not \n     permitted to receive public assistance for three years, and \n     they may be deported if they obtain such assistance \n     (though few are). Refugees, however, are entitled to such \n     assistance immediately upon entry, which (together with \n     their needy circumstances) accounts for their high rate of \n     welfare use soon after arrival.\n       Re the use by immigrants of welfare services including food \n     stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), \n     Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Medicaid: these \n     expenditures are the tail that wags the dog in policy \n     discussions. Expenditures called ``welfare'' now comprise \n     about $404 per person annually for immigrants and about $260 \n     for natives. Total government social outlays are roughly \n     $3,800 for natives.\n     \n[[Page S18731]]\n\n       Because of the public interest in the set of welfare \n     services that includes food stamps, AFDC, SSI, and Medicaid, \n     the data on this cluster of welfare programs are presented \n     here, but only for completeness. By themselves they do not \n     provide the basis for any conclusions about overall transfer-\n     payment receipt by various cohorts of immigrants and natives, \n     because these calculations do not include most payments to \n     the native elderly.\n       Foreign-born persons taken altogether have perhaps a 10 to \n     20 percent higher probability of obtaining these welfare \n     services than do natives. They average perhaps 30 percent \n     higher average receipts per capita than do natives.\n       There may have been a small increase in the use of these \n     programs from pre-1970 to post 1970 entrants and from \n     immigrants arriving between 1970 and 1986 to those entering \n     between 1987 and 1990, but the evidence is mixed.\n       If refugees are excluded from the assessment, and only \n     nonrefugees are considered, the rate of welfare use for new \n     immigrants who entered between 1980 and 1990 is considerably \n     below the rate for natives ages 15 and above.\n       Among foreign-born persons 65 years of age or more, a \n     greater (and growing) proportion receive welfare (mainly SSI) \n     than among natives. This is due to the arrival of many \n     immigrants too late to accumulate enough work time to earn \n     Social Security benefits; the welfare is a substitute for \n     Social Security.\n       Social Security and Medicare are by far the most expensive \n     transfer payments made by the government. These payments go \n     almost completely to natives. This is because immigrants \n     typically arrive when they are young and healthy, and also \n     because older recent immigrants do not qualify for Social \n     Security for many years after their arrival.\n       Social Security and Medicare are by far the most expensive \n     transfer payments by the government. The cost of supporting \n     elderly natives is vastly greater than for immigrants. This \n     is because immigrants typically arrive when they are young \n     and healthy, and the appropriate life-time analysis shows \n     that this provides a large windfall to the national treasury. \n     (Current data alone also show a similar effect because of the \n     contemporary age distribution of the immigrant population). \n     Also, older recent immigrants do not qualify for Social \n     Security for many years after arrival.\n       As of the 1970s, immigrant families in all cohorts within \n     several decades clearly paid more taxes on average than \n     native families. However, the mean earnings of all new \n     immigrant men were smaller relative to adult natives 25 to 64 \n     in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The mean earnings \n     of immigrant men who entered in the 1970s were smaller \n     relative to adult natives 25 to 64 in the 1980s than the \n     similar comparison for the previous decade. This continues a \n     trend from men who entered in the 1960s. This implies that \n     the size of tax contributions by recent cohorts of immigrants \n     relative to those of natives has diminished in recent \n     decades.\n       When immigrants are subclassified by legal category of \n     entrance, the picture is quite different from that for \n     immigrants taken altogether. In an analysis of the 1990 \n     census, where the average household income (different from \n     the earnings concept referred to in the paragraph above) for \n     natives was $37,300, 1980-1990 immigrants from countries from \n     which most of the immigration is legal received $34,800 (that \n     is, 91 percent of natives' household income), the average for \n     those from countries sending mostly refugees to the United \n     States was $27,700, and for those from countries sending \n     illegals $23,900. (No information is now available on whether \n     the picture was the same or different in earlier decades.) \n     These data on recent legal immigrants are the relevant data \n     for policymaking in legal immigration.\n       As of the 1970s, immigrants contributed more to the public \n     coffers in taxes than they drew out in welfare services. The \n     most recent available data (for 1975) show that each year, an \n     average immigrant family put about $2,500 (1995 dollars) into \n     the pockets of natives from this excess of taxes over public \n     costs.\n       The possible changes over time in earnings in the various \n     immigrant cohorts cast some doubt on the present-value \n     calculation for earlier years concluding that immigrants make \n     net contributions to the public coffers; a different sort of \n     calculation may be needed for which data are not available.\n       Illegal aliens contribute about as much to the public \n     coffers in taxes as they receive in benefits. New data \n     suggest that the undocumented pay about 46 percent as much in \n     taxes as do natives, but use about 45 percent as much in \n     services.\n     Immigrants, the Environment, and Natural Resources\n       Natural resources and the environment are not at risk from \n     immigration; rather, in the long run, resources increase and \n     the environment improves due to immigration. The long-term \n     trends show that U.S. air and water are getting cleaner \n     rather than dirtier, and world supplies of natural resources \n     are becoming more available rather than exhausted. \n     Immigration increases the technical knowledge that speeds \n     these benign trends.\n     Public Opinion about Immigrants and Immigration\n       The most recent polls of U.S. residents' opinions show that \n     most persons want less immigration. This is consistent with \n     the consensus of all polls since the first such surveys in \n     the 1940s. There does not seem to be a long-run trend in \n     public opinion opposing immigration.\n       A poll of the most respected economists found a consensus \n     that both legal and illegal immigrants are beneficial \n     economically.\n       No data are presented in this pamphlet concerning racial or \n     ethnic composition or the country of origin of immigrants \n     because these characteristics are not relevant for any policy \n     decisions that are related to the economic consequences of \n     immigration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n             Study Paints a Positive Picture of Immigration\n\n\ncosts: both legal and illegal immigrants use fewer government resources \n                than native-born citizens, report says.\n\n                         (By James Bornemeier)\n\n       Washington.--A new study on the effects of immigration \n     finds that total per capita government expenditures are much \n     lower for immigrants--legal and illegal--than for native-born \n     citizens.\n       The report also paints an upbeat picture of immigrants' \n     educational achievements and asserts that the nation's \n     natural resources and environment are unaffected by the \n     influx of immigrants.\n       ``As of the 1970s, immigrants contributed more to the \n     public coffers in taxes than they drew out in welfare \n     services,'' the report says. ``The most recent data * * * \n     show that each year an average immigrant family puts about \n     $2,500 into the pockets of natives from this excess of taxes \n     over public costs.''\n       The study, to be issued this morning in Washington by the \n     National Immigration Forum, an immigration-advocacy group, \n     and the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, comes at a \n     time when Congress is wrestling with major immigration bills \n     and public opinion is increasingly negative on immigration \n     issues.\n       Legislation is progressing in both houses of Congress to \n     clamp down on illegal immigration and--to the dismay of many \n     immigration advocates--restrict entry of legal immigrants as \n     well.\n       The issue has split Republicans, some of whom see the free \n     flow of legal immigrants as an economic boon to the country. \n     Immigrant-rights groups say the political activism to stem \n     illegal immigration has unfairly led to the limitations on \n     legal immigrants.\n       But groups pushing for stronger restrictions on immigration \n     branded the report, authored by University of Maryland \n     professor Julian L. Simon, as biased.\n       ``Julian Simon is not a liar,'' said Dan Stein, executive \n     director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, \n     ``but he gets as close as anyone can be to one. He is \n     intentionally deceptive, manipulative and grossly in error.'' \n     Signifying the sensitivity of the issue, more than 20 \n     interest groups and think thanks have signed on to the \n     report, and they span the political spectrum--from the \n     immigrant-rights group, the National Council of La Raza, to \n     the Progress and Freedom Foundation, an organization closely \n     associated with House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n       House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a strong supporter of \n     legal immigration, is scheduled to address the Capitol press \n     conference where the report is to be released today.\n       Among the report's most controversial findings is Simon's \n     conclusion that government expenditures are lower for \n     immigrants than for native-born Americans.\n       According to the report, the average immigrant family \n     receive $1,404 in welfare services in its first five years in \n     the country. Nativeborn families averaged $2,279, Simon \n     writes. The report makes these other points:\n        The number of illegal immigrants in the United \n     States--estimated at 3.2 million--is not very different from \n     a decade before.\n        More than half of illegal immigrants enter legally \n     and overstay their visas; less than half enter clandestinely.\n        New immigrants are more concentrated than native-\n     born citizens in the youthful labor force ages when people \n     contribute more to the public coffers than they draw out.\n        Immigrants on average have a year less education \n     than natives--about the same relationship as has been \n     observed back to the 19th century.\n       Such optimistic findings collide with the views of other \n     researchers.\n       ``His numbers are conventional and unremarkable,'' said \n     Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies in \n     Washington. ``The question is what sort of spin Julian puts \n     on them. He has his bias, and the bias has a very significant \n     influence on the interpretation he has put on the facts.''\n       As an example, Simon says the number of immigrant high \n     school dropouts has been declining. For example, Krikorian \n     said, Simon reports that the number of immigrant high school \n     dropouts has been declining.\n       ``But what he doesn't mention,'' said Krikorian, ``is the \n     gap between the percentage of American high school dropouts \n     and the percentage of immigrant high school dropouts is \n     widening. It's pretty obvious that the education gap in \n     increasing. By not addressing [that] he makes his document an \n     advocacy document.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18730-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18731-S18732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the remarks I made \non \n\n[[Page S18732]]\nthe floor earlier today with respect to the size of the direct loan \nprogram. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program was originally \nauthorized to administer 5 percent of total loan volume as a \ndemonstration program. In 1993-94, the first year of the Direct Lending \nProgram, the Department of Education was authorized to administer 5 \npercent of total loan volume. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 imposes a \n10-percent cap on direct loans, and ensures that all schools who \nparticipated in the first year of the program will continue to serve as \nthe demonstration group, thereby allowing a proper test to take place.\n  I would also like to be very clear about the impact of the proposed \n10-percent cap: a 10-percent cap on direct loans will in no way affect \nany student's ability to receive a student loan. The law requires that \nthe eligibility requirements for both loan programs be identical, and \ntherefore a 10-percent cap on direct loans will not limit any student's \nability to receive the loans they need to attend college. The \nadministration continues to try to frighten students and their families \nby implying that a cap on direct lending will limit student loans, but \nthis is simply not the case: a cap on direct lending only affects how \nthe loans are delivered--it does not affect loan access or \navailability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18731-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18732-S18734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SENIOR CITIZENS' FREEDOM TO WORK ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday the Finance Committee reported out \nS. 1470 with technical changes. The committee will not file a written \nreport. For the benefit of my colleagues, the following is a synopsis \nof the bill's provisions.\n  The Social Security retirement earnings limit for senior citizens age \n65 to 69 is gradually increased from the 1995 level of $11,280 to \n$30,000 by the year 2002. The cost of the retirement earnings limit \nproposal is offset by the following reforms: Drug addicts and \nalcoholics will no longer qualify for SSI and SSDI disability benefits \nsolely by reason of their addiction; and stepchildren will no longer \nqualify for Social Security dependents' benefits unless their \nstepparent provides at least 50 percent of the stepchild's support; \nsuch benefits will terminate the month following the divorce.\n  A new revolving fund is created within the SSDI Trust Fund to provide \na stable source of funds for the Social Security Administration to \nconduct continuing disability reviews of SSDI recipients.\n  The legislation clarifies that the Secretary of the Treasury and \nother Federal officials are not authorized to underinvest and/or \ndisinvest Social Security and Medicare funds in Federal securities or \nobligations in order to avoid the limitations on the public debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the synopsis of S. 1470 \nbe printed in the Record, together with a letter from John D. Hawke, \nUnder Secretary of the Treasury.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Description of Proposals\n\n     1. Increase to Social Security retirement earnings limitation\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Senior citizens age 70 and older receive full Social \n     Security benefits regardless of the amount of earnings they \n     have from wages or self employment.\n       Senior citizens age 65 to 69 receive full Social Security \n     benefits only if their wages or self-employment income are \n     lower than a retirement earnings limit. The earnings limit is \n     increased annually based on the rate of average wage growth. \n     The estimated limitation amounts under present law for 1995 \n     and the following seven years are:\n\n        Year                                                Present Law\n1995............................................................$11,280\n1996.............................................................11,520\n1997.............................................................11,880\n1998.............................................................12,240\n1999.............................................................12,270\n2000.............................................................13,200\n2001.............................................................13,800\n2002.............................................................24,400\n\n       Senior citizens age 65 to 69 who earn more than the limit \n     for a year lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 \n     in wages or self-employment income they earn over the \n     limitation amount.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       According to the Social Security Administration, 925,000 \n     beneficiaries between age 65 and 69 lose some or all of their \n     benefits as a result of the earnings limit. Given the \n     combined effects of Federal, State and local income taxes, \n     Social Security payroll taxes, income taxes on benefits, and \n     the earnings limit, senior citizens who earn even moderate \n     amounts over the limit may realize very little financial gain \n     from their labor. These rates are a disincentive to work and \n     penalize retirees who often need to work out of economic \n     need.\n\n                            Proposed Change\n\n       The retirement earnings limit for workers age 65 to 69 is \n     gradually raised to $30,000 by the year 2002 as follows;\n\n        Year                                                   Proposed\n1996............................................................$14,000\n1997.............................................................15,000\n1998.............................................................16,000\n1999.............................................................17,000\n2000.............................................................18,000\n2001.............................................................25,000\n2002.............................................................30,000\n\n       After 2002, the limitation amount will increase annually \n     based on the rate of average wage growth.\n       Senior citizens age 65 to 69 who have wages or self-\n     employment income in excess of the earnings limit continue to \n     lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 earned over \n     the limit.\n       The substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount used in \n     determining whether an individual under age 65 is eligible \n     for disability benefits on the basis of blindness is not \n     changed. Therefore, it will no longer equal the Social \n     Security retirement earnings limit for senior citizens age 65 \n     to 69. The SGA amount for blind individuals under age 65 will \n     continue at the present law amount ($11,280 for 1995-- and \n     will continue to be wage-indexed in future years.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal, phased in gradually over 7 years, would be \n     effective beginning in 1996.\n     2. Denial of disability benefits to drug addicts and \n         alcoholics\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Individuals whose drug addition or alcoholism is a \n     contributing factor material to their disability may receive \n     cash disability benefits under the Social Security Disability \n     Insurance (SSDI) program or the Supplemental Security Income \n     (SSI) program through a representative payee for up to three \n     years. These recipients must participate in an approved \n     treatment program when available, and must allow their \n     participation in a treatment program to be monitored. Cash \n     benefits (SSDI or SSI)) end after 36 months, although medical \n     benefits (Medicare or Medicaid) continue if an individual \n     remains disabled by drug addiction or alcoholism.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       The Committee is concerned that the current policy of \n     paying cash Social Security and SSI disability benefits to \n     individuals whose sole severe disabling condition is drug \n     addiction or alcoholism is false compassion and only helps \n     those individuals sustain his/her addiction. Treatment is \n     needed instead. The legislation diverts part of the savings \n     to additional Federal funding to States for drug and alcohol \n     treatment, providing an incentive for States to provide \n     treatment to former recipients.\n\n                            Proposed Change\n\n       The proposal would end entitlement to SSDI and SSI \n     disability benefits if drug addiction or alcoholism is the \n     contributing factor material to the individual's disability. \n     Individuals with drug addiction and/or alcoholism who have \n     another severe disabling condition can qualify for benefits \n     based on that disabling condition.\n       If a person qualifying for disability benefits based on \n     another disability is also determined to be an alcoholic or \n     drug addict and unable to manage their benefits, a \n     representative payee would be appointed to receive and handle \n     the individual's checks. In the case of any individual whose \n     benefits are paid through a representative payee, the \n     Commissioner of Social Security shall refer that individual \n     to the appropriate State agency for substance abuse treatment \n     services approved under the Public Health Service Act \n     Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant.\n       For each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998, $50 million will be \n     available to fund additional treatment programs and services \n     through Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       Generally, changes apply to benefits for months beginning \n     on or after the date of enactment. However, an individual \n     entitled to benefits before the month of enactment would \n     continue to be eligible for benefits until January 1, 1997. \n     The Commissioner of Social Security must notify such \n     individuals within three months of the date of enactment. The \n     Committee's intent in providing this partial grandfather is \n     to allow current beneficiaries to complete treatment and to \n     allow the Social Security Administration to determine in an \n     orderly fashion if such individuals are disabled by another \n     condition.\n       Those who wish to reapply for benefits must do so within \n     four months after the date of enactment in order to qualify \n     for priority redetermination of eligibility. The Commissioner \n     must make these determinations within one year after the date \n     of enactment for individuals who reapply.\n       In addition, in the case of an individual with an \n     alcoholism or drug addiction condition who is entitled to \n     Social Security or SSI disability benefits on the date of \n     enactment, the representative payee and referral \n\n[[Page S18733]]\n     to treatment requirement will apply on or after the first continuing \n     disability review occurring after enactment.\n     3. Entitlement of stepchildren to Social Security dependent \n         benefits\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Generally a child, including a stepchild, under age 18 (or \n     under age 19 in the case of an individual attending \n     elementary or secondary school full-time) may be entitled to \n     receive Social Security benefits as the dependent child of a \n     worker when the worker retires, becomes disabled, or dies.\n       A stepchild is deemed dependent on a stepparent if he/she \n     lives with the stepparent or receives one-half of his/her \n     support from the stepparent. Social Security dependent \n     benefits continue to be paid to a stepchild after the child's \n     natural parent and the stepparent divorce. Continuation of \n     those benefits after divorce may reduce the amount available \n     for payment to other children entitled to receive Social \n     Security Dependent benefits based on the worker's record.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Under current law children who are entitled on a worker's \n     record may be unnecessarily penalized by the entitlement of a \n     stepchild who has other means of support. This change would \n     result in the payment of benefits only to stepchildren who \n     are truly dependent on the stepparent for their support, and \n     only as long as the natural parent and stepparent are \n     married.\n\n                            Proposed Change\n\n       Social Security dependents' benefits are payable to a \n     stepchild only when the stepparent provides at least 50 \n     percent of the stepchild's support upon application for \n     benefits. A stepchild is eligible for survivors' benefits \n     upon the death of a stepparent if the stepparent provided at \n     least 50 percent of the stepchild's support immediately \n     preceding death.\n       In addition, a stepchild's Social Security benefits based \n     on the work record of his/her stepparent are terminated the \n     month following the divorce of the child's natural parent and \n     stepparent. The stepparent must also notify the Social \n     Security Administration of the divorce and the Social \n     Security Administration is required to notify annually those \n     potentially affected by this provision.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is generally effective three months after date \n     of enactment for new entitlement of stepchildren to benefits \n     and for divorces finalized after that period.\n     4. SSDI revolving fund for continuing disability reviews\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The administrative costs of conducting continuing \n     disability reviews (CDRs) of individuals receiving Social \n     Security disability benefits are provided through an \n     appropriation of trust fund monies, and are considered \n     discretionary spending subject to the domestic discretionary \n     spending cap of the Budget Enforcement Act.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Limited administrative resources have prevented the Social \n     Security Administration from keeping up with CDRs, which \n     estimates that for every $1 spent conducting CDRs, $6 are \n     saved in benefits that would otherwise be paid to individuals \n     who are no longer disabled. The Social Security \n     Administration estimates that the failure to perform timely \n     CDRs between 1990 and 1995 will cost the SSDI Trust Fund $2.3 \n     billion by 1999. The proposed revolving fund would be a \n     source of non-appropriated administrative resources to \n     finance CDRs, enabling SSA to perform this essential program-\n     integrity work.\n\n                            Proposed Change\n\n       A revolving fund is established in the Social Security \n     Disability Insurance (SSDI) Trust Fund as a source of non-\n     appropriated administrative funds to finance Social Security \n     CDRs. At the start of each fiscal year, the revolving fund \n     will be credited with an amount equal to the estimated \n     present value of savings to the SSDI and Medicare trust funds \n     achieved as a result of CDRs of beneficiaries conducted in \n     the prior fiscal year--except for the first year, during \n     which $300 million will be credited. These amounts will be \n     calculated by the Social Security Administration's Chief \n     Actuary, with appropriate adjustments made annually in \n     subsequent years. Amounts credited to the revolving fund are \n     available for all expenditures related to conducting CDRs by \n     the Social Security Administration and appropriate State \n     agencies.\n       In addition, the position of Chief Actuary in the Social \n     Security Administration is established in law.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The revolving fund is effective for fiscal years beginning \n     after September 30, 1995, and sunsets September 30, 2005.\n     5. Protection of Social Security and Medicare trust funds\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The various authorizing statutes of the major Federal trust \n     funds require that any program income not needed to meet \n     current expenditures be invested in interest-bearing \n     obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed \n     as to both principal and interest by the United States. The \n     vast majority of these securities are ``special issue'' non-\n     marketable obligations of the United States. Virtually the \n     entire amount of securities held by the Federal trust funds \n     is considered Federal debt subject to the statutory debt \n     limit.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Since late October, the total amount of the public debt \n     obligations has been very close to the public debt limit. \n     This has given rise to concerns that the Social Security and \n     Medicare Trust Funds might be under invested or disinvested \n     for debt management purposes. While the Administration has \n     stated that it would not take such action, the Committee \n     concluded that it was desirable to make clear in law that \n     these funds could not be used for debt management purposes. \n     In clarifying this, the Committee does not intend that the \n     legislation authorize conduct in contravention of any other \n     applicable provision of law, such as the public debt limit.\n       The Committee seeks to assure that, to the maximum extent \n     possible under the statutory debt limit, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and other Federal officials shall invest and \n     disinvest Social Security and Medicare trust funds solely for \n     the purposes of accounting for the income and disbursements \n     of these programs. The Committee further intends that the \n     investments of the trust funds are made timely, in accordance \n     with the normal investment practices of the Treasury, and are \n     not drawn down prematurely for the purposes of avoiding \n     limitations on the public debt or to make room under the \n     statutory debt limit for the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     issue new debt obligations in order to cover other \n     expenditures of the Government.\n\n                            Proposed Change\n\n       The legislation codifies Congress' understanding of present \n     law that the Secretary of the Treasury and other Federal \n     officials are not authorized to use Social Security and \n     Medicare funds for debt management purposes. Specifically, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury and other Federal officials are \n     required not to delay or otherwise underinvest incoming \n     receipts to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \n     They are also required not to sell, redeem or otherwise \n     disinvest securities, obligations or other assets of these \n     trust funds except when necessary to provide for the payment \n     of benefits and administrative expenses of the cash benefit \n     programs. The Committee intends that these requirements be \n     carried out to the maximum extent possible under the \n     statutory debt limit. The legislation applies to the \n     following trust funds:\n       1. Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust \n     Fund;\n       2. Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund;\n       3. Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund; and\n       4. Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust \n     Fund.\n     Effective Date\n       The proposal is effective upon date of enactment.\n\n\n                       budget effects of the bill\n\n       According to preliminary estimates of the Congressional \n     Budget office, the legislation will reduce mandatory spending \n     by $200 million over seven years (FY 1996-2002) and by $2.7 \n     billion over ten years (FY 1996-2005).\n\n\n                             miscellaneous\n\n       Attached is a letter from John D. Hawke, Jr., Under \n     Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, providing \n     comments on the proposal to protect the Social Security and \n     Medicare trust funds as originally introduced. The \n     legislation reported by the Committee includes a modification \n     of this proposal to address these concerns.\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Our comments have been requested with \n     respect to the provisions of Section 6 of S. 1470, the \n     ``Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 1995.'' This \n     section of the bill is intended to provide protections to the \n     Social Security and Medicare trust funds at times when the \n     public debt limit might otherwise cause certain adverse \n     consequences with respect to those funds.\n       The Administration shares the objective of protecting the \n     beneficiaries of these funds. As you know, both the President \n     and the Secretary of the Treasury have stated that the \n     Secretary has no authority to redeem securities from the \n     Social Security fund for any purpose other than to assure the \n     payment of benefits. The same principle would apply as well \n     to the other 178 trust funds that are not subject to the \n     Secretary's express debt management powers.\n       Section 6 would do the following:\n       It would require that all revenues received or held by \n     these funds be invested in public debt obligations, \n     ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' Thus, it \n     would effectively create an exception to the debt limit to \n     permit the investment of incoming receipts of these funds.\n       It would forbid the ``disinvestment''--that is, the \n     redemption prior to maturity--of securities held by the funds \n     if a purpose thereof were ``to reduce the amount of \n     outstanding public debt obligations.''\n       It would allow Treasury to disinvest the funds and to issue \n     corresponding new public debt, ``notwithstanding the public \n     debt limit,'' to the extent necessary to raise cash to pay \n     benefits to fund beneficiaries.\n       The provision of Section 6 would, however, have serious \n     adverse consequences, and would present certain practical \n     problems \n\n[[Page S18734]]\n     that could frustrate or impede the realization of its objectives:\n       First, the continued investment of new fund receipts, \n     notwithstanding the debt limit, would cause outstanding \n     Treasury debt to exceed the debt limit in an ever increasing \n     amount. This would prohibit Treasury from issuing any other \n     new Treasury debt. Even the rollover of maturing debt would \n     be precluded so long as outstanding debt remained over the \n     debt limit. As a consequence we would face imminent default \n     on all other outstanding obligations.\n       Because no other new debt could be issued, the bill would \n     also remove Treasury's ability to raise cash to pay benefits \n     from other trust funds, even after a disinvestment of \n     securities held by such funds.\n       Second, while the bill intends to protect the ability to \n     make payments to fund beneficiaries at times when the debt \n     limit would otherwise preclude such payments, as a practical \n     matter it cannot be assured that the protected payments could \n     actually be made, given the current methods of paying \n     government obligations.\n       The Federal Reserve's current procedure, when government \n     checks are presented for payment, is to give immediate credit \n     to the presenting bank. Incoming checks are not actually \n     sorted for several days after presentment. There is not \n     presently in place any operational capability that would \n     permit a distinction to be made between protected benefit \n     checks and all other checks being presented for payment.\n       While the bill would require the Secretary to institute \n     procedures to assure that the protected benefits are paid \n     when due, we estimate that it would take a minimum of three \n     months, and perhaps longer, to institute the changes in the \n     payments system necessary to provide this assurance.\n       Finally, the protected payment procedures prescribed by \n     this legislation would only be triggered when we were in, or \n     on the brink of, default.\n       Since the country has never in its history experienced a \n     default, it is impossible to determine whether or to what \n     extent it would be possible for Treasury to sell new debt to \n     the public to make the protected payments.\n       In such a situation, all other payment obligations of the \n     United States would either be in default or would be ``queued \n     up'' for payment as cash became available.\n       We would be pleased to work with the Committee to try to \n     develop legislative language that would carry out the \n     objectives that we share, while avoiding the adverse \n     consequences we see flowing from the language in the current \n     bill.\n       We continue to believe, however, that the most effective \n     and certain means for assuring that the interests of \n     beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare--as well as all \n     other trust funds--are fully protected, is promptly to enact \n     a clean permanent increase in the debt limit.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John D. Hawke, Jr.,\n\n                                   Under Secretary of the Treasury\n     for Domestic Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18732-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Lautenberg \nresponded to a statement I made yesterday regarding the so-called \nLautenberg amendment.\n  In defending this abused program, which has made a farce of the \nRefugee Act, my friend and colleague claimed that the beneficiaries \n``have to prove a credible fear'' of persecution before they qualify.\n  Yet, in fact, these people do not have to prove a credible fear of \npersecution; rather all they have to do is assert a fear of \ndiscrimination. Discrimination, Mr. President, is not persecution; and \nasserting a fear is not proving it. All other refugees in the world who \nare coming to this country are required to prove a ``well-founded fear \nof persecution.''\n  Senator Lautenberg responded to the reports of criminals using this \nprogram to enter the United States by saying it wasn't designed to \n``allow criminals to enter.'' He said it is the responsibility of the \nINS and the State Department to prevent criminals from using the \nprogram.\n  I would remind my good friend that when the INS tried its level best \nto effectively screen these people, representatives of ``the groups'' \nwent directly to Moscow to insist upon lower standards. Do not blame \nthe Justice and the State Departments alone for this fiasco. ``The \ngroups'' and their skilled lobbyists created this one from whole cloth.\n  Senator Lautenberg said he was surprised to hear me refer to Russia \nas our ``best friend.'' Perhaps best friend was a bit of an \noverstatement, but they are certainly among our friends, and certainly \nthis administration and this President as well as the previous \nadministration have gone out of their way to cultivate friendly \nrelations with that country. Whether it is a best friend or a good \nfriend, there is certainly no justification whatever--at this present \nday--for some blanket ``presumption'' of ``refugeeness'' for any of \ntheir citizens who happen to belong to one of several religious groups, \nsome of whose members have been subject to discrimination or even \npersecution in the past.\n\n  However, the most astounding thing the Senator from New Jersey said \nwas that the program ought to be extended for another year. Even if we \ncut this off today, there are 100,000 of these beneficiaries of the \nLautenberg amendment already ``in the pipeline.'' That means that even \nwithout an extension we will have 35,000 entering every year for the \nnext 3 years.\n  I can only reply to my friend that he should read again the article I \nplaced into the Congressional Record yesterday, and I respectfully \nrecommend that he should talk to the Immigration Service about the \ncurrent traffic from Moscow regarding this program.\n  How can any of us support a program where only one-half of 1 percent \nof those applying now could qualify as a ``refugee'' under the American \nand the international law definition of ``refugee''? We make a mockery \nof the law if we do so.\n  Why should the American taxpayer provide our severely limited refugee \naid for these persons, who are actually regular ``immigrants,'' not \n``refugees.''\n  These ``asserters'' are not even required to prove a well-founded \nfear of persecution, so we have absolutely no assurance that they are, \nin fact, refugees. And more importantly please recall that when they do \nreceive permission to enter the United States, they take months, even \nsometimes more than a year, to decide whether or not they really want \nto come here.\n  About 40,000 of them who are authorized to come here are lingering in \nthe former Soviet Union, weighing their options. They are clearly in no \nhurry. That is what an immigrant ordinarily does--to calmly, and \nwithout urging, weigh all the pluses and minuses of staying or going to \nthe United States. A true refugee does not have any possible luxury of \nsuch a lengthy, deliberative process. After all they are required to be \n``fleeing'' or have a ``well founded fear'' of persecution.\n  Again, I urge the conferees on the State Department reauthorization \nbill to insist upon the Senate provisions and not continue this misused \nprogram any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18734-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18734-S18735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF LEE M. NACKMAN\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to take a \nfew brief moments of the Senate's time to acknowledge the impending \nretirement of Mr. Lee M. Nackman from Federal service.\n  For nearly 10 years, Mr. Nackman has served as the Director of the \nLos Angeles VA Outpatient Clinic. During his tenure, he has taken his \nclinic from substandard basement quarters to a $40 million, state-of-\nthe-art, ambulatory care center in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.\n  The constituency served by the clinic brings to it a myriad of \nmedical and psychosocial problems. Many of the veterans care for are \nhomeless, living on the streets literally within sight of Los Angeles' \nCity Hall. In large measure because of his leadership, each of the \nveterans cared by the clinic is treated with the dignity and respect \nthey have earned through service to their country. This is a difficult \npatient population, yet Lee Nackman has assured that it is one that is \nwell served by the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system.\n  Mr. President, on January 3, 1996, Mr. Nackman is ending a \ndistinguished 35-year career of service to America's veterans. He began \nas a pharmacy intern at the Manhattan VA Medical Center upon completion \nof his B.S. degree from Columbia University. While working as a \npharmacy resident at what is now the West Los Angeles VA Medical \n\n[[Page S18735]]\nCenter, he completed his M.Sc. degree at the University of Southern \nCalifornia School of Pharmacy.\n\n  Throughout his career with the Veterans Administration, now the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, he has held a series of positions of \never increasing responsibility in pharmacy and in health care \nmanagement, to include 2 years as Assistant Director of the VA hospital \nin Sheridan, WY.\n  While in Los Angeles, Mr. Nackman has chaired the Southern California \nand Southern Nevada network of the Veterans Health Administration. His \nleadership was instrumental in creating a more integrated, more patient \nfocused approach to caring for the more than 1.7 million veterans \nresiding in that area. This network approach to providing health care \nhas served as a model for the national reorganization of VA health care \ndelivery into Veterans Integrated Service Networks.\n  Mr. Nackman currently chairs the Greater Los Angeles Federal \nExecutive Board, in which capacity he has shown leadership in \nencouraging a range of Federal partnerships which assure the provision \nof services administered by all Federal agencies in a more efficient \nand effective manner. This country's taxpayers deserve no less.\n\n  Mr. President, Lee Nackman has brought honor and dignity to the \nstatus of Federal employee. He has contributed to all that is good \nabout those in Government who provide goods and services to our \ncitizens, and most significantly, to the veterans he has so directly \ncared for over the 35 years of his distinguished career. Those of us \nwho care deeply about this Nation's veterans can but thank those men \nand women, like Lee Nackman, who have dedicated themselves to the \nservice of veterans. It is fitting that we recognize that service \ntoday. It is also appropriate that we express our thanks to Lee \nNackman--and indeed, to so many dedicated public servants, the best of \nwhom he represents--at this, the moment of his retirement.\n  Mr. President, I know all in this body join with me in this \nvaledictory. We wish Lee Nackman many years of a satisfying retirement. \nDuring that time he can truly look back upon a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18734-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18735-S18736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NORDY HOFFMANN--A GREAT AMERICAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the December 13, 1995, edition of the Hill \nincluded an article written by Ron Martinson paying special tribute to \nF. Nordhoff Hoffmann. It is a fine piece that captures perfectly the \nman we all know as Nordy. Mr. Martinson takes us through the various \nand varied stages of Nordy's life revealing a remarkable example of one \nperson's contribution to his family, his college, his colleagues and \nhis country.\n  I have known Nordy for many years. His service to this institution, \nmost notably as Sergeant at Arms, is well-known and remains a standard \nto which all who fill that position are compared. While Nordy's tenure \nin the Senate was as a Democrat, his ability to transcend party and \npolitics was extraordinary and one pattern I often wish was emulated \nmore regularly. Nordy's empathy for everyone from Senators to staff was \ntruly uncommon. To put it simply Nordy, throughout his life, has always \nbeen a caring individual and an excellent role model. It has been \nsometime since I have seen Nordy, and I am deeply saddened by news of \nhis ill health, but I wanted to take this opportunity to call attention \nto this article and to let Nordy know I am thinking of him and I wish \nhim well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hill article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the ordered to be printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Dec. 13, 1995]\n\n   Nordy Hoffmann--Ailing Former Senate Sergeant at Arms Was a Giant \n                      Figure With A Heart To Match\n\n                           (By Ron Martinson)\n\n       P. Nordhoff Hoffmann, known to generations of Notre Dame \n     alumni and members of Congress as ``Nordy,' was convening his \n     first department head meeting as Senate sergeant at arms in \n     January 1976.\n       With the directors of a dozen service organizations under \n     his jurisdiction dutifully assembled, Nordy opened the \n     meeting with characteristic directness; ``Some of you guys \n     probably think that because Nordy Hoffmann is 67 years old, \n     he won't be around in this job for very long. Well, let me \n     tell you something--my grandfather lived to be 92, so get \n     that out of your damn heads right now.''\n       Hoffmann, who will turn 86 next Tuesday, is seriously ill \n     with cancer. But to anyone who knew him during a lifetime of \n     successes earned by determination and a sense of destiny, he \n     was one of the most remarkable and unforgettable \n     personalities who ever walked the corridors of Capitol Hill.\n       A huge hulk of a man whose massive frame carried more than \n     300 pounds before his illness, Nordy's thundering voice could \n     intimidate the most intrepid soul. But underneath was a \n     gentle spirit and big heart that earned Nordy legions of \n     devoted friends.\n       A native of Seattle, Nordy first achieved distinction as an \n     All-American right guard on Knute Rockne's 1929 and 1930 \n     Notre Dame championship football teams. He had never played \n     the game before Rockne spotted him on campus one day and \n     ordered him to report to practice. He graduated from Notre \n     Dame Law School in 1933 and after several years as assistant \n     coach at his alma mater and a semi-pro football player, he \n     saw service as a World War II Navy officer in the Pacific.\n       After the war, Nordy was tapped by Philip Murray, president \n     of the United Steelworkers Union, to become the union's \n     legislative director in Washington, a position that quickly \n     immersed him in national Democratic politics. For the next 20 \n     years, he was in the thick of every major labor battle on \n     Capitol Hill, from Taft-Hartley to minimum wage to Medicare.\n       Nordy received a rare tribute in 1963 when then-Vice \n     President Lyndon Johnson singled him out during a speech at a \n     Democratic dinner and roared, ``Nordy Hoffmann knows what I'm \n     talking about because he and Phil Murray and I were fighting \n     for these things way back when. We didn't win but we didn't \n     stop trying because Nordy Hoffmann's not a quitter, and \n     neither am I!''\n       In 1967, Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine) prevailed upon Nordy \n     to become executive director of the Democratic Senatorial \n     Campaign Committee, and 10 years later, in January 1976, the \n     Democratic majority picked him to succeed William H. Wannall \n     as Senate sergeant at arms.\n       It took Nordy about two minutes after being sworn in to put \n     his ``Let's get it done and help the people'' management \n     style into full gear. He engaged everyone in the process, \n     seeking advice from people from senators to janitors about \n     how to make his office more open, productive and helpful.\n       As Nordy's administrative assistant and the token \n     Republican in his office, I always found him exceptionally \n     open to ideas, including that of putting a ``welcome'' sign \n     on the door. He was also color blind, as he brought his \n     longtime assistant Barbara Towles with him and made her his \n     executive secretary. She was the first black person to hold \n     this position in the Sergeant at Arms Office.\n       Nordy was genuinely focused on being a good steward of the \n     resources entrusted to him, and he looked for and found many \n     ways to save money, improve services and steamline \n     operations. But all of those things were only tools to help \n     him achieve his most important goal, which was to provide \n     service for others.\n       In a town where people often dispense favors and return \n     phone calls based upon the recipient's ability to \n     reciprocate, Nordy would give his shirt to the first person \n     who asked without expecting anything in return. Once, a \n     friend of mine who was working for a junior Republican \n     congressman asked if I knew of any job opportunities for \n     Republicans on the Senate side as his niece was looking for \n     work.\n       When I suggested he talk to Nordy, he couldn't believe that \n     Nordy would even see him. Not only did Nordy talk to him, but \n     he found the aide's niece a job. That former aide is now a \n     Republican congressman from New York.\n       Nothing underscores the universal affection for Nordy \n     better than the time he was recommended for induction into \n     the national collegiate football Hall of Fame. An ad hoc \n     committee headed by Don Womack, former superintendent of the \n     Senate Press Gallery, was formed to collect testimonial \n     letters on Nordy's behalf to the judges considering Nordy's \n     nomination.\n       When I looked at the folder containing copies of the \n     letters that were presented to Nordy as a keepsake, I \n     discovered personally signed letters from Presidents Carter \n     and Ford and Vice Presidents Mondale and Rockefeller, along \n     with those from every one of the 100 senators. Needless to \n     say, Nordy was elected to the Hall of Fame.\n       But Nordy wasn't just a hero to sports enthusiasts or \n     powerful politicians. Once, when a maid asked me if I could \n     do something about the dirty, dilapidated maids' lounge in \n     the basement of the Capitol, I walked into Nordy's office and \n     stood in front of his desk.\n       ``Nordy, you consider yourself to be a humane employer, \n     don't you?'' I declared. He looked at me with a quizzical \n     expression, and as I described what I'd seen, he spun around \n     on his chair and began punching buttons on his phone with his \n     sausage-like fingers.\n       He gave Tom Ward, the chief engineer in charge of \n     maintenance at the Capitol, an earful about the disgraceful \n     working conditions of his maids, and within two days, Ward \n     had dispatched a team of painters and plasterers to convert \n     the maids' lounge into a clean, pleasant place, making Nordy \n     a hero forever to the maids.\n       Nordy's legendary kindness didn't stop at the doors of the \n     Capitol. He and his wife Joanne opened their Potomac, Md., \n     home and \n\n[[Page S18736]]\n     swimming pool to retarded children. Nordy also raised staggering \n     amounts of money for cancer research as a member of the board \n     of the Vince Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University \n     Hospital.\n       Following the Republican takeover of the Senate in 1981 \n     Nordy left the Senate to open his own consulting firm, but he \n     continued as an informal advisor and friend to people both on \n     and off the Hill. When I stopped by his office several years \n     ago, he had just finished ``putting the tap'' on a lobbyist \n     friend for a donation for his annual Thanksgiving project.\n       Nordy used the money to buy turkeys, which he then had a \n     Senate chef cook for him. On Thanksgiving Day, he picked up \n     the birds and delivered them to homeless shelters in the \n     area. He did this for years without telling any of his \n     friends and associates.\n       On my last visit with Nordy several months ago, before he \n     entered the hospital for treatment of his illness, I saw the \n     sign that sat prominently on his desk. It read, ``Never \n     complain about getting old. It is a privilege denied to \n     many.''\n       Nordy Hoffmann has always acted on this advice and has \n     lived every moment to the fullest with the purpose of serving \n     others. That service continued until very recently when his \n     declining health forced him to end it. But his legion of \n     friends and admirers know that he was always a real friend in \n     a town where real friends are truly rare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18735-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDR. NED A. OSTENSO, PH.D., A LEADER IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON LAND AND \n                                  SEA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the news \nthat Dr. Ned A. Ostenso, Ph.D., Assistant Administrator of the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research, plans to retire in 3 weeks, on January 3, 1996.\n  During his distinguished career, Dr. Ostenso has made invaluable \ncontributions as a research scientist, administrator, and leader in \nshaping America's understanding of the oceans and in directing our \nNation's marine and atmospheric research.\n  As a researcher, he played a major role in defining the structure of \nthe Arctic Ocean Basin, providing quantitative studies of mid-ocean \nridges--including the first paper on the relationship of sea-floor age \nto crustal thickness--and defining the nature of Greenland and \nAntarctic ice caps.\n  His research activities have resulted in more than 50 published \nscientific papers.\n  Among Dr. Ostenso's numerous honors in earth and marine sciences, a \nseamount in the Arctic Ocean was named after him. In addition, while \nserving with the team that made the first transit of Antarctica during \nthe International Geophysical Year, Dr. Ostenso discovered an Antarctic \nmountain peak that today bears his name.\n  Long after we are gone, Dr. Ostenso's name will be remembered both on \nland and at sea.\n  In the 1970's, Dr. Ostenso represented the United States Navy on \nmutual defense environmental data agreements with Australia, Germany \nand New Zealand. In 1972, he represented the United States Navy in \nnegotiating, and later administering, the U.S./U.S.S.R Bilateral \nAgreement in World Ocean Studies.\n  Later, he served in the White House Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy as Assistant Presidential Science Advisor. He was Deputy \nDirector and Senior Oceanographer of the Ocean Science and Technology \nDivision, Office of Naval Research.\n  In January of 1977, Dr. Ostenso moved from the Navy to the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] to assume 12 years of \nleadership of the Sea Grant College Program.\n  I am best acquainted with Dr. Ostenso's extraordinary skill through \nmy own role as the Senate author of the National Sea Grant College and \nProgram Act. Under his leadership, Sea Grant improved and expanded \nduring a dozen exciting and challenging years, including five \nreauthorizations.\n  As Sea Grant Director, Dr. Ostenso improved Sea Grant's science \nthrough rigorous peer review and broadened Sea Grant's reach by \nbringing new colleges and universities under its umbrella. Under his \nleadership, Sea Grant expanded to a total of 29 programs in 31 coastal \nand Great Lakes States.\n  Sea Grant is highly regarded for its support of excellent research \nand effective educational and technology transfer programs. An economic \nstudy of the National Sea Grant Program showed that, in the year \nstudied, 1987, Sea Grant's impact on the national economy was $840 \nmillion.\n  In today's dollars, this impact would likely exceed $1 billion per \nyear. For example, Sea Grant research over the last two decades has \ngiven the country a profitable marine aquaculture industry with an \nestimated 1995 value of $300 million.\n  For 6 years, Dr. Ostenso served as Assistant Administrator for \nOceanic and Atmospheric Research, which included responsibility for Sea \nGrant, the National Undersea Research Program, and the Environmental \nResearch Laboratories.\n  During his tenure, the 12 institutions comprising the Environmental \nResearch Laboratories made a number of significant contributions \nleading to: Modernization of the National Weather Service; an \nunderstanding of the physics and chemistry of the polar ozone holes \nthat has led to sensible national policies; a national climate program \nthat is just now beginning to predict weather on season and yearly time \nscales; and a vast improvement to our understanding of severe weather \nevents that has had a direct impact on more accurate and timely \nwarnings.\n  As Assistant Administrator, Dr. Ostenso oversaw a major shift in the \nfocus of the National Undersea Research Program [NURP].\n  Under his guidance, NURP changed from a primary focus on the \nprocurement of undersea vessels and associated hardware to an increased \nemphasis on more scientifically oriented national, subsurface research.\n  NURP now supports merit-based research grants to provide the \nscientific basis for addressing critical natural resource issues--such \nas the preservation of natural marine sanctuaries. The program also \ncontinues to provide access to an extensive array of manned and \nunmanned undersea vehicles.\n  Dr. Ostenso also served as NOAA's acting chief Scientist for 1 year. \nHe was instrumental in obtaining OMB and congressional support for a \n15-year NOAA fleet replacement and modernization program.\n  Over the years, Dr. Ostenso has served on a number of national and \ninternational committees and panels. The most recent was his \nappointment by Vice President Gore and the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency to serve on an Environmental Task Force to assess \nthe dual use of defense and intelligence data and systems for civilian \nenvironmental studies.\n  Dr. Ostenso has played a pivotal role for years in guiding the \nAmerican Geophysical Union [AGU]. Most recently he supervised the \nconstruction of their handsome new facilities on Florida Avenue here in \nWashington, DC.\n  He also is former vice president of the American Oceanic \nOrganization, president of the American Polar Society, and a member of \nmany organizations, including the Antarctica Society, Arctic Institute \nof North America, Cosmos Club, Explorers Club, and Geological Society.\n  I am confident that I speak for many of my colleagues when I express \nadmiration and thanks to Dr. Ned A. Ostenso, Ph.D., for his invaluable \ncontributions to the United States of America and to the world \nscientific community. He has our best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18736-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18736-S18737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

The costs of implementing the START \n     II Treaty should be borne by both parties to the Treaty. The \n     exchange of instruments of ratification of the START II \n     Treaty shall not be contingent upon the United States \n     providing financial guarantees to pay for implementation of \n     commitments by Russia under the START II Treaty.\n       (4) Exchange of letters.--The exchange of letters--\n       (A) between Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and \n     Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, dated December \n     29, 1992, regarding SS-18 missiles and launchers now on the \n     territory of Kazakstan,\n       (B) between Secretary of State Eagleburger and Minister of \n     Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, dated December 29, 1992, and \n     December 31, 1992, regarding heavy bombers, and\n       (C) between Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev and Secretary \n     of Defense Richard Cheney, dated December 29, 1992, and \n     January 3, 1993, making assurances on Russian intent \n     regarding the conversion and retention of 90 silo launchers \n     of RS-20 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) \n     (all having been submitted to the Senate as associated with \n     the START II Treaty),\n\n     are of the same force and effect as the provisions of the \n     START II Treaty. The United States shall regard actions \n     inconsistent with obligations under those exchanges of \n     letters as equivalent under international law to actions \n     inconsistent with the START II Treaty.\n       (5) Space-launch vehicles.--Space-launch vehicles composed \n     of items that are limited by the START Treaty or the START II \n     Treaty shall be subject to the obligations undertaken in the \n     respective treaty.\n       (6) NTM and cuba.--The obligation of the United States \n     under the START Treaty not to interfere with the national \n     technical means (NTM) of verification of the other party to \n     the Treaty does not preclude the United States from pursuing \n     the question of the removal of the electronic intercept \n     facility operated by the Government of the Russian Federation \n     at Lourdes, Cuba.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Cooperative threat reductions.--Pursuant to the Joint \n     Statement on the Transparency and Irreversibility of the \n     Process of Reducing Nuclear Weapons, agreed to in Moscow, May \n     10, 1995, between the President of the United States and the \n     President of the Russian Federation, it is the sense of the \n     Senate that both parties to the START II Treaty should attach \n     high priority to--\n       (A) the exchange of detailed information on aggregate \n     stockpiles of nuclear warheads, on stocks of fissile \n     materials, and on their safety and security;\n       (B) the maintenance at distinct and secure storage \n     facilities, on a reciprocal basis, of fissile materials \n     removed from nuclear warheads and declared to be excess to \n     national security requirements for the purpose of confirming \n     the irreversibility of the process of nuclear weapons \n     reduction; and\n       (C) the adoption of other cooperative measures to enhance \n     confidence in the reciprocal declarations on fissile material \n     stockpiles.\n       (2) Asymmetry in reductions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the START or \n     START II Treaty, the President should, within the parameters \n     of the elimination schedules provided for in the START \n     Treaties, regulate reductions in the United States strategic \n     nuclear forces so that the number of accountable warheads \n     under the START and START II Treaties possessed by the \n     Russian Federation in no case exceeds the comparable number \n     of accountable warheads possessed by the United States to an \n     extent that a strategic imbalance endangering the national \n     security interests of the United States results.\n       (3) Expanding strategic arsenals in countries other than \n     russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that, if during the \n     time the START II Treaty remains in force or in advance of \n     any further strategic offensive arms reductions the President \n     determines there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the START II Treaty so as \n     to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the START II Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (4) Substantial further reductions.--Cognizant of the \n     obligation of the United States under Article VI of the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons of July 1, \n     1968 ``to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at \n     any early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on \n     general and complete disarmament under strict and effective \n     international control'', it is the sense of the Senate that \n     in anticipation of the ratification and entry into force of \n     the START II Treaty, the Senate calls upon the parties to the \n     START II Treaty to seek further strategic offensive arms \n     reductions consistent with their national security interests \n     and calls upon the other nuclear weapon states to give \n     careful and early consideration to corresponding reductions \n     of their own nuclear arsenals.\n       (5) Missile technology control regime.--The Senate urges \n     the President to insist that the Republic of Belarus, the \n     Republic of Kazakstan, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation \n     abide by the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime (MTCR). For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``Missile Technology Control Regime'' means the policy \n     statement between the United States, the United Kingdom, the \n     Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and \n     Japan, announced April 16, 1987, to restrict sensitive \n     missile-relevant transfers based on the MTCR Annex, and any \n     amendments thereto.\n       (6) Further arms reduction obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (7) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18737-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Craig, and \n             Mr. Bennett):\n       S. 1481.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the nonrecognition of gain for sale of stock to certain farmers' \ncooperatives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    farmers' cooperative legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am joined by Senators Harkin, Craig, and \nBennett in introducing legislation that will assist farmers' \ncooperatives in purchasing the refining and processing facilities that \nreceive their goods and lower the cost of bringing agricultural \nproducts to market. The bill extends certain nonrecognition of gain \nbenefits contained in the Internal Revenue code to owners of \nagricultural product refining and processing facilities if they sell to \na farmers cooperative.\n  Currently, the Tax Code provides various incentives for the promotion \nof economic activity and growth. For example, section 1042 grants \nemployees participating in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan [ESOP] and \nworker-owned cooperatives the opportunity to acquire an ownership \ninterest in certain corporate stock. This has enabled employees and \nmembers of worker-owned cooperatives to participate as owners of the \nbusiness. This Congress, as have previous Congresses recognizes that \neconomic conditions are changing as advancing technology has \ntransformed our business climate into one that is more dependent on \ncapital investment for growth and profits. Participatory ownership at \nall levels is important in spreading the benefits of capital ownership \nfrom the few to the many.\n  The bill would provide farmers who form farmers cooperatives the \nopportunity for an ownership interest in the processing and marketing \nof their products. Owners of a refining or processing facility would be \nable to receive nonrecognition treatment on any capital gain if the \nfacility is sold to a farmers cooperative that did at least 50 percent \nof its business with the refining or processing facility, so long as \nthe owners reinvest the sales proceeds into similar property.\n  Mr. President, farmers generally own their own businesses. Some have \na few acres of land and some have developed large operations. Over the \nyears, farmers cooperatives have been formed to take advantage of \neconomies of scale. These farmers cooperatives bring farmers together \nto sell their agricultural products to someone else who refines or \nprocesses them and sells them to the public. The chain in agricultural \nmarketing includes both the farmer and the refiner or processor. Each \nadditional link in the chain can add increasing costs to the final sale \nof these agricultural products. If the farmers, through the combined \npower of a farmers cooperative, could acquire ownership in the refiner \nor processor that finishes and markets their products, the driving need \nfor profits at both levels of the chain would be lessened. By combining \ntheir business interest, an additional level of overhead and \nprofitability could be greatly reduced. The net result would be lower \ncosts to the consuming public and a healthier farm economy.\n  America's farmers have seen many changes to their industry over the \npast few years. It is tough to be a farmer. Price changes, demands for \nnew machinery, changes in agricultural demand, the unpredictable \nweather, and economic hardship have shaken the farming industry. This \nbill will give farmers a chance for more stability and control in the \nfuture marketing of their products. Of course, not all farmers will \ntake advantage of these benefits. However, those that do will hopefully \nreap greater benefits from a more integrated agricultural business.\n  Representatives Pat Roberts, chairman of the House Committee on \nAgriculture, Charles Stenholm, and others introduced similar \nlegislation in the House as H.R. 2676. This bill has bipartisan \nsupport. It is timely assistance for our Nations farmers' cooperatives. \nI urge my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the isle to support \nthis initiative for our Nation's farming industry. This bill has been \nendorsed by the National Council of Farmers' Cooperatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NONRECOGNITION OF GAIN ON SALE OF STOCK TO CERTAIN \n                   FARMERS' COOPERATIVES.\n\n       (a) Application of Section 1042 Section 1042 to Certain \n     Farmers' Cooperatives.--Section 1042 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to sales of stock to employee stock \n     ownership plans or certain cooperatives) is amended by adding \n     at the end of the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Application of Section to Sales of Stock in \n     Agricultural Refiners and Processors to Eligible Farm \n     Cooperatives.--\n       ``(1) In general.--This section shall apply to the sale of \n     stock of a qualified refiner or processor to an eligible \n     farmers' cooperative.\n       ``(2) Qualified refiner or processor.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `qualified refiner or processor' means a \n     domestic corporation--\n       ``(A) substantially all of the activities of which consist \n     of the active conduct of the trade or business of refining or \n     processing agricultural or horticultural products, and\n       ``(B) which purchases more than one-half of such products \n     to be refined or processed from farmers who make up the \n     eligible farmers' cooperative which is purchasing stock in \n     the corporation in a transaction to which this subsection is \n     to apply.\n       ``(3) Eligible farmers' cooperative.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term `eligible farmers' cooperative' means an \n     organization to which part I of subchapter T applies which is \n     engaged in the marketing of agricultural or horticultural \n     products.\n       ``(4) Special rules.--In applying this section to a sale to \n     which paragraph (1) applies--\n       ``(A) the eligible farmers' cooperative shall be treated in \n     the same manner as a cooperative described in subsection \n     (b)(1)(B),\n       ``(B) subsection (b)(2) shall be applied by substituting \n     `100 percent' for `30 percent',\n       ``(C) the determination as to whether any stock in the \n     domestic corporation is a qualified security shall be made--\n       ``(i) without regard to whether the stock is an employer \n     security, and\n       ``(ii) by treating the requirements of subsection (c)(1)(A) \n     as being met if more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock \n     of the corporation is not readily tradable on an established \n     securities market, and\n       ``(D) subsection (c)(7) shall not apply.''\n       ``(b) Coordination With Section 338(h)(10).--Section \n     338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by \n     adding at the end of the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Corporation with section 1042.--An election may be \n     made under this paragraph with respect to a sale described in \n     section 1042(g) for which an election was made under section \n     1042(a), except that no gain shall be recognized by reason of \n     subparagraph (A)(ii) to the extent it is not recognized under \n     section 1042(a).''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to sales after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with Senators Hatch, Harkin, \nand Bennett in introducing legislation which would be helpful to farmer \ncooperatives seeking to purchase businesses that refine or processes \ntheir agricultural crops, and ultimately would lower the costs of \nbringing their products to market.\n  The proposed legislation would amend section 1042 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, which currently allows a similar treatment for sales to \nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan [ESOP] and worker-owned cooperatives. \nThrough this section of the Internal Revenue Code, employees and \nmembers of worker-owned cooperatives are able to acquire an ownership \ninterest in certain corporate stock and participate in ownership of the \nbusiness.\n  Currently, farmers cannot compete with other business entities and \nwith ESOP's in buying such businesses because of the advantages \ninherent in the tax deferrals available in transactions with these \nother purchasers.\n  Mr. President, this bill would allow farmers' cooperatives the \nopportunity to be directly involved with the processing and marketing \nof their products. With this combination, overhead could be greatly \nreduced, and the result would be lower costs to the consuming public \nand a healthier farm economy.\n  Making it easier, on a more level playing field, for farmers to \nparticipate in the refining and processing of their products will \nprovide them with a better way to deal with market fluctuations of \ncommodity prices and also provide for more stability and control in \ntheir future marketing of products.\n  This bill has bipartisan support. Similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House as H.R. 2676, by Pat Roberts, Charlie Stenholm, \nand others. I urge my colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle to support \n\n[[Page S18740]]\nthis initiative for our Nation's farming industry, which has been \nendorsed by the National Council of Farmers Cooperatives.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1482. A bill to amend chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, \nto deem all Federal employees to be essential employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                federal government shutdown legislation\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, once again we stand at the edge of \nanother partial shutdown of the Federal Government.\n  Looking back on last month's shutdown, I have a hard time explaining \nto Minnesotans why we gave 800,000 Federal Government employees 4\\1/2\\ \ndays of what amounts to paid ``vacation'' on top of the already \ngenerous employee leave benefits. I have a hard time explaining what \nthe taxpayers got when they footed the bill for $400 million dollars of \nwork that was never performed.\n  Mr. President, losing your job is tough but if you get laid off or \nyou go on strike, you don't get paid. Yet, if the Federal Government \nfurloughs many of its employees it becomes a vacation and is paid in \nfull. I'm reminded of that popular song from a few years back: \n``Somthin' for nothin'.'' That's exactly what Federal employees got \nwhen the Government shut down--``Somethin' for nothin'.'' And I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that the American taxpayer is sick and tired of \ngetting nothing.\n  I realize that most Federal employees want to work and not become \npawns in the debate over Federal spending. I want to change the law to \nensure that Federal employees will work during shutdowns.\n  As we all know, the determination of whether you came to work during \nthe shutdown depended on if you were deemed ``essential'' or \n``nonessential.''\n  It was very interesting when we saw the numbers of ``nonessential'' \nemployees in some of the agencies we continue to support with billions \nof tax dollars.\n  Fifty-seven percent of the employees at Health and Human Services; 66 \npercent of Commerce; 72 percent at Interior; 75 percent at Labor; 82 \npercent at EPA; 89 percent at Education; and a full 99 percent of HUD.\n  Overall 800,000 employees--all of them deemed ``nonessential'' all of \nthem on a paid ``vacation'' they didn't ask for and didn't want.\n  I can't tell you how many times I've tried to explain to angry \nMinnesotans why we're employing all of these nonessential employees and \neven worse, why we paid them to stay away from the office.\n  Mr. President, we cannot let this happen again. We cannot have \nemployees who come to work not knowing whether they'll be paid and \nothers forced to sit at home, hoping they will be paid. This is unfair \nto Federal employees and this is especially unfair to American \ntaxpayers, who pay far too much of their hard earned dollars to the \nGovernment.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation which will end this \nclassification process and restore some common sense that will keep \npeople working when Congress and the President fail to enact \nappropriations.\n  Simply put, my bill, the ``Federal Employment Taxpayer Accountability \nAct,'' eliminates the distinction between essential and nonessential \nemployees deeming all Federal Government employees essential.\n  This will put an end to classification of Federal employees. It \nremoves the guesswork on who's ``essential'' and most importantly, it \neliminates Federal employees being used as ``pawns'' of the process--as \nbargaining chips for negotiators.\n  Mr. President, the prospect of another Government shutdown is \ndisappointing. The people of this country are demanding a balanced \nbudget. Yet here we are, ready to throw another 300,000 employees out \nof work at Christmas time. Will they get paid when they come back? My \nbet is yes. If they're paid again for not working will the taxpayers \nunderstand? My bet is no.\n  Let's not let this happen again. Let's ensure that taxpayers are \nprotected. Let's ensure that when we ask them to send part of their \npaycheck to Washington, they're getting the most efficient cost \neffective Government possible--without the paid vacations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Federal workers--and the American \ntaxpayers--by supporting the Federal Employment Taxpayer Accountability \nAct.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1483. A bill to control crime, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the victim rights and domestic violence prevention act of 1995\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce the Victim Rights and \nDomestic Violence Prevention Act of 1995. The O.J. Simpson trial \nreminded all of us of the terrible problem of domestic violence in \nAmerica. Now is the time to do all we can to bring abusers to justice.\n  Women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent crimes a year, \nincluding half a million rapes or other sexual assaults, according to \nthe Department of Justice. The National Victims Center calculates that \na woman is battered every 15 seconds. Additionally, the FBI has \nreported that one violent crime occurs every 16 seconds, an aggravated \nassault every 28 seconds, a robbery every 48 seconds, and a murder \nevery 21 minutes.\n  Nicole Brown Simpson's story is an all-too-familiar one. Last year's \ncrime bill, which is now law, did much to help victims of domestic \nviolence--making it easier for evidence of intrafamilial sexual abuse \nto be introduced, for example. It will now be much easier for \nprosecutors in Federal cases to introduce evidence that the accused \ncommitted a similar crime in the past. The crime act also provides \nFederal funding for battered women's shelters and training for law-\nenforcement officers and prosecutors.\n  The Victim Rights and Domestic Violence Prevention Act will \nstrengthen the rights of domestic violence victims in Federal court \nand, hopefully, set a standard for the individual States to emulate.\n  A message must be sent to abusers that their behavior is not a family \nmatter. Society should treat domestic violence as seriously as it does \nviolence between strangers. My bill authorizes the death penalty for \ncases in which a woman is murdered by her husband or boyfriend.\n  Courts will not, under this bill, be able to exclude evidence of a \ndefendant's violent disposition toward the victim as impermissible \ncharacter evidence. My bill also provides that if a defendant presents \nnegative character evidence concerning the victim, the government's \nrebuttal can include negative character evidence concerning the \ndefendant. It makes clear that testimony regarding battered women's \nsyndrome is admissible to explain the behavior of victims of violence.\n  We must establish a higher standard of professional conduct for \nlawyers. My legislation prohibits harassing or dilatory tactics, \nknowingly presenting false evidence or discrediting truthful evidence, \nwillful ignorance of matters that could be learned from the client, and \nconcealment of information necessary to prevent sexual abuse or other \nviolent crimes.\n\n  Violence in our society leaves law-abiding citizens feeling \ndefenseless. It is time to level the playing field. Federal law \ncurrently gives the defense more chances than the prosecution to reject \na potential juror. My bill protects the right of victims to an \nimpartial jury by giving both sides the same number of peremptory \nchallenges.\n  Last year's Crime Act included a provision requiring notice to State \nand local authorities concerning the release of Federal violent \noffenders. Under the act, notice can only be used for law-enforcement \npurposes. The Justice Department opposes this limitation because it \ndisallows other legitimate uses of the information, such as warning \npotential victims of the offender's return to the community. My bill \nwould delete this restriction.\n  Under the bill, if a victim requests an HIV test in a sexual abuse \ncase, the court must order HIV testing of the defendant, unless the \ncourt determines that the defendant's conduct created no risk of \ntransmission of the virus to the victim. The order must direct that the \ninitial test be performed within 24 hours of the issuance of the \ntesting order, or as soon thereafter as feasible. The defendant cannot \nbe released from custody until the test is performed. \n\n[[Page S18741]]\nTest results would be disclosed to the victim, and follow up testing \nwould take place after 6 and 12 months. Additionally, the bill deletes \na requirement that a victim must undergo counseling before she can seek \na testing order. Second, it deletes a provision that the court cannot \norder testing of the defendant unless the victim demonstrates that such \na test would provide information that is necessary for her health. \nThird, it makes clear that prosecutors may assist victims in obtaining \ntesting orders under these provisions.\n  It is our responsibility to continue to work to combat violent crime, \nwherever it occurs. The Victim Rights and Domestic Violence Prevention \nAct of 1995 is an important step toward protecting the rights of crime \nvictims, curbing domestic violence, and removing violent offenders from \nour streets and communities.\n  Finally, I would like to thank two of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee.

Mr. President, I offer my strong support for \nthe Victim Rights and Domestic Violence Prevention Act, which I am \npleased to co-sponsor with Senators Kyl and Dewine. I also want to \ncommend my colleague from Arizona the cooperative spirit he has shown \nin working with me on this and other efforts to help crime victims, and \nfor addressing this important issue which is now so prominently, and \ntragically, in the news.\n  Nearly every American knows the plight of Nicole Brown Simpson. Who \namong us hasn't read of, or heard of, or discussed the tragic \ncircumstances of her case?\n  But, Mr. President, what about the thousands of women who suffer the \nterrible physical and emotional effects of domestic violence in silent \nanonymity every day all across the Nation? And, what about the women \nwho do stand up to domestic abusers and seek refuge from them from a \njustice system that seemingly doesn't care?\n  It is for those women that I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor this much needed bill.\n  Last year, Congress acknowledged that action must be taken to stop \ndomestic violence when it passed the Violence Against Women Act as part \nof the President's crime bill.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is designed to, among other things, \nprovide funding for: Local programs for victims' services; battered \nwomen's shelters; rape education and community prevention programs; a \nnational family violence hotline; and increased security in public \nplaces.\n  I strongly believe that this landmark legislation will go a long way \ntoward reducing domestic abuse and helping its victims recover from \ntheir ordeals.\n  Today, we continue the work begun by the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Much more needs to be done to protect the rights of the victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence and to stop these heinous crimes.\n  Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this problem: According to \nthe National Coalition of Physicians Against Family Violence, domestic \nviolence strikes one in four families in the United States; the FBI has \nreported that a women is beaten every 18 seconds in the United States; \nand the Senate Judiciary Committee reported in 1992 that three to four \nmillion women are battered each year.\n  In my own State, the attorney general has reported that there were \n251,233 domestic violence-related calls for assistance from law \nenforcement last year. Of those cases, 155,944 calls involved a \nperpetrator attacking his victim with a personal weapon--such as his \nhands or feet.\n  According to the FBI, a women is raped every five minutes in this \ncountry; in 1994 alone, there were 102,296 rape or attempted rape cases \nreported to law enforcement; and in California, there were 10,960 cases \nof forcible rape that year.\n  Domestic violence touches too many woman. It must be stopped by \nmaking the court system more user-friendly to the victims of this \ncrime, and those who inflict it must be more severely punished. This \nbill accomplishes those two important goals.\n\n\n                      equal protection for victims\n\n  This bill will make the court system more user-friendly in several \nways:\n  First, it protects the right of victims to an impartial jury by \nequalizing the number of peremptory challenges afforded to the defense \nand the prosecution in jury selection.\n  Second, this bill provides that if a defendant in a criminal case \npresents negative evidence about the victim's character, the victim's \ndefense lawyer can present character evidence concerning the defendant. \nMr. President, too many women who take their abusers to court must \nsuffer the double indignity of having their own characters \n\n[[Page S18743]]\nattacked. It's time to level the playing field.\n  Third, it extends the right of victims to address the court \nconcerning the sentence to all criminal cases.\n  Fourth, the bill establishes higher standards of professional conduct \nfor lawyers in Federal cases to protect victims and other witnesses \nfrom abuse, and to promote the effective search for the truth. It does \nthis by requiring hat lawyers in Federal cases: not engage in conduct \nfor the purpose of increasing litigation expenses; not engage in \nconduct designed just to harass another person; not offer false \nevidence, or discredit true evidence; elicit a full account of the \nevents from the lawyer's client; not necessarily delay litigation; must \ndisclose information that the client intends to commit a crime of \nviolence; and may disclose information that the client intends to \ncommit other crimes.\n  Fifth, it removes the restriction that limits use of notices that \nviolent Federal offenders will be released to law enforcement purposes. \nThis will allow victims to be informed when their assailant is back in \nthe community.\n  Finally, the bill requires that prosecutors have the same level of \nrepresentation on committees that make court rules as defense attorneys \ndo. This will ensure that fair, balanced rules are enacted, which do \nnot favor criminals over prosecutors.\n\n\n                           domestic violence\n\n  I also strongly believe that swift, sure action must be taken to stop \ndomestic violence, and that penalties must be increased for those who \ncommit this heinous crime.\n  This bill includes a provision to authorize capital punishment, under \nFederal interstate domestic violence offenses, for cases in which the \noffender murders the victim.\n  That's tough punishment for perpetrators who think domestic violence \nis something that goes on behind closed doors, where it's OK for them \nto beat their wives, or girlfriends, or mothers or sisters because it's \ntheir prerogative. Well, Mr. President, domestic violence is no one's \nprerogative and this bill provides tough punishment for criminals who \ndeserve it.\n  This bill also makes two changes in the rules of evidence, to help \nvictims of domestic violence. First, it allows evidence of the \ndefendant's past crimes or wrongful acts against the victim to be \nintroduced, to establish a pattern of abuse.\n  Second, it allows evidence of battered women's syndrome to be \nintroduced, to show why some women are driven to retaliate against \ntheir abusers.\n  Finally, the bill fights those who transmit HIV in sexual assaults, \nby requiring that: sentences be toughened if the offender knew he was \ninfected; upon request of the victim, the offender must be tested for \nHIV before he is released; and follow-up testing be done on sexual \nassailants.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, right now too many women fear for their safety and too \nmany women suffer physically and emotionally from domestic violence.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an \nissue which has important policy implications for the United States as \na world leader in promoting education. With the end of the cold war, \nwe, as a nation, must reexamine how the United States can most \nappropriately provide world leadership in the future. The need for the \nUnited States to continue to provide such leadership is not a serious \ncontention. However, as we debate a foreign policy direction that will \nadvance American interests in a more interdependent world, we should \nbear two important considerations in mind: We must act with budgetary \nresponsibility and we must not assume that government itself is always \nthe best agent to implement our international goals.\n  I believe that private entities, such as educational institutions, \nhave an important role to play in advancing our foreign policy goals. \nAmerican education is recognized throughout the world as one of our \ngreatest national assets, and it can be invaluable in shaping America's \nimage abroad, promoting political and social pluralism, instilling the \nAmerican ideals of tolerance and freedom of expression, expanding \nmarkets for U.S. commodities and products, and encouraging private \ninitiative and economic growth.\n  An American education is prestigious and in high demand in virtually \nevery country. Those receiving such an education frequently rise to \ntheir country's most senior leadership positions in government and in \nthe private sector. As effective instruments to spread American \ninfluence, privately sponsored American educational institutions \nundoubtedly surpass direct U.S. Government programs. Quite modest \nlevels of government assistance can be leveraged by these private \ninstitutions to achieve fundamentally important American goals, and do \nso without costly government bureaucracy.\n  In no part of the world can the contribution of American education to \nUnited States foreign policy be of greater significance than in the \nMiddle East. Fortunately, we are in a strong position to use education \nas a cornerstone of our policy there because of the presence of two \nAmerican educational institutions with which I happen to be personally \nacquainted: The American University of Beirut [AUB] and the Lebanese \nAmerican University [LAU]. The excellent work of these two institutions \ndeserve special attention. Both schools have long proved themselves as \nbeacons of tolerance and rationality in that part of the world. \nFurthermore, in the future, these schools will have an increased \nimportance as the Middle East looks for the institutional structures \nwhich will help the region move from the currently emerging formal \npeace to a more lasting warm peace.\n  Mr. President, as we know, the future of Lebanon, in no small \nmeasure, rests with the talent, intellect, and ingenuity of its people, \nespecially the youth. Educating young Lebanese is essential, therefore, \nto rebuilding the country. LAU and AUB are instrumental in this \nrebuilding. These universities, moreover, promote the use of American-\nmade goods, enhancing international reliance on American goods and \nservices. Students who are educated by using American computers, for \nexample, will rely on American computers when they pursue their \ncareers. Furthermore, these institutions nurture democracy by educating \nsuccessive generations of leaders who are committed to American \ndemocratic values and who understand the tangible economic, political, \nand social benefits that a commitment to democracy producers.\n  These New York State chartered institutions continue to have strong \nAmerican ties and a long tradition of teaching students the value of an \nAmerican education. As a result, their students learn to appreciate \nsuch fundamental American values as tolerance, freedom of thought and \nexpression, and private initiative. Maintaining these attributes is \nextremely important to the people of Lebanon as well as to those in the \nregion of the Middle East.\n  The American University of Beirut and the Lebanese American \nUniversity have nurtured the best American tradition of voluntarism. \nHaving been established by individual citizens motivated by a strong \nconviction, these institutions have had a responsibility to better \nsociety. Such a tradition continues today. I believe it is good policy \nfor us to encourage this spirit of voluntarism and, in the process, \nachieve important United States goals such as helping to rebuild \nLebanon's democracy and promoting regional sustainable development.\n  These educational institutions also help promote American culture and \nvalues amongst the influential decision makers in the Middle East. \nThese universities train students who are then able to communicate, \nshare values, and work with Americans in business, government the \nsciences, and other mutually beneficial endeavors. This has a direct \nimpact on promoting free-market reforms in the countries of the Middle \nEast. Graduates of AUB and LAU appreciate American entrepreneurship and \nmarket-based economies, and from their positions as leaders in both \nprivate firms and public agencies, they guide their countries in this \ndirection. Their familiarity with American culture and products also \nopens opportunities for the United States to develop export markets and \ninvestments in the region.\n  AUB and LAU also are addressing other problems of concern to \nAmericans such as health and environmental issues. They engage in \ninnovative programs of study and research on issues of water quality, \nmigration patterns, desertification and pollution abatement. Both \ninstitutions are leaders in high quality health care in the Middle \nEast, which advances America's concern with global public health.\n  But perhaps the single most important contribution these institutions \nare making to American interests in the region comes in connection with \nthe Middle East Peace process. They have given vital assistance to that \nprocess by creating an intellectual climate that encourages rational \ndialogue, and by educating men and women with the vision and skills to \nachieve conciliation and cooperation. And once a formal peace is \nfinally achieved, AUB and LAU will be in the forefront to encourage a \nwarm peace of meaningful interaction among all parties in the region.\n  The Administration, Mr. President, will soon deal with the difficult \nfunding choices as the budget necessarily begins to decrease. And I \nunderstand that budget realities may dictate assistance to a smaller \nnumber of universities abroad than in the past. However, as decisions \nare being made to allocate funding levels, I strongly urge the \nAdministration to maintain as a high priority continued funding for the \nAmerican University of Beirut and the Lebanese American University. I \nam not alone in this conclusion, as clearly reflected by the language \ncontained in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee \nreports. The Senate report states:\n\n       The Committee continues to strongly support the important \n     work carried out by institutions funded under the American \n     Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) Program. The Committee \n     support is based in part on the effective use of public \n     resources to leverage private sector funds. The Committee \n     believes that several institutions which have received \n     funding under ASHA have distinguished records and deserve \n     further support including: The American University of Beirut \n     which has trained Middle Eastern leaders for 130 years in a \n     strong liberal arts tradition encouraging freedom of \n     expression, private initiative, and tolerance. Its academic \n     quality, longstanding relationship with regional governments, \n     network of prominent alumni and distinction as a hub of high \n     level global expertise make the university a primary resource \n     for regional development. The Lebanese American University \n\n[[Page S18745]]\n     (formerly Beirut College) is the most rapidly growing institution of \n     higher learning in Lebanon and is an increasingly important \n     resource for talent in this expanding region.\n\n  The House report contains similar language.\n\n       The Committee notes that over the years a number of quality \n     educational institutions have received both development and \n     Economic Support Fund assistance, including the American \n     University of Beirut, . . . and the Lebanese American \n     University. The Committee recommends that best efforts be \n     made to continue assistance for institutions of this nature, \n     with the highest priority assigned to those lacking \n     alternative sources of funding.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that continued support of these two \ninstitutions is in the national interest of the United States. As I \nhave stated, continued funding of these institution is a congressional \npriority and I hope that the administration will agree. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18744-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE BENEFITS OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as immigration reform legislation moves \ncloser to the House and Senate floors, a new study has appeared that \nconfirms what many of us on both sides of the aisle have been saying \nall along: That legal immigrants confer net economic benefits on \nAmerican society.\n  The study, entitled ``Immigration: The Demographic and Economic \nFacts,'' is authored by University of Maryland professor Julian Simon \n(no relation) and published by the Cato Institute and the National \nImmigration Forum in association with a diverse coalition of over 20 \norganizations. I would like to include for the Record a Los Angeles \nTimes article from December 11, 1995 previewing the report's findings, \nwhich include the following:\n  The current rate of immigration is only about one-third the rate of \nimmigration at the beginning of the century.\n  Total per capita government expenditures are lower for immigrants \nthan for native-born Americans.\n  The effect of immigration on Americans' wages is limited.\n  Because new immigrants are more concentrated than native-born \nAmericans in the youthful labor force ages, they tend to contribute \nmore to the public coffers than they draw out.\n  Educational levels among immigrants have increased from decade to \ndecade.\n  These conclusions again confirm that current levels of legal \nimmigration are not a problem for America. In fact, the legal \nimmigrants of today demonstrate the same work ethic and imagination \nthat characterized their predecessors of decades ago, and continue to \nbe a vital component of our Nation's well-being.\n  The same cannot be said of illegal immigrants. These individuals \nshould be the subject of our attention as immigration reform \nlegislation winds its way through Congress. This administration has \ndemonstrated an unprecedented commitment to preventing illegal \nimmigration through increased enforcement at the border and in the \nworkplace. We in Congress should continue this effort and work hand in \nhand with the administration in this endeavor. In so doing, however, we \nshould not disturb our system of legal immigration, which works now and \nhas worked in America for centuries.\n  The difference between legal and illegal immigration is the subject \nof much public confusion. It is up to Congress, with the help of such \nreports as the Simon report, to keep the two issues distinct, and to \nfocus its attention on the real immigration problem: illegal \nimmigration.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n             Study Paints a Positive Picture of Immigration\n\n\nCosts: Both legal and illegal immigrants use fewer government resources \n                 than native-born citizens, report says\n\n                         (By James Bornemeier)\n\n       Washington.--A new study on the effects of immigration \n     finds that total per capita government expenditures are much \n     lower for immigrants--legal and illegal--than for native-born \n     citizens.\n       The report also paints an upbeat picture of immigrants' \n     educational achievements and asserts that the nation's \n     natural resources and environment are unaffected by the \n     influx of immigrants.\n       ``As of the 1970s, immigrants contributed more to the \n     public coffers in taxes than they drew out in welfare \n     services,'' the report says. ``The most recent data * * * \n     show that each year an average immigrant family put about \n     $2,500 into the pockets of natives from this excess of taxes \n     over public costs.''\n       The study, to be issued this morning in Washington by the \n     National Immigration Forum, an immigration-advocacy group, \n     and the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, comes at a \n     time when Congress is wrestling with major immigration bills \n     and public opinion is increasingly negative on immigration \n     issues.\n       Legislation is progressing in both houses of Congress to \n     clamp down on illegal immigration and--to the dismay of many \n     immigration advocates--restrict entry of legal immigrants as \n     well.\n       The issue has split Republicans, some of whom see the free \n     flow of legal immigrants as an economic boon to the country. \n     Immigrant-rights groups say the political activism to stem \n     illegal immigration has unfairly led to the limitations on \n     legal immigrants.\n       But groups pushing for stronger restrictions on immigration \n     branded the report, authored by University of Maryland \n     professor Julian L. Simon, as biased.\n       ``Julian Simon is not a liar,'' said Dan Stein, executive \n     director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, \n     ``but he gets as close as anyone can be to one. He is \n     intentionally deceptive, manipulative and grossly in error.'' \n     Signifying the sensitivity of the issue, more than 20 \n     interest groups and think tanks have signed on to the report, \n     and they span the political spectrum--from the immigrant-\n     rights group, the National Council of La Raza, to the \n     Progress and Freedom Foundation, an organization closely \n     associated with House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n       House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a strong supporter of \n     legal immigration, is scheduled to address the Capitol press \n     conference where the report is to be released today.\n       Among the report's most controversial findings is Simon's \n     conclusion that government expenditures are lower for \n     immigrants than for native-born Americans.\n       According to the report, the average immigrant family \n     received $1,404 in welfare services in its first five years \n     in the country. Native-born families averaged $2,279, Simon \n     writes. The report makes these other points:\n       The number of illegal immigrants in the United States--\n     estimated at 3.2 million--is not very different from a decade \n     before.\n       More than half of illegal immigrants enter legally and \n     over-stay their visas; less than half enter clandestinely.\n       New immigrants are more concentrated than native-born \n     citizens in the youthful labor force ages when people \n     contribute more to the public coffers than they draw out.\n       Immigrants on average have a year less education than \n     natives--about the same relationship as has been observed \n     back to the 19th century.\n       Such optimistic findings collide with the views of other \n     researchers.\n       ``His numbers are conventional and unremarkable,'' said \n     Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies in \n     Washington, ``The question is what sort of spin Julian puts \n     on them. He has his bias, and the bias has a very significant \n     influence on the interpretation he has put on the facts.''\n       As an example, Simon says the number of immigrant high \n     school dropouts has been declining. For example, Krikorian \n     said, Simon reports that the number of immigrant high school \n     dropouts has been declining.\n       ``But what he doesn't mention,'' said Krikorian, ``is the \n     gap between the percentage of American high school dropouts \n     and the percentage of immigrant high school dropouts is \n     widening. It's pretty obvious that the education gap is \n     increasing. By not addressing [that] he makes his document an \n     advocacy document.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18745-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18745-S18746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATTY CALLAGHAN\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish today to give tribute to one \nof Eastern Montanan's treasures, Patty Callaghan. Patty recently \nretired after 20 years with Action for Eastern Montana.\n  Patty retired as executive director to attend Luther Seminary in St. \nPaul MN. She hopes to return to eastern Montana as a lay leader with \nrural churches.\n  Montana needs more leaders like Patty Callaghan. Rural Montana needs \nthe love for and knowledge of our state that people like Patty have.\n  Patty's work with action actually led to here decision to choose the \nseminary. When funding cutbacks in the programs that she administers \nforced her to look to other resources, Patty found the churches \nresponding generously. She found the needs of rural communities to be \nmuch the same as the congregations--energy, leadership for change, \naccountability, respect and compassion.\n  Patty has dealt with many family issues that will serve her will in \nher new life. She found the work at Action for Eastern Montana \nrewarding and the Glendive community generous when a need was \nidentified.\n  In a recent tribute to Patty, family members, coworkers, friends and \nmany \n\n[[Page S18746]]\nothers including Montana's Governor Marc Racicot expressed their \nrespect and appreciation for her life's work.\n  I would also like to express my profound respect and admiration for \nPatty Callaghan and what she has done for eastern Montana. Public \nservice can bring out the best and worst in people. With Patty, her \ncompassion and caring has only deepened. Eastern Montana desperately \nneeds this commitment to its communities.\n  Thank you, Patty.

Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to an editorial in the November 17, 1995, issue of USA Today, \ncalled Hate Speech on the Net.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, college campuses have been at the \ncenter of the debate over hate speech. Several universities have \nestablished restrictive rules on speech and have punished students with \nprobation or even dismissal. These rules, while certainly established \nwith the best intentions, do raise serious issues of free speech.\n  As Americans, we are allowed to say what we want, as long as it does \nnot threaten public safety, no matter how much it may offend others. \nVoltaire is credited with saying, ``I disagree with what you say but I \nam ready to fight to the death to preserve your right to say it.'' I \nwould like to add: and then I will speak out against what you have \nsaid. As this editorial points out, a recent episode at Cornell \nUniversity illustrates that a better response to hate speech is often \nan eloquent reply.\n  I ask that the full text of the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Nov. 17, 1995]\n\n                         Hate Speech on the Net\n\n       A tasteless but not harmless college prank got the national \n     attention it deserved this week when four Cornell freshmen \n     made the mistake of sharing their raunchy degradation of \n     women via the Internet.\n       The four sent an e-mail message listing ``75 reasons why \n     women (bitches) should not have freedom of speech.'' After \n     the message was spread--and attacked--they expressed ``deep \n     remorse.'' In an apology published in the campus newspaper, \n     they insisted they didn't mean any of the things they wrote.\n       Please.\n       If they didn't mean to trash women, why was their list so \n     demeaning, degrading and threatening? If they meant to share \n     this list with just a few of their buddies, why did they send \n     it on the Internet, where so many other students pulled up \n     the list that at least one school's computer system crashed?\n       Their juvenile attempts at humor included such sexist slaps \n     as: ``Big breasts speak for themselves.'' ``Female drunks are \n     annoying unless they put out.'' ``If she can't speak, she \n     can't cry rape.'' Other suggestions were simply too vulgar to \n     repeat.\n       Freshmen with the brains to get into a prestigious Ivy \n     League college should have known this list was not harmless \n     fun.\n       Cornell acknowledged this episode ``offended, angered and \n     distressed.'' But its judicial administrator concluded \n     Thursday that the students did not violate the college's code \n     of conduct.\n       That judgment will further infuriate those outraged by this \n     sexist attack. But this sorry tale takes a turn for the \n     better.\n       As the students' bad taste became public, the e-mail \n     response was so loud and large that it brought a prompt \n     response from the university\n       The students now have ``offered'' to attend gender-\n     sensitivity training, perform community service and apologize \n     in person to senior Cornell administrators.\n       Had the students been denied the right to make their sexist \n     views public, those views might have gone unchallenged and \n     unchanged. All of which shows again that the best remedy for \n     offensive speech is not a restrictive rule but an eloquent \n     reply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18746-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MS.

Mr. President, Richard Roeper, who is a regular columnist \nwith the Chicago Sun-Times, recently had a column headed, ``Computer \nBettors Can Be Virtually Sure of Losing,'' which I ask to be printed in \nthe Record in full after my remarks.\n  It is not simply an editorial column with that conclusion. Mr. Roeper \ngoes into the specifics of what happened to him when he placed bets.\n  Some people wonder why we should have a commission to look at the \nwhole phenomenon of legalized gambling in the United States.\n  It is spreading rapidly, and I don't know what we do about the \nphenomenon of computers and gambling, just as one example.\n  The column follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Dec. 10, 1995]\n\n            Computer Bettors Can Be Virtually Sure of Losing\n\n                          (By Richard Roeper)\n\n       ``The technology will allow people to bet on anything they \n     choose to, and if it's legal, someone is sure to set up a \n     service.''--Bill Gates, discussing the potential for gambling \n     on the Internet in The Road Ahead.\n       Sooner rather than later, you're probably going to be able \n     to sit at a computer in your home office and lose everything \n     you own, including the computer you're sitting at in your \n     home office.\n       Such are the perils of gambling and the wonders of \n     technology.\n       Lately there's been a lot of talk about setting up \n     ``virtual casinos'' on the information highway--onscreen \n     gambling emporiums that will be constructed on computer \n     networks so that you won't have to fly to Las Vegas or even \n     drive out to Aurora to play craps or roulette or poker. All \n     you'll have to do is log on, enter an access code, provide a \n     credit card number and bingo!\n       Bingo. They'll probably have that, too.\n       If you win, you'll receive electronic credits. If you lose, \n     you'll be charged on your next Visa or American Express \n     statement.\n       This is a frightening concept. As it is, real casinos are \n     designed to provide a cushion between you and reality. The \n     absence of clocks, the lack of windows, the waitresses \n     providing you with complementary drinks, the conversion of \n     hundred-dollar bills into toyish black chips that you flick \n     around like bottle caps--all are tools to make it easier to \n     separate you from your money.\n       And it works. Those huge, tacky, gleaming, zillion-dollar \n     palaces in Las Vegas are owned by the folks who are taking \n     the bets, not the folks who are making the bets. They build \n     the 5,000-room hotels and the cages for the white tigers and \n     the pirate ships and the fake pyramids with your money.\n       Still, at least when you bet with chips, you're vaguely \n     aware that they represent real money. Watching a stack of \n     those chips shrink can be a painful experience; you can see \n     and feel some proof of the fact that you're losing.\n       Others around you, including the employees of the casino \n     and your fellow gamblers, also provide some stimuli. But if \n     you're alone at a keyboard, there's no human element, nobody \n     to cluck in sympathy when you lose, or slide some chips your \n     way when you win. There's no sense that you're truly risking \n     your money. So it will be ridiculously, tragically easy for \n     the gambler to log on and lose a huge chunk of money in a \n     single session online.\n       I put this theory to the test by playing a three-day round \n     of blackjack on my personal computer and keeping a record of \n     my ``wins'' and ``losses.''\n       The game on my Windows '95 program is called ``Dr. \n     Blackjack.'' Little boxes at the top of the screen keep track \n     of wins and losses for each session, as well as a running \n     tally for a player.\n       Monday, 8:43 a.m. I set the computer for $50 wagers and \n     tell the electronic dealer to deal--and our respective cards \n     appear on the screen almost instantly. With a click of the \n     mouse, I can then decide to stay, hit, split, double down, \n     even buy insurance against a dealer blackjack. As soon as I \n     make my decision, the computer plays out the dealer's hand in \n     literally the blink of an eye, much faster than the slickest \n     human dealer.\n       By 9 a.m. I'm up $450, each winning hand accompanied by an \n     electronic deedle-deedle-dee! of joy, each losing hand \n     stomped on by a sharp buzzer.\n       After two hours I'm at the $500 mark in winnings. A nice \n     round number, so I sign off. Don't have a stack of chips to \n     pocket, don't have a dealer to tip.\n       Monday, 4:47 p.m. My plus-$500 total is waiting for me when \n     I sign on. I'm playing with the casino's money, so I up my \n     wager amount to $100 per hand.\n       Monday, 5:03 p.m. Down $2,300. That is not a misprint. \n     During one stretch I lost nine hands in a row. A note appears \n     on my screen, telling me I've lost too much in one sitting \n     and should take a break.\n     \n[[Page S18747]]\n\n       Somehow I think the virtual casinos of the future won't \n     have that feature.\n       Monday, 11 p.m. I know I should stay away from the table, \n     but what the heck, I'm here to gamble, right? I'm down \n     $2,300, so it seems unwise to play for only $100 a hand; I'll \n     never get my money back. So I increase my wager to $200.\n       Boom Boom Boom Boom, four winning hands in a row, including \n     a blackjack, and I'm down only $1,400 now, We're rolling.\n       Tuesday, 12:35 a.m. It's been a long, hard struggle, but \n     I'm exactly even for the day. Of course, so is everyone else \n     who hasn't played a single hand of blackjack, and they didn't \n     spend four hours sitting at a computer terminal.\n       Tuesday, 12:39 a.m. Down $800. Should have quit while I was \n     even.\n       Tuesday, 6:30 a.m. Now betting $300 per hand. Occasionally, \n     when I make the incorrect decision, an electronic ``cheat \n     sheet'' appears on the screen and I'm asked if I'm sure this \n     is the move I want to make. What they're really saying is, \n     ``Split those 8's, bonehead.''\n       Again I doubt this feature will exist when you're playing \n     for real money. And though I know it's for my benefit, it \n     gets annoying, and sometimes I stubbornly refuse to follow \n     the suggested strategy. I always lose those hands.\n       Tuesday, 8 a.m. Had a good run. I'm up $1,600. Time for a \n     break.\n       Tuesday, 6:05 p.m. What the heck, I won money this \n     afternoon and I'm winning money now and I'm ``going home'' \n     after tomorrow's session, so why not increase the bets to my \n     limit, $500?\n       Tuesday 6:30 p.m. Doubled down with an 11 and drew a 10. \n     The dealer had a 17. That's a $1,000 win on a single hand. \n     I'm now up $4,850.\n       Tuesday, 8:15 p.m. The computer is saying I've won too much \n     and a graphic appears that accuses me of counting cards! I'm \n     forced to sign off for the night. Up six grand and change.\n       Wednesday, 7 a.m. In just a few minutes I've raised my \n     winnings to $11,350. If I could press a button that would \n     turn those numbers into real money, would I do it? Doubtful. \n     Why stop when you're hot?\n       Wednesday, 8:50 p.m. Hovering at the $11,000 mark. Had a \n     great daytime session and I'm ready for more.\n       Wednesday, 10:30 p.m. I'm looking at the figures on the \n     screen but I don't believe it. How can I be down $11,000? If \n     I hear that loser-buzzer one more time I'm going to smash \n     this keyboard. I want to increase my limit, but I can't. Five \n     hundred is the maximum.\n       Wednesday, 11 p.m. All right, a comeback. I'm down only \n     $7,750. One hour left before my self-imposed midnight \n     deadline.\n       Midnight. That's it, time is up. For the three days, I \n     ``lost'' $1,750--and I'm happy with that. I consider that a \n     real triumph.\n       Which is pretty sick when you think about it.\n       Sure, this was only a simulation. I'm sure I'd have better \n     self-control with real money, even at a virtual casino. But \n     it was scary enough watching those numbers change so quickly, \n     even though I knew they didn't mean anything.\n       If virtual casinos ever became a reality, it'll be the \n     people on the other side of the computers who will be \n     smiling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/15/senate-section/article/S18746-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18747-S18771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOREIGN RELATIONS REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  The text of the bill H.R. 1561, as passed by the Senate on December \n14, 1995, is as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 1561) entitled ``An Act to consolidate the foreign \n     affairs agencies of the United States; to authorize \n     appropriations for the Department of State and related \n     agencies for fiscal years 1996 and 1997; to responsibily \n     reduce the authorizations of appropriations for United States \n     foreign assistance programs for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, \n     and for other purposes'', do pass with the following \n     amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPORT ON OCCUPIED TIBET.\n\n       (a) Findings and Declarations of Congress.--The Congress \n     makes the following findings and declarations:\n       (1) Historically, Tibet has demonstrated those attributes \n     which under international law constitute statehood. It has \n     had a defined territory and a permanent population, been \n     under the control of its own government, and has engaged in, \n     or had the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other \n     states.\n       (2) Between 1951 and 1959, Tibet was forcibly and \n     coercively incorporated into the People's Republic of China \n     as an ``autonomous region''.\n       (3) Because Tibet's incorporation into the People's \n     Republic of China was involuntary, under international law it \n     is an occupied sovereign country and its true representatives \n     continue to be the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in \n     exile.\n       (4) Because the Tibetan people are historically, \n     territorially, and culturally distinct from the Han Chinese \n     population in the People's Republic of China, and because of \n     the involuntary loss of their sovereignty, they are entitled \n     to the right of self-determination.\n       (5) Credible evidence exists which demonstrates that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently \n     denied the Tibetan people that right, and instead have \n     subjected them to a serious pattern of human rights abuses. \n     For example, in 1960 the International Commission of Jurists \n     found that the Chinese authorities in Tibet had violated \n     sixteen articles of the United Nations Human Rights \n     Declaration.\n       (6) The United States should seek to establish a dialogue \n     with those recognized by Congress as the true representatives \n     of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, his representatives, \n     and the Tibetan Government in exile, concerning the situation \n     in Tibet and the future of the Tibetan people and to expand \n     and strengthen United States-Tibet cultural and educational \n     relations, including promoting bilateral exchanges arranged \n     directly with the Tibetan Government in exile.\n       (b) Report on United States-Tibet Relations.-- Not later \n     than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     every 12 months thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     transmit to the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a \n     report on the state of relations between the United States \n     and those recognized by Congress as the true representatives \n     of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, his representatives, \n     and the Tibetan Government in exile, and on conditions in \n     Tibet.\n       (c) Separate Tibet Reports.--\n       (1) It is the sense of the Congress that whenever an \n     executive branch report is transmitted to the Congress on a \n     country-by-country basis there should be included in such \n     report, where applicable, a separate report on Tibet listed \n     alphabetically with its own state heading.\n       (2) The reports referred to in paragraph (1) include, but \n     are not limited to, reports transmitted under sections 116(d) \n     and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating \n     to human rights).\n\n     SEC. 608. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR TIBET ACT OF 1995.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Special Envoy for Tibet Act of 1995''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     withholds meaningful participation in the governance of Tibet \n     from Tibetans and has failed to abide by its own \n     constitutional guarantee of autonomy for Tibetans;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China is \n     responsible for the destruction of much of Tibet's cultural \n     and religious heritage since 1959 and continues to threaten \n     the survival of Tibetan culture and religion;\n       (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     through direct and indirect incentives--\n       (A) has established discriminatory development and other \n     programs which have resulted in an overwhelming flow of \n     Chinese immigrants into Tibet, including those areas \n     incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, \n     Gansu, and Qinghai; and\n       (B) has excluded Tibetans from participation in important \n     policy decisions, further threatening traditional Tibetan \n     life;\n       (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China denies \n     Tibetans their fundamental human rights, as reported in the \n     Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices for 1993;\n       (5) the President and the Congress have determined that the \n     promotion of human rights in Tibet and the protection of \n     Tibet's religion and culture are important elements in United \n     States-China relations and have urged senior members of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to enter into \n     substantive negotiations on these matters with the Dalai Lama \n     or his representative; and\n       (6) the Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to respond in a good faith manner by reciprocating a \n     willingness to begin negotiations without preconditions, and \n     no substantive negotiations have begun.\n       (c) Position of United States Special Envoy for Tibet.--\n       (1) Establishment of position.--There shall be within the \n     Department of State a United States Special Envoy for Tibet, \n     who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate. The United States Special \n     Envoy for Tibet shall hold office at the pleasure of the \n     President.\n       (2) Rank of ambassador.--The United States Special Envoy \n     for Tibet shall have the personal rank of ambassador.\n       (d) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) Authorities.--The United States Special Envoy for Tibet \n     is authorized and encouraged--\n       (A) to promote substantive negotiations between the Dalai \n     Lama or his representatives and senior members of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China;\n       (B) to promote good relations between the Dalai Lama and \n     his representatives and the United States Government, \n     including meeting with members or representatives of the \n     Tibetan Government in exile; and\n       (C) to travel regularly throughout Tibet and Tibetan \n     refugee settlements.\n       (2) Duties.--The United States Special Envoy for Tibet \n     shall--\n       (A) consult with the Congress on policies relevant to Tibet \n     and the future and welfare of all Tibetan people;\n       (B) coordinate United States Government policies, programs, \n     and projects concerning Tibet; and\n       (C) report to the Secretary of State regarding the matters \n     described in section 536(a)(2) of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law \n     103-236).\n\n     SEC. 609.

MIDDLE EAST PEACE FACILITATION ACT OF 1995.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Middle \n     East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palestine Liberation Organization (in this section \n     referred to as the ``PLO'') has recognized the State of \n     Israel's right to exist in peace and security; accepted \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; \n     committed itself to the peace process and peaceful \n     coexistence with Israel, free from violence and all other \n     acts which endanger peace and stability; and assumed \n     responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order \n     to assure their compliance, prevent violations, and \n     discipline violators;\n       (2) Israel has recognized the PLO as the representative of \n     the Palestinian people;\n       (3) Israel and the PLO signed a Declaration of Principles \n     on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Declaration of Principles'') on \n     September 13, 1993, at the White House;\n       (4) Israel and the PLO signed an Agreement on the Gaza \n     Strip and the Jericho Area (in this section referred to as \n     the ``Gaza-Jericho Agreement'') on May 4, 1994, which \n     established a Palestinian Authority for the Gaza and Jericho \n     areas;\n       (5) Israel and the PLO signed an Agreement on Preparatory \n     Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Early Empowerment Agreement'') on August \n     29, 1994, which provided for the transfer to the Palestinian \n     Authority of certain powers and responsibilities in the West \n     Bank outside of the Jericho Area;\n       (6) under the terms of the Declaration of Principles, the \n     Gaza-Jericho Agreement and the Early Empowerment Agreement, \n     the powers and responsibilities of the Palestinian Authority \n     are to be assumed by an elected Palestinian Council with \n     jurisdiction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in accordance \n     with the Interim Agreement to be concluded between Israel and \n     the PLO;\n       (7) permanent status negotiations relating to the West Bank \n     and Gaza Strip are scheduled to begin by May 1996;\n       (8) the Congress has, since the conclusion of the \n     Declaration of Principles and the PLO's renunciation of \n     terrorism, provided authorities to the President to suspend \n     certain statutory restrictions relating to the PLO, subject \n     to Presidential certifications that the PLO has continued to \n     abide by commitments made in and in connection with or \n     resulting from the good faith implementation of, the \n     Declaration of Principles;\n       (9) the PLO commitments relevant to Presidential \n     certifications have included commitments to renounce and \n     condemn terrorism, to submit to the Palestinian National \n     Council for formal approval the necessary changes to those \n     articles of the Palestinian Covenant which call for Israel's \n     destruction, and to prevent acts of terrorism and hostilities \n     against Israel;

The President may not exercise that \n     authority to make such certification until 30 days after a \n     written policy justification is submitted to the relevant \n     congressional committees.\n       (B) Presidential certification.--The President may exercise \n     the authority provided in paragraph (1) only if the President \n     certifies to the relevant congressional committees each time \n     he exercises such authority that--\n       (i) it is in the national interest of the United States to \n     exercise such authority;\n       (ii) the PLO continues to comply with all the commitments \n     described in subparagraph (D); and\n       (iii) funds provided pursuant to the exercise of this \n     authority and the authorities under section 583(a) of Public \n     Law 103-236 and section 3(a) of Public Law 103-125 have been \n     used for the purposes for which they were intended.\n       (C) Requirement for continuing plo compliance.--\n       (i) The President shall ensure that PLO performance is \n     continuously monitored, and if the President at any time \n     determines that the PLO has not continued to comply with all \n     the commitments described in subparagraph (D), he shall so \n     notify the appropriate congressional committees. Any \n     suspension under paragraph (1) of a provision of law \n     specified in paragraph (4) shall cease to be effective.\n       (ii) Beginning six months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, if the President on the basis of the continuous \n     monitoring of the PLO's performance determines that the PLO \n     is not complying with the requirements described in paragraph \n     (3), he shall so notify the appropriate congressional \n     committees and no assistance shall be provided pursuant to \n     the exercise by the President of the authority provided by \n     paragraph (1) until such time as the President makes the \n     certification provided for in paragraph (3).\n       (D) PLO commitments described.--The commitments referred to \n     in subparagraphs (B) and (C)(i) are the commitments made by \n     the PLO--\n       (i) in its letter of September 9, 1993, to the Prime \n     Minister of Israel and in its letter of September 9, 1993, to \n     the Foreign Minister of Norway to--\n\n       (I) recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist in \n     peace and security;\n       (II) accept United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 \n     and 338;\n       (III) renounce the use of terrorism and other acts of \n     violence;\n       (IV) assume responsibility over all PLO elements and \n     personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent \n     violations, and discipline violators;\n       (V) call upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and \n     Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the \n     normalization of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, and \n     contributing to peace and stability; and\n       (VI) submit to the Palestine National Council for formal \n     approval the necessary changes to the Palestinian National \n     Covenant eliminating calls for Israel's destruction; and\n\n       (ii) in, and resulting from, the good faith implementation \n     of the Declaration of Principles, including good faith \n     implementation of subsequent agreements with Israel, with \n     particular attention to the objective of preventing \n     terrorism, as reflected in the provisions of the Gaza-Jericho \n     Agreement concerning--\n\n       (I) prevention of acts of terrorism and legal measures \n     against terrorists;\n       (II) abstention from and prevention of incitement, \n     including hostile propaganda;\n       (III) operation of armed forces other than the Palestinian \n     Police;\n       (IV) possession, manufacture, sale, acquisition, or \n     importation of weapons;\n       (V) employment of police who have been convicted of serious \n     crimes or have been found to be actively involved in \n     terrorist activities subsequent to their employment;\n       (VI) transfers to Israel of individuals suspected of, \n     charged with, or convicted of an offense that falls within \n     Israeli criminal jurisdiction;\n       (VII) cooperation with the Government of Israel in criminal \n     matters, including cooperation in the conduct of \n     investigations;

The committee shall make its recommendations to the \n     House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, \n     within 30 calendar days following the date of such \n     resolution's introduction.\n       (d) Motion to Discharge Committee Considering Resolution.--\n     (1) If the committee to which is referred a resolution \n     introduced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (c) has \n     not reported such resolution at the end of 30 calendar days \n     of continuous session of Congress after its introduction, it \n     shall be in order to move either to discharge the committee \n     from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge \n     the committee from further consideration of any other \n     resolution introduced with respect to the same plan which has \n     been referred to the committee, except that no motion to \n     discharge shall be in order after the committee has reported \n     a resolution with respect to the same plan.\n       (2) A motion to discharge under paragraph (1) may be made \n     only by a Senator favoring the resolution, is privileged, and \n     debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to \n     be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing \n     the resolution, the time to be divided equally \n\n[[Page S18769]]\n     between, and controlled by, the majority leader and the minority leader \n     or their designees.

A motion further to limit debate is in order \n     and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to \n     postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business, or a motion to recommit the resolution is \n     not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     resolution is passed or rejected shall not be in order.\n       (3) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on \n     the resolution with respect to a reorganization plan, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall \n     occur.\n       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n     application of the rules of the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure \n     relating to a resolution with respect to a reorganization \n     plan shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) If, prior to the passage by one House of a resolution \n     of that House, that House receives a resolution with respect \n     to the same reorganization plan from the other House, then--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (f) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives on \n     Reorganization Plans.--Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of \n     this section are enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n     respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n     procedure to be followed in that House in the case of \n     resolutions with respect to any reorganization plans \n     transmitted to Congress in accordance with section 1501, \n     1603, 1604, or 1605, or any other plan transmitted by the \n     President to Congress having the effect of revising such a \n     plan, and they supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 1609.

I thank the majority leader. It has been a very difficult \nday. It is very late. I will not go on at length.\n  I just feel we are fortunate here, as Members of the U.S. Senate, \neven though we are working very long and hard, and it is very \nstressful, at least we know we are going to get our paycheck. But, \nunfortunately there are those very hard-working families tonight who \nreally do not know if they will get their paychecks. About 350,000 \nfamilies are adversely impacted because tonight the Congress was not \nable to pass a continuing resolution to send a signal to the entire \ncountry that we can keep this Government operating.\n  I do not want it to be lost, as we end here this evening. I do not \nwant the people out there to think that they are forgotten. I also do \nnot want people to think that who are veterans who will not get their \nservices, perhaps, as readily as they should come Monday, or people who \nneed passports, or people who want to go to our parks. We certainly \nknow tomorrow they will be inconvenienced for no good reason.\n  It may well be that Democrats and Republicans cannot come together on \na long-term, 7-year balanced budget. It may be that we will never be \nable to do that. I, for one, hope that we can and think that we can. I, \nfor one, believe there are a few key areas where we could come together \nand get that balanced budget.\n  But surely we could come together to keep this Government operational \nfor another week? I do not know what is happening here, but it seems to \nme, with all the anger I have seen on the Senate floor, we ought to put \nthat aside for 10 minutes and pass a clean continuing resolution as our \nDemocratic leader recommended. Yes, we have those outstanding debates. \nYes, we will have to discuss them and resolve them. But we can keep \nthis Government going instead of acting like little children who do not \nget their way and marching outside of the room and objecting when there \nis a very simple, straightforward suggestion that we can keep things \ngoing until--even Monday or Tuesday.\n  But, no, we are not going to do that. So, constituents of mine and \nothers across this country who work for the Federal Government, like \nKen Takada, a veterans claim examiner in Los Angeles are very \nconcerned. He is not independently wealthy. He lives from paycheck to \npaycheck like most of us in America do. He could default on his student \nloans if he misses a paycheck. The day the Government shuts down, Ken \nhas told us, he is going to have to go to the unemployment office and \napply for benefits to keep his life going. He does not want to be on \nunemployment. He wants to work. And the veterans of southern \nCalifornia, who depend on him to handle their cases, want him to be at \nhis post at the Federal building in Los Angeles.\n  Then there is Larry Drake and his wife, Joan. Larry works for the \nBureau of Labor Statistics and Joan works at the Public Health \nServices. If the Government shuts down, both will be furloughed. Their \nfamily will loose 100 percent of its income. We do not know if they \nwill get their back pay; perhaps they might, perhaps they might not. \nBut what kind of way is that for us to act? We have a responsibility to \nthe workers and to those that they serve. All we had to do is say \n``aye'' to the Democratic leader when he said, ``Put aside our \nproblems. Let us keep the Government going at least until next week.'' \nSimple, straightforward, easy thing to do.\n  But, no, we cannot get it done.\n  I heard the majority leader over in the House, Mr. Armey, \nRepresentative Armey from Texas, who is the Republican majority leader \nover there, say, ``Well, we didn't get a good enough budget from the \nPresident. We got a meager budget. Therefore we are not going to send \nover a clean debt extension.'' That is a little bit like a guard in a \nprison camp. ``You haven't behaved. We are not going to give you your \nbread and water.''\n  The fact is, these appropriations bills have not been done and there \nis a very easy way to handle it. Wrap them in a continuing resolution. \nBut, oh, no. The Republican leaders over in the House--and presumably \nwe went along with it on this side, I am sad to say--they did not like \nwhat they got so they are not sending over a clean extension.\n  I would assume if the House did it, the Senate would have gone along.\n  Well, if we furlough Larry Drake and his wife Joan, what are they \ngoing to do? A two-income family and they are going to lose their \nincome, either temporarily or for a longer time.\n  Then there is Ray Montgomery who works for the Census Bureau in Los \nAngeles. He is classified, even though he works for 40 hours a week, as \nan intermittent employee, so he will not get his back pay at all.\n  Ray told my office he is so worried about a second shutdown that he \nhas not yet bought any Christmas presents for his family, and if the \nGovernment shuts down there will not be any presents at all. And Ray \nwrote to me, ``For Heavens sakes, I am one paycheck away from being \nhomeless. I work hard to be a credit to my country. I try to be a good \nrepresentative of Government employees to the American people.''\n  I just think it is a shameless situation. It is not necessary that we \nshut this Government down. We have a legitimate disagreement over how \nto balance the budget in 7 years. That is legitimate. It is a big \nproblem. I am on the Budget Committee. I voted for two balanced \nbudgets, one by Bill Bradley, one by Kent Conrad. I am proud to have \ndone it because it got to a balanced budget without hurting Medicare, \nMedicaid, without giving these outrageous tax breaks to the wealthiest \nwho do not need them right now. For God sakes, put off the tax breaks \nuntil we have really balanced the budget. This is a phantom \ncelebration. Give a tax break to the wealthy. People who earn $350,000 \na year are going to get back almost $8,500 a year.\n  I mean really, while we cut Medicare and Medicaid and education and \nthe environment and veterans, cops on the beat? Where are our values?\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, Senator Grams is a very effective \nspeaker. He says, when we say, on our side of the aisle, ``Where are \nour values?'' that the only value that is important--and I am \nparaphrasing him--is to balance the budget.\n  It is certainly important to balance the budget. Do you know the last \ntime we had a surplus in this country was under Lyndon Johnson? Do you \nknow the first President to get the deficit down 3 years in a row? \nGuess. Bill Clinton--the first one. George Bush and Ronald Reagan added \nmore to the debt than all the Presidents from George Washington to \nJimmy Carter. So Democratic Presidents take a back seat to no one in \nfiscal responsibility--no one. We are the ones who have a better \nrecord.\n  I have to say, there is a lot of anger on this floor. There is anger \ntoward the \n\n[[Page S18773]]\nPresident. I have not seen such anger. I serve on that special \ncommittee that is looking into the Whitewater. The Presiding Officer \nand I sit there. God, there is anger toward that President. And the \nPresident does say he wants a balanced budget that is consistent with \nour values.\n  What are those values? I will not take too long to go into them \nbecause I know the hour is late. Respect for our elderly--pretty \nimportant value. I learned that as a child. So why would you sock it to \nMedicare and Medicaid and people in nursing homes, if you believe that \nwe should respect our elderly? And give a tax break to the very wealthy \nwho do not need it?\n  How about respect for our children? But, no, we are going to have \nthousands of fewer kids in Head Start, thousands of fewer kids getting \nspecial reading attention, cuts in education. Do you want to hear more? \nRespect for our environmental heritage. Respect for our environmental \nheritage. Respect for our environment--not only passing laws that say \nwe will have clean air and clean water but actually enforcing those \nlaws.\n  The Republican budget does not have respect for the elderly or the \nchildren or the environment and many other areas because they are so \nrespectful of the rich and powerful that they will give them a huge tax \nbreak and therefore have to cut into these other programs.\n  Do the people want a balanced budget? You bet. You bet. But they want \nit to be fair. That is a value, too. Fairness is a value. In their \nbudget they raise taxes on people earning less than $10,000 a year. \nWhere is the value there for fairness? And they are mad at the \nPresident because he will not go along with it, and he has the guts to \nstand up and say it. And they do not like it. And they keep saying, \n``Gee, the President doesn't stand for anything.'' But now that he does \nthey do not like what he stands for. They want it all ways.\n  And then they say, ``Well, the President signed a commitment, a \ncommitment to balance the budget in 7 years with CBO estimates.'' They \nleft out a few things, however. In the agreement that CBO would check \nwith the other experts, the blue chip indicators, the OMB indicators, \nand consider those. It is an important point. He did not just say, yes, \nwhatever CBO says. The CBO has to check with these others. He also \nsigned on to the fact that we will all protect certain priorities. They \nare listed in that document: Medicaid, Medicare, education, the \nenvironment.\n  So, yes, we all want a balanced budget. And we know that we can get \nthere in a fair way. But we are not going to be blackmailed into it. \nAnd I honestly think that some of the Republican leaders over in the \nHouse think that because they are threatening a government shutdown we \nare going to say, OK, we give up. Cut Medicare, Medicaid. We do not \nreally mean what we say. We do not care about tax breaks to the \nwealthy. All of this was just talk. Just keep the Government. We will \ngive up.\n  It is not going to happen. So we come down to this very unhappy \nmoment in the Senate, angry words, angry feelings, dispirited people \nall over the place. It is about a very important issue: What are our \nvalues? What do we value as a people?\n  So, Mr. President, thank you for this time that I have had to express \nmyself this evening. My heart goes out to those Federal employees who \ndo not know if they will have a happy Christmas.
