Fill this day with serendipities, unusual \nhappenings in usual circumstances. Surprise us again with the amazing \nway You can untangle the knotted threads of process and weave Your \nthoughts from many minds into answers we could not achieve without each \nother and most of all, without You.

The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4) to restore the American family, reduce \n     illegitimacy, control welfare spending, and reduce welfare \n     dependence.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole modified amendment No. 2280, of a perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are not under \ncontrolled time. I believe the Senator from Delaware is prepared to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dole, Senator \nPackwood, and my other colleagues in introducing this comprehensive \nwelfare reform legislation, S. 1120, America's Work and Family \nOpportunities Act of 1995.\n  The American people know our welfare system is fatally flawed. The \npresent welfare system is not serving the best interests of either the \nbeneficiaries or the taxpayers. S. 1120 is a bold initiative that will \nhelp prevent even more Americans from falling into the trap of \ndependency.\n  Mr. President, in 1965, the average monthly number of children \nreceiving aid to families with dependent children was 3.3 million; in \n1992, there were 9.3 million children receiving AFDC benefits. While \nthe number of children receiving AFDC increased nearly threefold \nbetween 1965 and 1992, the total \n\n[[Page S 11804]]\nnumber of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by \n5.5 percent.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12 \nmillion children will receive AFDC benefits within 10 years. To do \nnothing to prevent this growing tragedy is unacceptable.\n  Congress has created a confused and confusing welfare system which \nrewards idleness and punishes work. At a recent hearing I chaired on \nwelfare reform, former South Carolina Governor, Carroll Campbell, \ntestified that his office found a family in which four generations were \ndependent upon the welfare system in which no one had worked. That is a \nsystem which does not protect children. That is a system which is cruel \nand heartless.\n  Properly understood, welfare reform is about reforming government. \nUnder our present system, no one is accountable for results. One of the \nbasic flaws in the system is that there is always someone else to blame \nfor failure.\n  More than 90 Federal programs administered by 11 separate Federal \nagencies provide education, child care, and other services to young \nchildren from low-income families. The Department of Agriculture \nadministers 14 food assistance programs for low-income individuals. Yet \nthe Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Health and Human \nServices also run separate food programs. There are 163 Federal \nprograms scattered across 15 Federal agencies providing employment and \ntraining assistance.\n  Let us be clear, however, that the individuals in need of assistance \nwill still receive it. Children\n will still be fed. Child care will still be provided. Individuals with \ndisabilities will still be provided with the full range of services \nthey need. This legislation presents the opportunity to restore the \nproper role of the States to consolidate funding from many of these \nseparate programs and design their own solutions. Under the present \nsystem, for example, a low-income mother with 2 children may need to \nvisit several different offices to obtain benefits from 17 different \nprograms. I firmly believe the States can improve the quality of \nservices at lower costs to the taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, to be successful in welfare reform, we must change the \nstructural status quo. The transformation of these programs into block \ngrants will yield tremendous savings over time. It costs $6 billion \njust to administer the AFDC and food stamp programs. When you include \nthe cost of errors, fraud, and abuse in these two programs alone, \nanother $3 billion of the taxpayers' money is wasted. Some of the \nsmaller categorical programs have administrative costs as high as 40 \npercent of the cost of the benefits.\n  The welfare system is a complex array of about 80 means-tested \nprograms which provide not only cash assistance, but also medical care, \nfood, housing, education and training, and social services. In this \nfiscal year, Federal and State governments will spend approximately \n$387 billion on these programs. It is clear that the failures of the \ncurrent welfare system are not caused by a lack of money, but rather by \nthe structure of the system itself.\n  Here is what the General Accounting Office recently said about this \ncollection of programs:\n\n       The many means-tested programs are costly and difficult to \n     administer. On one hand, these programs sometimes overlap one \n     another; on the other hand, they are often so narrowly \n     focused that gaps in services hinder clients. We note that \n     although advanced computer technology is essential to \n     efficiently running the programs, it is not being effectively \n     developed or used. Due to their size and complexity, many of \n     these programs are inherently vulnerable to fraud, waste, and \n     abuse. We also point out that some of our work has shown that \n     the welfare system is often difficult for clients to \n     navigate. Finally, administrators have not articulated goals \n     and objectives for some programs and have not collected data \n     on how well the programs are working.\n\n  At best, we have created a masterpiece of mediocrity. But I think it \nis much worse. Government has trivialized what it has professed to \nesteem, specifically family and work. The welfare system which was \ndesigned to protect children has failed to consider the consequence of \nidleness.\n  Thirty years of experience have ratified what many of us have known \nall along--Government programs and our welfare system cannot replace \nstable families. Perhaps the greatest mistakes the Federal Government \nhas made during this period is to act as if family life can be reduced \nto a mathematical diagram and that the wisdom of Solomon can be \nreproduced in the Federal Register.\n  The moment to truly change our welfare system is here and now. It has \nbeen said that the first act of common sense is to recognize the \ndifference between a cloud and a mountain. It is time to recognize that \nthe system created to end poverty has helped to bring more poverty. It \nis time to recognize that the cost of the system is excessive and \nwasteful. The American people clearly see that Washington has failed. \nAnd it is time we act accordingly.\n  True reform has been quietly evolving in the States. Our objectives \nshould be to unleash the latent creativity of these States. We need to \ntest new approaches, to experiment with new methods that seek to \naddress the varying conditions to be found in our 50 States. That is \nwhat the Dole-Packwood bill does, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Packwood). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  My fellow colleagues, it has been 30 years since President Lyndon \nJohnson launched his unconditional War on Poverty. One overriding fact \nremains, the War on Poverty has failed. In welfare, as in most \ngovernment policies, you get what you pay for.\n  For 30 years, the welfare system has paid for nonwork and nonmarriage \nand has achieved massive increases in both. By undermining the work \nethic and rewarding illegitimacy, the problems of the poor and the \ninner city have actually gotten worse, not better, in the subsequent \nyears. Not only are there more people living in poverty today than ever \nbefore but, thanks to welfare, whole generations of Americans have \nlived and died without every owning a home, holding down a steady job, \nor knowing the love and support of both a mother and a father.\n  This failure is not due to a lack of Government spending. In 1993, \nFederal, State, and local governments spent $324 billion on means-\ntested welfare programs for low-income Americans. To date, welfare now \nabsorbs 5 percent of the gross domestic product, up from 1.5 in 1965 \nwhen the War on Poverty began. According to Congressional Budget Office \nfigures, total annual welfare spending will rise to nearly $500 billion \nand 6 percent of gross domestic product by 1998.\n  Though President Johnson declared that ``the days of the dole are \nnumbered,'' welfare now involves an ever-expanding share of the \npopulation. Today nearly one out of seven American children is enrolled \nin aid to families with dependent children [AFDC], with Uncle Sam's \nwelfare check serving as a surrogate father. About half of the children \ncurrently on AFDC will remain on welfare for over 10 years.\n  The core problem behind this growth is that the current welfare \nsystem promotes self-destructive behavior: non-work, illegitimacy, and \ndivorce. Mr. President, in my practice as a heart transplant surgeon in \nTennessee, I witnessed the effects of our misguided welfare system \nevery day.\n  One out of three of my patients was below the poverty level. Some \ntried, but couldn't get a job. Some didn't want to work. But almost all \nfelt trapped by the current welfare system which pulls families apart.\n  Caring for these individuals, I heard the same stories, again and \nagain. Young teenage mothers would explain that the Government would \npay them $50 more a month if they moved out of their parents' home, \naway from their family and away from the only support system they had \nto pull themselves out of the welfare trap.\n  Mr. President, we must act now to reverse this disintegration and \ndestruction of the American family. We cannot afford to pass on the \nopportunity to put forward a proposal that will end \n\n[[Page S 11805]]\nthe generational cycles of welfare dependence. The American people \nelected us to do the very thing we are now trying to do.\n  They asked us to return control of their lives and their government \nto local communities.\n  They asked us to spend their money wisely.\n  They asked us to create a system of mutual responsibility in which \nwelfare recipients would be granted aid but would be required to \ncontribute something back to society for assistance given.\n  They asked us to change incentives, and create a welfare system that \npromotes work, that reduces illegitimacy, that strengthens families, \nand that provides an opportunity for all Americans to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Dole substitute amendment, No. 2280, \ngoes a long way toward doing what the American people have asked us to \ndo.\n  It consolidates AFDC cash benefits, JOBS, and related child care \nprograms into a capped block grant to States and gives States a large \ndegree of flexibility to address their unique problems. The Dole \nsubstitute also requires a 30-percent reduction in Federal staff \ncurrently administering AFDC and the JOBS Program. By consolidating \nprograms, we can reduce the costs of bureaucracy and get the money to \nour children.\n  The Dole substitute requires able-bodied adult welfare recipients to \nwork. Welfare recipients will no longer be able to avoid work by moving \nfrom one job training program to the next. They must begin work no \nlater than 2 years after getting on the rolls and cannot receive \nbenefits for more than 5 years.\n  Finally, it contains several provisions designed to strengthen \nfamilies and require personal responsibility. States can deny cash \npayments to teenage mothers and place family caps on cash assistance. \nSingle teen parents must stay in school and live under adult \nsupervision. And deadbeat parents will face financial penalties and \ntough sanctions, including the loss of drivers and professional \nlicenses.\n  Mr. President, a number of amendments will be offered this week which \ncan strengthen the Dole substitute.\n  For example, I believe a welfare bill should include a pay-for-\nperformance work requirement, so that there is a proportional reduction \nin benefits for work missed by a welfare recipient--no work, no \nbenefits.\n  I would support an amendment to reward Governors for their efforts in \nreducing illegitimacy rates within their States.\n  And we should strengthen the requirements that unwed mothers \nestablish the paternity of their children in order to get benefits.\n  Mr. President, we have a chance to make history here this week. We \nhave the opportunity to regroup, to restructure, and to find new ways \nof helping those in need.\n  Those of us who are committed to change have behind us the full force \nof the American people. Those who argue against those changes have \nnothing on their side but the dismal history of the past 30 years.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wish the Presiding Officer a good morning. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11803-5", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11805-S11806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every 5 years, Congress has the \nopportunity to review the Government's role in sustaining domestic \nagriculture production and determine the effectiveness of those \nprograms. That effort is underway as we begin, again this year, the \nlegislation that modifies and extends USDA programs. The multiyear farm \nbill allows us to step back and shine the light on current conditions \non each and every one of the programs affected by this legislation.\n  As the Senate Agriculture Committee took its first look under the \nhood earlier last month, it is already clear that some of the programs \nneed a tune-up, some need a complete overhaul, and still others may \nneed to be hauled away.\n  No piece of legislation Congress takes up this year will affect the \nlives of South Dakotans and rural Americans more than the 1995 farm \nbill. Commodity support programs, trade, conservation, research, \ndomestic food assistance, rural credit, and the rural development \nprograms will all be under very close scrutiny.\n  In my years in Congress, I have had the honor of representing the \ninterests and concerns of South Dakota farmers and ranchers in a number \nof these farm bill debates. In close consultation with the agricultural \ncommunity, I have worked to improve farm income and bolster the rural \neconomy by offering amendments that were eventually incorporated in the \nfinal legislation.\n  Nonetheless, as each of these bills have come up for final votes, I \nhave had to ask myself whether they truly represented our best effort \nto respond to legitimate needs of the agricultural sector. I sincerely \nhope this year, as we begin to weigh pros and cons of the legislation, \nthat we recognize that the stakes could not be higher.\n  As we debate the 1995 farm bill in the coming months, I hope the \nDemocrats and Republicans alike can move beyond the partisanship that \nso often dominates Congress and work together to draft a farm bill that \ntruly reflects the genuine appreciation for an agricultural community \nthat is too often taken for granted. On many issues, I am optimistic \nthat broad consensus is possible and, indeed, likely. As in years past, \nhowever, there are those in Congress who will push for drastic and \ndisproportionate cuts in agricultural spending, claiming that in these \ntimes of tight budget constraints, we can no longer afford to support \nAmerican agriculture, including family farmers.\n  I say we cannot afford to. American agriculture is making an \nextraordinarily important contribution to the national economy. In a \ntime when our manufacturing base continues to decline, agriculture \ncontributes more to our exports and produces one of the largest \npositive balances of trade of any sector within our economy.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the extent to which the agriculture \nsector has already contributed significantly to deficit reduction in \nthe last several years. Since 1986, agriculture spending has been cut \nby 60 percent, from $26 to $9 billion today. If other Federal programs \nhad been slashed as severely as agriculture over the last 10 years, the \nU.S. Government would now have a budget surplus.\n  Such past contributions will not and should not preclude the Federal \nagricultural programs from being thoroughly reviewed once again. The \nfarmers I talked to realize and accept this proposition. They are as \nconcerned about the Federal deficit as anyone. Amidst ever-increasing \nproduction costs and stagnant commodity prices, they know how difficult \nit is to balance a budget, but they do it in their daily lives and \nexpect us to do it as well. Farmers and ranchers are willing to lend \ntheir hand to the effort. They simply ask that once a hand is extended, \nit receives a fair shake.\n  Our task is to ensure fairness and responsibility in drafting a new \nfarm bill. Farm programs are like many other Government programs: They \ncan be refined; they can be streamlined. Their costs can be reduced and \ntheir effectiveness can be increased.\n  All agricultural policy initiatives must be crafted with the \nintelligence and with the simultaneous appreciation for the role that \nfamily farmers play in the daily lives of all Americans and the \nbudgetary constraints in which we now find ourselves.\n  We must not, however, let those woefully ignorant of farming \nrealities run roughshod over sound agricultural policy under the guise \nof fiscal responsibility. Farmers across the country know the \ndifference between political expedience and fiscal responsibility, even \nif we in Congress confuse the two.\n  Fashioning a farm bill that will reduce the cost and still provide \nthe necessary services and support for agriculture is one of the top \npriorities in \n\n[[Page S 11806]]\nthis session of Congress. I have four primary goals as we look at the \nupcoming farm bill.\n  First, we need to increase the market income of family farmers. \nFarmers are the backbone of rural America and an essential part of the \nfoundation of our entire economy. The new farm bill should be \nstructured to maximize net farm income and reduce reliance on \nGovernment payments.\n  Farmers tell me time and time again that they want to receive more \nincome from the market and less from the Government. The income support \nprograms in the farm bill must give farmers the flexibility to respond \nto market conditions while still providing an economic safety net. I am \nfirmly convinced the market can and should more fairly compensate \nfarmers for the long hours and large amounts of capital they invest in \nproducing our food.\n  Second, we need to promote the production of innovative value-added \nagricultural products that will expand the markets for American \nagriculture and enhance the incomes of all of our producers. USDA \nresearch dollars should be targeted toward the expansion of these \nmarket opportunities.\n  The American farmer is the most productive in the world, but \nproduction in and of itself does not pay the bills. We need to \nfacilitate the creation of new markets in which agricultural products \ncan actually be sold. This will stimulate our small communities by \nbringing new industries to rural areas and improving the economic \nstability of all family farmers.\n  Third, we need to drastically simplify Federal programs. I have had \nthe opportunity to work in a South Dakota county ASCS office and see \nthe excessive paperwork and redtape. Any of us would get hopelessly \nlost in the maze of base acres, deficiency payments, marketing loans, \npayment acres, program crops, nonprogram crops, and target prices that \nproducers must navigate each and every day. These programs cry out for \nreform and simplification. Most farmers will tell you that if we could \ndo any one of them a favor, this would be it. Let us allow farmers to \nget back to doing what they do best: Growing safe and abundant food.\n  Finally, we need to find innovative ways to assist young and \nbeginning farmers. The future of rural communities is really in their \nhands. Far too many young South Dakotans are forced to leave our State \nevery year in search of opportunities in urban areas. Loans, assistance \nprograms and, most of all, a good price are needed to encourage young \npeople to begin farming. We are almost unanimous in support of this \ngoal, but the challenge here is perhaps greater than anyplace else, \ngiven the severe budget restrictions we face over the next few years. I \nhope we can find the creativity necessary to meet this particular \nchallenge.\n  In the context of the extensive cuts the current budget resolution \nwill inflict upon rural America, our actions on the farm bill are \nmagnified in importance. We simply cannot let the farm bill deteriorate \ninto a political squabble between parties or, for that matter, regions. \nIf that happens, everybody will be busy scoring political points, and \nthe only real loser will be agriculture. It is time we stopped taking \nour safe and abundant food supply, and the farmers and ranchers who \nproduce it, for granted. We must use this opportunity to craft a farm \nbill that reflects the need to preserve rural America and the farms \nthat produce the world's safest and most abundant food supply.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11805-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11806-S11810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, briefly, because I know we are ready to \nmove on with this legislation, I certainly want to speak in support of \nthe Work Opportunity Act of 1995. That bill which my fine colleagues, \nMajority Leader Dole and Senator Packwood, have placed before us \nrepresents, I think, a very good starting point for welfare reform. I \ncommend both of them for their work and for working with all of us to \nensure that our concerns were taken care of.\n  It is not a perfect bill. A bill rarely is. But it surely puts us on \nthe right track. They have listened to my suggestions, especially with \nregard to recognition of rural areas and amending the bill to include \nvocational training and the definition of work. That is a provision \nWyoming needed in the bill, and now under the bill, recipients can \nreceive vocational training for up to a year. I appreciate that very \nmuch. That was very attentive to our needs.\n  I strongly felt that welfare reform should be a high priority. I \nthink we all agree with that. There is much to do. Not only to ``get \ntough'' with those who might best be described as welfare addicts, \nwhich offend us all, but also to help those who truly want to become \nself-sufficient, which charms us all, and know that these people need \nour attention.\n  So, if we can do this in a humane and responsible manner--there is \nnot one among us who has a desire to be punitive or destructive to any \nof those who are disadvantaged and most vulnerable in society. I do not \nsee that. That is an absurd premise.\n  When we talk about welfare reform, it is important that we look at \nthe big picture and understand the reasons why people are on welfare. \nIt is a very difficult thing. Those who have studied it for decades are \nunable to really come to closure on how these things happen, why is \nthis occurring, why is the birth rate here, and what is the rate of \nillegitimacy? Nobody has done more work in that area than the senior \nSenator from New York. We read his studies, his works, and appreciate \nhis extraordinary range of and grasp of the issue. It is a giant \npuzzler for us.\n  In Wyoming, I know a single parent will tell me that they could get \nby without welfare if they just received the child support they were \nsupposed to get in the divorce. I know about that because I did about \n1,500 of those in my practice of law for 18 years. ``If he would pay \nthe child support, I would not need to be on welfare.'' That is very \ntrue. I have often felt we should put teeth in the welfare and child \nsupport enforcement laws. I applaud the leadership for including \nserious child support provisions in this bill. I am particularly \npleased by the provisions that improve our ability to track down absent \nparents and streamline the process to make interstate enforcement less \ncomplicated and unmanageable. This is what has happened for years. You \nget the decree and support order, and the husband takes off. This will \ninject some responsibility in here for a group in society known as \n``fathers'' who are not here on Earth simply to sire the flock and move \non, and that has to stop.\n  Paternity establishment is another high priority in the legislation, \nand we are addressing that. I appreciate the approach in regard to \nblock granting. Our very able Governor, Jim Geringer, a very able \nadministrator, tells us that they need and require flexibility. We want \nto give that flexibility in the form of block grants so States can \nshape their own programs, make themselves laboratories. I am one who \njust does not believe that the Federal Government, or we here, have a \nmonopoly on compassion. I do not see how people can even imagine that \nState officials somehow care any less about families and children than \nthe Feds do. I think that these programs and flexibility are very \nimportant.\n  I also agree with Senators Packwood and Chafee in their approach to \nthe child welfare provisions included in the bill by not putting child \nwelfare and child protection into block grants. They have recognized \nthat we should not be too hasty in turning everything over to the \nStates at one time.\n  There is a consensus here among child welfare administrators that \nFederal protections have led to new improvements to this system and \ncritical incentives to the State. It was true in my State where the \nsystem was in complete chaos until the State had guidelines and \nrequirements to follow for receiving the Federal funding. Only then did \nWyoming develop a child protection and foster care program that takes \ncare of its most vulnerable and neglected children. In fact, were it \nnot for the standards that Congress enacted--and I know this is strong \nlanguage for a Republican, but in this situation, were it not for the \nstandards Congress enacted in 1980, the States and territories with the \nworst track \n\n[[Page S 11807]]\nrecords, such as the District of Columbia, would have been allowed to \ncontinue to disregard the basic safety of abused and neglected children \nwith complete impunity.\n  So I support block grants. I feel that aid to families with dependent \nchildren, along with the JOBS Program and AFDC child care programs, \nshould be block granted. I would like to see States given the \nflexibility to run these programs as they see fit without Congress \ndefining specific categories to whom States cannot pay benefits.\n  With regard to SSI, we had hearings on supplemental security income. \nI agree that drug addicts and alcoholics should not receive cash \npayment benefits because they have a so-called ``disability.'' It is a \nself-induced one in many cases. However, I do feel that these addicts \nand substance abusers need to receive treatment for their addictions.\n  I feel that sensible improvements have been made also in this area of \nchildren's eligibility for SSI. We had anecdotal examples of parents \ncoaching their children to act up in school, and families who have all \nof their family on SSI rolls. However, those are only anecdotal \nevidence, and we should not use them as an excuse for carrying out some \nwholesale purge of children from the SSI rolls. We should make sure the \nlow-income families who have children with severe disabilities are \ntaken care of, especially if one or both parents must stay at home to \ncare for this very troublesome and disabled child--and often they are \nsimilar and often a tremendous burden upon a parent in a time of \nstress.\n  With regard to immigration, we will deal with that in a large area of \nthe immigration subcommittee, which I chair. But I think it is very \nimportant to note here that since our earliest days as a nation, we \nhave required new immigrants to be self-supporting. In the year 1645--\nand I see my colleague from New York pique his interest, because he \nloves history--Massachusetts refused to admit prospective immigrants \nwith no means of support other than public assistance. But America's \nfirst general immigration law--the big one, before the big influx in \nthe early 1900's--was passed in 1882. In 1882, it prohibited the \nadmission of ``any person unable to take care of himself or herself \nwithout first becoming a public charge.'' This restriction still \nexists. Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act excludes \nthose who are ``likely at any time'' to become a public charge. Courts \nhave come along and interpreted that in a way which made it absolutely \nsenseless. But that is the law.\n  I think our Nation's welfare law should be consistent with America's \nhistoric immigration policy. This bill, in conjunction with immigration \nproposals under consideration within the subcommittee, will create a \nlong absent commonality.\n  Many immigrants--half of the new immigrants in fiscal year 1994, \naccording to the State Department--are permitted to enter only because \na friend or relative in the United States has promised, that is \nsponsored, and said to the U.S. Government that the newcomer will not \nrequire public assistance. Should this new immigrant then fall on hard \ntimes, it is the responsibility of the sponsor--that friend or relative \nwho promised the support--to provide the aid. This Dole bill will \nrequire all Federal welfare programs--save a few ``public interest'' \nprograms--to include the income of this sponsor when determining a \nrecent immigrant's eligibility for welfare.\n  The message in this area with regard to welfare is very clear: \nAmerica is serious about our traditional expectation that immigrants be \nself-supporting. Newcomers should turn to the friends and relatives who \nsponsored them for assistance before seeking aid from the American \ntaxpayer. Hear that clearly.\n  Immigrants who come here and are sponsored must be self-supporting. \nThey will not turn to the taxpayers first; they will turn to their \nsponsor first.\n  I look forward to a healthy debate on all these issues. We will have \none. I am happy to see us move forward. We need to move toward this \nprogram of work and self-sufficiency while leaving States without \nrestrictions, giving flexibility.\n  I thank the leaders for their fine work in moving this legislation \nforward.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I take just a moment of the Senate's \ntime to express my gratitude, and I am sure that of Senator Packwood, \nfor the substance of the remarks of Senator Simpson and particularly \nfor the tone of those remarks.\n  We are, indeed, struggling in this effort with forces we do not fully \nunderstand that have come upon us very suddenly, as history goes.\n  The learned Senator can speak of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its \nregulations in 1645. That is eons of time, as compared to the sudden \nincidence of this problem in our cities.\n  I wonder if the Senator could allow me a moment to point out the \nurban dimension of this subject, because urban affairs--cities--are no \nlonger a central topic of our concerns as they were, say, 30 years ago.\n  President Nixon's first act upon taking office was to create an Urban \nAffairs Council. This will not take 3 minutes. I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia is waiting, and he will be heard in just a second. This \nis what has happened in the course of the last few years, suddenly, as \nif it were a tornado out in Wyoming country.\n  In the city of Los Angeles, Mr. President, 62 percent of the children \nare supported by aid to families with dependent children; in Chicago, \n43.7 percent; in Detroit, 78.7 percent; in my city of New York, 28.4 \npercent; in Houston, TX, 24.6 percent. These are the 10 largest cities. \nThere are higher ratios, but these are our 10 largest cities.\n  What this does, and I think the Senator from Wyoming can sympathize \nwith this, these ratios overwhelm municipal capacity. Going back to \n1912--I will go back that far--the New York Times began a series that \nhas been going on until this day called ``The 100 Neediest Cases.'' At \nChristmastime, they give you a list of 100 families; most had \ntuberculosis, or an industrial accident killed the father, or something \nlike that. You can cope with 100. There are more than 100, but it gives \nyou a sense of dimension.\n  How do you cope with the situation where 62 percent of your children \nare on welfare, which means, of course, they are paupers. One of the \nthings we have had most application for in waivers was to allow \nfamilies to have a car worth little more than $1,500. In Wyoming, you \nneed a car to get to work in most places. That is an element we do not \ntalk about often.\n  This problem tends to be concentrated. It is an urban problem. It is \nan urban crisis. It is a general problem. What is a problem in Wyoming \nis a crisis in Cook County.\n  Therefore, the more do I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from \nWyoming and the mode in which he has stated them. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from West Virginia.\n   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a lot of the time I wonder what we \nare doing talking on the floor because we just seem to be talking about \nthings that do not make a lot of difference and that do not necessarily \nconcern Americans as much as they may concern some internal dynamic \nhere in the Senate, which may or may not be important.\n  This obviously is a very different kind of setting. This time the \nSenate is turning to something that the people of my State, and the \nState of the Presiding Officer, and States all over this country really \ncare about and really expect us to do something about. They see a \nwelfare system that gives out too much for too little in return. They \ndo not like it. They are very clear in their view about it. They are \nright.\n  They see too little emphasis on something which I think is sort of \nthe byway by which America is either going to come back to our proper \ncourse or we are not. That is something called personal responsibility. \nWe have lost our sense of it in this country--not just the poor, but \nall of our people, I think--what we have an obligation to do ourselves \nas opposed to turning toward the communities or toward the Government.\n  Also, something called work ethic, which people are talking a lot \nabout, beginning to do something about, something the American people \nwant to see badly and something they deserve to see. \n\n[[Page S 11808]]\n\n  I think people have lost, and rightly so, their tolerance on \ndependency. Dependency is unavoidable in certain circumstances, but in \nmost circumstances it is not. The American people know that. There are \na lot of Americans who pay taxes who were dependent one way or another \nand fought their way out of it and have every reason to look at those \nwho do not askance.\n  The point is that we are talking about something really serious in \nwelfare reform. Tax-paying, hard-working Americans are not the only \nones who want reform in welfare. Most families on welfare want things \nto change, too, because many of the things that we in Government have \ndone has fostered their dependency even against their own will, \nalthough they have to submit to it. The whole act of submission is one, \nof course, of losing a sense of personal responsibility.\n  For all kinds of reasons, some very sad, mothers and fathers find \nthemselves living in poverty. For some, attitudes and behavior bring \nthem to welfare and keep them on welfare. For many families and many in \nmy State of West Virginia, they want to get off welfare as much as the \nmiddle class wants them to get off welfare and to avoid all the \nproblems that are associated with welfare, including the cost of it.\n  The father disappears or refuses to pay child support. There are \nbillions and billions of dollars out there. Child care costs more than \na minimum-wage job, so people do not get around to overcoming that \nfact. Or the parent just cannot find a paying job because she or he \ndoes not have the most basic of skills. That I can remember from \nearlier days. They use to have something, as the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee knows, called the dollar-an-hour program. We had that \nin West Virginia. I am not sure if they had that in all kinds of other \nStates, but that was something where, when there really was not \nanything else, you paid somebody $1 an hour and they went out and \nworked on the highways for the department of highways. They got $1 an \nhour. It was really for people who could not do anything else but that \nkind of work.\n  It was sad, but it was all that there was, and people did it because \nthey had to. These are some of the situations we run into.\n  Welfare is also about children. Acronyms and clunky program titles \nkeep that basic truth from the picture of welfare.\n  But the fact is that 43,000 families in West Virginia who get a \nwelfare check every month--there are that many--and the 5 million \nfamilies across America who get a welfare check every month--and there \nare that many--include over 9 million innocent children; 5 million \nfamilies, 9 million children. We are talking about 1-year-olds, 7-year-\nolds, 11-year-olds, and everything in between; people who are just \nstarting life, in effect. These are not the deadbeats, are they? They \nare totally innocent of whatever can be blamed on the welfare system \nand its recipients. Whatever their parents might have done or not done, \nthey are innocent--and they really are.\n  I think back to many cases I know of in West Virginia where the \nchildren of parents who are on welfare simply overcame that and went on \nand now have decent jobs and are raising families. It is a triumphant \nthing to see. It is something to fight for, something to work for, \nsomething to glory in, if we can get a welfare system that allows that \nto happen more commonly.\n  In fact, from every poll that I have seen, while Americans expect \nCongress to reform welfare and are fairly stiff in their views about \nit--us and it--they also expect us to make sure the children are \nprotected. On that, they are not equivocal. They want children \nprotected. They recognize the difference between the perpetrators and \nvictims. They see children as victims and they say so, and they want \nchildren protected even as they want the adults and the parents to \nwork. They want children protected. They are not asking us to be cruel. \nThey are asking us to be firm, but not cruel. They are asking us to be \nsmart, in other words.\n  Because of the anger about the welfare system, it is very tempting \nfor politicians to simplify the solutions; because there is always a \ncoming election, to say that you were tougher on welfare than the next \nperson. There is nothing like being tougher on welfare except, of \ncourse, if it does not work. If you do something that does not work, \nyou may do better in the argument but you should not sleep as well at \nnight.\n  The test in welfare reform, it seems to this Senator, will be met by \nits results, what we actually do--hopefully come together to do--on the \nfloor of this body and the other one. It will not be charts or bumper \nstickers or promises.\n  West Virginians want welfare reform because they want to see things \nreally change. They know the system is not working as it is. They \nbelieve the system should work, can work, ought to work, and can be \nmade to work by us, who are their representatives, if we will but come \ntogether. If we do not come together we will all fail, and it will be a \nshame and a sham on this institution. If we come together, Republicans \nand Democrats, we can make this work. We do not have to be tougher, one \nthan the other, but simply be smart and make it work. And being smart \nwill be plenty tough--plenty tough.\n  I think that is what the Senate should spend this week, or whatever \ntime we have, sorting through. That is the way to change the welfare \nsystem in a way which works--on both sides, if that is possible. Every \nsingle Member of this body should reject the idea that welfare reform \nis some kind of trophy that one party holds over the other. I see some \nof that already and it worries me, as I know it worried the Senator \nfrom New York. It is a chance to recognize the realities of people on \nwelfare, and a system that spits out the wrong results. It is a chance \nto do careful surgery so we get it right. There is not any time for \nanything else. And we can get it right.\n  I am still incredibly surprised--and I say this not in a partisan \nspirit, but because I must out with my feelings on this subject--that \nthe majority leader thinks that a block grant is welfare reform. I have \nto say that. There is no question, if the Federal Government collects \n$16 billion from the taxpayers and chops it into 50 separate pots for \nthe States, welfare will certainly end as we know it. But that is a \ncop-out. What a way to run from the hard decisions and the tough calls \nthat we know are required to get the results that will make all of this \npossible. Nobody on either side of the aisle is running from tough \ndecisions, but we have to be smart. As a former Governor, I know that \nwe have to be practical. What we do has to work.\n  I support the Daschle-Breaux-Mikulski bill, because it is an actual \nplan to change the welfare system. It does not just pass the buck to \nGovernors. It replaces the current unsatisfactory, maddening welfare \nsystem with the rules and the steps that will get people into jobs and \nenable them to stay employed. It is not just the getting of the job \nthat is important, it is having that job 2 years later that really \ntests the mettle of what we do. But it also remembers the children in \nthe right way.\n  There is all this talk about values, and properly so. I just hope \nthat means that some compassion--a little bit--is carved out for \nsomething called children, that one really does put them in a separate \ncategory--children who had nothing to do with where they were born, how \nthey were born, or whether their mother is dirt poor or an heiress. I \nmean, most of us really have very little to do with that. Yet, if we \nare in one condition or another, it has an enormous impact on our \nlives. And people have to understand that. The Senate must not \nsurrender this country's commitment to children and the idea that \neverybody deserves a chance after they are born.\n  There is nothing timid about the Daschle-Breaux-Mikulski bill. It is \na bold bill.\n  AFDC, the letters for the core of today's welfare program, is \nabolished. AFDC--I have been living with that acronym for 35 years--is \nabolished. It is ended, as we know it. In its place we propose \nsomething called Work First, words that mean what they say. For the \nfirst time we say financial aid for poor families comes with strings \nattached, and that aid will only last so long a period and then it will \nstop if those conditions are not met. Children will keep getting help \nif they need it, but for adults the help is temporary.\n  Parents have to actually sign something called a parent empowerment \n\n[[Page S 11809]]\n  contract. It is a personal agreement outlining how he or she will move \nfrom welfare to work. The contract is enforceable. All of this is new.\n  In return, Work First is a plan that respects what families need to \ngo from poverty to independence--what they have to have. That means \ndifferent things for different families. Basically, we make sure there \nis help to find a job, qualify for a job, and stay in a job with backup \nsupport like child care and, thank heavens, health care. What parent in \nhis or her right mind can take a job if there is no one to care for his \nor her children? We put people in jail, you know, for neglecting \nchildren. It is a Federal offense.\n  Again, as a former Governor, I know what happens when the Federal \nGovernment declares victory over a difficult problem--and now I come \nback to block grants. Block grants, in my judgment, are closer to \nsomething called surrender: Here, States, come along with us on this \nblock grants. It is a sturdy idea, come along. We are going to give you \na check. But, by the way, the check is going to shrink. And, by the \nway, should there be a recession, or some kind of natural catastrophe, \nor you happen to have many more poor families, then that is kind of a \nproblem for you. But people like the idea of block grants, so we are \ngoing to do block grants.\n  This Senator does not like the idea of block grants. This Senator was \nGovernor during the first New Federalism in the early 1980's and \nwatched the State go from the highest employment in its history to a 17 \npercent unemployment rate all in the period of 3 years. That is not \npretty. That is full of tragedy. That is not all because of the Federal \nblock grants. But they symbolized it, and it hurt. It hurt a lot, Mr. \nPresident.\n  That is why I hope that we can find agreement on this Senate floor, \nand why it is so important--and why we have opening statements and then \ntwo Senators over there who are running against each other for \nPresident and Senators over here, and then two sides, that we sort of \nforget about some of these things--that we start thinking about what we \nare here for, which is solid welfare reform.\n  We have the time if we take it. If we have to stay longer, then I \nguess we should do that. But we have to think about the realities of \npoverty, of welfare, and how to make the whole country a place where \nchildren do matter.\n  For example, in Senator Dole's plan the answer to States hit by a \nrecession or depression is a loan fund. Right--States really are going \nto be able to borrow money. Of course, that money has to be repaid in 3 \nyears with interest, when more of their people face a temporary crisis \nof unemployment and hunger.\n  Mr. President, the Senate needs to look behind the rhetoric of that \nwelfare plan and deal with facts and come together. The Congressional \nBudget Office says that under a very similar bill--the one passed by \nthe Finance Committee--44 States will not be able to meet the bill's \nsupposed work requirements. Let me say that again. The bill that we put \nout of Finance will fail in 44 of the 50 States, will fail according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Common sense says that we, therefore, \nshould not do that, and we have to again come up with something that \nworks. That is all I am interested in--something that works, that is \npractical and works, that gets people off welfare, that protects \nchildren, that is tough on personal responsibility, that makes parents \nwork, makes them work but works as a plan.\n  The bill of Senator Dole really has the same problem. It just does \nnot bother to figure out how the work requirements become reality.\n  Why should we set our States up to fail? We do not want to do that. \nWe may be in a rush. But we do not want to set our States up to fail. \nWe do not want to do that. It would be supremely wrong and shameful. I \nwould say look at the democratic alternative and you will find a plan \nthat will get results, with people actually working, what we all say \nthat we want.\n  The block grant approach in the Dole bill turns away from the \nNation's safety net for children, and we are all asked to hope that \neach individual State will step in. Many of them will not. Americans \nare not asking us to abandon children. I repeat and repeat. They are \nasking us to strike a better deal with their parents, to link the \nresponsibility to Government help that is also temporary.\n  There are areas of agreement in this Chamber on welfare reform, and I \ncelebrate those. Members on both sides of the aisle are clearly \ninterested in promoting flexibility and in encouraging innovation among \nthe States. Again, as a former Governor, I also know the frustration, \nthat a Federal bureaucracy that micromanages is annoying, a Federal \nbureaucracy that is too regulated, that stifles creative efforts to \ndevelop local initiatives to move families from welfare to work. So we \nall agree, 100 of us I suspect, that the States need more flexibility.\n  I might add, that is not where you need to look for sudden converts. \nThe senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, focused the \ncountry's attention 8 years ago on the signs of progress that were just \nappearing in a few States that had been given more room to experiment. \nThat was the basis of the Family Support Act passed in 1988, and it is \nthe reason States this very minute are trying all kinds of new ways to \nmove families off of the welfare rolls and to making it on their own.\n  I remember in West Virginia we started something back in the 1970's. \nIt was called the Community Work Experiment Program [CWEP]. That was \nmade a part of the Family Support Act. We were the only State in the \nNation at the time to be doing that. We started that, and we aimed it \nparticularly at some of our southern counties, and it worked. It was \nworking. As a result of that, it was kept in the 1988 Family Support \nAct and was deemed to be good, and is still on the books.\n  There is partisan agreement on the crucial need to dramatically \nimprove child support enforcement. I would say 100 Senators will agree \non that, again a building block for bipartisan consensus here. The \ntools to force parents to accept financial responsibility for their \nchildren are not in full use. We know that. They must be, and we do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate sets politics aside and makes results \nour test, and keeps a special place in our hearts for children, we can \nproduce and pass a bill that deserves the title ``welfare reform.'' We \ncan do that.\n  Our debate should focus on how to get the parents of over 9 million \nchildren to work, while making sure that the victims are not the \nchildren. Our work and our votes should be based on facts and \nrealities, not on the temptation to pretend slogans will solve \nproblems, or on trying to outdo each other or to bring home a trophy. \nThe only trophy ought to be a bipartisan one that creates a welfare \nsystem that works, and that is a trophy for our country--not for us.\n  As I look ahead to this debate, I intend to respond to West \nVirginians who have been waiting for welfare reform. For the system to \nchange so that the rules are the same for everyone--if you can work, by \ngolly, you work; if you have children, care for them, take \nresponsibility.\n  I also hope we will see the country change. We can do better, and it \ndoes not have to be done by becoming mean or becoming thoughtless. It \ncertainly should not be done by abandoning the little that is done for \nchildren who have so little.\n  I recall, Mr. President, Majority Leader Dole's opening statement \nfrom a March hearing in the Senate Finance Committee. I am going to \nquote what he said. Senator Dole said:\n\n       I do not know anything else as meaningful or as critical as \n     doing our part to help America's children in need, and \n     helping them get the necessary support to remain a part of \n     their family, helping them realize their full potential as we \n     launch into the next century . . . our first concern must be \n     the well-being of the children involved. They are not the \n     instigators, they are the victims of what we see as a growing \n     problem . . .\n\n  If we heed those words, wise words, and work together to achieve real \nreform and insist on getting the surgery right--that is, that we are \ncareful and smart and practical in what we do--then we have a \ntremendous opportunity to come through for the American people on \nwelfare reform.\n  I hope the Senate will surprise the pundits and the skeptics and the \nprofessional observers of this place by not only passing something \ncalled welfare reform but a bill of which we can be proud. \n\n[[Page S 11810]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

May I just express the appreciation of this Senator for \nthe remarks that have been made by the Senator from West Virginia, the \nchairman of the Rockefeller Commission on Children, who spoke so \ncarefully and thoughtfully, particularly to his point about dependency.\n  The issue of welfare is the issue of dependency, and in a world where \nadults stand on their own two feet, as the phrase has it, we have a \nsituation in which the condition of dependency is massive in our \ncities, pervasive in the land, and while we have not been able to solve \nthe problem, we are making real steps in addressing it.

Mr. President, I have sat through 2 days of probably some \nof the most substantive debate on a key issue in this country that I \nhave heard in years, listening to the debate of our colleague from \nOregon, who has led the Republican side of welfare reform, and \ncertainly the senior Senator from New York on the other side, both men \nof tremendous substance attempting to deal with a very important issue \nfor our country. I have just listened to the Senator from West Virginia \nin a most sincere appeal for resolution of an issue that has gone \nbeyond what I think most Americans ever intended it to be.\n  In some way my comments this morning are a part of that because I am \ntalking about a very real people issue in the West that has caused, by \nits presence and by our inability to act, people to go on welfare, to \nbe subject to at least or to ask for assistance from their State to \nprovide for food on their children's table. And so, if I could for just \na few moments, I wish to reflect on an issue which is really very \nperplexing that I and others in this Chamber have attempted to deal \nwith over the years that is now front and center again, at least in the \ntimber-producing States of our Nation.\n  Every week, I receive tragic appeals from unemployed forest workers \nstruggling to feed and care for their children, many of them, as I have \njust mentioned, on the edge of welfare at this moment. A major reason \nfor their struggle is that a rising flood of subsidized Canadian timber \nhas captured nearly 39 percent of our domestic softwood lumber market \nin May of this year.\n  This May figure is already an all-time record for foreign market's \nshare of lumber in our country, and the industry anticipates that the \nfigure in June will be equal to or will exceed that level. This flood \nof imports also has contributed to a 34-percent reduction in U.S. \nsoftwood prices since 1994. Last year alone, Canada sent to the United \nStates nearly 16 billion board feet of lumber worth $5.8 billion. Tens \nof thousands of jobs and the economic livelihood of hundreds of \ncommunities throughout the public forested States of our Nation, \nprimarily in the West, depend on a prompt and fair solution to this \nproblem of Canadian subsidized timber.\n  What is the cause of the problem? In Canada, where 92 percent of all \ntimber is Government owned, Provincial programs allocate trees to \nproducers under long-term agreements at a fraction of their fair market \nvalue. Producers in British Columbia, for example, paid on the average \nof $100 per thousand board feet of timber in 1994.\n  That is in stark contrast to United States producers immediately \nacross the border in the States of Washington and Idaho and down into \nOregon paying $365 per thousand board feet of timber of the same type \nand the same quality--nearly 300 percent more than what was being paid \nin Canada. United States prices are substantially higher because in the \nUnited States, unlike Canada, trees from virtually all public and \nprivate forests are sold at fair market value through the competitive \nbid process.\n  Coupled with that, there has also been--by Government edict, \nenvironmental laws, Endangered Species Act--a tremendous reduction in \nthe allowable timber cut or the allowable sales quantity on our public \nforests. The result of this and the subsidies have resulted in mills \nshutting down and, of course, the competitive advantage that should be \nours in our own market being dramatically lost to this flood of \nsubsidized timber. All regions of the country have announced production \ncurtailments, temporary shutdowns, and permanent closures of mills and \nrelated businesses. Small family-owned businesses have been devastated. \nIf prompt action is not taken, the inequity will only get worse.\n  The United States lumber industry is competitive but for Government \ncurtailment of supply and Canadian subsidies. United States lumber \nproduction costs, excluding timber, are the same and in most instances \nlower than Canadian production costs. The United States output per \nemployee is about the same as the Canadian industry. Canadian labor \ncosts are higher and rising faster than labor costs in the United \nStates.\n  Canadians must adopt a fair market-based approach to timber pricing \nto begin to level the playing field that we are talking about. These \npricing policies also have been criticized by Canadian groups, \nincluding Canada's maritime and small lumber producers. Criticism also \ncomes from a previous British Columbia Forest Minister who said that \nCanadian timber pricing practices harm the Canadian economy and do not \nprovide a good return from the industry.\n  Over the past 10 years, United States lumber industries have \nrepeatedly won duty determinations against Canadian subsidies before \nthe United States Department of Commerce and the International Trade \nCommission. Why? Because it is obvious and well-known that Canada \nsubsidizes its industry.\n  In 1993, however, three Canadian members of the binational panel \noperating under chapter 19 of the United States-Canadian Free-Trade \nAgreement ruled that Canadian timber pricing practices are not \nsubsidies under United States law. In response, the U.S. lumber \nindustry filed a constitutional challenge to the panel's authority to \narbitrate such disputes. This challenge was withdrawn when the industry \nwas assured by United States Trade Representative Kantor that Canada \nwould agree to consultations to address the timber pricing issue.\n  There was also another reason why our trade ambassador entered in; he \ndid not want the Canadian Free Trade Agreement and its problems and its \nloopholes exposed.\n  When that agreement was passed in the mid-1980's, I voted against it, \nand in the Chamber of the House--I was then a Congressman--I argued \nthat these loopholes did exist and that we had set ourselves up for the \nvery scenario being played out today. If our Trade Ambassador wants to \nsolve this problem and keep the free-trade agreement intact, then he \nought to move on this issue.\n  In spite of these consultations, I think legislation may be needed to \nresolve the problem that has surfaced with this binational panel or \npanels as a result of the free-trade agreement.\n Past panels have ignored the standard of review mandated by the \nagreement and United States law, and two Canadian members of one lumber \npanel failed to disclose serious conflicts of interest.\n\n  Because these rulings by nonelected, non-United States panelists are \nbinding under the United States-Canadian Free-Trade Agreement, and now \nunder the North American Free-Trade Agreement, serious constitutional \nand procedural issues arise. Reform is needed to assure that future \npanels do not and cannot ignore U.S. law in order to protect unfair \ntrade practices.\n  So where are we today, Mr. President?\n  The U.S. softwood lumber industry is in no condition to endure \nunrestrained, subsidized imports during an extended period of \nnegotiations. Nonetheless, the first meeting of the United States-\nCanadian lumber consultations that \n\n[[Page S 11811]]\noccurred on May 24 and 25 was inconclusive. The second meeting on July \n11 and 12 produced an acknowledgement, finally, of a glimmer that says, \nyes, there is a problem, and suggested there were prospects for \neventual solutions, but without sufficient urgency, in my opinion, to \ncurtail the massive loss of U.S. industry and jobs that is now going on \nin this country.\n  More than 10 years ago I organized congressional opposition to this \npersistent, recurring problem. And I say this morning to the Canadians, \ndown the road from this Capitol, turn up the volume on your television \nset if you are watching C-SPAN2 at this moment, because in the Canadian \nEmbassy you are about to begin to work once again, because we are going \nto put you to work, as this country speaks out for its forest products \nindustry and the men and women who work for it. We will no longer allow \nthis loophole to exist in the United States-Canadian Free-Trade \nAgreement.\n  I have sent letters to the administration urging a quick and \npermanent solution to this problem. And I must say at this moment, \nAmbassador Kantor, your lip service does not answer very well the \nconcerns of the men and women in Idaho and across the Pacific Northwest \nthat are losing their jobs.\n  A third United States-Canadian lumber consultation panel is to meet \nin September. This meeting must accelerate and complete efforts to \nproduce a concrete framework for permanently reforming Canadian pricing \nschemes in order to eliminate the subsidies provided to the Canadian \nproducers.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, I hope this problem will be resolved \nquickly, jointly between the United States and Canada in their \nnegotiations. Frankly, I would prefer if that were to happen. But if it \ndoes not happen, this is one Senator who will rally other Senators and \nMembers of the other body to resolve this problem legislatively like we \nhad to do in the late 1970's. And to our Trade Ambassador, Ambassador \nKantor, go to Canada in September and work to resolve the issue. Lip \nservice no longer serves well the unemployed men and women of the \nforest products industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11810-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11811-S11812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, today's debate over reforming the welfare system is a \ndebate over the values we hold most sacred as Americans. We prize \nindependence over servitude, personal accountability over \nirresponsibility, hard work over Government handouts. A welfare system \nthat works ought to embrace those values, inspire people to seek the \nfreedoms these values represent, and help them lead a better life.\n  And yet, the Democratic system imprisoned over 20 million needy \nAmericans since the 1960's. Instead of bringing families together, \nAmerica's welfare system tears them apart. It encourages dependency, it \nsubsidizes illegitimacy. And the people who benefit most from the \npresent system are not the underprivileged Americans who need it, but \nthe bureaucrats who run it. And it is time for a change.\n  With the welfare reform legislation being debated in Congress, we at \nlast have an opportunity to change 30 years of failed policies. We are \ndetermined to replace the old system for one simple reason; and that \nis, it does not work.\n  Over the last 30 years, since the beginning of the War on Poverty in \n1965, American taxpayers have spent more than $5 trillion on 79 \ndifferent means-tested welfare programs. And what have we accomplished \nwith their sizable investment? Not enough, because the poverty rate has \nremained constant. Federal, State, and local governments combined are \nnow spending $350 billion every year on welfare benefits. That is \nnearly 40 percent more than we spend on national defense each year.\n  If the Senate's welfare reform proposals were signed into law today, \nwe would still spend nearly $1.2 trillion in welfare over the next 5 \nyears. Anyone on Main Street will tell you that that is an awful lot of \nmoney. And it is all funded by the taxpayers. And I believe $1.2 \ntrillion is a sufficient amount of taxpayer dollars to accomplish our \ngoals of the next 5 years. And anyone who does not believe that this is \nenough, well, they spend too much time inside the beltway. Just look at \nthe hard-working men and women of Minnesota who hand over more than a \nthird of their paychecks to Washington.\n  Last fall Republicans pledged to use the American taxpayer dollars \nmore efficiently and more effectively. And reforming the welfare system \nis part of our effort to keep that promise. Our goal in the Senate is \nto truly end welfare as we know it. We must change the priorities that \nthis country places on welfare and emphasize personal responsibility. \nWe must include tough work requirements for welfare recipients. We must \ngive States the power to develop policies which make both parents \nresponsible for their children and eliminate benefits for drug addicts \nand alcoholics.\n  We must give block grants to the States and put an end to the role of \nthe Federal Government as a barrier in the welfare reform \nexperimentation. States should begin the freedom, unhindered by the \nFederal bureaucrats in Washington, to implement innovative reforms. And \nwe must give State governments the flexibility that they need to \ncustomize programs to address local needs, because State officials, not \nWashington bureaucrats, know best how local welfare dollars should be \nspent efficiently.\n  State and local communities will finally be given the flexibility \nthat they need to customize their welfare programs to best meet the \nneeds of their citizens.\n  It was President John F. Kennedy who once said:\n\n       Welfare programs must contribute to the attack on family \n     breakdown and illegitimacy.\n       Unless such problems are dealt with effectively, they \n     fester and grow, sapping the strength of society as a whole \n     and extending their consequences in troubled families from \n     one generation to next.\n\n  And I agree.\n  This legislation makes a first step in this direction by overhauling \n6 of the Nation's 10 largest welfare programs. And this will save the \ntaxpayers approximately $70 billion over the next 7 years. Now we will \nrequire able-bodied welfare recipients to work 20 hours a week. Welfare \nrecipients will no longer be able to endlessly job search and then \ncount that as work. Under the Dole-Packwood bill, work is work. In \naddition, the bill would require 50 percent of a State's welfare \ncaseload to be working by the year 2000.\n  This bill will no longer give welfare recipients more food stamps if \ntheir cash assistance is lower because they have refused to work. In \naddition, the bill requires States to meet a minimum paternity \nestablishment ratio of 90 percent. Now welfare recipients who refuse to \ncooperate in paternity establishment will have their benefits withheld.\n  Another significant change this bill will make is that drug addiction \nand alcoholism will no longer be considered a disability for the \ndetermination of supplemental security income. Taxpayers will no longer \nbe required to pay for an individual's drug or alcohol addiction.\n  The Dole-Packwood bill will deny welfare benefits to illegal aliens \nand also impose a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits. And I \ncommend Senator Dole for these very, very important steps.\n  One element of the bill that I am particularly proud of is the \nadoption of an amendment that I proposed with my friend and colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Shelby, our pay-for-performance amendment that \nwill require States to pay benefits to welfare recipients only for the \nnumber of hours worked.\n  If a welfare recipient refuses to work at all during the required 20-\nhour work-week, they would receive no benefits for that week. If they \ndecided to work only 15 hours instead of the 20 hours required, they \nwould receive welfare benefits for 15 hours' worth of work.\n  Now, Mr. President, this amendment which has been included in the \nleadership amendment will hold welfare recipients to the same \nemployment \n\n[[Page S 11812]]\nstandards as the rest of America's work force. You will be paid for the \namount of hours you work, no more, and no less.\n  Now, Congress has no intention of turning its back on the most needy \nin this country. We simply want to try a new approach, an approach that \ncreates opportunity and offers a hand up and not just a handout, an \napproach that is just as fair to the taxpayer as it is to the welfare \nrecipient.\n  Truth be told, the only people who will be turned out on the streets \nby welfare reform are the thousands of bureaucrats and lobbyists who \nadminister and protect the current welfare system's complex maze of \ndependency.\n  And maybe those who are bilking the system of millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars each year--those who enjoy taking hard-earned \nmoney from taxpayers--maybe they have forgotten that taxpayers in \nMinnesota would like to keep their dollars and use them wisely for \ntheir child's care or their children's education.\n  Again, $1.2 trillion over the next 5 years is a major commitment by \nAmerica's taxpayers. Amazingly, however, many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will argue that $1.2 trillion is not enough, \nthat America's taxpayers should pay more.\n  I disagree. I believe taxpayers have been generous, but now they have \nhad enough of these failed policies which have produced little return \nfor their investment, policies that have only created more dependency \nand have not solved any of the problems we face. Taxpayers have paid \nmore than their fair share, and as an advocate for America's taxpayers, \nI am prepared to be their voice in this debate.\n  We have witnessed the attacks over the last few months organized by \nthe entrenched bureaucrats, the special interest lobbyists for the \ntaxpayer-financed welfare industry, and the liberal activists who \noppose any welfare reform.\n  We have been subjected to the orchestrated campaigns of these \nopponents of change, these jealous defenders of the status quo.\n  They continue to distort the truth and misrepresent our intentions.\n  They cry that changing the welfare system is dangerous and it is \ncruel, that Republicans will take food out of the mouths of starving \nchildren. But I believe that nothing could be more dangerous or cruel \nthan letting the current system remain.\n  The American taxpayers must look beyond the scare tactics, the \nrhetoric, and focus on the facts. The facts are reducing bureaucracy, \nincreasing flexibility, and demanding work from those who are capable \nof working is an investment in our future--in their future--and both \nwelfare recipients and taxpayers will be better off for it.\n  Welfare, as it was originally envisioned, was meant to be a temporary \nsafety net for those who had fallen upon hard times, not a permanent \nhammock that coddles them into life-long dependency. The American \npeople are calling for a new vision that will make this country better, \nstronger, in the year 2000 and beyond.\n  To the liberals, the solution to the welfare problem is the same \nsolution they have turned to over and over again for the past 30 years.\n  Whenever they have faced a fiscal crisis, their answer has always \nbeen to raise taxes on the middle class. That is what they have done \neach time the Medicare trustees warned that Medicare was facing \nbankruptcy. And that is how they would have us fix welfare, give away \nmore of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  That makes the liberals feel good to take away people's money, to \nfund programs of their choice, so they appear righteous--but what does \nthat do to middle class Americans?\n  This Congress is not going to raise taxes.\n  This Congress is not going to ask the taxpayers to finance these \nfundamental changes to the welfare system. Instead we are going to ask \nmore from the welfare recipients, and I believe that is a fair deal.\n  After all, the taxpayers have supported the failed status quo for far \ntoo many years. And with little but a bloated bureaucracy to show for \nit.\n  For those reasons, I am proud to be cosponsoring the Dole welfare \nreform bill to change the status quo, to protect hard-working, middle-\nclass taxpayers, to lift people out the vicious cycle of dependency, to \ntruly end welfare as we know it.\n  As Oklahoma Representative J.C. Watts has stated so well:\n\n       We can no longer measure compassion in this country by how \n     many people are on welfare. We need to measure compassion by \n     how many people are not on welfare because we've helped them \n     climb the ladder of success.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join my efforts to offer \nopportunity to all Americans by fundamentally reforming our failed \nwelfare system and providing a fair deal to the taxpayers and those who \nreceive the taxpayers' earnings.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have an informal arrangement \nalternating side by side, but no Democratic Member on this side is \nseeking recognition. I am happy to hear from the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the mid-1960's, this country declared \nwar on poverty. It was done with the greatest conviction, the greatest \nsense of purpose that Americans carry forward to all of our \nenterprises. It was sincerely and honestly believed that through \nGovernment action at the Federal level we could not only declare war on \npoverty but that we could beat poverty, that we could end it in this \ncountry.\n  Ironically, today we spend in Federal programs almost enough that if \nit were divided among all the poor in this Nation there literally would \nbe no one in poverty. We are not quite to that point, but it is very \nclose.\n  But obviously, all that money does not go to eliminate poverty. As a \nmatter of fact, to our great chagrin, poverty has increased, not gone \ndown. The number of people in poverty in this country has increased \ndramatically, even as we have added programs. It does not mean that our \neffort, our humanitarian effort, was not well intended, but it does \nmean that the program did not meet the objectives we set forth.\n  Part of the money we spend, obviously, goes to administer it. Is it \ntoo much? Perhaps. But I think the problems go further. In thinking \nabout ending poverty, we forgot about the most important factor of all, \nand that is ministering to the human spirit and providing opportunity \nand incentive for people to change their lives. What we have done, \ntragically enough, is create a system that at times made things worse, \nnot better.\n  For some people, we have locked them into poverty, we have literally \nmade them financially unable to get out of poverty. We provided \nincentives to stay in poverty and penalties for getting out of poverty. \nThat is what this welfare reform is all about: Finding a better way to \nhelp people realize their abilities and their opportunities and the \npotential for their own lives. We must understand that incentives, \nrewards and initiative have to be recognized in any program that helps \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to participating in this historic \ndebate. I am confident that together both parties will fashion a bill \nthat will make a dramatic difference not only in our welfare system but \nin improving the lives of the poor of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11811-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11812-S11813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACCOUNTING STANDARDIZATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it may shock many Senators to realize that \nthe largest single enterprise in the history of the world does not have \na uniform accounting system. Perhaps that is not on the top of your \nlist to worry about today, but let me tell you why it is important.\n  The U.S. Government has a $2 trillion cash flow. It has 900 million \nchecks issued each year. It has a payroll and benefits system for 5 \nmillion employees. It has over 1,962 separate budget accounts. It has \nthough, incredibly, \n\n[[Page S 11813]]\nMr. President, 253 separate financial management systems. We do not \nhave standardized accounts, we do not have a standardized management \nfinancial system, and what we have wreaked is chaos in terms of \naccounting for the taxpayers' money.\n  We do have the GAO authorized under the law to set up accounting \nstandards, but in the past both the Treasury and the Office of \nManagement and Budget have openly disagreed with GAO. The consequences \nare, even though the GAO has come up with financial accounting \nstandards, they have been ignored. Agencies regularly ignore those \nstandards and, as a result, the Federal Government is literally \noperating without generally accepted accounting standards, and the \nresults show it.\n  According to GAO's report in 1995, the Department of Defense \nfinancial management systems, practices and procedures continue to be \nhampered by significant weaknesses. Here is what Secretary Perry said:\n\n       Our financial management system is a mess. It is costing us \n     money we desperately need.\n\n  Over $400 million in adjustments were made to correct errors in the \ndefense reporting data for fiscal years 1991 to 1993 and the resulting \nstatements still were not reliable. Vendors were literally paid $29 \nbillion that could not be matched with supporting documents to \ndetermine if the payments were properly made.\n We cannot even find out if they properly made the reports. An \nestimated $3 million in fraud payments made to a former Navy supply \nofficer for over 100 false invoice claims, and approximately $8 million \nin Army payroll payments were made to unauthorized persons, including 6 \nsoldiers who never existed and 76 deserters.\n\n  The park system--National Park Service financial system is in chaos. \nThe Park Service has listed that a $150 vacuum cleaner as worth more \nthan $800,000 on its books, a $350 dishwasher as worth $700,000, but a \nfire truck valued at $133,000 was carried on the books for only a \npenny.\n  The IRS keeps its records in a way that would not be acceptable for \nany of the people it audits. Literally, the GAO reports that although \nit collects 98 percent of the Government revenues, it has not kept its \nbooks and records with the same degree of accuracy it expects of its \ntaxpayers. For the last 2 years, GAO has been unable to express an \nopinion on the IRS financial statements due to ``serious accounting and \ninternal audit problems.'' Unreliable data is estimated on $71 billion \nof valid accounts receivable, over $90 billion of transactions that \nhave not been posted to taxpayer accounts and the inventory of tax debt \nhas increased from $87 to $156 billion.\n  Mr. President, I could go on. There are hundreds of examples of \noutrageous failures in the system. What is the solution? The bill I \nhave introduced today would establish generally accepted accounting \npractices for the Federal Government. It codifies generally accepted \naccounting standards for the Federal Government as set up by the \nFederal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, and approved by the GAO, \nTreasury, and OMB. It will also codify the standard general ledger.\n  Mr. President, what this will do is give us one standardized \naccounting system where the statements will be meaningful, accurate, \nand we cannot only save taxpayers money, but it will give Congress a \nbetter understanding of what the money is going for. Let me give one \nexample. When we sought to identify the over $100 billion in overhead \nexpenses this Government spends, we were literally unable to get an \naccurate accounting on what we spend on overhead, partly because there \nis not a standard set of accounts. This tool will not only save the \ntaxpayers money, but it will make Congress far more able to maximize \nthe dollars that the taxpayers send us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I know you have been alternating between \nboth sides of the aisle on our opening statements as far as welfare is \nconcerned. I notice my friend from Hawaii is on the floor. I would \ngladly yield to him, or I can go ahead and make my statement. He has \nindicated for me to proceed. I appreciate my friend from Hawaii.\n  I want to associate myself with the words of my good friend from \nColorado in introducing the bill to standardize the accounting system \nin this Government. When you are on the Appropriations Committee you \nreally understand that we cannot get any kind of accounting to make \nsome decisions. So I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11812-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11813-S11827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is with great importance that we not \nunderestimate the debate that is about to come on welfare reform. I do \nnot think there is one person who thinks the present system is working \nat its best. Maybe it is the best we could expect from it. But I can \nlist in Montana friend after friend who will tell you how it can be \nimproved, because if there is one subject that everybody has an opinion \non, it is welfare.\n  Right now, we have a system that only makes it easy to get on \nwelfare. But it makes it awfully tough to get off of it. There is \nsomething backward about that. Welfare is supposed to be a temporary \nassistance, not a way of life, and for too many it has become just \nthat.\n  I would like to talk about a young woman in Helena, MT, who is a \nsuccess story, not because of welfare assistance, but in spite of the \nexisting welfare system. At the age of 26, she found herself in the \nposition of being a single mother of four children under the age of 6. \nShe did not even know about welfare programs prior to that, but she \nsoon found out that in order for her to survive and to take care of her \nfour youngsters, she had no choice. Though, she wanted to keep on \nworking, the price of child care was more than she could afford. She \nwas getting AFDC but would not qualify for the transitional child care \nunless her AFDC case was closed. She tried to get off the system a \nnumber of times, but each time was unsuccessful. She got involved in a \nprocess, though, when she was appointed to the Governor's child care \ndevelopment block grant task force, and she soon found that she had to \nchoose between continuing employment or returning to the welfare rolls. \nHappily, she chose work and went through 8 months of increasing her \ndebt before child care funds could come through. Now, her bottom line \nis that of so many people who want to get out of the system, but they \njust get tired of fighting the system. Welfare did nothing to aid her \nindependence. In fact, it was just the opposite. All she needed was a \nlittle help with child care and she could have remained a self-\nsupporting member of our society. We have had a lot of visits in the \nmeantime, and she is doing very well now. But she says, ``If you help \nus a little bit with housing and with child care, the majority of us \ncan make it.''\n  This may have been avoided had it not taken 5\\1/2\\ years for her to \nreceive her first child support statement. This, too, she tried to \nfight on her own. The father had moved to California, and the \nCalifornia investigator informed her that she was just one of 21,000 \ncases in that State being handled and, basically, she had to wait her \nturn.\n  Well, she is off of welfare now. She has remarried. Her current \nhusband does provide support. She recently said, ``It seems that if you \nchoose to try and regain your self-worth, your self-esteem, dignity, \nand self-respect, and you go out and become a taxpaying citizen, you \nthen also choose to take food out of your children's mouths, provide \nless clothing, create more stresses in the home which sometimes leads \nto abuse and possibly loss of medical benefits.'' That should never be \na choice any American has to make.\n  So, Mr. President, our welfare system clearly needs reforming, but it \nneeds it in the right way. Right now, each dollar we spend on welfare--\nlet us say that of each dollar that we appropriate for welfare, 30 \ncents goes to direct assistance, while 70 cents--or 70 percent--goes to \npay for the services or the bureaucracy to deliver those funds. Seventy \npercent of that dollar supports the system and not the recipient. That \nsounds a little odd to me. It seems that the very first thing we need \nto do is reverse that, cut the bureaucracy, cut the miles of redtape, \nand get the dollars to those who need it.\n  Also, according to the Cato Institute, in 1990, it would have cost us \n$75 billion \n\n[[Page S 11814]]\nto bring every family in America with an income below the poverty level \nabove that threshold. Yet, in 1990, the Government antipoverty spending \nwas $184 billion, nearly 2\\1/2\\ times the amount needed to end poverty \nin America.\n  So why do we not just send them a check? It does not take a \nbureaucracy as big as an army to do that. So I do not think it is a \nmatter of whether we make changes, it is a matter of when we make those \nchanges. If we want to do something for the American society as we know \nit, we must act now, put people back in the work force --and I mean \nreal work, not job training after job training after job training, but \njob training followed by a job.\n  We have to end welfare as a way of life. People should not \nautomatically qualify for welfare and assistance. They should be on it \nfor just a limited time. We have to get away from this language called \nentitlement language. My State of Montana has gone ahead with their \nwelfare reform. They require their folks to work when they are ready. \nThat may be right away, and that may be after completing job training. \nAnd if for some reason after that training you are still not ready to \nwork, you must do community service. Now, it is too early to tell \nwhether it is successful or not, but I am willing to bet they will be \ngetting some folks off of welfare quicker than when no work is \nrequired.\n  Any bill we consider must include pay for performance. If someone \nshows up for work only half the time, then they only get half the \nbenefits. That makes sense to me and it makes sense to a lot of other \nfolks here in this country.\n  It is pure and simple a reality. Anyone in the work force knows how \nthat works. You show up for work you get paid; if you do not, you do \nnot get paid. Why should it work any different for someone trying to \nget off welfare? I believe it is a matter of personal responsibility.\n  We need to address our illegitimate rate. This is something that has \nbeen on the rise at almost dangerous levels and one thing that probably \ncontributes most to the decline in our society's strengths. More and \nmore children are growing up without a father.\n  Crime statistics show more crimes are committed by kids who were \nraised without a father. It may be tough to legislate, but if we can \nencourage families to stay together, toughen child support laws, get \nthe States to work toward reducing illegitimacy and thereby reduce the \nnumber of households headed by a single teenage mom, we can make a \nstart toward rebuilding what I believe is the greatest society this \nworld has ever known.\n  I think one of the most important things to do to help control \nwelfare is to give it over to the States. Montanans know what is best \nfor Montanans. I have said that before on a number of issues, but it \napplies here as well.\n  Block granting various programs to the State will allow them to use \nthe dollars to best serve their residents, but more importantly, by \ngetting the Federal Government out of the administration, it reduces \nredtape and regulations and the hoops they have to jump through. They \ncan concentrate strictly on helping those who need assistance and get \nthe dollars out to them.\n  I have a feeling that the 70 cents out of every $1 that goes to \nservices--not to the recipient but goes to pay the bureaucrats who live \nand thrive within the system--if we give the money directly to the \nStates, we are bypassing that morass and focusing on our target: \nAssisting folks who have fallen below the poverty level and helping \nthem to get back on their feet.\n  I have talked to my people in the State. In fact, we are in contact \nwith our people in Montana as this debate goes on. We will be in \ncontact with them daily. They welcome the opportunity to decide \nwhether, where, and how to spend those dollars. They want the \nflexibility, and we honestly believe they can control it better than we \ncan. I happen to believe that.\n  I am a product of local government. We understand what it is to run a \nwelfare office. In Montana, when we had declining incomes, declining \nproperty values, and therefore, declining tax base, Yellowstone County, \nwhich I was a commissioner of, was the only county that did not become \nwhat we call ``State assumed.'' We could control it; we administered it \nfrom the county level. We are very proud of that, very proud of that.\n  I look forward to this debate. I do not know of anybody that \nunderstands this situation more than the two managers of this piece of \nlegislation, who have spent more time studying it, both from the \nstandpoint of a system that delivers the welfare system and also the \ndollars it takes to provide welfare.\n  It cannot be business as usual, as both of them have a history of \nforecasting many years ago on exactly what would happen if we did not \ntake actions then. No action was taken then, so we find ourselves in a \npredicament now.\n  I was interested in what the Senator from Iowa said about the system \nin Iowa, my friend, Senator Harkin. They can do that in Iowa, but they \nhad to stand in line for 2 or 3 years before they obtained a waiver to \nput a system in that would work for Iowa.\n  The real key word here is ``flexibility'' and is not standing in line \nfor 2 or 3 years. The Senator from Oregon understands what they had to \ngo through in order to get their plan approved. It was disapproved and \ndisapproved, and it did not make any difference what administration it \nwas.\n  States should not have to do that. I have a hunch as the debate goes \non we will hear from the Federal bureaucracy. In fact, they make a \npowerful lobby because they understand who controls the multitude of \nprograms to keep the control right here in Washington, DC.\n  As those State plans come up, maybe I would not like the Oregon \nplans, maybe I would not like the Iowa plan. Maybe the Iowa plan would \nnot work for my home State of Montana. But it does for them. That is \nimportant. That is important to the folks that live there--block grants \nand flexibility. Those plans are a success. They have been devised by \npeople who are in on the ground, and they are devised by people who \ncare about those who have suffered maybe some injustice of the system \nbut have not had a very good break. They need a hand up and not a hand \ndown.\n  It makes a lot of difference when you are operating here than when \nyou are on the ground in the trenches trying to do something for your \nfellow man. It makes all the difference in the world.\n  I cannot help but think if these States and State offices, those \npeople who labor in that vineyard are some of the most dedicated people \nin this society. I do not want to demean them at all because they are \nwonderful, wonderful deliverers of help.\n  I think the key here is to cut the bureaucracy here, to cut the cost \nof delivering the system, and get more dollars to the people who \nreally, really need it. How we get there will probably be the focus of \nthe debate. Keep our eye on the ball and work together. As this debate \ngoes on, I think that we are men and women enough to fashion a plan to \nget us to where we want to be.\n  I thank the managers of the bill. I thank the President. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii would like to \nspeak on this matter, and we would like to hear from him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York for the \ntime.\n  Mr. President, this week, we begin consideration of legislation to \noverhaul our welfare system. As we reform welfare, we must take action \nto encourage work and promote personal responsibility. However, we must \nalso ensure that adequate resources are available to achieve these \nobjectives. Without adequate resources to implement essential \ncomponents of any welfare reform proposal--such as work requirements, \nreduction of teen pregnancy, child care, and child support \nenforcement--welfare reform cannot succeed.\n  I am seriously concerned about the adverse impact of the legislation \ncurrently pending before us. Although I am troubled by a number of \nprovisions, including the lack of sufficient resources for child care, \nthe lack of national standards, and the restrictions on assistance for \nlegal immigrants, I would like to focus my remarks on some very basic \nflaws of the Republican proposal. \n\n[[Page S 11815]]\n\n  First, it seems that the driving force behind Republican reform \nefforts is the potential Federal budget savings that may accrue as a \nresult of changes in current law. I believe our primary goal should be \nto lessen dependency on welfare programs by enabling individuals to \nbecome self-sufficient while reducing Federal spending on welfare \nprograms.\n  However, the legislation before us fails to address the difficult \nproblem of moving individuals into the work force. Although the work \nrequirement has been refined to actually require work, it is an empty \nrequirement. By increasing the number of welfare recipients required to \nspend time outside the home, but not increasing funds for child care, \nthe Republican plan places significant additional burdens on States \nthat are trying to comply with the bill. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services estimates that States would need to spend $6.9 billion \nmore in fiscal year 2000 than projected under current law in order to \nmeet the work requirements but would receive $3.6 billion less in \nfunding for the temporary family assistance block grant. Over the 7-\nyear period, States would need to spend an additional $23.7 billion on \nwork services and child care but would receive $21.2 billion less in \nfunding from the temporary family assistance block grant. Indeed, the \nRepublican plan has the potential to shift huge costs to local \ngovernments as the block grants provide no assurance that local \ngovernments will be provided with sufficient program funding.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle recall, earlier this \nyear, the Senate passed the unfunded mandates legislation with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. The new law, signed by the President \non March 21, 1995, was designed to make it more difficult for Congress \nto pass future unfunded mandates. Now, before that law takes effect, \nsome of my colleagues want to enact welfare reform legislation which \nhas the potential of passing huge additional costs on to the States.\n  Another serious problem with the Republican proposal is that it would \neliminate the safety net for millions of children living in poverty. \nThe block grant locks State governments into a fixed funding level for \nfive years based on each State's current share of Federal Aid to \nFamilies With Dependent Children. The block grants in the proposal \ncontain virtually no adjustments for inflation, recession, or increases \nin child poverty within States. Under the Republican approach, which \nrips away the entitlement status of welfare, needy children may or may \nnot get help, depending on local economic conditions and the discretion \nof local officials.\n  Based on these and other concerns, Senate Democrats, under the \nleadership of Senator Daschle, have crafted an alternative package that \ncontains real reforms. I support the Work First plan because it \nrequires work and personal responsibility, it provides resources and \nincentives for moving recipients into the work force, it is estimated \nto save $20 billion in the next 7 years, and of paramount importance, \nit protects children at every stage.\n  In contrast to the Republican proposal, the Work First plan maintains \nthe entitlement status of welfare assistance programs as all \nindividuals who meet the eligibility requirements and who abide by the \nrules will receive assistance. Instead of shifting costs to States and \nlocalities, the Work First plan provides resources and tools to the \nStates to help move individuals into the work force. This is, in large \npart, a primary reason why the U.S. Conference of Mayors endorsed the \nWork First plan.\n  As we consider welfare reform legislation, a carefully constructed \napproach must be taken--one that balances flexibility for States with \nthe need for a national framework, accountability for outcomes, and \neffective protection for our Nation's children and families. As \nPresident Clinton stated in his speech to the National Governors \nAssociation on July 31, ``There is common ground on welfare. We want \nsomething that's good for children, that's good for the welfare \nrecipients, that's good for the taxpayers, and that's good for \nAmerica.'' I could not agree with his comments more, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to enact welfare reform legislation that \nbenefits all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the Work First plan of the \nDemocrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, could I take just a moment of the \nSenate's time to express the honor I feel, as so many of us feel, to \nshare this Chamber with the Senator from Hawaii. He is a person of such \ntransparent goodness, thoughtfulness, and measured concern. His \nstatement is a model of what I hope to hear more of, and what I would \nlike to see this Chamber respond to.\n  I thank him and I want to tell him what an honor it is to be \nassociated with him in this debate.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator very much and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, yesterday, when I made an opening \ncomment on welfare, I talked about the philosophy of the different \napproaches between the two parties. It is well illustrated in the \nminority leader's bill that Senator Daschle will present, and the bill \nthat Senator Dole and I have presented, in terms of giving authority, \npower, decisionmaking--call it what you want--back to the States.\n  The argument is used: This is Federal money, and if it is Federal \nmoney, we ought to tell the States how to spend it, how to use it. I \nmade the argument that while legally this may be Federal money, and in \na court suit I suppose we could defend our legal right to it, in \nreality it is the taxpayers' money. We hold it in trust for some \nlimited period of time and spend it as a trustee should, in the best \nway possible for the beneficiaries, that is the taxpayers.\n  We should not get caught up in the argument as to whether this money \nis ours, that is the Federal Government, or the States, or the local \ngovernments, and that whoever thinks they own the money should put the \nstrings on how it is spent. There is nothing wrong, even if we make the \nargument this is our money, with us giving it to the States and letting \nthem spend it as they think best.\n  With that background, let me explain what has happened over the years \nand why the States so desperately want us to block this money together \nand give it to them and let them attempt to solve the problems. I say \n``attempt.'' The Washington Post had an editorial this morning somewhat \ncritical of me because I said I cannot guarantee that--if we give these \nprograms to the States I cannot guarantee the States can make them \nwork. I can guarantee, however, the States cannot do any worse than \nwhat the Federal Government is doing now.\n  We have been trying to make welfare work for 60 years. The welfare \nsystem started in 1935. If anyone wants to make the defense that after \n60 years of the Federal Government running the welfare system it is \nworking, I have yet to hear it on this floor. It is not working, and we \nare not going to make it work by tinkering with it a bit around the \nedges, by creating one more Rube Goldberg attachment to an already \noverburdened Rube Goldberg device.\n  What happened? Here is the 1935 section of the Social Security Act \nthat created the present welfare system. It is 2\\1/4\\ pages long. That \nis it. That is where we started. And there were no regulations.\n  There was a little pamphlet which kind of told the States how this \nworked. But there was no regulations. Sixty years later, where are we? \nFrom 2\\1/4\\ pages, we have come to this. This is only part of it. These \nare the regulations that a caseworker in Oregon has to be familiar with \nand go through in order to determine a person's eligibility for \nwelfare. And they had better jolly well know it and do it well or \nOregon can be sued by the Federal Government for not complying with the \nFederal regulations.\n  I emphasize this is only to determine eligibility. Once you are \neligible, not how much money you get, or not once you are eligible, how \nlong before we try to put you to work, or something else; just that you \nare eligible.\n  Here is the path of the reason. Here is the eligibility process. In \ncomes Jimmy Jones or Susie Smith. ``I would like to apply for \nwelfare.'' The caseworker says, ``Hello, Jimmy and Susie. Can you give \nme proof of identity, age, \n\n[[Page S 11816]]\nand citizenship? I want your driver's license, Social Security card, \nbirth verification for each person, alien registration and your arrival \nand departure record, or any other identification from any other agency \nor organization.''\n  That is the first thing they ask you. Assuming Jimmy or Susie \nactually understands what an alien registration and arrival or \ndeparture record is, whether they have a Social Security card for each \nperson, let us say we get to the first person.\n  We now move over to the proof of relationship and child in the house. \nWe want a signed and dated statement from a friend or relative naming \neach child and the child's residence, birth certificate or other \ndocuments stating the parent's name.\n  That is simple enough.\n  Then we will move over here--proof of residence and shelter costs. \nHow much are your electric bills, paid or unpaid; gas or fuel bills, \npaid or unpaid; rent or lease agreement; rent receipt and landlord \nstatement; mortgage payment and book; deed to the property and proof of \nhousing subsidies?\n  Assuming poor Jimmy or Susie actually has access to it, knows what it \nis, has gathered it all together along with their driver's license, \nSocial Security card, alien registration form, names of all children or \nproof from some relative who knows who they are, who is living in the \nhouse. We now have gone through to here: Proof of family situation; \ndeath certificate for deceased parent; divorce papers or separation \npapers showing the date, if separated, a statement from friend, \nneighbor, or relative that you are separated; marriage certificate; if \nin prison, the date of imprisonment and the length of sentence; if \npregnant, medical statement with expected delivery date, name of \ndoctor, name of hospital and doctor's statement. Poor Susie and Jimmy \nis gathering up more information.\n  Now we come to here: Does anyone here have any income? It is a very \nimportant question. Do you have any income? If no, we go this way. Let \nus go to ``no.'' All right, we want to check your bank statement, \ncurrent checking account statements, real estate documents, payment \nbooks or receipts from all mortgages, land sales, list of all stocks \nand bonds with current market value. My hunch is they do not have a \nlot. By chance, they may have some.\n  We want title for all motor vehicles, agreements or documents showing \nconditions, trust fund, insurance policies. This is all to prove, in \nessence, that you have nothing.\n  I am not quite sure how you prove a negative. ``No, I do not have any \nstocks or bonds nor a bank statement, book.''\n  ``I do not have, I do not have.''\n  How do we know you are telling the truth. ``I do not have it.''\n  Now, if it is ``no,'' we finally get an annual eligibility decision \nover here. But if the poor devil has some income, now you are in \nserious trouble.\n  ``Does anyone here have any income?'' If yes, proof of income.\n  Now we go to uncashed workmen's compensation, other benefits check, \nSocial Security or VA benefit, a court order stating alimony--go \nthrough all of that.\n  The one that I like, you do not count for purposes of income--but you \ndo count. You do not count for purposes of income. Adoption assistance \nfor a child's special needs, do not count that. But you do count as \nincome adoption assistance if not for special needs. This is assuming \nthat Susie or Jimmy knows what special needs are.\n  Here is my favorite. ``Do not count benefits from the agent orange \nsettlement fund, Aetna Life.'' We do not count as income benefits from \nthe agent orange settlement fund, Aetna Life. We do count as income, \nhowever, payments under the Agent Orange Act of 1991. That is income.\n  I could go down this list. Here is another one of my favorites. We do \ncount as lump sum the amounts over $2,000 of payments to Seminole Tribe \nmembers. We count that. We do not count, however, payments to Indians \nunder Public Law 91-114.\n  If you have finally gone through all of this, you may finally at the \nend of it became eligible for welfare--just eligible. This is just \nSusie or Jimmy. What has the State had to go through? Why does it cost \nthem so much money? Why do we have this stack of regulations? Because \nthese are the things you have to know to understand this. That is just \nthe first step because this is not just welfare, AFDC, as we call it; \nthere is also food stamps.\n  Food stamps have a different standard of eligibility from welfare, \nand there are 57 major areas of difference between Federal policies as \nthey affect the Food Stamp Program and the welfare program, and yet \nthese programs serve in many cases the same person. Usually, if you are \neligible for welfare you are probably eligible for food stamps, but \nthis does not qualify you for both. That just qualifies you for AFDC, \nif you can get through.\n  Then you go to food stamps. What has Oregon had to do? The \ninformation I am giving you comes from Jim Neely, who is the assistant \nadministrator for Oregon's adult and family services division. This is \nour principal welfare division.\n  Oregon has 600 administrative rules, of which this stack is a part: \nTwo volumes of computer guides, 1,452 pages; one volume of form guides, \n270 pages; eligibility manual, 871 pages; workers guide, 910 pages--all \nof which you, as a caseworker, are expected to know. These regulations \nare used to determine welfare eligibility and to make welfare payments. \nLess than 15 percent of this information deals with helping people \nbecome self-sufficient through employment.\n  As a matter of fact, most of this information is not really designed \nto help the person at all other than to get them a welfare payment. \nThis information is gathered to make sure that the State of Oregon does \nnot get sued by the Department of Health and Human Services or the \nDepartment of Agriculture because they have food stamps and claim that \nwe have not had sufficient quality control to monitor the program.\n  So I emphasize again, we are doing these things to comply with the \nFederal law.\n  Mr. Neely in the letter that he sent said this Oregon Department of \nAdult and Family Services files 550 reports a year with the Federal \nGovernment; 550--roughly 1\\1/2\\ every day, Saturdays and Sundays \nincluded; that is our welfare division--spends 20 percent of their \nresources complying with Federal regulations, 20 percent beyond any \nlevel necessary to run what we would call a seamless welfare program.\n  The Federal regulations have also interfered with Oregon's efforts to \nmove welfare recipients into the work force. Oregon must now spend an \nenormous amount of time and resources documenting how welfare \ncaseworkers spend this time.\n  Can you believe this, Mr. President? A welfare caseworker must \ndocument what they are doing during every 6-minute segment of the day. \nI know lawyers do that. I can recall the time charts in a lawyer's \noffice where you put, ``10 o'clock, I talked with client Jones.'' You \nput that down. I do not know if lawyers bill in less than 15-minute \nquarters. No matter how much they talk, they keep all the time, and \nthat is the way they bill. The caseworker accounts for every 6 minutes \nso that this time is properly allocated to different moneys the State \nis eligible to receive.\n  The welfare worker is doing the welfare workload. It may be welfare, \nor it may be food stamps. It might be job training. But all of these \nare separate amounts of money that come from the Federal Government \nwith their own regulations.\n  So for the State to be able to say caseworker Jones spent 2 hours and \n14 minutes on Wednesday on food stamps, you have to be able to document \nit.\n  In addition, the coding system that the caseworkers use to code each \n6 minutes, they have 110 different time reporting codes. You just do \nnot put down, ``10 o'clock to 10:06, Susie Smith.'' You put down the \ncode for what it was you were doing. You have to figure from the 110 \ncodes the correct one so that you are in compliance.\n  Mr. Neely estimates that less than 10 percent of agency time is spent \non what we call JOBS activities, capital J-O-B-S.\n  Less than 10 percent is spent on JOBS Program activities and 90 \npercent is spent on attempting to prove what they have done--programmed \nadministration. Now, you know what the argument is? We need a waiver \nprocess and we do not need to really block grant and give these \nprograms to the \n\n[[Page S 11817]]\nState and say, here, use this money for the poor as best you see fit. \nYou have to make them work. But you use it as best you see fit.\n  The argument is, well, we can have a waiver process. And the Federal \nGovernment, if you apply to them, will give you a waiver from all of \nthese regulations I have been talking about.\n  Mr. President, I have been through this. I went through it with the \nState of Oregon when we tried to get a waiver that would let us take \nfood stamp money and in certain circumstances ``cash it out,'' as we \ncall it. Instead of giving food stamps to a person, we say we will help \nyou get a job.\n  We coordinated it with our JOBS Program. We had to get waivers for \nboth of them. And we would say to an employer, we will give you x \namount of money if you will hire Susie Smith. And we will give the \nemployer the subsidy from the food stamp money because we would rather \nhave Susie have a job that paid more than AFDC and food stamps \ncombined.\n  In order for Oregon to make these reforms, we had to apply to both \nthe Department of Health And Human Services for a waiver, and to the \nDepartment of Agriculture for a waiver. In some cases, State must apply \nto the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, and to the \nDepartment of Labor. All four of these departments are responsible for \nprograms in one way or another that affect low-income families, the \ncurrent welfare system, welfare as we know it. But there is no \ncoordination between the departments in granting waivers, and the \nrequirements of each department are different.\n  So I am going to just read what happened in order for Oregon to get a \nwaiver and why, having had this experience, I feel so strongly we ought \nto block these programs together and give them to New York, give them \nto Oregon and say, here, you make it work. Let us get rid of this stack \nof rules and regulations.\n  In November 1990, ballot measure 7 was passed by the voters of \nOregon. It was an innovative workfare demonstration, but it did not \nqualify for Federal waivers. Federal officials said that substantial \nchanges would have to be made in the program the way the voters had \npassed it and we would have to apply for the waivers. That is November \n1990.\n  We got no waiver for years. Jump forward now 2\\1/2\\ years to July \n1993. The JOBS Plus--this is the J-O-B-S Plus Program as Oregon called \nit--was created by the Oregon Legislature in response to this 1990 \nballot measure. We could not even get going on it because we could not \nget any help from the Federal Government. The Governor and the \nDepartment of Human Resources worked with the ballot measure's \nsupporters to create a workable alternative. But in order for Oregon to \ntry this JOBS Plus Program, it was still necessary to get waivers from \nsome of these Federal departments.\n  On September 28, 1993, Mr. Neely, to whom I have previously referred, \nthe assistant administrator for adult and family services, writes to \nLouis Weissman, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of the \nAdministration for Children and Families, requesting suggestions on the \ndraft waiver request. That is September 28.\n  September 30. Mr. Neely writes to Steve Pichel, Western Region State \nProgram Officer for food stamps, requesting suggestions on the draft \nwaiver request. This is because we have to apply to one Department, \nHealth and Human Services, for the AFDC waiver. We have to apply to \nanother Department, Agriculture, for the food stamp waiver.\n  Two weeks later, on October 18, formal request for waivers for the \nJOBS Plus Demonstration Program was sent to Mary Jo Bane, the Assistant \nSecretary for the Administration for Children and Families of Health \nand Human Services.\n  A day later, October 19, a request for food stamp waivers to \nimplement the JOBS Plus Program was sent to Dennis Stewart, the \nRegional Director for the Food Stamp Program, U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Ten days later, Governor Roberts, our then Governor, sent a letter to \neach member of the Oregon delegation asking for our help in getting \nthese waivers.\n  Three weeks after that, Kevin Concannon, the director of the \ndepartment of health and human services; Stephen Minnich, the \nadministrator of adult and family services; and Jim Neely, the \nassistant administrator, came here to meet with Health and Human \nServices and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials.\n  In January 1994, Governor Roberts requested Congressmen Wyden and \nKopetski to meet with the new administration and see if we could get \nthe waivers that we wanted.\n  January 5, 1994. A letter goes to Bruce Reed, the Deputy Assistant to \nthe President for Domestic Policy, from Kevin Concannon, asking his \nintervention on Oregon's behalf with the Department of Agriculture.\n  January 14, 1994. A letter is sent from Jim Neely to Bonny O'Neil, \nActing Deputy Administrator for Food Stamps, to follow up on the \nNovember meeting.\n  I will not read the rest of what goes on. It goes on for another 10 \npages of letters, meetings, requests, refusals to grant the waiver, \nsuggestions as to how we had to change it, pare it, make it different \nto fit Federal standards. And I will not bother to read the six pages \nof my personal involvement with this --phone calls, letters, meetings.\n  That is what it took to get a waiver so that Oregon could try an \nexperimental program combining AFDC and food stamps and work.\n  Mr. President, it is working. It is working. It would have worked a \nlot faster and it would have worked a lot better if Oregon could have \nput this into effect immediately, if Oregon could have gotten rid of \nthat stack of documents immediately.\n  So when those who oppose the Dole-Packwood bill say we can do this \nwith waivers, here is an example of an attempt to do it with waivers. \nAt the end, after 3\\1/2\\ years--pardon me, 4\\1/2\\ years--did we finally \nget the waiver, did we finally get the waiver in the form we wanted it \nand do exactly what we wanted? No. Do we still have to do more reports \nthan we think we should? Yes. Is our program working? It is.\n  There is not a State in this country that does not know better than \nwe in Washington, DC, know what their problems are. And there is \nprobably not a county in a State that does not know their problems \nbetter than the State government. And there is probably not a \nneighborhood in the county that does not know its problems better than \nthe county government.\n  The closer we can get this program back to the local level, the \nbetter it is going to work and the more money that can be spent on \nhelping people instead of filing forms.\n  So, Mr. President, I very much hope when we are done with this, we \nwill pass the Dole-Packwood bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan].\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I respond to my friend and chairman after a very \ngraphic, very powerful statement. I wonder if we have not wandered, \nperhaps without anticipating it, into a larger subject, which is that \nof bureaucracy in America and central government in America, federalism \nin America.\n  The President in his 1992 campaign, starting with an address at \nGeorgetown University in 1991, proposed to end welfare as we know it. \nHe had in mind, I think he clearly had in mind the proposals set forth \nby David Ellwood in his book ``Poor Support,'' which was published in \n1988, which the chairman knows, on poverty and the American family.\n And Dr. Ellwood is now the academic dean of the Kennedy School. He has \nleft Washington, but he had an idea for the type of limited welfare \nwhich would involve very much larger expenditures than we now have.\n\n  The bill that was proposed finally toward the end of the second year \nof the administration would have cost $11,762,000,000 over 5 years; $12 \nbillion in additional outlays, which is a sense of what we have. But \ntalking about ending welfare as we know it, it seems to me we have \nbegun the debate about ending the Department of Health and Human \nServices as we know it.\n  The pattern here is discouraging, but it is also predictable. When \nGovernment gives away money, there is only one way an administrator can \nget in \n\n[[Page S 11818]]\ntrouble, only one way a caseworker can get in trouble. And I wonder if \nmy friend would not agree with me, the only way to get in trouble is \ngiving money to someone who is not entitled to it, giving money by \nmistake, giving money by modes that could be depicted as inappropriate, \nimproper, felonious, for that matter.\n  It is in the nature of a Government program to say that we have to be \nabsolutely certain that you are eligible before you would be given \nmoney. And that will overwhelm any other enterprise.\n  The most striking line on the Senator's chart there, Federal Barriers \nTo Moving Welfare Recipients Into Work, State Of Oregon, is that only \n10 percent of agency time is spent on JOBS activities.\n  Now, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Program began with the \n1988 Family Support Act. It was the first effort to redefine welfare to \nsay this is not a widow's pension with an indefinite stay assumed. This \nis a program to help young persons who are in need of assistance to get \nout of a dependent mode into an independent life through job \nopportunities.\n  And all the years since we passed that legislation--and I recall--I \nhave said several times, it went out the Senate door 96-1 in 1988, 96-\n1. We rarely have such a vote. But no one from the Department of Health \nand Human Services has ever come near this Senator--I do not think \nthere would be any other one--to say, ``You know, we are not getting as \nmuch out of this legislation as we hoped for because we are bogged down \nin administrative procedure.'' I see my friend from Oregon is agreeing. \nWe can get 10 percent of the time in Oregon; and Oregon is not a State \noverwhelmed with this problem.\n  Oregon is not the city of Los Angeles with 62 percent of its children \non welfare. It is not the city of New York with more than half a \nmillion children on welfare. There are about 11 States in the Union \nthat have a total population that is smaller than the welfare \npopulation of New York State. This is not being evenly distributed.\n  But it is clear that here in Washington a responsible bureaucracy has \nnot sensed how irresponsible its procedures have come to be seen in the \nNation. How almost conspiratorial they have come to be seen, as if you \nare trying to prevent us from doing what we would like to do. There is \na hidden agenda in all these--``Did you get yellow rain benefits under \nthis program? That is all right; that program, not all right.'' Clearly \nthere is some hidden motive in such seemingly absurd distinctions.\n  That is the condition of the Federal Government. We look up and we \nfind park rangers--as a child I do not know that there was any more of \na benevolent role that a person could have than to be a park ranger \nwith a Smokey Bear hat, welcoming you to Yellowstone Park or the Statue \nof Liberty, as a matter of fact.\n  Suddenly they are being threatened, seen as oppressors. They are seen \nas persons involved in illicit acts intended on depriving citizens of \ntheir liberties. Well, bureaucracies that do not get that message will \nhear what the Department of Health and Human Services is hearing on the \nSenate floor. I have not heard one statement on either side of the \naisle which has not in particular taken up the issue of the bureaucracy \nhere in Washington. It is not large, 327 persons, but, indeed, neither \nhas it been sensitive to the way it is perceived.\n  As I say, in 19 years in the Senate dealing with this subject, no one \nhas ever come to us from that Department--it was HEW when it began, \nwhen I first arrived--saying, ``We do have a problem here. I think we \nhave some ways to deal with it.'' It was the same thing, if I may say, \nuntil last year when we enacted legislation which came out of the \nFinance Committee to take the Social Security Administration out of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services where it kind of ended up after \nfloating around in the 1940's.\n  A majority of nonretired adults do not think they will receive Social \nSecurity. Now, that is a statement of a lack of confidence in \nGovernment that is pretty striking. If people think that the Government \nis lying about that, which is pretty elemental, your retirement \nbenefits, your retirement and disability insurance, what else do they \nthink? But it has not troubled the Department of Health and Human \nServices that persons did not believe in this most elemental contract. \nI mean, a person is paying for their Social Security benefits. Seventy \npercent of the American people, adults, taxpayers, pay more in Social \nSecurity payroll taxes, combining the employer and employee, than they \ndo in income tax.\n  If a majority of the nonretired adults think that the Government is \nlying, well, that is a problem which the administrators could not see \nbecause they felt they were not lying. In time you will find out we \nwere not. We have never been a day late or a dollar short. It did not \ntrouble them. And I have made the point, if you do not think you are \ngoing to get Social Security, you will not miss it when they take it \naway. Despite efforts to get earnings statements and a decent card to \nreplace that pasteboard from the 1930's, we had no success.\n  We have earning statements now. We had to legislate them, Mr. \nPresident. They could have done it entirely on their own. But we had to \ntell people, ``Yes, we know your name. We know what you made last year. \nWe recorded it as such. Keep on going about the way you are going and \nthis is what you will expect when you are 65.'' I mean, a simple \nstatement that banks put out once a month, insurance companies put out \nonce a year, that kind of thing.\n  I have heard things on the floor that disturb me. And there is a lack \nof response. If there is anybody in the Department of Health and Human \nServices listening, may I say, ``You may be listening to the case being \nmade for abolishing your Department.'' It has been dismantled piece by \npiece. Education was taken out. Social Security was taken out. Pretty \nsoon there will not be--the Surgeon General's office is not being \nfunded. In time there may be nothing left except the Hubert H. Humphrey \nBuilding. I wish he were alive, but I would not wish him to be alive to \nsee what is going on today.\n  I see my very good friend, Senator Abraham, is on the floor. And in \nthe manner we have of alternating statements, I will be happy to yield \nthe floor for the remarks by my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nAbraham], is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it has been almost 30 years since Lyndon \nJohnson began the much publicized War on Poverty--30 years and $5.4 \ntrillion later. It seems to me that poverty is winning that war. \nToday's poverty rate of 15.1 percent is actually higher than the 14.7 \npercent it was in 1966 when the war on poverty began.\n  What is more, as a result of impersonal, family-destroying welfare \npolicies, we now have what the First Lady herself terms ``cities filled \nwith hopeless girls with babies and angry boys with guns.''\n  Former Reagan Education Secretary Bill Bennett's index of leading \ncultural indicators shows that while population increased only 41 \npercent between 1960 and 1990, the violent crime rate increased more \nthan 500 percent; the teen suicide rate more than tripled; and the \ndivorce rate more than doubled. Also since 1960, illegitimate births \nincreased more than 400 percent. By the end of this decade, 40 percent \nof all births in America will occur without benefit of marriage.\n  We now know that the children who never know their fathers fare far \nworse in crucial aspects of life than do children who grow up with both \nparents. For example, children of single parents are twice as likely to \ndrop out of high school, 2\\1/2\\ times as likely to become teen mothers, \nand 1.4 times as likely to be idle, out of school and out of work, as \nchildren who grew up with both parents.\n  Why do we have such high rates of out-of-wedlock births with all the \nbad consequences it brings? In significant part, I think it is because \nwe have a welfare system that discourages the formation of intact two-\nparent families, all this while costing America's taxpayers $380 \nbillion per year.\n  Mr. President, the welfare system is broken. I do not think there is \nanyone in America who believes the present system is working--not the \nrecipients of welfare, not the bureaucrats who administer welfare \nprograms, and certainly not the taxpayers who pay for them.\n  I say we have to stop spending $380 billion a year on welfare only to \n\n\n[[Page S 11819]]\nproduce more welfare dependency, more poverty, more broken families, \nmore babies born out of wedlock into lives of desperation without hope \nor solace.\n  Mr. President, this is not a debate about just another Government \nprogram. It is a debate about our children. It is a debate about \nwhether we are willing to do what is necessary to save literally \nmillions of American kids with futures without parents and too often \nwithout hope.\n  Some of our colleagues and others who are interested in this subject \nhave come forth in recent days claiming that any approach that empowers \nthe States to make their own welfare choices will somehow be less \nhelpful to America's children. I ask my colleagues, and others who \nespouse this view, a simple question: What has been the legacy of the \ncurrent welfare system to children? Let me repeat some of the points I \nmentioned earlier.\n  First, both overall poverty and child poverty is higher than when the \nwar on poverty began. Second, the teen suicide rate more than tripled \nbetween 1960 and 1990. Third, the rate of out-of-wedlock births has \nincreased more than 400 percent since 1960. Again, children of single \nparents are far more likely to drop out of high school, become teen \nmothers, be out of work and out of school as children who grow up with \nboth parents. And so, Mr. President, it is my view that if this is what \nconstitutes a caring approach that helps our children, count me out. I \nwill take my chances with a new approach that vests power and authority \nwith the States.\n  Our current welfare system is not working, and that is why reform is \nso important. The question is, what form should the new system take? I \nbelieve that any truly successful reform attempt must be guided by \nthree core principles: Reform must consolidate and reduce welfare \nprograms and bureaucracy; it must promote certain national objectives, \nsuch as strengthening families, self-sufficiency, and personal \nresponsibility; and it must allow maximum State flexibility.\n  First, welfare reform must consolidate and reduce Federal welfare \nprograms and bureaucracy. There are at least 79 duplicative and \noverlapping welfare programs designed to aid the poor, ranging from \nAFDC to food stamps to public housing. If reform is to be successful, I \nthink the system of assistance we provide must be comprehensive and \nintegrated so that all of the component parts fit together coherently.\n  Further, welfare reform must cut the welfare bureaucracy, not expand \nit. According to the Heritage Foundation, ``Welfare bureaucracies are \nprolific in inventing new programs which allegedly promote self-\nsufficiency but accomplish nothing or actually draw more people into \nwelfare dependence.''\n  Second, welfare reform must establish and achieve several Federal \ngoals: Specifically, strengthening families, requiring personal \nresponsibility, and promoting self-sufficiency. I do not believe that \nthe Federal Government should, or effectively can, design welfare \nprograms for all 50 States and accomplish these goals. But I think it \nshould set the goals in place and then give States the opportunity to \nfulfill them.\n  We have tried a centralized, Washington-based welfare system for 30 \nyears, and it has been a failure.\n  So I say let us leave the details to those closest in proximity to \nthe people and their problems. But the Federal Government must have its \nvoice heard as we work to support the fundamental principle that people \nmust put forth some effort, that we must try to create intact families \nand encourage their formation in exchange for the assistance they \nreceive.\n  So, third, welfare reform must also allow for maximum State \nflexibility and experimentation. States must be given the authority to \ndesign the day-to-day regimen of their programs and to respond to the \nunique needs and circumstances that cannot be anticipated or \nappreciated by the Federal Government.\n  The current system at least provides States the opportunities to seek \nwaivers from certain Federal requirements. But this waiver system has \nproven to be clumsy and time consuming. It is laborious and often \nstalls or even kills innovative ideas.\n  For example, my State of Michigan still is seeking a waiver so that \nit can implement its idea to cash out food stamps for clients who are \nworking. Michigan thinks this would be an excellent way to reward aid \nrecipients who are making progress toward self-sufficiency. The program \nwould eliminate the stigma of using food stamps for those who work to \nat least partially support themselves; in other words, so that people \ndo not have to go to the grocery store with food stamps and continue to \nfeel that they are not productive in their own right. Unfortunately, \nthe State has been waiting for approval from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture for this waiver since March 1994.\n  In short, Mr. President, the waiver system is inefficient because it \nputs the least innovative bureaucrats in bureaucracies--indeed, those \nbureaucracies at the Federal level who have the least incentive to make \ndramatic changes to the system, because many of them might lose their \njobs--in charge of approving or disapproving new program ideas \nsubmitted by the most innovative Government agencies, those at the \nState and local level.\n  Unfortunately, far too much of the State's time and resources are \nspent either complying with onerous Federal requirements or seeking \nwaivers.\n  In my State of Michigan, it has been estimated that front-line \nwelfare workers, those who deliver the services to Michigan's neediest \nfamilies, spend two-thirds of their time interpreting the dizzying \narray of complex and arcane Federal rules and filling out paperwork, \neither to support those regulations or to seek waivers from them.\n  We have had reports on this in several hearings in which I \nparticipated as a member of the Budget Committee. I was listening to \nthis testimony from people who actually were on the front line of the \nwelfare battle that persuaded me that it was time to really change \ndirection and give the States the kind of authority that we are \nconsidering this week, because when I realized that two-thirds of the \nfront-line welfare worker's time was being spent not helping people but \nfilling out forms, I realized that redtape from Washington was a major \nsource of the problem with our welfare system today.\n  So, Mr. President, using these three guiding principles for welfare \nreform, I believe the best approach would be to combine as many welfare \nprograms as possible into a single block grant and give the States \nauthority to battle local problems, to develop innovative welfare \nreforms, and to tailor reforms to local circumstances with as few \nWashington rules, regulations, mandates, and strings attached as \npossible.\n  We all want to reduce the number of out of wedlock births and \nincrease incentives to work. But Federal mandates and strings that do \nnot allow States to take into account their own varying local \ncircumstances can only have adverse consequences. Each State has \ndifferent poverty populations which may require different reforms to \nachieve the best results.\n  Mr. President, many of our colleagues have raised concerns about the \nblock grant approach. Specifically, some oppose the no strings block \ngrant approach because they believe that State and local government \nleaders will not fulfill their requirements and their obligations to \ntake care of the needy.\n  Instead of doing their best to help poor people, on this view, State \nofficials will, if freed from Washington control, commence a race to \nthe bottom. States will compete with one another to cut welfare \nbenefits so as to convince recipients to settle elsewhere. The result, \nit is said, will be mothers and children left with little or no \nassistance from the State. According to this view, only bureaucrats in \nWashington have the brains and heart to make decent welfare policy that \nwill help all who deserve it.\n  Mr. President, I cannot speak for any other colleagues here, but for \nmyself, I know of no one that would let this happen. This is not the \n1850's, or even the 1950's. We are entering the 21st century. State and \npublic officials do care about their citizens. In fact, I think they \nprobably care about them more than the people do here in Washington.\n  I would challenge those who adhere to this race-to-the-bottom notion \nto tell us what State--name the State--\n\n[[Page S 11820]]\nthat would allow its families and children to fall through the social \nsafety net.\n  Again, I cannot speak for every State official, but I can assure you \nthat, in my State of Michigan, we can and will continue to take care of \nour people. For example, in this era of fiscal austerity and tight \nbudgets, our State held the line and protected education funding from \ncuts and dramatically increased spending for children at risk. In \naddition, we have achieved a long-awaited reduction in the infant \nmortality rate, and other similar kinds of project lines designed to \nhelp the most needy and the most at risk among our population.\n  I think this example of Michigan shows how our States, if allowed the \nnecessary flexibility, can come to grips with the problem of welfare \ndependency that is plaguing our Nation.\n  With only limited flexibility under AFDC waivers, Michigan Governor \nJohn Engler managed to get 90,000 welfare recipients off the rolls and \ninto paid jobs. Governor Engler did this not by abandoning the poor but \nby asking them to sign a social contract that committed them to \nworking, engaging in job training, or volunteering in the community at \nleast 20 hours per week.\n  Our Governor and legislature also let welfare mothers--and this is \ninnovation--keep the first $200 per month of their earnings without \ncounting it against their assistance. And he let them keep 20 percent \nof the money they earned after the $200 cutoff point. The effect was \npredictable. It was one in which people had a much greater incentive to \nbe productive, get into the work force, and get out of the cycle of \ndependency. The success is, I think, rather staggering.\n  Since the policy began in October 1992, average earnings by AFDC \nrecipients have gone up 16 percent to $460 a month as of April. The \npercentage of cases with earned income has skyrocketed, in Michigan \nterms, to 27.6 percent--triple the national average.\n  As explained recently in the Detroit Free Press, the ability to keep \npart of their earnings prodded recipients to accept low-level, first-\nrung-of-the-economic-ladder type jobs. As they gain more experience, \nthey work longer hours and begin to land higher paying jobs. Thousands \nof them ended up earning such an amount of money, in fact, that they no \nlonger needed AFDC assistance.\n  Again, 90,000 people were saved from lives on welfare, and at a \nsavings of over $100 million--after inflation. In my view, that is \nquite impressive, and it reflects only a part of the progress we can \nmake by giving our States more freedom to order their own social \nspending priorities.\n  Mr. President, we could do more, but, unfortunately, too often the \nWashington bureaucracy is in the way. Recently, at the hearings I \nreferenced earlier, we heard from the people who run the social \nservices department in Michigan. They came with huge notebooks, similar \nto the ones the Senator from Oregon recently had, in terms of paper \nload. They had notebook after notebook, almost from literally a table \ntop halfway to the ceiling of the room in which the hearing was held, \nmade up of the forms and the paperwork that the welfare workers in our \nState are forced to fill out just to seek a waiver--to be given the \nflexibility to do positive things to try to both reduce caseload and \ngive people the incentive to find jobs and get out of the cycle of \ndependency.\n  Governor Engler, at one of our hearings, produced a scroll that \nstretched from one end of the hearing room to the other, and it \nindicated on it a list of all the programs and regulations that a State \nadministrator had to confront in order to deal with the many, many \nprograms which they are required to administer under these laws. Think \nof what we could do if the people administering those programs could \ncut that paperwork burden in half, or more, and devote their time to \nhelping more people get out of the cycle of dependency and find \nopportunities and get on the first rung of the economic ladder and make \ntheir way independently. I think that would be quite an accomplishment.\n  Some people come at this from a different perspective--people who \ngenerally share my respect for State and local prerogatives but who \noppose the no-strings approach, for different reasons. They argue that \nblock granting will produce no significant policy changes. They believe \nthat the State bureaucracies and liberal social workers constitute \nentrenched bastions of the status quo, and they are equally committed \nto expanding and maintaining the current welfare system. But, in my \njudgment, there is no evidence to suggest that a new set of Washington \nrules, regulations, and mandates will produce better outcomes. I do not \nthink there are any good arguments, either liberal or conservative, for \ncentralizing welfare in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I think the choice is clear: It is a choice between \nbusiness-as-usual welfare reform with some window dressing, bells, and \nwhistles, versus real reform that shakes up the current welfare system \nin ways that benefit both welfare recipients and the taxpayers. It is a \nchoice between a Washington-centered welfare system and a new State \nsystem.\n  Given the magnitude of the current problem, I say the real change \nwill occur only if we rely on the States.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe the amendment before us \nencompasses many of the objectives for welfare reform I outlined at the \noutset of my speech. It reduces welfare growth by consolidating \nprograms into block grants and cuts the welfare bureaucracy and the \nrelevant departments by 30 percent; it sets national goals on the \nissues of work and illegitimacy; and it gives States the freedom to \npursue innovative ways to reduce dependency and increase self-\nsufficiency among welfare recipients.\n  I know several amendments will be offered, and some I intend to \nsupport because I think they will more fully flush out some of the \nobjectives I outlined earlier. I think when those amendments are \nadopted, the full amendment before us will achieve the objectives which \nI have been working for in the context of this legislation.\n  So in closing, I argue that Washington has not cornered the market on \ncompassion. As the experience of Michigan and many other States have \nshown, innovative State programs are better able to lift the poor out \nof welfare dependency, give people a chance to get on the first rung of \nthe economic ladder and are, therefore, ultimately more compassionate \nthan a one-size-fits-all program, head- quartered in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan for his \nvery thoughtful, very moderate remarks. I, however, wish to point out \nthat the innovative programs that have indeed taken place in Michigan \nin recent years have done so under the Family Support Act of 1988.\n  Michigan responded exactly as we hoped it would respond, as other \nStates would respond, as other States have responded. It was that \nbipartisan exercise that said, ``Go and innovate. Do what you think is \nbest. Fit your own needs.''\n  I congratulate Michigan for what it has done. I hope they are \nconfident that they can now do it on their own. That is where they are \ngoing to be.\n  I said earlier that to a degree we perhaps do not recognize we are \ndealing with an urban crisis. In the city of Detroit, 72 percent of the \nchildren are on welfare. There has never been such an experience in our \nhistory. It will not go away easily. It has come about in a very short \nperiod of time--30 years, 35 years.\n  I hope that we know what we are doing if we are going to say the \nFederal commitment to match State efforts need no longer be made. I \nthink, sir, we will regret that, but we will find out as the debate \ncontinues.\n  Now, we have a dissenting view and an alternative view, at the very \nleast, from the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, who also has a \nGovernor who has been very active in these affairs under the Family \nSupport Act.\n  I am happy to yield such time as he may require to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair, and I especially thank the senior \nSenator from New York. He has showed unparalleled leadership and wisdom \non this particular issue and many other issues.\n  Clearly, we have come to rue the day that we did not listen to the \nsenior Senator from New York on this issue. I say to the Chair and all \nmy colleagues, \n\n[[Page S 11821]]\nwe will come to rue this day as well if we do not listen to the senior \nSenator from New York on this issue that he has more understanding of \nthan any Member in this body.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support real reform of our Nation's \nwelfare system. I rise in support of genuine reform that focuses on \ntemporary and transitional assistance to families, work and work \npreparation, guaranteed child care, positive family development, \nvigorous child support enforcement, the prevention of teen pregnancy, \nand teen and adult parental responsibility.\n  Simply put, I strongly support the Work First plan which was recently \nintroduced by the distinguished Democratic leader. The Work First plan, \nMr. President, actually ends welfare as we know it and presents a clear \ncontrast to the bill before the Senate, which I think is largely \nbusiness as usual.\n  Work First fundamentally changes the structure of welfare by creating \na new, conditional entitlement for a limited time. The Republican plan \nmerely repackages the Federal AFDC and jobs program into State \nentitlement block grants with cap funding that does not consider \neconomic variability.\n  Work First emphasizes and requires actual work in order to receive a \nbenefit. The Republican plan has no real work requirements and provides \nno incentives for people to get or keep jobs. It merely measures \nparticipation in jobs or other bureaucratic programs in order for \nStates to be able to qualify for future funding.\n  In addition, Mr. President, Work First protects kids with a safety \nnet of services if parents fail to participate and guarantees child \ncare assistance for parents who do work. The Republican plan limits \nassistance for child care, has no safety net, and leaves families at \nthe mercy of future economic downturns and the State and local \nresponses to them.\n  Mr. President, Work First requires States to invest in getting \nwelfare recipients to work by maintaining a State match while creating \nsavings from the existing welfare program.\n  The Republican plan requires no State match and dramatically cuts \nwelfare to finance a Federal tax cut for the rich, while virtually \nensuring an increased tax burden on State and local governments when \nthe robust economic conditions change.\n  Mr. President, the distinctions between the two plans are very clear: \nEither we want to practice what we preach by providing temporary \nassistance while moving people into work, or we want to just talk a \ngood game of State flexibility while at the same time reducing the \nState's ability and capacity or incentive to truly end welfare as we \nknow it.\n  As the senior Senator from New York pointed out, my own State of \nWisconsin, which has been in the spotlight as a leader in welfare \nreform, actually provides a model of two conclusions about this issue. \nWisconsin provides both a good example of the types of initiatives that \nWork First can inspire, but frankly it also provides a clear warning \nthat good PR is a poor substitute for demonstrable results for families \nand for the States.\n  In other words, all that glitters is not gold when we look at the \nWisconsin model. There is good and there is bad. We want to make sure \nthat this body knows the difference.\n  First, we will talk about what has been very good. The New Hope \nproject in Milwaukee, WI, demonstrates that the principles of Work \nFirst are a proven and effective alternative to the Republican proposed \nwelfare program. New Hope began in 1992 as a demonstration project with \n51 participating families. Now it has been expanded just in the last 3 \nyears to 600 families. Its funds were secured through Federal, State \nand private sources. The projects targeted families receiving welfare \nand the working poor who qualified for some public assistance like food \nstamps and Medicaid.\n  New Hope requires participants to work. It provides access to \nprivate-sector jobs, community service jobs if no job can be found in \nthe private sector. Mr. President, it provides wage subsidies if \nnecessary to bring a family's income above the poverty line. And, Mr. \nPresident, very importantly, it provides health and child care \nsubsidies for families with up to 200 percent of poverty.\n  While the project shares the goals of self-sufficiency with existing \nefforts, it goes way beyond this in three ways. First, the project \nguarantees access to a job. Second, it removes categorization of those \nwho are poor and thereby removes some of the disincentive to \nparticipate in the current system. Third, it links subsidies to income \nlevel rather than creating sudden-death scenarios for participants when \narbitrarily established time limits are reached.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that New Hope speaks for itself in its \nresults. There has been an 86 percent increase in the proportion of the \nparticipants who work. There has been a 75 percent decrease in the \nproportion of participants who are unemployed. The employed no longer \nrequire AFDC, and 25 percent of them no longer require Medicaid.\n  Let me talk about the other example. Turning to the much-touted \nwelfare reform initiatives in the State of Wisconsin championed by \nGovernor Thompson, let me first commend Governor Thompson for his \nactivism in the welfare debate. It is substantial. It is a credit to \nthe skilled people working in the State's bureaucracy that as many \ninnovations have been carefully implemented in the past 8 years, and \nour State has earned its reputation on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important for people to know, since I \nserved in the State Senate through many of the years this began, that \nthe jury is still really out on the actual cause of the results \nWisconsin has experienced--in other words, Mr. President, the sharp \ndecrease in the welfare caseload, which has been impressive. We have \nhad a 22.5-percent decrease in welfare from 1986 to 1994. But, Mr. \nPresident, the information we have is that this is probably not \ndirectly attributable in large part to the Thompson innovations but \nmore likely to be attributed to unrelated aspects.\n  Similarly, while the Republican bill before the Senate seeks to \nreform welfare by slashing funding to the States, the one thing that we \nare pretty clear that Wisconsin does demonstrate is that significant \ninvestment is necessary in order to realize even the slightest measure \nof success in preparing people for and getting them to work.\n  Wisconsin's well-developed employment and training system, which \nfeatures 30 one-stop-shopping job centers, is evidence of the \ninvestment that is really needed to get these kind of results.\n  Mr. President, there is also recent empirical evidence that the cause \nof Wisconsin's success is most likely the function of factors not very \neasily replicated in other States, simply through the implementation of \nprogram policies.\n  Michael Wiseman of the University of Wisconsin's Institute for \nResearch on Poverty and the Robert M. LaFollette Institute of Public \nAffairs released a study in June 1955 entitled ``State Strategies for \nWelfare Reform: The Wisconsin Story.''\n  Wiseman traces the short history of Wisconsin's welfare reform \nefforts beginning with the Thompson administration's first waiver \ninitiative in 1987. He analyzes caseload data, unemployment rates, \nmanufacturing employment, and benefit and eligibility levels in the \ncontext of each policy initiative requiring a waiver in order to test a \nvariety of reform experiments. We have had many of these experiments. \nLet me just mention the variety.\n  These experiments include:\n  Learnfare, which requires teenage children of AFDC recipients and \nteen parents to regularly attend school or the family losses benefits;\n  JOBS 20-hour requirement, which allows the State to require more than \n20 hours of JOBS participation for mothers with preschool children;\n  Allowing lower benefits to be paid in the first 4 months after a job \nis taken;\n  Continuation of Medicaid benefits for 1 year;\n  Suspension of the 100-hour rule, which denies benefits if the \nprincipal earner works more than 100 hours in a month;\n  Bridefare, which allows welfare applicants under age 20, if they live \ntogether, to enjoy liberalized benefit and eligibility standards, but \nreduces benefits if a second child is born;\n  So-called two-tier benefits allow the State to pay the benefit level \nof the \n\n[[Page S 11822]]\nsending State for new residents--I would add, this is currently being \nchallenged in the Federal courts as unconstitutional;\n  Prohibit ownership of a vehicle valued at more than $2,500; allow \nrecipients to save up to $10,000 for education/training;\n  A program called Work, not Welfare, which provides intensive job \npreparaton before requiring the recipient to work within 2 years or \nlose all benefits;\n  Family Caps, which denies additional benefits for additional \nchildren;\n  Work First, which requires participation in job search/preparation \nfor 30 days before benefits can be received; and\n  Pay for Performance, which reduces the JOBS benefit for every hour of \nJOBS participation not completed.\n  The Wiseman study points out that Wisconsin's welfare caseload \ndeclined by 22.5 percent between December 1986 and December 1994. The \nstudy states that the decline is primarily associated with restrictions \nin eligibility and benefits, a strong State economy. Our State \nunemployment rate still hovers between 4 and 4.5 percent. And finally \nthis is mostly correlated with large expenditures on welfare to work \nprograms.\n  Wiseman goes on to state that continued reduction of welfare \nutilization is jeopardized by proposed changes in Federal cost sharing \nbecause the Republican plan requires no State match. Wiseman concludes \nthat the special circumstances enjoyed by Wisconsin are unlike to be \nduplicated elsewhere.\n  He cautions that other States and the Federal Government should not \nassume that expanded State discretion alone will produce comparable \ngains unless accompanied by major outlays for employment and training \nprograms, reductions in benefits, and tightening of eligibility \nrequirements. He further cautions that the first policy is expensive to \ntaxpayers, the second and third policies harm recipients.\n  Finally, just this past Thursday Governor Thompson unveiled a new \nstatewide welfare program that replaces AFDC. This follows the recent \nState budget action, which transfers responsibility for administering \nwelfare programs to the State's labor department. The new ``W-2'' \nProgram places participants into four categories depending on their job \nreadiness.\n  Those with the highest job skills will receive assistance from \nprogram staff to obtain full time private sector jobs. Those \nparticipants would also continue to receive food stamps and the EITC.\n  Second, participants with less proficient job skills will be placed \nin full-time private sector jobs on a trial basis, on-the-job training \nsubsidized by the State, with food stamp and EITC eligibility.\n  Third, those who cannot secure private sector jobs or placed in trial \njobs must perform community service for less than minimum wage with \nfood stamp eligibility.\n  Finally, the fourth category would be for people who are unable to \nobtain or hold a job, and who would be required to work in sheltered \nworkshops, volunteer and participate in job preparation programs.\n  What comes through with this latest proposal is the notion of high \nlevel investment throughout the Wisconsin plan. The notion that work \ncomes first is another key element. It is sounding more and more like \nGovernor Thompson is adopting the Work First strategy put forward in \nthe minority leader's plan.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, Work First will be effective, because \nit adopts an attitude of uplift rather than put down, it requires \ninvestment by the States, not the cut and run strategy of the \nRepublican plan. It develops and preserves families, rather than \nproviding incentives to disintegrate them. It aggressively addresses \nteen pregnancy first through prevention, and by requiring teens to live \nin supportive home, or second chance home environments.\n  So there is a very viable plan before us. It is a plan that brings \ntogether the best lessons we have learned in Wisconsin and that can \nactually be transferred to many other States. In that spirit I again \nthank the senior Senator from New York and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like first to thank the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin and draw particular attention to the idea of second-\nchance homes. This is an idea that has been around for some while. It \nreceived very strong support from persons such as James Q. Wilson, of \nthe University of California at Los Angeles, as one possible \nintervention in the reproductive cycle of young persons in situations \nwhere they are overwhelmed by the single-parent culture in which they \nfind themselves living. Not 3 miles from this Capitol you will find \nsuch neighborhoods, such settings.\n  It is a deeply humane idea. It is an old idea--a maternity home. It \nmay yet find a place in our response to the questions of illegitimacy--\nnonmarital births, if you like.\n  I am going to take just one moment, pending the Senator from \nNebraska, to call attention to a matter in this regard. On the 1st of \nAugust, Mr. President, the Bureau of the Census put out its annual \ncompilation called ``Population Profile of the United States, 1995.'' \nIn that summary there is a statement that, ``26 percent of children \nborn in 1994 were out-of-wedlock births.''\n  That is discouraging, because it is not so. And the Bureau of the \nCensus needs to know it is not so. They take this information from \nsample surveys, and survey responses in this regard are simply not \ndependable for reasons that do not have to be explained. Respondents \nare asked whether a child born to the family was out of wedlock. Some \nwill say otherwise.\n  The actual number for 1992 from the National Center for Health \nStatistics, which counts every birth, it does not take samples--the \nnumber for 1992 was 30.1 percent. That is an exact count. I have \nestimated that it will have reached 32 percent by 1994. What 1995 will \nbe--we are on that ascent. Nothing indicates it has changed. It may \nhave moderated.\n  But, for the Bureau of the Census to say otherwise when it so easily \ncould have left this matter to the National Center for Health \nStatistics, is a bit disappointing. The Bureau of the Census is a \nglorious institution and it makes mistakes. We all do. I just want to \nmake that point.\n  I see my friend, the formidable and indomitable Senator from \nNebraska, is on the floor. It is going to be an honor to hear from him.\n  I do not see any Senator from the other side of the aisle, and my \nfriend from Iowa indicates he does not either, in which event, Mr. \nPresident, I hope the Senator from Nebraska might be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to respond to a \nspeech made yesterday by the senior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for just one moment?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be glad to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we might \ncontinue in session under the understanding that no amendments will be \noffered for such time as is required for the Senators who are now on \nthe floor who would like to make statements. That includes Members on \nthe floor who would like to make statements. Is that agreeable to the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As long as, if we have Republicans come, they share \ntime.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my purpose in rising today is to discuss \nthe statement that was made yesterday by the senior Senator from Texas \nwho was here, among other things, to criticize the majority leader's \nwelfare proposal for being too soft on illegitimacy.\n  Mr. President, at the start of my own comments about the welfare \nsystem--and I hope and expect to have several opportunities to come and \ndiscuss this issue--I would like to stipulate that I do not know a \nsingle welfare recipient. That is to say, I do not know a single \nwelfare recipient on a first-name basis. Perhaps some of my colleagues \ndo, but I do not. Perhaps some of those who argue so confidently about \nwhat works and what does not work have poor friends who are on welfare \nand thus speak from experience. \n\n[[Page S 11823]]\n\n  I do know and have friends who receive corporate welfare, and I know \nand I have friends who have argued with me forcefully about the urgent \nneed for various tax incentives which will create jobs, promote \nhomeownership, provide for investment in technology or stimulate \nexports.\n  I am on a first-name basis with lots of people who receive something \nfor nothing but none of them are poor. And none of them appears to have \nbecome lazy or sexually promiscuous as a result of a taxpayer subsidy.\n  Mr. President, many of us are debating something about which we have \nlittle recent firsthand experience--poverty. In such circumstances, it \nwould serve us well to acquire an attitude of humility as well as a \nlittle gratitude for the circumstances of our own births.\n  As our colleagues know, the Senator from Texas is an economist by \ntraining, and as such his thoughts ought to be respected. But they \nought to be recognized for what they are--an economic analysis. As we \nexamine this analysis and the proposal that springs from it, we should \nask one question: Are teenagers and single mothers having babies as a \nconsequence of a rational economic decision?\n  The Senator remarked on a television program over the weekend that \nthe problem with welfare is that we punish work and family while \nrewarding people for not working and for breaking up families.\n  As far as this analysis goes, I agree with it. Our system of \nincentives is sending the wrong signal. We should reward behavior we \nwant and discourage behavior we dislike. The Senator from Texas \ncorrectly notes that our welfare system has perverse incentives.\n  Unfortunately, his analysis causes him not to propose positive \nincentives for things we believe are right and negative for those we \nbelieve are wrong. Instead, he proposes to basically wipe the slate \nclean and punish everything. God help us if we wrote campaign finance \nlaws with such an attitude.\n  Mr. President, the issue of teenage or out-of-wedlock birth is an \nemotional issue. We need to be certain as we discuss this issue that we \ncalmly and rationally answer some basic questions before we begin our \nconsideration of what our laws should say. The first of those questions \nis: Why are teenagers and single women having children? The Senator \nfrom Texas answers this question with an economic analysis. We are \npaying them to do it. For a teenager, he argues, a baby is a free ride \nout of a parent's home and a permanent meal ticket.\n  Research does not support this conclusion. Economic circumstances are \nnot high on the list of reasons why our babies are having babies. While \nit sounds true, unfortunately, it is not. Such arguments make it seem \nthat some Americans are poor because welfare benefits are too \nattractive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial that \nappeared yesterday in the Omaha World Herald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, Aug. 7, 1995]\n\n                     An Ignored Law: Statutory Rape\n\n       The results of a study done by the Alan Guttmacher \n     Institute indicate that at least half of the babies born to \n     teen-age girls are fathered by adults. Have these men no \n     sense? Have they no shame?\n       Researchers said the study was the most comprehensive of \n     its kind. Nearly 10,000 mothers between the ages of 15 and 49 \n     were interviewed from 1989 to 1991. Researchers found that \n     half of the babies born to mothers between ages 15 and 17 \n     were fathered by men who were 20 or older. Generally, the \n     younger a mother was, the greater the age difference between \n     her and her baby's father.\n       In California, a survey of 47,000 births to teen-age \n     mothers in 1993 indicated that two-thirds of the babies were \n     fathered by men of post-high-school age.\n       Even disregarding the moral aspects of mature men sexually \n     exploiting teen-age girls, there is a legal problem in some \n     cases. It's known as statutory rape. The law wisely \n     recognizes that young girls--and boys, for the matter--aren't \n     as mature in their thinking and feelings as adults. \n     Therefore, to seduce a person under a certain age when the \n     seducer is above a certain age is a crime, whether the victim \n     willingly participated or not. The ages vary from state to \n     state. In many cases, a man 19 or older is guilty of \n     statutory rape if he has sex with a girl 15 or younger.\n       The Guttmacher study has implications for the campaign to \n     reduce the number of teen-age pregnancies. If so many teen-\n     age girls' partners are adults, then some educational \n     programs and anti-pregnancy campaigns are misdirected.\n       Moreover, stricter enforcement of the statutory rape laws \n     may be needed. Certainly the Guttmacher study is a setback \n     for the view that teen-age pregnancies are due mostly to \n     teen-age hormones and immature kids who give in too easily to \n     peer pressure or curiosity. The problem of youthful \n     pregnancies, it turns out, is much more complex. And much \n     more appalling.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Omaha World Herald is a conservative \nnewspaper, one that all of us in Nebraska at least are familiar with if \nnot read on a regular basis, and in yesterday's editorial they \ndiscussed an issue that is very relevant to the question of why are \nteenagers having children.\n  The headline for the editorial is ``An Ignored Law: Statutory Rape,'' \nand the first paragraph references a study done by the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute which indicated that at least half of the babies born to \nteenaged girls are fathered by adults.\n  It goes on to describe that 10,000 mothers between the ages of 15 and \n49 were interviewed between 1989 and 1991, and researchers found that \nhalf the babies born to mothers between ages 15 and 17 were fathered by \nmen who were 20 or older, and generally the younger a mother was the \ngreater the age differences between her and her baby's father. And the \neditorial goes on to describe, I think correctly, the need for \nincreased vigilance by law enforcement people on the situation of \nstatutory rape, I think a quite relevant and appropriate response given \nthe analysis done by the Guttmacher Institute.\n  The Guttmacher Institute did not say that these young girls were \nhaving babies as a consequence of seeing a financial incentive.\n  Quite simply, teenagers are not examining Government benefits in \ngeneral and making a rational economic choice when they decide to have \nbabies, to the extent that this is a conscious decision at all.\n  If this was the case, we might solve the whole problem by investing a \nlittle extra training in basic mathematics for whomever it is who \nthinks having a baby on welfare is a clever financial planning \nstrategy. The truth is that if you could count on teenagers to see far \nenough ahead and understand enough home economics to respond rationally \nto the carrots and sticks the Senator from Texas proposes, or in this \ncase mostly sticks, then the solution to this problem would get pretty \neasy. The problem is that most of us do not know any teenagers who can \nmanage their lunch money from day to day much less engage in a detailed \nanalysis of welfare benefits and decide whether or not to have a child \nbased upon it.\n  I do not know why children are having children; I do not have an \neasy, quick answer, nor can I in a simple fashion explain the \nterrifying breakdown in the American family in the last couple of \ngenerations. Senator Moynihan, who knows more about this subject \nprobably than anybody in this body and maybe perhaps anybody in this \ncountry, displayed some disturbing charts yesterday that reveal a \nfrightening social trend. I did not look at them and envision a sea of \npoor Americans making a series of rational economic decisions to have \nchildren out of wedlock.\n  The Senator from Texas accuses the Democratic leadership of believing \nthat having spent billions upon billions of dollars we can just handle \npoverty if we only spend a little bit more. I do not know anyone in the \nDemocratic leadership who espouses this view. But let me say I do not \nconsider it any more rational to say we can solve the problem just by \nspending more than it is to say, as the Senator from Texas does, that \nwe can solve it just by spending less.\n  The fact is that ending poverty will in the end likely cost us money. \nThis is an inconvenient fact, to be sure, but it is a fact nonetheless. \nWe are overlooking it these days because we have gone chasing after a \nrhetorical refrain about ``ending welfare as we know it,'' which, as I \nindicated at the start, is relatively easy for an awful lot of us since \nwe do not know much about welfare. What we really mean, or should mean \nin my judgment is attempting to perhaps not end poverty but at least \nend the misery many still suffer as a consequence of it.\n  Ending welfare as we know it is a simple legislative transaction. \nJust get rid of it, which is the strategy reflected in much of what the \nSenator from \n\n[[Page S 11824]]\nTexas proposes. Ending poverty is much more difficult. It requires us \nto commit time and resources, which has become at least in some circles \na political taboo in an age in which we seem to be competing against \none another to see who can be the toughest.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to coming back to the floor to address \nthis subject in more detail, but I thought a response to the senior \nSenator from Texas was in order. No one doubts his expertise as an \neconomist, but before we get carried away with economic solutions we \nought to be asking whether we are dealing with an economic problem. To \nsome extent, we are. But to a very large extent we are not. It is \nhelpful to make the distinction.\n  To close my first statement on welfare, Mr. President, I should \ndeclare that while I do not know on a first name basis one person who \nreceives AFDC or AFDC child care support, I do know what it means to be \non welfare.\n I do know what it is like to have the bottom drop out of your life, \nand while you are falling, to be caught in the net of American \ngenerosity.\n\n  Like many Americans who are wounded in wars and receive benefits that \nwere earned in combat, I know that benefits given by our Nation do not \nhave to make you lazy. They can make you grateful. I am forever \ngrateful that I live in a country where people do care enough to try to \nhelp those who are suffering.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I simply say for one moment, I thank the gallant \nSenator from Nebraska for an extraordinary statement with such candor \nand accuracy. But I add to the preface, just one point: Ending poverty \nis nothing so difficult as ending dependency. And that is perhaps what \nwe are mostly talking about here.\n  There are few Members, if any, in this Chamber who could meet a \nwelfare mother and recognize her and call her by her first name. I \nthink there are even fewer who know that kind of dependency in which \nyou could have the city of Detroit with 72 percent of the children on \nwelfare. None of us live in those neighborhoods. And we do well to have \nthe courage of a man of servitude to say so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe we are alternating. And I believe \nthe Senator has----\n  Does someone wish to speak?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I may say this, we went through this \nyesterday when I was presiding. We decided we would go back and forth. \nIs that still the arrangement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the arrangement. But in order to go \nback and forth, individuals on either side of the aisle have to ask for \nrecognition from the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I would like to do that.\n  Mr. EXON. The only reason the Senator from Nebraska intervened was \nnot because I want to interrupt the order, but when a quorum call was \nsuggested, when this Senator waited last night and again this morning, \nI thought I might move ahead.\n  Mr. President, in order to go back to the usual procedure, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Does the Senator from Wyoming wish to get recognition?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. I am sorry we had this \nconfusion. As I said, we went through that yesterday.\n  I will be brief, but I did want to use this opportunity to rise to \nsupport the leadership's bill. I support it, at least partially, \nbecause I think it has the best chance for success in the Congress, \nthat it has the best chance to be the vehicle for doing something about \nchange, something that I think we need to do. We have a monumental, \nhistoric opportunity now to overhaul a program that has been in place \nfor a very long time, one that by almost any measure has not succeeded \nin producing the results that most of us want. It is not perfect, of \ncourse. None is perfect. On the other hand, they can be changed and \nshould indeed be changed when we find that portions of it are not \nperfect.\n  The point of welfare, of course, is to put in place a program that \nprovides the opportunity to assist people who need help and to assist \nfolks to get back into the workplace. And that, it seems to me, has to \nbe the measure. If that, indeed, is the measure, we have not succeeded. \nAnd there are those on the floor who simply want to continue to put \nmore money into the program. But I suggest to you that there is little \nreason to expect change if we continue to do the same thing. So we do \nhave a great opportunity.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from New York and the chairman of \nthe committee for the intense effort that has gone into this. I think \nthere has been a rational and reasonable debate. There will continue to \nbe. There will be substantial differences of view, both philosophically \nand practically, as to how we go about this. But I hope we do keep \nbefore us the notion that there is a goal and a purpose that most of us \ncan share; and that is to be compassionate, to be helpful, to help \nthose who need help, but not to make it a career opportunity.\n  I was frankly surprised yesterday when the Senator from New York, in \nhis numbers, showed that the median time on welfare was nearly 13 \nyears. That is not the purpose of this program, and we need to do \nsomething about that. I believe strongly--and there will be \ndisagreement about this--that the States are the best laboratory to do \nsomething. The States are the best place to devise programs and to \ndeliver services that meet the needs of that particular State. My State \nof Wyoming has different kinds of needs than does New York State or \nPennsylvania. And we need to have the flexibility to be able to do \nthat.\n  There are those who will say, ``Oh, no, the States don't have the \ncompassion to do that. The States won't do this job.''\n  I do not agree with that. I do not think there is any evidence at all \nto show that there is more compassion in Washington, that there are \nbetter ideas in Washington than there are in the States. I believe \nstrongly in moving government closer to the people who are governed. \nAnd I have great confidence there.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of issues. Of course, one of them \nwill be the block grants and how much authority we give to the States. \nLet me just check in on the side of giving them as much authority as we \ncan, making it as available to the States to put together several \nprograms and then administer them as they believe it is best.\n  I think there will be discussion about work opportunities. Let me \ntell you that we have had a program of work opportunities in our State, \nstarted by the last Governor, a Democrat as a matter of fact, but it \nhas been limited to relatively few counties because we cannot get a \nwaiver to go forward with it. It has worked.\n  Wyoming wants to do that. We want to help people to be trained and to \nbe able to work. It requires 35 hours of work a week. It is a good \nprogram. We have worked with the Smart Card Program in terms of food \nstamps that we cannot get a waiver to move it on. And it does work. It \nhelps with fraud and abuse.\n  So, Mr. President, in general I think that is one of the issues here. \nWe ought to give the States as much authority to do what they want to \ndo. The question, of course, of limiting payments to unwed mothers is \none that will also be of great conflict here. I have to tell you that I \ndo not favor that idea. But I do favor giving States the opportunity to \ndo what they think is best. I do favor the notion that we ought to get \naway from cash payments and provide an opportunity for young unwed \nmothers to either stay at home or stay in a supervised living \narrangement where they can go on and be trained and be useful members \nof society. I think we all agree with that.\n  So, I am not going to take a great deal of time, but I again want to \nsay \n\n[[Page S 11825]]\nthat I think this is one of the issues that is really a pivotal issue \nin whether or not this Congress lives up to the expectations that \npeople put on us this year. I know it is not a simple issue, but I do \nknow that we ought to find and resolve it and come to closure. We ought \nnot to find ourselves in the position of continuing to extend and avoid \na decision by having endless amendments.\n  Now, I suppose some will say, well, this is a deliberative body. \nThere ought to be no limit. I have a little trouble with that. We ought \nto really seek to come to closure and seek to find some solutions. And \nthere are some that we can find. And they are not partisan. Not all of \nthe right answers are on this side of the aisle. They are not all on \nthe other side. But I can tell you one of the answers that is not \nacceptable, and that is to continue to do what we have been doing and \nexpect there will be changes simply because we say, well, we are going \nto just put some more money into it. It does not work. We have had \nplenty of experience on that. So I think we did receive a message.\n  I think we are serious about breaking the cycle of welfare. I think \nwe are serious about continuing to provide help to people who need it \nand serious about helping people to get off of that cycle so they can \nget into the system. I think we are serious about reducing the role of \nthe central Government and strengthening the role of State governments. \nAnd the votes we cast in the next few days will give us some answers to \nthese questions.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I want to congratulate our leaders on the \nfloor on this. They have done an excellent job, and continue to do so. \nAnd it is not easy.\n  All I urge is that we do come to some closure, we make some \ndecisions, and move forward in the area that we think is best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I can resume for just a moment to \nthank the Senator from Wyoming for his statements, to share his \nsentiments and, particularly, to address this matter of a second-chance \nhome for very young mothers in settings where they can live \nindependently, and neither should they be in the setting from which \nthey came, from which many of them are, in fact, fleeing. It is an old \nidea whose time may have come round once again.\n  I appreciate the Senator's statements in that regard.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to add my thanks to those that have \nbeen said by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this \nmorning for the good leadership that we, obviously, have in the \nforefront of the U.S. Senate as we face this very, very difficult but \nmust-do task of reforming welfare.\n  Certainly, my colleague and friend from New York, the former chairman \nof the Finance Committee, has been trying to get this reformed for \nyears and years and years. I say to the Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, his dream is about to come true, I think. I appreciate the \nthoughtful leadership that he has provided over the years, the \nthoughtful bipartisan leadership that he has provided, and his \ncounterparts on the other side of the aisle, as we move forward on this \nimportant matter.\n  I have brief remarks, comparatively speaking, with regard to the \nwelfare matter before us. Before I go into that, I warn all, I suspect \nwe are not going to complete action on the welfare reform matter before \nwe finally get to our shortened recess. During that time, there are \ngoing to be lots of wars going on, financed by special interests, on \nthe radio and television.\n  In that regard, I will simply advise all Senators, but more \nimportantly, the public at large, that they should have seen the \n``Nightline'' show last evening. The ``Nightline'' show last evening \nwent to the heart of what I suspect will be foremost on our airwaves \nduring the recess, particularly with regard to the welfare reform bill.\n  The ``Nightline'' program last evening went into great detail with \nregard to the totally unprincipled lobbying that is being done by \ncertain high-minded interests with regard to the telecommunications \nbill we wrestled with in the Senate not long ago and which passed the \nHouse of Representatives last week.\n  The House Members were deluged in the last few days of that debate by \nstacks and stacks of mail from their constituents. We all want to get \nmail from our constituents. We are here to represent them. But, \nclearly, I think with the investigation that is now being promised by \nprominent leaders of the House of Representatives, we may begin to get \nto the bottom of some of the problems that we have with the democratic \nprocesses today that are being perverted by money and moneyed \ninterests.\n  The ``Nightline'' show last night went into great detail about the \nmountains of mail that was being received, supposedly from constituents \non a voluntary basis. There is an alarming trend developed with regard \nto the brief investigation that has so far been done on the amount of \nmail being received by House Members from their constituents that their \nconstituents were not writing to them at all, but their constituents' \nnames were on the bottom of preprepared mailings. They had several \ninstances of people live on the ``Nightline'' show last night whose \nnames and addresses were signed to memorandums or lobbying or \nconstituent letters, depending on how you want to describe them, people \nwho never sent the letters. Letters were signed by dead people. Letters \nwere signed by one person who knew nothing about it. In fact, he was \nbicycling in Europe someplace during this time.\n  So I hope that the House of Representatives will pursue their \ninvestigation to see how moneyed interests, with highly paid expert \nlobbyists, cannot fool the public all of the time but sometimes they \ncan fool Members of the Congress by totally fraudulent avalanches of \nmail sent in for a specific purpose, to vote one way or another on a \nbill when the constituent had no knowledge of it whatsoever.\n  Certainly, the new modern revelations and revolutions that we are \nhaving in communications today has given a new power into the hands of \nthe manipulators, the highly paid manipulators that dwell inside the \nbeltway. The ``Nightline'' program showed some of that last night.\n  This is simply a forerunner to say that at the present time, there \nare highly paid advertising schemes going on on television. I say, \nagain, that the majority of the people cannot be fooled all of the \ntime, to partially quote Abraham Lincoln, but it is clear to me that a \nsubstantial portion of the public can be fooled, temporarily at least, \nand can be led into writing their Members of Congress on something with \na key phrase or two. The key television phrase that is being used \nagainst Democrats in five States today, Democrats up for reelection, is \nto ``Write your Democratic Senators and tell them to support \nworkfare.'' Boy, that is a catchy phrase. There is an untold amount of \nmillions of dollars spent today, first, to see what catchword or phrase \nrings with people and ``workfare,'' of course, is something that most \npeople would like to see.\n  So thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars will be spent by \nmoney groups and political parties during this recess to bombard the \nMembers of the House and the Members of the Senate. I emphasize once \nagain and I invite, I encourage, and I have a significant staff that \nworks with me in responding to constituent suggestions. I want \nlegitimate input from my constituents. I do not want my constituents or \nmy office or this Senator to be taken advantage of by the high-price \nmoney that has invaded the political system.\n  We, in the House and Senate, are partially to blame for this \nourselves because we are the first ones who started to divert the \npolitical system with high-paid, efficient attack ads--attack, attack, \nattack--and maybe I can win whether I should or not. There is nothing \nshameful that millions of dollars cannot overcome and at least \ntemporarily justify. It is wrong. Therefore, I hope that the welfare \nreform bill we are talking about today will not be unduly influenced by \nmoney through television and radio advertising that is intended to \nmislead the public rather than inform it.\n  I think we all remember very well that key television ad of last year \nthat \n\n[[Page S 11826]]\nmade it impossible, because the people were misled temporarily, that ad \nwhere Lucille and her live-in boyfriend were sitting at the table in \nthe kitchen saying--it was the most effective television ad I had ever \nseen. They were talking about the problems that Americans have meeting \ntheir medical expenses. And then they talked about the President's \nplan. They said, ``He is trying to do something about it,'' but the key \nline at the end was, ``But there must be a better way.''\n  That is the old technique that the trial lawyer used in trying to \nplant doubt in the minds of the jurors. If you can plant a doubt, then \nyou are not going to get a conviction. There are lots of things wrong \ntoday, but I think things are right when we are tearing into the matter \nof welfare.\n  I rise in support of the amendment to be offered by the distinguished \nminority leader and Senator Breaux, the Work First welfare plan, the \nonly one of its kind that I know about today.\n  The Work First welfare reform plan is a step in the right direction \nand should be the rallying cry around which we can all gather, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to get something constructively done with \nregard to welfare reform. The Daschle-Breaux plan attacks welfare \nreform head on. It helps turn welfare recipients into productive \nbreadwinners. It weaves a safety net that protects the children of \nwelfare parents. It allows the States greater flexibility to administer \ntheir welfare plans and to make positive changes.\n  If I were to summarize this amendment in one word, it would be: \nresponsibility. It requires the responsibility of those currently \nreceiving welfare to take charge of their lives and find work. \nResponsibility is a two-way street. The amendment requires the Federal \nGovernment to act responsibly by making sure that the States will have \nsufficient funding and oversight to do the job properly.\n  Mr. President, the current welfare system has veered off course. \nSenator Moynihan has demonstrated and talked about this time and time \nagain. There is no doubt about that. Not enough welfare recipients are \nmaking the leap from support to gainful employment. The well-beaten \npath of welfare has become a dangerous rut that grows deeper and deeper \nwith the years. For many, welfare has become a permanent state of \nexistence.\n  Welfare's failings did not develop overnight, nor will they be solved \nin a day and a night. However, in the past decade, we have taken \nconstructive steps to reform the system and we build on these reforms \nwith this amendment. In 1988, I vigorously supported the Family \nSecurity Act, which was signed into law by President Reagan. That \nbipartisan legislation, passed by a vote of 96 to 1, provided States \nwith the flexibility to establish programs to assist with job skills, \neducation, and child care.\n  The philosophy behind the Family Security Act is as sound today as it \nwas 7 years ago. We best help people in need by giving them the tools \nto get off of welfare and onto the job rolls once and for all.\n  Unfortunately, while some States showed modest success in \nimplementing their reform programs, the Family Security Act never \nachieved its full potential. Welfare reform continues unabated, \nhowever, in many States, including my State of Nebraska. And the \nDemocratic amendment provides the States with the flexibility and \nfunding to carry out and administer those reform plans. Let me briefly \nexplain how.\n  First, the Daschle-Breaux plan replaces the unconditional, unlimited \nAFDC aid with conditional benefits over a limited period of time. I \nbelieve that most Americans would agree that there has to be an \nendpoint to benefits for able-bodied adults. Otherwise, we find \nourselves still saddled with a welfare system that is self-\nperpetuating.\n  Second, the Democratic leadership amendment emphasizes work. Let me \nrepeat that. The Democratic leadership amendment emphasizes, above all \nelse, work. Welfare reform without work is but a hollow promise. For \nStates the plan establishes the Work First block grant, giving them the \nresources and flexibility to assist welfare recipients to obtain work. \nBy the year 2000, States will be required to put 50 percent of eligible \nrecipients into jobs. In addition, the States will be penalized for \nmissing the target and rewarded for surpassing it.\n  The Democratic plan emphasizes a partnership between parents and the \nStates through the parent empowerment contract. Parents must engage in \nan intensive job search, or have their benefits reduced. Moreover, the \nplan provides incentives to stay in the work force by adding an \nadditional 12 months of child care and Medicaid for those who go to \nwork.\n  Third, the Democratic plan is sensitive to the consequences of \nwelfare reform--especially as to how it affects children. Children \nshould not be pawns in this debate. I would never hold children hostage \nmerely to satisfy some ideological itch. Rationing assistance to \ninnocent children is not only heartless, it is terribly shortsighted. \nThe Democratic plan protects the well-being of children above all else. \nThey are not left to the vagaries and whims of local conditions and \nofficials. They are not pitted against competing interests. They are \nnot shortchanged on services. If a mother loses her benefits after a 5-\nyear time limit, her children will still be eligible to receive \nassistance for housing, food, and clothing.\n  Fourth, the Democratic leadership plan cuts and invests. It cuts \nspending by reducing the welfare rolls and invests those savings to \nprovide even greater rewards for the American taxpayers. This is fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I am fearful, however, that other well-intentioned \nproposals essentially bundle up the problem and shuffle it off to the \nStates. As a former Governor, I see concerns here. We must not just \npass the welfare problem on to the States without some assurance that \nit can be financed. You simply cannot, in my opinion, pass the buck \nwithout passing the bucks.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to remind all that earlier this \nyear, I was one of four original cosponsors of the unfunded mandate \nbill. We passed that legislation, and the President signed it into law. \nThis is one of the greatest accomplishments of the 104th Congress. We \nhad bipartisan support for the unfunded mandates bill, and for good \nreason. From town councils to the Governor's mansion, we heard the cry \nfor relief from unfunded mandates. For too long Congress shifted the \ncosts of regulations and mandates to the States. Their ledgers bled \nfrom red being forced to comply with the unfunded mandates.\n  The Republican formula for block grants is troubling, especially to \nStates like Nebraska that have a growing poverty population. Under the \nnew formula, Nebraska will receive no additional funding above the 1994 \nlevel. However, in the early 1990's, my State's AFDC population grew by \n18 percent. We also have experienced a 24-percent increase in the \nnumber of children living in poverty over the last 3 years. So I am \nvery concerned that my State might not have the resources that it needs \nfor a safety net for our poor children.\n  Mr. President, the Republican claim that they put welfare recipients \nto work is not a valid one. One of my Republican colleagues has said on \ncountless occasions that folks should get out of the wagon and start to \npull. That may be an appealing sound bite, but despite the modification \nmade by the majority leader yesterday, this Republican initiative does \nlittle to ensure that goal. The Republican bill is not tough love, it \nis just tough luck.\n  If we are truly sincere about welfare reform, we have to help people \nget and keep jobs and keep them off of welfare. If we want to put \npeople back to work, we have to help them with training and job \nplacement. Our society and our world has changed dramatically from the \ndays when a high school diploma could alone still land you a good job. \nWe are in an economy that puts a premium on education and training. \nYet, other plans provide no incentive or resources for either the \nStates or individuals to get welfare recipients into the workplace and \nkeep them there.\n  We can do better, and we must do better, with the likes of the \nDaschle-Breaux amendment.\n  There are now plans underway to tighten the provisions being \nconsidered to the Democratic proposal. We offer an open invitation to \ncome join us, to work constructively together with suggestions. \n\n[[Page S 11827]]\n\n  It is my hope that we can move ahead on this matter in a true \nbipartisan fashion and carefully consider a consensus. But let me \nemphasize, Mr. President, unreasoned haste can clearly make matters \nworse on this measure, which is of great import and great magnitude. \nMr. President, we should work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the unanimous-\nconsent order be extended until 1:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska not only for the \ngenerosity of his remarks, the clarity of his concern, the depth of his \nconcern, but to connect his opening remarks to the closing remarks.\n  I do not think the Senator will receive many letters from welfare \nrecipients. I do not think many of those children will be writing \npostcards. No one, certainly, will be paying them.\n  That, Mr. President, is the nub of the issue. We are talking of \npeople who have but little voice in this land and less real influence \nin the end. We are seeing it all about us now.\n  Mr. President,\n   the Census Bureau has just released the ``Population Profile of the \nUnited States: 1995'' which reports that ``26 percent of children born \nin 1994 were out-of-wedlock births.''\n\n  However, according to the National Center for Health Statistics \nfigures which I have frequently cited, the illegitimacy ratio was 30.1 \npercent in 1992, and I estimate that it will have reached 32 percent in \n1994.\n  According to Martin O'Connell, Chief of the Fertility Statistics \nBranch of the Census Bureau, ``The higher figures are correct. The \n`Population Profile' seriously undercounts the number of children born \nout of wedlock as the figures it reports are based on a small sample \nand incomplete information. Senator Moynihan is right.''\n  This is one area where precision of fact is imperative. In order to \nunderstand a problem, we must first be able to accurately measure it, \nand few problems are of such enormous consequence as this unrelenting \nrise in illegitimacy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11813-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           RECESS UNTIL 2:15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, no one disagrees that the current welfare \nsystem is in shambles. Since the beginning of President Lyndon \nJohnson's War on Poverty, government, at all levels, has spent more \nthan $5.4 trillion on welfare programs in America. To understand the \nmagnitude of $5.4 trillion, consider what could be bought for it.\n  For $5.4 trillion, one could purchase every factory, all the \nmanufacturing equipment, and every office building in the United \nStates. With the leftover funds, one could go on to buy every airline, \nevery railroad, every trucking firm, the entire commercial maritime \nfleet, every telephone, television, and radio company, every power \ncompany, every hotel, and every retail and wholesale store in the \nentire Nation.\n  While many Americans may not know the exact dollar amount of the War \non Poverty, there is a public understanding that more and more \ntaxdollars are coming to Washington and being funnelled into programs \nthat are having little effect. Despite a $5.4 trillion transfer of \nresources, the poverty rate has actually increased over the past 28 \nyears. During this same period, the out of wedlock birthrate \nskyrocketed from 7 to 32 percent, and currently one in seven children \nin America is raised on welfare. Moreover, this massive spending has \ndone nothing to alleviate drug use, child abuse or violent crime--all \nof which have sharply increased during this period. In short, our \ncurrent welfare system has failed miserably. It has exacerbated the \nvery problems it was created to solve, and it should be dramatically \noverhauled now.\n  The first priority of reform should be to change the incentives in \nthe current system which undermine the traditional family structure. \nToday, the Government pays individuals, including teenagers, up to \n$15,000 per year in cash and in-kind benefits on the condition that \nthey have a child out of wedlock, do not work and do not marry an \nemployed male. That is a cruel system, since we know that work and \nmarriage are two of the most promising avenues out of poverty. We \nshould not be surprised that years after this policy was instituted, \nthe out of wedlock birthrate has reached 80 percent in many low-income \ncommunities. That means that 8 out of 10 children born in many \nneighborhoods in America do not know what it means to have a father. \nThe results of this condition are devastating, not only to the \nchildren, but to the parents, and to society as a whole.\n  I believe the time has come that Congress should end the practice of \nmailing checks to teenagers who have children out of wedlock. Teenagers \nthemselves are still children, and to simply mail them a check and \nforget about them is a cruel form of so-called assistance. I know of no \nprivate charity which assists people in this manner. We should continue \nto provide for these young mothers and their children, through adoption \nassistance, vouchers for child care supplies, food and nutrition \nassistance, and health care assistance. But, this Nation should no \nlonger dole out cash to unwed teenage recipients. Several amendments \nwill be offered during the course of the debate on welfare reform to \naccomplish this, and I intend to support them.\n  The second priority of reform is to reinstill the value of work into \nour welfare system. No civilization can successfully sustain itself \nover a long period of time by paying a large segment of its population \nto remain idle. The current system discourages work, because nothing is \nrequired from those who receive assistance, and in many instances, \nwelfare pays better than a normal job. I support the efforts of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee to change that by requiring welfare \nrecipients to work in exchange for their benefits. Under this \nlegislation, welfare will no longer be free. Taxpayers have to work \nhard everyday, and those receiving public assistance should do the \nsame.\n  Finally, true welfare reform means saving money. In the past, welfare \nreform has meant digging a little deeper into the taxpayers' pockets \nfor more money to transfer into ineffective Federal programs. Federal, \nState, and local governments spent $324 billion on more than 80 \ndifferent welfare programs in 1993--that is an average of $3,357 from \neach household that paid Federal income tax in 1993. We must reject the \nidea that somehow, $324 billion is not enough. Real welfare reform \nshould result in fewer people needing welfare and generate savings to \nbe returned to the taxpayers. The Work Opportunity Act will save more \nthan $60 billion over the next 5 years by returning control over \nwelfare programs to State and local officials with a fixed dollar \namount from Washington. This will give State and local officials the \nability to improve their services to poor people without waiting on the \ndilatory approval of Washington bureaucrats.\n  The American people have demanded welfare reform not because they are \nstingy or spiteful toward the poor and needy. Rather, they have \ndemanded reform because they have seen a system which has destroyed the \nhope and dreams of millions of Americans by trapping them in cycles of \ndependency and encouraging self-defeating behavior. Welfare has been \nfertile soil for child abuse, neglect, homelessness, and crime. By \nstrengthening the traditional family, requiring work in exchange for \nbenefits, and bringing financial discipline to our current welfare \nsystem, we can change welfare from a system of hopelessness to one of \nhope, from a system of dependency to one of responsibility. We owe it \nto welfare recipients, their children, and society, to do no less.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n[[Page S 11828]]\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request that has been agreed to?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue with \ndebate on H.R. 4, the welfare reform bill, until the hour of 4 o'clock \ntoday without any amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  It is with great enthusiasm that I rise to support the Work First \nAct, the Democratic alternative on welfare reform. I support it with \nenthusiasm because it is firm on work, provides a safety net for \nchildren, brings men back into the family for both child support and \nchild rearing, and at the same time provides State flexibility and \nadministrative simplification.\n  Mr. President, I am the Senate's only professionally trained social \nworker. Before elected to public office, my life's work was moving \npeople from welfare to work, one step at a time, each step leading to \nthe next step, practicing the principles of tough love.\n  This is the eighth version of welfare reform that I have been \nthrough--as a foster care worker, as a child abuse and neglect worker, \na city councilwoman, a Congresswoman, and now a U.S. Senator. Each of \nthose previous efforts in times have failed both under Democratic \nPresidents and under Republican Presidents. It failed for two reasons. \nOne, each reform effort was based on old economic realities, and, \nsecond, reform did not provide tools for people to move from welfare to \nwork--to help them get off welfare and stay off welfare.\n  I believe that welfare should be not a way of life, but a way to a \nbetter life. Everyone agrees that today's welfare system is a mess. The \npeople who are on welfare say it is a mess. The people who pay for \nwelfare say it is a mess. It is time we fix the system.\n  Middle-class Americans want the poor to work as hard at getting off \nwelfare as they themselves do at staying middle class. The American \npeople want real reform that promotes work, two-parent families and \npersonal responsibility.\n  That is what the Democratic Work First alternative is all about. We \ngive help to those who practice self-help. Democrats have been the \nparty of sweat equity and in our Work First bill have a real plan for \nwork. Republicans have a plan that only talks about work, but does not \nreally achieve it.\n  Democrats have produced a welfare plan that is about real work, not \nmake work. That's why we call our bill ``Work First,'' because it does \nput work first. At the same time, it does not make children second \nclass.\n  Under our plan, from the day someone comes into a welfare office, \nthey must focus on getting a job and keeping it, and work at raising \ntheir family.\n  How do we do this under the Work First plan?\n  First, we abolish AFDC. In its place, we create a program of \ntemporary employment assistance.\n  Second, we change the culture of welfare offices--moving welfare \nworkers from eligibility workers to being empowerment workers. Social \nworkers are now forced to fussbudget over eligibility rules. Under the \nWork First Act, social workers now become empowerment workers. They sit \ndown on day one with welfare applicants to do a job readiness \nassessment. So they can find out what it takes to move a person to a \njob, stay on a job, and ensure that their children's education and \nhealth needs are being met.\n  Third, everyone must sign a parent empowerment contract within 2 \nweeks of entering the welfare system. It is an individualized plan to \nget a job. The failure of individuals to sign that contract means they \ncannot get benefits.\n  Fourth, everyone must undertake an immediate and intensive job search \nonce they have signed that contract. We believe the best job training \nis on the job. Your first job leads you to the next job. Each time you \nclimb a little bit further out of poverty, up the ladder of \nopportunity, and at the same time we reward that effort.\n  Yes, this is a tough plan with tough requirements. It expects \nresponsibility from welfare recipients. Everyone must do something for \nbenefits. If you do not sign the contract, you lose your benefits. If \nyou refuse to accept a job that is offered, you lose benefits. If, \nafter 2 years of assistance, you do not have a job in the private \nsector, then one must be provided for you in the public sector.\n  No adult can get benefits for more than 5 years in their adult \nlifetime. If you are a minor, the 5-year limit does not apply, so long \nas you are able to stay in school and receive benefits.\n  So, yes, we Democrats are very tough on work. Everyone must work. \nAssistance is time limited and everyone must do something for benefits. \nIf you do not abide by the contract, then you lose your benefits.\n  What else do we do under the Work First plan? We provide a safety net \nfor children. We not only want you to be job ready and work-force \nready, we want you to be a responsible parent. That's why we require \nparents, as a condition of receiving benefits, that you make sure your \nchildren are in school and that they are receiving proper health care.\n  Once you do go to work, under the Work First plan we will not abandon \nyou. We want to make sure that a dollar's worth of work is worth a \ndollar's worth of welfare. While you are working at a minimum wage, \ntrying to better yourself, we will provide a safety net--child care for \nyour children, continued nutritional benefits, and health care. We want \nto be sure that while you are trying to help yourself, we are helping \nyour children grow into responsible adults.\n  I do not mind telling people that they must work. Because in asking \nthem to take that step, our Work First plan makes sure they have the \ntools to go to work and that there will be a safety net for their \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, the proposed Republican welfare bill does none of \nthese things. It does not look at the day-to-day lives of real people \nand ask what is needed to get that person into a job. The people we are \ntelling to go to work are not going to be in high-paid, high-tech jobs. \nWe know that mother who wants to sign a contract that requires her to \nwork will be on the edge when it comes to paying the bills.\n We know that she will have serious problems with finding affordable \nand quality child care unless she has a mother or an aunt or a next \ndoor neighbor to watch her kids.\n\n  The Republican bill does not provide enough money to pay for real \nchild care. Suppose that mother lives in suburban Maryland or Baltimore \nCity or the rural parts of my State? She does the right thing; she gets \nan entry-level, minimum-wage job. She is going to make about $9,000 a \nyear, but will have no benefits. She might take home, after Social \nSecurity taxes, $175 a week. But if her child care costs her $125 a \nweek, that leaves her $50 a week for rent, food, and clothing. How do \nwe expect this woman to support a family on $50 a week? There would be \nno incentive to do that.\n  So that means, under the Republican welfare bill, she must jump off \nof a cliff into the abyss of further and further poverty. Where moving \nto work puts her at an economic disadvantage. The Democratic bill wants \nto help people move to a better life. The Republican bill will push \nthem into poverty through its harsh, punitive approach.\n  Welfare reform is about ending the cycle of poverty and the culture \nof poverty. And the Democratic Work First plan will tackle both.\n  Ending the cycle of poverty is an economic challenge. It means \nhelping create jobs in this country and then making sure that our \ncountry is work-force ready and that welfare recipients are ready to be \npart of our new economy.\n  But welfare reform must also end the culture of poverty, and that is \nabout personal responsibility. It is about bringing men back into the \npicture. It is about tough child support, saying that if you have got \nthe stuff to have a child, you should have the stuff to support that \nchild and rear that child.\n  We believe that the way families will move out of poverty is the way \nfamilies move to the middle class--by bringing men back into the \npicture, having two-parent households, ensuring that there are no \npenalties to marriage, or to families going to work.\n  So, Mr. President, Democrats in this debate are firm on work and \npersonal \n\n[[Page S 11829]]\nresponsibility. We believe that the Democratic welfare reform \nalternative will bring about these results. That is why I support it \nwith the enthusiasm that I do.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I may state a different tack. I am sincere when I say \nthis. I do not care which party straightens out this country just so \none of them does. I have felt that way for a long time.\n  For the benefit of those looking in on C-SPAN, the distinguished \nParliamentarian was having a discussion with the Presiding Officer. I \nwas wondering whether he was talking about some rule that I may have \nunwittingly violated.\n  Anyway, I am pleased that debate in the Senate has finally begun on \nthe issue of the fundamental reform of America's welfare system. There \nare all sorts of plans floating around. And my view is, let us get one \nthat has a minimal amount of Government in it and proceed with a \nsensible welfare plan. Efforts to move away from the disastrous welfare \nstate--some call it the dependency state--is long overdue. We have seen \nthe bitter fruits of what has followed this business of trying to \nsocialize welfare.\n  We must pray that the Nation can somehow recover from the destruction \nof the basic fundamental precepts and principles, the moral and \nspiritual principles, if you will, laid down by our Founding Fathers. \nAnd a lot of damage has been done to all of those by the effort to have \nthe Government provide for everybody, causing so many to decide that it \nis better not to work and just to sit back and get a welfare check.\n  Now, that will cause screams in some quarters, but most Americans \nknow it is so. Welfare as it now exists is a clear example of a \nGovernment program intended to be compassionate, but which, in fact, is \ndemonstrably destructive, even to people to whom the political system \ngives benefits financed by citizens who work for a living.\n  The welfare system has discouraged work. It encourages dependency. It \nencourages single motherhood and the breakup of families. Look at \nstatistics. It is all there for people to perceive.\n  Mr. President, a clear signal has been sent to the American people \nthat the liberal policies of the past are and have been an abject \nfailure. Congress must cease its sorry practice of cranking up more and \nmore giveaway programs for the purpose of buying votes in the next \nelection. It is time to stop throwing the taxpayers' money at pie-in-\nthe-sky Federal programs instead of working to get to the root of the \nproblem.\n  So, here we are. The Senate now confronts the responsibility of \ndeciding how significantly the Congress will reform the welfare system \nif some Senators will let the consideration proceed.\n  Mr. President, it is not a matter of being for or against helping \nthose in need. It is a matter of setting the parameters of welfare so \nthat every able-bodied citizen will feel obliged to go to work instead \nof sitting back to receive free sustenance from the working taxpayers. \nPast policies of dumping that burden entirely on the shoulders of the \nAmerican taxpayers has never worked, and it never will.\n  There are many citizens across the country who are working to restore \npersonal responsibility in this regard. I have a couple of remarkable \nladies in mind when I say that. First, there is Mattie Hill Brown, of \nWilson, NC. Now, we call her ``Miss Mattie.'' She was recently awarded \nthe prestigious Jefferson Award for Outstanding Community Service.\n  Mr. President, you know what she does? Do you know why she was given \nthis award? This remarkable lady gives freely of her limited income--\nand it is limited--to prepare and deliver meals to truly needy people. \nHer generosity is direct and it is personal. It is independent of all \nadministrative agencies, public and private. She wants to do it because \nit is a desire of her heart and from her heart to help others.\n  And then there is another lady. She is from Texas, Houston, TX. Her \nname is Carol Porter. Mrs. Porter is a remarkable lady who founded Kid-\nCare, Inc., a nonprofit group that helps feed some of Houston's \nneediest children. And Kid-Care will accept no government funding, not \na penny. ``I'm against people saying, `Let the government do it,' '' \nMrs. Porter once said. Then she added, ``It's time for Americans to \nfeed needy Americans''--not the Government, but individual Americans \nout of the compassion of their hearts.\n  Oh, we can sit up here in the U.S. Senate and spend other people's \nmoney and we can say how generous we are. But until we do it ourselves \nand sacrifice ourselves, it does not mean a thing. Mr. President, \nhistory shows clearly that efforts to shift the responsibility of \nwelfare from individuals and communities to the Federal Government have \nfailed. You can see that failure all around you, you can see it within \nthree blocks of this U.S. Capitol.\n  Now, since Lyndon Johnson led the Nation down the road to what he \ncalled the Great Society in the middle 1960's, the predictable result \nhas been massive Federal spending, mushrooming Federal debt.\n  By the way, the Federal debt is going to cross $5 trillion within the \nnext 30 days. Watch it.\n  It has led to increased poverty and, unfortunately, millions of \nAmericans are locked into the welfare cycle. In 1988, Congress enacted \nthe Family Security Act, which ostensibly reformed welfare to reverse \nthe errors that were apparent, the errors of the past.\n  They were continued, of course. But supporters of that legislation \nboasted at the time that it would ``revise the AFDC program to \nemphasize work and child support and family benefits * * * encourage \nand assist needy children and parents under the new program to obtain \nthe education, training and employment needed to avoid long-term \nwelfare dependence.''\n  If that is not a political declaration, I do not know what it is. And \nit was not so, and that bill failed.\n  It is encouraging to note that neither Democrats nor Republicans now \npropose to perpetuate the JOBS Program, which is an entitlement to \neducation and job training for AFDC recipients. It was created in the \n1988 act. By the way, that one act in 1988--this business of Congress \ngiving away other people's money--has run the Federal debt up $8 \nbillion since 1988. It has increased the Federal debt for our children \nand grandchildren to pay by $8 billion.\n  One reason for its failure is the large number of exemptions from \nparticipation in the JOBS Program. Currently, 57 percent of AFDC \nrecipients are exempt from JOBS for one reason or another. Of the \nnonexempt only 11 percent are currently participating and all the \nrest--all the rest--are living off the taxpayers.\n  These policies have not helped to end poverty in America. Just the \nopposite. As of 1993, there were 15.1 percent of Americans in poverty \nas compared to 13 percent when that reform took place. That is a 2-\npercent growth in the number of people in poverty.\n  Yet, Senators agreed that this legislation would end welfare as we \nknow it. We must not make that mistake on this welfare reform.\n  In addition, Mr. President, 76 percent of AFDC recipients receive \ncash benefits for 5 years or more. That is certainly not the intended \neffect of the 1988 legislation.\n  The point is, we must not miss the opportunity now to institute real \nreform of the welfare system. No longer should the taxpayers be forced \nto subsidize able-bodied people who just prefer not to work. We must \nprovide individual responsibility and stop turning to the State and \nFederal treasuries for millions of borrowed dollars, the tab for which \nwill be passed along to our children and grandchildren.\n  Opinions differ as to what aspect of America's welfare system has \nbeen the greatest failure, in terms of principle. The fraudulent Food \nStamp Program or the failed JOBS Program or the bloated bureaucracy--\nthe list is endless. The one segment of Federal Government control that \nis in most need of reform, however, is welfare.\n  This past April, at Elon College, NC, the Right Honorable Margaret \nThatcher, former Prime Minister of Great Britain and a close personal \nfriend of Dot Helms and me, came down to speak to a convocation. She \nencouraged Americans, especially the young people in the audience, to \ntake another look at our welfare system, which she explained that day \nfosters what we call dependency, dependency on Government welfare. \n\n[[Page S 11830]]\n\n  Margaret Thatcher said: ``Of course you have to help people out of \npoverty. The Good Samaritan was the first.''\n  But then she said: ``What happens when the system you have for \ngetting people out of poverty produces more people in poverty, \ngeneration after generation after generation?''\n  Maggie Thatcher, of course, was right. She had been repeatedly right \nin her challenges to Government socialism and in her defense of the \nfree enterprise system.\n  But there is another authority who is a favorite of mine. His name is \nPaul, the Apostle Paul who, in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, \nchapter 23, verses 7 through 10, and I am going to quote the modern \nversion, had a thought or two about this issue which we call today \nwelfare. Paul wrote to the Thessalonians and said this:\n\n       We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat \n     anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we \n     worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would \n     not be a burden to any of you.\n\n  And then the Apostle Paul said:\n\n       We did this, not because we do not have the right to such \n     help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to \n     follow. For even when we were with you, we gave you this \n     rule. If a man will not work, he shall not eat.\n\n  Whether we like it or not, and I happen to like it very, very much, \nthe Apostle Paul was exactly right when he wrote his Second Epistle to \nthe Thessalonians. Margaret Thatcher is right in what she says. All the \nothers down through history who have sounded the same tocsin in various \nways, they have been right, they have been telling us, ``Watch out.''\n  Mr. President, political hi-jinks in this matter should be laid aside \nso that the Senate can have a meaningful welfare reform bill considered \nand enacted and sent to the President of the United States for his \nsignature. The people have made clear that this is what they want. They \nhave made clear that if we do not deliver, they will not forget it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have been \nlistening very carefully to this debate; this discussion. I think it is \nfair to say that there are some who believe this debate is a battle for \nthe Nation's soul. There are others who believe it is a battle for the \nNation's heart. And there are some, I among them, who believe that it \nis a battle for the Nation's future.\n  At its best, welfare reform can contribute to the work ethic and \nupward mobility of large numbers of people. At its worst, it can fuel \npoverty and desperation, and it can take us back to those days best \ncharacterized by Charles Dickens in some of his novels.\n  The results of our actions here will be evaluated by generations to \ncome. I truly believe that the ultimate test of a civilization is, as \nAlbert Schweitzer once stated, a civilization is known by how that \ncivilization treats the least among them.\n  So I sincerely hope that one day we will be judged as having met the \nchallenge of welfare reform with light rather than heat and with \npractical solutions.\n  I know there are many who believe they have all the answers, but the \nultimate test of whether we succeed in what we do here is whether more \npeople will be working tomorrow than today, and whether more people \nwill be able to support themselves than today, and whether children \nwill be better off or worse off.\n  Any bill for welfare reform, I think, because of the gravity of the \nsituation in the largest State in the Union--California, must be looked \nat by how it impacts that State. California today comprises 12.3 \npercent of our Nation's population, with more than 32 million \nresidents. It has 18.6 percent of the country's welfare caseload. It is \nhome to 38 percent of all legal immigrants, including 42 percent of the \nNation's immigrants who receive SSI. It has one-third of the Nation's \ndrug- or alcohol-addicted SSI caseload, and almost one-fifth of the \nnational AFDC caseload.\n  So I believe it is fair to say that any successful welfare bill will \nhave a major and dramatic impact on virtually every walk of life in the \nState of California.\n  Let me begin by laying out what I think are the necessary components \nof any successful welfare reform bill and how it relates to California. \nThe first issue is entitlements. I believe that the consensus is broad \nthat the time has come to eliminate the entitlement status of welfare. \nOur system of entitlements has reached a point where there are more \npeople entitled to benefits than there are people willing to provide \nthem. That is a major difficulty.\n  I have had people, particularly young people, tell me that they \nbelieve they have a right to welfare. They interpret the entitlement \nstatus as giving them a basic right to this program. I do not agree, \nand I believe that the notion that welfare is a right has, in a sense, \ncontributed to the collapse of the system. People in need should have \ntemporary assistance, but they are not entitled to a lifelong grant.\n  Anyone who has ever had responsibility for running a welfare system \nknows the challenges, but one of the biggest challenges is the welfare \nbureaucracy itself. I remember somebody bringing to the floor a pile of \ndocuments that it took to qualify somebody into a categorical aid \nprogram and the documents were quite high. The more top down our \nwelfare system has become, the less effectively it has served its \npurpose.\n  As a former mayor and a county supervisor, and now a Senator, I have \ndealt with every conceivable layer of bureaucracy in the administration \nof public benefit programs. But I truly believe it is at the local \nlevel, the counties, where welfare has seen some of its most innovative \nand successful reforms. For example, and it has been mentioned here \nearlier, specifically with one county, several California counties have \ninstituted a program called GAIN. Everybody is familiar with it: \nGreater Avenues for Independence. One county, Riverside, has returned \n$2.84 to the taxpayers for every $1 spent on its GAIN Program. In Los \nAngeles, the results from the GAIN Program have been equally \nimpressive. Working with 30,000 long-time welfare recipients who have \nbeen employed for more than 3 years, the Los Angeles GAIN Program has a \ncurrent placement rate of 34 percent, which is very high as these \nthings go.\n  Followup studies in Los Angeles reveal a 60 percent retention rate, \nindicating that the majority have not cycled back to welfare.\n  San Mateo and San Diego Counties have each created successful job \nsearch programs, cutting administrative costs and moving people into \nprivate-sector employment. San Mateo last year put an unprecedented 85 \npercent of the people in the program to work.\n  Enforcement of child support obligations, I believe, is the single \nmost important welfare reform measure from the California perspective, \nbecause one of the principal causes of poverty in my State is the \nabsence of child support, the last time I looked at this.\n  Almost 3 million people in California receive AFDC [Aid to Families \nwith Dependent Children]. Now, that is a caseload larger than the \nentire populations of many of the States represented in this body. \nCurrently, the combined annual cost to Federal, State, and local \ngovernment is $7 billion for the AFDC Program.\n  Since 1980, the total AFDC costs for California have tripled, from \n$1.9 billion in 1980 to $5.6 billion in 1993.\n  During that same period, births to unmarried teen mothers rose by 76 \npercent. Now, it is true that this is not a large portion of the \ncaseload. However, mothers who had their first child as teenagers \ncomprise more than half of our entire AFDC caseload. So while teen \nmothers may be a small number, but the finding of the California \nexperience is that once teenagers enter welfare, it is difficult to get \nthem to leave the program.\n  I believe it takes two people to bring a child into this world, and \nas a society we must demand that both parents be responsible for \nsupporting the child. So strong child support must be an essential \ncomponent of welfare reform.\n  Of course, as has also been said by many in this debate, child care \nremains the linchpin to a successful transition from welfare to work. \nIn the California experience, the shortage of affordable child care is \na critical and overwhelming problem for the State and for local \ncommunities. Our State spends $840 million annually on child care. \nAnother $200 million of Federal funds goes into this. That is more than \n$1 billion \n\n[[Page S 11831]]\nfor child care, and we still meet the needs of less than 30 percent of \nthe families who are eligible for child care. This is the catch-22 of \nthe Dole-Packwood bill for California.\n  In San Diego, Federal funds provide a total of 1,636 child care \npositions. Yet, there are 11,663 eligible families on the waiting list. \nThe odds of getting a child care spot in the present system are 1 in \n14. In San Francisco, with combined State and Federal funds, there are \n8,000 child care spaces. But, there are 6,000 eligible families on the \nwaiting list.\n  So this is one simple issue of common sense. You cannot move millions \nof mothers into the work force if there are not enough child care \noptions available for them.\n  Let me talk for a moment about welfare fraud, because it is a real \nproblem and it must be addressed, particularly in the Food Stamp \nProgram. My understanding is that an investigation by the Secret \nService last year estimated that food stamp fraud alone costs taxpayers \nat least $2 billion a year. I am very pleased that both bills--the \nDole-Packwood bill, as well as the Democratic leadership bill--have \nbuilt in legislation which I introduced last week to enact strong \nprovisions to permanently disqualify merchants who knowingly submit \nfraudulent claims, and to double the penalties for recipient fraud. But \nwe also must remove Federal obstacles to an electronic benefit system, \nso that we can eliminate paper coupons and replace them with the \ncounterfeit-proof debit card. I will certainly support efforts to do \nso.\n  I think it is fair to say that under the Dole-Packwood bill, my State \nis the biggest loser. And I cannot vote for the bill in its present \nform for that reason. First of all, I was surprised to see that the \nbill does not consider California a growth State.\n No State grows more than California. Yet, in this bill, California is \nnot a growth State.\n\n  I was pleased when I learned that there would be a new growth fund in \nthe bill, but I might say that the growth fund excludes one of the \nfastest growing States in the Nation--that is California--so it is not \nmuch of a growth fund.\n  For my State this bill is an enormous unfunded mandate. It requires \nCalifornia to achieve levels of work participation five times higher \nthan the present. Yet, it freezes funding at the 1994 level.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that to \noperate the work program plus related child care will cost my State \nmore than $4 billion over 5 years. Yet, funding is frozen at the 1994 \nlevel.\n  Meeting the work requirements in this bill will result in a need for \nan 894 percent increase in AFDC-related child care needs. Yet, funding \nis frozen at the 1994 level.\n  California, as I mentioned, is home to 38 percent of all legal \nimmigrants. But it is also home to more than half, 52 percent, of all \nlegal immigrants who receive Federal welfare. Fifty-two percent of all \nlegal immigrants who receive Federal welfare are in the State of \nCalifornia. I am one who believes immigrants should not come to this \ncountry to go on welfare. But this bill takes a problem created by the \nFederal Government and simply dumps it on the States.\n  It would deny SSI and Medicaid benefits to almost 300,000 legal \nimmigrants who reside in California, resulting in a $6.3 billion cost \nshift to my State over 5 years. Los Angeles County alone has estimated \na loss of $530 million annually under the Republican bill.\n  We cannot just shift the problem. The impact on States and counties \nmust also be addressed. I have already stated that many of the \ninnovations currently under discussion have been pioneered by \nCalifornia counties. I want them to have the ability to continue the \nwork they have begun. Counties--not the State--are on the front lines \nin California.\n  The Dole-Packwood bill falls far short for States like mine where \nresponsibility for administering welfare has been delegated to the \ncounties. If we are serious about devolving authority to local \ncommunities, I see no reason to sustain a two-tiered welfare \nbureaucracy where the State simply passes the responsibility through to \nthe counties but keeps some of the funding for its own purposes. I want \nto see the people closest to the problem--the counties--have full \ncontrol of the Federal funds being allocated to implement this mandate.\n  In conclusion, the legislation currently before the Senate, I \nbelieve, fails to reform welfare in a way which will help California \nor, I believe, the Nation. I believe the alternative proposal by the \nDemocratic leadership is a more cost-effective vehicle for change in my \nState.\n  The Daschle bill addresses California's concern in the following \nways. It accommodates growth; it provides adequate child-care funding; \nit allows for local government control; it does not dump a huge \nunfunded mandate on the States with regard to immigrant benefits.\n  For 60 years now, this Nation has been generous to poor families with \ndependent children. Originally conceived during the Great Depression, \nAFDC was designed to keep widows at home with their children at a time \nwhen women were not valued in the work force.\n  The 1930's were a time when women and children were accorded respect \nand compassion if they were poor, because they were economically \nvulnerable. It seems that time has passed. But our goal in these times \nhas not changed. We still need a plan to assist the economically \nvulnerable, assist them to work and to be independent. So we must do so \nwith training, with child care, and with incentives to work. Surely a \nnation which could reach for the stars could also eliminate poverty.\n  I have been very fortunate in my life. I have not known poverty, and \nI have not known hunger. But I have known failure. To me, there are few \nhuman experiences that are worse.\n  Yet, our welfare system has rewarded failure and punished success. In \nthe process, we have created not only a dependency on welfare but a \ndependency on failure. It is overcoming failure which is the challenge \nbefore the Senate.\n  I very much hope that in reform we do not throw the baby out with the \nbath water, and that we also recognize that the American people are no \nless generous than they were in 1935. Today, perhaps, they are much \nmore practical. They want to know that their tax-paying dollars are \ngoing for good, solid, practical programs.\n  I do not believe there are Americans that really want to see \nyoungsters starving in the streets of our communities. They are still \nwilling to help those in need, provided they are willing to help \nthemselves.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to rise today to continue \ndiscussing welfare with a little different tack on it than yesterday. I \nwant to talk about what is going on on the other side of the aisle, and \nhow the President and the Senators on the Democratic side are \nparticipating, or, in some cases, not participating, in this debate.\n  I have been on the floor on many occasions over the past several \nmonths to talk about the President's abdication of responsibility in \ndealing with the most important issue that we have to deal with here in \nthis session of the Congress and one of the most important issues we \ndeal with in every sense of the Congress, and that is passing a \nbudget--passing a reconciliation bill. In this case, a very important \nreconciliation bill, because it is one that will bring our budget into \nbalance.\n  I got up on the floor of the Senate on many occasions and suggested \nthat the President has not come to the table in that respect in \noffering a balanced budget. I have not been to the floor in recent \nweeks because the President has not really been talking about his \nbudget--the one that he proposed, the 10-year balanced budget that he \nproposed.\n  I am not going about espousing how this brings us into balance, but \nyesterday he did an interview on NPR talking about how irresponsible \nthe Republican budget was, how irresponsible the Republicans were on \nMedicare, how irresponsible the Republicans are being on welfare, and I \nthought it was time to bring to the Senate floor and remind people of \nhow many days it has been since we put up a responsible Republican \nbalanced budget over a period of 7 years, and how long it has been \nsince the President has refused to come to the table and do so.\n  He gets away with a lot in the national media. I am not surprised \nwith NPR, but I would be surprised with any \n\n[[Page S 11832]]\nother mainstream media that he gets away with saying he lived up to his \nresponsibility. He says, ``My responsibility was fulfilled when I \noffered them an alternative balanced budget and a willingness to \ndiscuss it.''\n  When did he offer such an alternative budget? He did not. The \nCongressional Budget Office scored the President's balanced budget over \n10 years as producing annual deficits of $200 billion a year as far as \nthe eye can see. There is no balanced budget.\n  Standing here and wishing it were so, saying that because you can \ncook the numbers at the White House and change all the economic \nassumptions, assume faster growth, lower interest rates, that there \nwill not be any other problems out there, that does not make it a \nbalanced budget.\n  The President himself said that he would stick with the Congressional \nBudget Office because they have been the most accurate in assessing \nwhether a budget comes into balance or not and what the provisions cost \nthat we pass here in Washington. But he has abandoned that, and he has \ngone with the Office of Management and Budget--his own internal \nrecordkeeping to come up with this phony budget that he trots around \nthe country suggesting that he has come forward with a balanced budget. \nHe has not. It is absolutely amazing to me that the members of the \npress corps continue to publish this as if he has actually come forward \nwith a balanced budget when he has not.\n  But this should be no surprise. It is 83 days since the President has \nrefused to come forward with a balanced budget after the Republicans \nhave. It has been an equal number of days since he has been unwilling \nto come forward with a specific Medicare proposal, to tell us how he is \ngoing to get savings. In his 10-year balanced budget, he does call for \na reduction in Medicare spending. That is interesting to note, because \nhe is running around the country saying how the Republicans are going \nto gut Medicare because they are going to cut Medicare. I know the \nesteemed chairman of the Finance Committee has said on many occasions, \nas has the Budget Committee chairman from New Mexico, Medicare is going \nto grow under the Republican budget at 6.4 percent per year. What does \nit grow under the President's budget? At 7.1 percent. What does it grow \nif we do nothing? At 10.5 percent.\n  You can say the Republicans are reducing the rate of spending, of \ngrowth in Medicare. But you also have to say the President is doing the \nsame thing. In fact, there is only about $11 billion a year difference \nbetween the Republicans' and Democrats' number. That is, by the way, \nout of a program that is roughly a $200-billion-a-year program. So to \nsuggest the Republicans are slashing when the President is not, that is \njust not living up to the realities of what is going on here. The \nPresident goes after Medicare as much as we do, almost. He does not \nconsider that a cut. We do not consider ours a cut. We consider it \nstrengthening the program because otherwise it would go bankrupt. He \nknows that as well as we do. So, let us own up to what the problem is \non Medicare.\n  The reason I started with these two is now we are at the third major \nissue of the day, of the times, and that is welfare reform. And where \nis the President? Where is the President who ran as a moderate Democrat \non one issue, welfare? It was the defining issue, in the American \npublic's eye, that made him different from Michael Dukakis or Walter \nMondale. He was for ending welfare as we know it. He was the moderate \nDemocrat, the new Democrat who was going to come forward and change the \nsystem.\n  Where is he? Where is the proposal? Oh, he trotted out something late \nlast year, 19, 20 months into his term, that was dismissed by both \nsides as an irrelevant welfare bill--an irrelevant welfare bill. Even \nin comparison to what the Democratic leader has put up here, it was \nmodest. It was truly rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n  Where is he this year on an issue that he says is the most important \nissue to face this country? Where is he? Where is the welfare reform \nproposal that really takes us in a new direction, that really reaches \ninto the communities where poverty is at its worst and gives the people \nin those communities a chance, that changes the whole dynamic of the \nsystem? Where is that proposal? It is nonexistent. It is more than 83 \ndays. Hundreds of days have gone by without the President being \nrelevant.\n  Oh, that does not mean he cannot sit in the Oval Office and throw \ndarts at the Republican plan. We will see lots of that; of how this is \ncruel and how it does not solve the problem. But where is his answer? \nWhere is the leadership on the budget, with real numbers, with real \nchoices and decisions? Where is the leadership on Medicare, that \neveryone in this Chamber knows will be bankrupt in 7 years? Where is \nthe leadership? Where is the leadership on welfare, his defining issue?\n  Oh, it is political season down on Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time \njust to criticize what the Congress is doing and hope the voters do not \nnotice that you do not have anything to offer yourself.\n  One thing I will say, the minority leader, the Democratic leader and \nothers on the Democratic side, have actually come up with a proposal. \nThey have actually put forward a proposal on welfare. I will add, just \nto be consistent in comparison, that the Democratic leader offered no \nbalanced budget. No balanced budget, no substitute budget was offered. \nThere were no ideas on how they would get to a balanced budget.\n  Oh, there were plenty of criticisms, plenty of amendments, but no \nDemocratic budget to get this country into balance. Medicare--I have \nnot seen any program offered on the other side of the aisle on how we \nare going to solve the Medicare problem. I have not seen anything, not \neven a discussion of a discussion. Not even a possible meeting on the \nsubject.\n  Again, there is plenty of criticism on what the Republicans want to \ndo and the fact we are even thinking of doing it. But not one solution \non the other side of the aisle, not one discussion on how they would \nsolve the problem that everyone in this Chamber knows exists.\n  But now we move to welfare, and so they are 0 for 2 and they have \ndecided maybe this time, instead of watching the strikes go past, they \nare going to take a swing at it. They are going to take a swing and see \nif we can put forward a welfare plan that can attract some support \namong the American public. Unfortunately, they swung and they missed \nand missed badly. This is a strikeout. This is a strikeout. It is a \nstrike against the people who are in the system who need the help. It \nis a strike against those who have to pay for this system.\n  The Daschle bill tinkers with welfare. In fact, I would even add that \nit may make things worse rather than improve them. It, in fact, spends \nmore money. It eliminates AFDC--that is the big claim, they eliminate \nAFDC. Again, it is changing the name of the program. But there is still \nan entitlement program there for mothers and children. It is called now \nthe Temporary Employment Assistance Program. It replaces the AFDC \nProgram but it is still a Federal program with Federal guidelines \nadministered in Washington, run by bureaucrats here in Washington, \nadministered through the State. It costs $16 billion more than the \ncurrent AFDC Program. No, it does not spend less, it spends more on \nAFDC--now called TEAP--but $16 billion more over the next 7 years.\n  They say it puts time limits in. Remember, the President ran saying \nwe are going to put a 2-year limit on welfare and at some point we are \ngoing to cut people off of welfare if they refuse to work? The minority \nleader would have you believe his bill puts time limits on welfare. It \ndoes not. It puts a 5-year limit on the--and this is in the bill, they \ndo not use the word ``person,'' they use the word ``client.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on his chart?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  Are you referring to the President of the United States, when you use \nthe name ``Bill''? Or are you referring to a bill, as in a Senate bill?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am sorry, the Senator from California has not been \nhere for the many occasions that I have been questioned on this chart. \nOn each one of those occasions I have been asked a question about who \nam I referring to. This is referring to the President's lack of a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So you when you say ``Bill'' you mean the President of \nthe United States? \n\n[[Page S 11833]]\n\n  I would say to my friend, if I had asked you to yield and I said, \n``Will Ricky yield for a question?'' I would think that would not be \nappropriate and I would not do that. I would say ``Will the Senator \nyield?''\n  I think, when we refer to the President of the United States on the \nSenate floor, be it in verbiage or on a chart, we ought to be \nrespectful.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. That is a common voice that I hear \nfrom the other side every time I have this chart up. So I appreciate \nthe Senator being added to the chorus of people who do not like my \nchart. But I am glad people are paying attention. Maybe the White House \nwill pay attention and actually come forward with a budget.\n  It is easy for me. I do not have to come here and do this. I can \nactually put this chart away, file it away for another day. All the \nPresident has to do is put a budget forward.\n  I would say to the Senator from California, who hopefully is \nlistening in the Cloakroom, on a couple of occasions I came to the \nfloor and noted example after example how Members on her side of the \naisle refer to the President of the United States by his first name, \nterms like, ``Where is George?'' ``Bushwhack,'' ``Reaganomics.'' I can \ngo on down the list. So to be indignant in this case is just further \nevidence of the fact that maybe people are uncomfortable with the fact \nthat the President has not put forward his budget, and since you cannot \nargue the substance, let us argue the chart.\n  Getting back to the Democratic bill on this subject of welfare \nreform, they say they impose a 5-year limit, but in fact they do not \nbecause there are in this bill--here is the substitute, and we have \npages 8 through 11, four pages of exceptions, of people who do not have \nto live by the 5-year time limit.\n  So there are a whole host of exceptions to people who are limited to \n5 years, and I will go through some of them. There is a hardship \nexception. That is the first one on here. A hardship exception is \npeople who are on AFDC, or now this new program, who live in high \nunemployment areas. So if you are on unemployment--high in this case is \ndefined as 7\\1/2\\ percent--if you are in a high unemployment area, 7\\1/\n2\\ percent or higher, you do not have to worry about the time limit.\n  Just to give you an idea, in 1994, people who lived in these cities \nwould not have 5-year time limits: Los Angeles, Washington, New York, \nPhiladelphia, Miami, Detroit, and the list goes on. None of those \npeople would have time limits. I do not know what percentage of the \npeople on AFDC are in those cities, but I would suggest a pretty good \npercentage of them are.\n  All of them are now off the list. They do not count toward the \nState's participation rate. So you have large groups of folks who will \nnever be time limited, particularly in the major cities of this \ncountry. One huge loophole. And there are a lot of suburban areas and \nrural areas that also qualify with these high unemployment areas.\n  I know that in several counties, rural counties in Pennsylvania that \nhave had difficult times, the unemployment rate is well in excess of 7 \npercent.\n  In New Jersey, there are 99 areas for computing unemployment. Of the \n99, 35 had rates in excess of 7\\1/2\\ percent in 1994. So you can see \nthat this is a major loophole to this 5-year requirement.\n  What else? Well, teenagers are exempt. Anybody who is a teenager does \nnot have a 5-year limit. If you have a child while you are a teenager, \nyou do not have a 5-year limitation. Your limitation does not kick in \nuntil you become the age of maturity and beyond. So you can get a much \nlonger period of time if you have children when you are a teen.\n  It does not apply to mothers who are having children. You get a year \nexemption. If you have a child, you have a 1-year exemption. It extends \nyour 5-year limit another year. And it goes on and on.\n  There are literally pages of exemptions for people to the 5 years. \nAll I would suggest is it is a phony 5 years. And remember, this only \napplies, to begin with, to 20 percent of the caseload; 20 percent of \nthe people who go into the system have to go into this kind of program \nwith all of these exemptions in place. That is 20 percent of the \nremaining caseload--not 20 percent of everybody but 20 percent of the \npeople who are not exempt.\n  So you take the people who are exempt out first and then you say you \nhave to have 20 percent. To give you an idea how that compares with the \nRepublican bill, the Republican bill is 20 percent of everybody, \nwhether they are exempt or not. In fact, there are no exemptions in the \nRepublican plan. The State can figure out who is exempt if they want \nto. It goes up to 50 percent in the Republican bill; in the Democratic \nbill, over a period of 5 years, but again the Democrats have this huge \nexempt group out here that never has to participate in this program. So \nit is a phony 5 years and a phony number of people who are going to be \nin this kind of program.\n  Under the Dole-Packwood bill, the savings in the welfare program over \nthe next 7 years are $70 billion. That is less than the House bill. The \nHouse bill is $60 some billion but it is over 5 years. The Senate bill \nis $70 billion over 7 years, and, of course, the House bill will be \nmuch more over 7 years. The Democratic bill, $21 billion over 7 years--\n$21 billion over 7 years in programs that spend over $100 billion a \nyear.\n  Take in one case the child support enforcement provision. Very \nimportant. The Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, was \nabsolutely correct that this is a very important aspect of the bill, to \ntrack down deadbeat dads--and 98 percent of the folks who owe back \nchild support are fathers--to track down deadbeat dads and get them to \npay the back child support. We are talking about over $50 billion in \nback child support owed in this country.\n  So this is a very important provision in this bill. You would think \nthat when tracking down deadbeat dads and getting them to pay the child \nsupport, as we do in this bill, that part of the child support paid \nback would go to the State, because it would offset the welfare \npayments that are being made to mom. In other words, if the mother and \nchildren get child support, they no longer get welfare. This would \nactually be a cost savings to the Federal Government. And, in fact, in \nthe Dole bill it saves $155 million a year, $1.2 billion over 7 years. \nThe Democratic bill costs $261 million over the next 3 years. That is \nthe only estimate we have at this point. So it costs money over those 3 \nyears.\n  What does this bill do for State flexibility? You are hearing a lot \nabout getting the bill and the program back to the States, back to the \nlocalities where they solve the problems the best, giving State \nflexibility. You will hear, as I have on some shows with some Members \nof the other side talking about welfare, the term ``partnership.'' What \nthe Democratic bill does is create a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the State government, and that this partnership will be \nforged where they work together to solve the problems of poverty. It \nsounds so nice, except it is not true.\n  A partnership is where each party has a say in the decision; that \nthey work together to come to a decision jointly. That is exactly what \nhappens under the Republican bill. Some decisions are made \npredominantly in Washington, other decisions are made predominantly in \nthe State. Most of them in fact are made by the State.\n  Under the Democratic bill, all the decisions are still made in \nWashington. You want to do something different in your State? You have \nto ask Washington for permission. I do not know too many people who are \ngoing to get involved in the partnership where the one partner \nbasically can tell the other partner no all the time and go ahead and \ndo whatever they want to do without asking them. But that is this \npartnership that they would have you believe is a partnership. That is \nthe current system. The current system already allows for waivers. This \ndoes not change it any. It just says we will be nicer and give you \nmore. But that is up to the President to decide.\n  You can see there is even some little special interest things in the \nDemocratic bill that remind you what constituency they are really \nserving here, and it is not the poor. This is not the poor. There is a \nprovision in this bill that has to do with the Work First program, the \nprogram that they get people in to get to work immediately upon getting \non welfare. \n\n[[Page S 11834]]\n\n  Participants in the Daschle bill program would be forbidden to fill \nany unfilled vacancy--in other words, ``participants'' meaning \nemployers--employers would be prohibited from filling any unfilled \nvacancy at their place of employment or to perform any activities that \nwould supplant the hiring of employed workers not funded under the \nprogram.\n  What does this mean? This means if you have a vacancy and you are in \na unionized job--most of these participants would be governed--that you \nnot fill a job slot with a welfare employee; you have to hire the union \nperson first. So unions do not lose any positions under this. The \nGovernment has to fill the job created in the bureaucracy with another \nunionized person. They cannot take a slot and fill it with a welfare \nrecipient who wants to get the job opportunity. Oh, no. We have to bow \nto the AFL-CIO here on the floor and make sure that any jobs we create \nfor this new work-force program are basically new--probably in many \ncases make-work jobs--because you cannot even supplant the hiring of \nemployed workers. You cannot even supplant the hiring of employed \nworkers.\n  This is one big bout to the AFL-CIO and one big ``Who cares?'' to the \npoor. We do not want to give you good job opportunities and \nopportunities where you can, in effect, learn some skills in jobs that \nare needed. We want to make jobs for you and keep you on the dole.\n  That is where this program goes. It keeps the gravy train running. It \nkeeps the entitlements and keeps the control, and it keeps everything \ndecided here in Washington and spends more money in the process.\n  I know a lot of people in this country are looking for welfare \nreform. But you have not found it here. It does not exist in this \nproposal. I do not know if I need to start another chart of how many \ndays it will be since Democrats have come up with a welfare reform \nproposal, because this is not it. If you want to get serious about \nwelfare reform, let us talk about working together on a bipartisan \nbasis for something real, something that fundamentally changes things, \nnot playing around with the existing programs, spending more money and \npaying off your constituencies that help you get elected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nCindy Baldwin, who is a fellow in my office this year, be granted the \nprivileges of the floor for the remainder of the debate on welfare \nreform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Which may be a substantial period of time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have some remarks that I would like to make on the \nwork components of the two major bills, the Dole-Packwood bill and the \nDaschle-Mikulski-Breaux bill. But the twist of fate has put me in the \nposition to be looking across the Chamber at my good friend and partner \nin some other good causes. And the question of, Where is the President? \nAnd I do, in fairness, want to respond to that question.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has discussed the role that the \nPresident's discussion of welfare reform had in the 1992 campaign. And \nI agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania; it was a pivotal role. It \nwas the defining element of the campaign. And may I say, as a Democrat, \nhow proud I was that we had a Presidential candidate in 1992 who broke \nwith the past, who was not defensive about the status quo, who was \nprepared to take on some interest groups, frankly, within the \nDemocratic Party who had always said, ``Do not touch welfare.'' I mean, \nif you touch welfare you are really talking about beating up on welfare \nrecipients. For your own political advantage--In this case, I think the \nPresident stood up and stood out and said very clearly, welfare as we \nknow it has to change. Welfare as we know it has to change. And I \nreally believe that, had the President not taken that leadership stand, \nwe would not be in the process of considering and having a genuine \nopportunity to adopt welfare reform. We may disagree--obviously we do \ndisagree on some of the specifics. But I think that the President's \nposition in 1992, and his following of that position since then, has \ncreated a bipartisan consensus in favor of welfare reform. And his \nprinciples as enunciated in the campaign were to create time limits, to \nrequire work, to give the States flexibility, to deal with teenage \npregnancy and to increase the child support enforcement role.\n  Mr. President, last summer the President introduced a bill, proposed \nlegislation, that would follow through, implement those principles that \nhe enunciated in the campaign. I want to say to my friend, and my \ncolleagues, that the President has worked very closely with the \nDemocratic Senate leadership, and I believe the House leadership, to \nfashion the proposal that is before the Senate now or will be when \nintroduced as a substitute by Senator Daschle and Senator Breaux and \nSenator Mikulski, which is the so-called Work First proposal.\n  The President has joined forces in that sense with the Senate \nDemocratic leadership. He has unequivocally endorsed the proposal. His \nendorsement is part of the reason why there is a remarkable unity among \nSenate Democrats. I remember the old Will Rogers line, ``I belong to no \norganized political party. I am a Democrat.'' That is true. Often that \nis the case. But in this case it is not true. That is to say, the \nDemocrats are united behind the principles that the President \nenunciated in 1992.\n  I will say one thing concerning the question that continues to \nresonate toward me in those luminescent colors of blue and yellow \nacross the Chamber, which is this: that President Clinton has not just \nspoken on this issue, he has acted. He has used the authority that the \nlaw gives him as President to grant waivers to the States, more \nwaivers, granted more rapidly, than any President before him. More than \nhalf the States now have waivers.\n  And the truth is that in the midst of all of the discussion and \nrhetoric and contests going on here, the real work of welfare reform in \nthe midst of the parameters that we set at the Federal level is going \non at the State level. They are experimenting. And one of the things I \nhope we will show in this debate is some sense of humility when we are \ndealing with the lives of millions of people in a system that we agree \nhas gone wrong, to understand that while we know what is wrong with the \nsystem, we, in most cases, do not have a great reason to have a great \nsense of confidence about exactly what will make it better. The States, \nin their experiments, are going to help us do that. And the President \nhas encouraged that. And this proposal builds on that.\n  So I do not know that I have totally satisfied the interrogatory \nalleged by the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I feel very, very secure \nin saying that on this issue President Clinton was out in front early, \nformed a consensus, and has been directly involved in the work that \nbrings us, hopefully in the near future, to the adoption of genuine \nwelfare reform.\n  Mr. President, this is an important debate. There have been some very \nthoughtful statements made in the first couple of days of the debate \nwhich showed that the people really thought about this issue and \nunderstand the importance of it to those who are on welfare, to those \nof us who pay for welfare, and really to the country, and to the \npeople's attitude toward Government, because the fact is welfare has \nbecome a symbol, in some senses a caricature, of all that has gone \nwrong with our Government, a well-intentioned program created in the \n1930's, as we all know, to help widows, particularly widows of coal \nminers, then becomes an enormous program that takes basic American \nvalues--work, reward for work, family, loyalty to family, and personal \nresponsibility--and turns them on their head. And in doing so, builds \nup an enormous bureaucracy, a kind of institutionalization of a lot of \nvalues gone astray.\n  So the debate here has been a good one. There is obviously a very, \nvery broad consensus supporting reform. There are winds in the willows \nhere. There are echoes in the Chamber that suggest it may not be \npossible to finish this debate this week. I am not surprised at that. \nAnd I do not think it is a bad sign. \n\n[[Page S 11835]]\n\n  Mr. President, it took us 60 years--60 years--for our welfare system \nto become the mess it is. We are not going to solve it in 6 days. We \nare not going to solve it right in 6 days. So, I hope that we will \nbegin the debate, lay down some basic proposals, and then continue when \nwe come back to do it the right way.\n  We all agree, I think, that the current system fails to demand \nresponsibility and provide work opportunities. It financially rewards \nparents who do not work, who do not marry, but who do have children out \nof wedlock. By doing so, our current welfare system demeans our most \ncherished values and really deepens society's worst problems, including \nthe problem of violent crime which has cut at the fabric of trust that \nused to underlay the sense of community that was so basically part of \nAmerican life. Gone, the victim of violent crime.\n  Mr. President, there is, as I say, this broad agreement that our \nsystem must change, and I believe that there is also bipartisan \nagreement that one can see through the discussion on the goals of \nwelfare reform. Democrats and Republicans agree that the welfare system \nshould focus first and foremost on moving people into the work force.\n  A reform system, obviously, should also combat the causes of welfare \ndependency, particularly the growth in out-of-wedlock pregnancies among \nteenagers. I hope to return to the floor on some other occasion to talk \nabout this epidemic problem the Senator from New York has foreseen, has \ndocumented, has spoken of with such insight.\n  May I just say the obvious, which is that if we can deal effectively \nwith out-of-wedlock pregnancies, if we can create a national effort to \ntry to cut down the number of pregnancies, this problem that has gone \nwild, we will thereby cut down the welfare rolls.\n  The welfare rolls are composed of children in great part who were \nborn out of wedlock. They are, therefore, dependent children. It is a \nchild or children living with the mother and no father, or at least no \nfather who has assumed responsibility and gone through marriage and \nlives legally in the house.\n  So I hope we will act on this shared impulse of reaction to this \nterrible problem. The system reform should reinforce, not undermine, \nour shared values and a reformed system should fulfill our national \ncommitment, in the midst of all the changes, that we try to provide \nprotections for our poorest children, remembering that they are the \ninnocent victims of the errors, misdeeds, irresponsibility, very often, \nof their parents.\n  So when we say ``entitlement,'' there is no entitlement, as the \nSenator from New York has pointed out. It is up to the States whether \nthey want to deal with the problems of the poorest.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be proud to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, is the Senator from Connecticut aware \nthat he is the first Senator, other than the Senator from New York, to \nmake that point in this now 2-day debate? There is no entitlement. I am \nprofoundly grateful to him, for at least he has heard that voice.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from New York. I am proud to be in \nhis company. That is the truth. It is up to the States to decide that \nthey wish to enter this system the Federal Government has created. It \nis really the choice of the State. There is no coercion here. But once \nthey decide, they have to play by the rules, and one of the rules--it \ncertainly seems like a good one, and I would guess it is a rule that \nwould be accepted in principle by a great majority of people in \nAmerica--and that is we care for the children.\n  I hope whatever system we adopt provides that level of guarantee for \na decent life for our children in this country.\n  The pending legislation, as amended by S. 1120, the Republican \nleader's bill, will create a welfare system that I believe will fail \nultimately to meet its primary objective, which is to put people to \nwork in great numbers, to get them off of welfare. It fails to give the \nStates the right incentives and resources to put people to work, and I \nam afraid that it ignores a lot of what we have learned about what \nworks and what does not in getting people off welfare.\n  Finally, I do not think it holds States accountable for their \nsuccess, that is I do not think that it gives them incentives \nappropriately to succeed or that it creates standards to measure in a \nfair and reasonable, rational way what success really means.\n  Mr. President, for the remainder of the time speaking this afternoon, \nI want to focus in on the work requirements.\n  We know a lot about what it takes to get people to work. In 1988, \nCongress passed the Family Support Act under the skilled and, may I \nsay, unique leadership of Senator Moynihan. The Job Opportunities Basic \nSkills Program, which has come to be known as JOBS, established by the \nact, sought to provide training to people on welfare to prepare them \nfor work. Evaluations of the JOBS Program that have been conducted have \nshown that the programs have had some success; they have begun to make \na difference.\n  Obviously, they have suffered from a lack of funding in some \nsubstantial degree, but welfare-to-work programs have increased work \nparticipation. The Government education and training programs have not \nyet moved large numbers of welfare recipients permanently into the work \nforce, and so we hope in this bill to try to do better.\n  But I do want to stress that it is critically important that we do \nnot dismiss the JOBS Program in that sense, but that we build on what \nwe have learned from the JOBS Program. Our experience with that program \nhas taught us several important lessons, one of which is that programs \nthat are focused on education and training, on investing in human \ncapital, have had some results. Programs that have, however, emphasized \nthe immediate work experience along with education and training have \nseemed to be more successful.\n  What research is showing us is that providing an initial connection \nto the work force, a step on the first rung on the ladder of work, then \nto be combined with training and education, seems to be an approach \nthat gives us some hope of making a welfare recipient find a way off \nwelfare and into work.\n  What we have learned from the Family Support Act is that education \nand training are critical to continue to climb up the ladder to self-\nsufficiency. But it is Work First, which is the title of the Democratic \nbill, that will spur a recipient on and improve her life--it seems \nobvious, but it is important in this area of human frailty and profound \nhuman problems to test what seems obvious. It means that a recipient \nshould, whenever possible, first take a job--any job--that is offered \nher to discover what her abilities are and then to be helped to learn \nthe basic skills that most employers value, some of them very basic but \ncritically important skills, like showing up to work on time, having \ngood work habits, working hard, notifying employers of absences, \ncommunicating well with coworkers.\n  The traditional education system has failed most of our welfare \nrecipients. Education and training, therefore, must play a critical \nrole in helping them succeed in the work force. But we have to connect \nrecipients to work and then help them succeed once they are in that \nwork environment. And that is what this bill, which Senators Daschle, \nBreaux, and Mikulski have introduced, and many of us have cosponsored, \nhas focused on.\n  Employers--and we have to listen to the people who are going to give \nthese welfare recipients jobs--employers say over and over again that \nit is not necessarily formally trained workers that they need, but \ndependable workers, workers that they can help to train along with \nGovernment-supported training programs.\n  As one employer said to me, ``I can train an employee to take apart \nand reassemble a widget, but I cannot train her to show up to work on \ntime.''\n  So programs that have taken a work-first approach, we think, have had \nthe most encouraging results. There has been a lot of discussion here, \nand I need not go on at length about the GAIN program in Riverside \nCounty, CA, which is one such positive example. The program focuses on \nquickly placing people in private-sector jobs and \n\n[[Page S 11836]]\nemphasizes low-paying jobs are an opportunity to start up a career \nladder and should not be turned down.\n  Mr. President, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. evaluated \nthe program and found a percentage of the recipients employed was 13.6 \npercent higher than in a control group.\n The JOBS programs run in Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and other places, \nprovide additional evidence of the importance of this strategy that \nemphasizes rapid job entry.\n\n  Mr. President, we have also learned that private investment in \nsupport agencies can effectively move welfare recipients into the work \nforce. So I would say that the three characteristics that we find from \nsuccessful programs are, first, that each assesses the needs and skills \nof each of its clients individually and assumes that they want to work.\n  Second, each program bypasses traditional education and training and, \ninstead, puts its clients to work as quickly as possible. But then, \nobviously, it has to supplement that with the education and training.\n  Third, successful programs do form strong links with local employers \nand work hard to maintain those links with the local employers, who are \nthe source of the jobs.\n  Another example of the private sector agency that has done some \nsuccessful work is America Works, which has been working in Connecticut \nfor a period of time. It is a for-profit placement and support \norganization that has helped over 5,000 welfare recipients find full-\ntime private sector jobs in New York, Connecticut, and Indianapolis. It \nplaces 60 percent of those in the program into jobs, and of that \npercent, 68 percent are hired permanently at an average wage of $15,000 \nper year, including benefits; 75 percent are still off of welfare 18 \nmonths later, at a cost to the Government of $5,400 per placement. \nAmerica Works is cost effective, especially when compared to other \npublic sector only programs.\n  Mr. President, we have to be honest here and say that successful \nprograms are still the exception and not the rule. That is the \ndifficult challenge that we face. States need more incentives to move \nrecipients into the labor market. We have to move the system away as we \nall want to, I am sure, from one that focuses on writing checks to one \nthat focuses on getting people into employment and providing the \nnecessary backup and education and training to keep them there. We need \nto change the incentives in the current system and to reward States, \nadministrators, and caseworkers for placing recipients in work.\n  There is simply not enough incentive in the current system, or may I \nsay in the Republican leadership bill, that rewards States directly for \nmeeting the most important goal of all, which is to place and keep a \nwelfare recipient in a job--a private sector, unsubsidized job.\n  Mr. President, the Republican leadership bill does take one important \nstep, I think, in the right direction. That is, to give States the \nflexibility to design innovative work-based programs. But flexibility \nis not synonymous with reform, and therein lies the fundamental flaw of \nthe Republican leadership bill. The problem with S. 1120 is that it \ngives States flexibility, but without the proper incentives to do the \nright thing, without the resources, without the accountability, without \nthe measurement of success. The bill sets States up, I am afraid, to \nfail to meet the fundamental goal that the bill establishes, which is \nto help establish self-sufficiency through work. Then it lets States \noff the hook when they fail.\n  Mr. President, S. 1120 looks tough on work, but ultimately I am \nafraid it will not deliver on that toughness, because it does not give \nthe States the resources they need to help put welfare recipients to \nwork.\n  There are some similarities, which is encouraging, to the Democratic \nWork First proposal. One is that it requires States to ensure that an \nincreasingly high percentage of their welfare caseload is involved in \nwork activities. By the year 2000, States must ensure that 50 percent \nof people receiving welfare are working in a private sector job for at \nleast 30 hours a week, or are participating in vocational education.\n  But I am afraid when you look closely at S. 1120, the Republican \nbill, you have to conclude that the States are going to have a very \nhard time meeting those work requirements, that 50 percent goal, 50 \npercent of welfare recipients to work, because the States simply cannot \nafford to meet them. States will not have the money they need to pay \nfor child care and other support for single parents participating in \npart-time work.\n  The Republican leadership block grant proposal freezes Federal \nsupport for cash assistance in child care at $16.8 billion--actually, \nless than what we are spending now, even as it requires States to move \nmore than three times as many individuals into work activities.\n  Mr. President, we all want to save money on welfare. But it seems to \nme that we should learn the lessons of business. In so many cases, you \ndo not save money, you do not turn out a better service, unless you \ninvest a little bit. That is exactly what we have to do to achieve \nlonger range savings for a better service, a better program.\n  Today, as required by the Family Support Act, about 400,000 people \nare participating in mandatory training or work programs for at least \n20 hours a week. That is no small accomplishment. Under the Republican \nleadership bill, by the year 2000, 1.3 million individuals would have \nto be in work activities for not 20, but at least 30 hours per week. So \nthe Republican leadership proposal triples the number of people who \nwill need child care, for instance, but adds no new funds; it basically \ntriples the number of people who will have to be in these mandatory \nwork programs for 10 more hours a week, but asks the States to do it \nwith effectively less and less money.\n  The unfunded costs, as estimated by the Department of HHS, and \nroughly, I gather, confirmed by CBO, the unfunded cost of these work \nrequirements in S. 1120 is a whopping $23 billion over 7 years. The \nState of Connecticut, my State, alone would have to spend an additional \n$300 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask, where will the States get that money? I am \ngoing to suggest on this chart that they have four choices to satisfy \nthe goal of getting 50 percent of welfare recipients into work. One is \nto raise State and local taxes. That is not a very pleasant prospect \nfor the Governors and State legislators, and I doubt they will do it.\n  Second is to deny assistance to needy families, either to make the \nwelfare eligibility requirements more restrictive or to cut down the \nbenefit level.\n  Third is to cut back on child care support, meager as it may be in \nmost places, and, therefore, force people to go to work, but to do so \nat the cost of leaving their children home alone, unattended.\n  The fourth choice is not to go ahead with reform, not to achieve the \n50 percent welfare-to-work goal that is set out in S. 1120, and the \npunishment is a 5-percent reduction of the block grant.\n  Well, it seems to me, we talk a lot about market incentives in this \nChamber, and I am all for them. We are going to give the States--\nspeaking in macro terms--a choice here. The choice is to spend the $23 \nbillion-plus over the 7 years for what I would call the ``unfunded \nmandate,'' or to lose what amounts to $6 billion, which is the \ncumulative total of a 5-percent reduction for no reform.\n  I am afraid that just on the basis of fiscal incentive, the system \nset up in S. 1120 will encourage States not to achieve the work goals \nin their proposal and, therefore, to take the relatively more \nattractive $6 billion hit.\n  Mr. President, let me offer one final chart and then I will close \nbecause I see my friend from Missouri here.\n  By contrast, I think the Work First proposal of Senators Daschle, \nBreaux, and others of us, really does do the job and understands that \nyou have to spend some money to save some money here. It funds the work \nrequirement through spending cuts within existing welfare programs. It \nunderstands that you are not going to get people to go to work--and \nthese are people who need some special help to get out there and go to \nwork--without some money.\n  Second, Mr. President, the Senate Democratic leadership proposal, \nwhich really is welfare reform, builds on a successful experience in \nthe State of Iowa--and a few other States have tried it--which is when \nwelfare recipients come in to apply, from day one, they undergo a work \nassessment profile, a work assessment test that is done on them. And \nthey are asked to sign a contract.\n \n[[Page S 11837]]\n\n  In other words, we are not just going to give them a check: Come in, \nshow you meet the basic requirements, write a check, and that is that. \nThe check is no longer unconditional. The check requires something of \nthe recipient to meet her part of what we call the parent empowerment \ncontract.\n  That goes from day one. Part of that contract is to accept any job \noffer. Sometimes you have a situation where people say that is not good \nenough for me, that is a minimum wage job. The point is, we found if \nyou start with a minimum wage job, you work your way up.\n  Third, as others have said, the Democratic proposal provides child \ncare.\n  Fourth, an important part that Senator Breaux and I may build on in \nan amendment later in the debate, the Democratic proposal provides \nbonuses to States for private-sector job placements. The amendment to \nthe Republican leadership bill will take 3, 4, 5 percent successively \nfrom the $16.8 billion in the bill and put it into a special fund that \nwill be redistributed to the States based on the number of people they \nget off of welfare and into private-sector jobs. I think that is the \nkind of incentive that can make these work requirements really work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is important to remember that welfare as \nwe have known it for 60 years is first and foremost a program to \nprotect the lives of children. Nine million of the 14 million welfare \nrecipients are kids--9 million.\n  Helping parents receive self-sufficiency through work will help kids. \nChildren growing up in a home with a working parent have a much more \npositive environment, positive role model, and less poverty. Requiring \nwork breaks the vicious cycle that is creating such--for want of a \nbetter term--an underclass in our society. That is why Senator \nDaschle's Work First proposal demands that people who are receiving \nbenefits work.\n  I hope that the proposal that I have described will assist the debate \nand, in whole or in part, draw bipartisan support. I think it deserves \nit. I hope my colleagues will agree with me that it is really through \nholding States accountable for their record at placing people in \nprivate-sector jobs that we will genuinely achieve welfare reform and \nimprove the plight of these millions of children who are born to \npoverty with the odds stacked against them as they go forward in life.\n  The greatest barrier to equal opportunity in our society today is \npoverty. Too often, that barrier has been made even more rigid by a \nwelfare system that sends all the wrong messages to people in our \nsociety.\n  I hope we together, Republicans and Democrats, side by side as this \ndebate goes forward, can finally and effectively reform that system.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to commend the Senator for an excellent \npresentation and statement, and in particular his emphasis on the child \ncare and the work provisions.\n  I think the Senator has made the case that unless you are going to \nhave a good training program in terms of moving people off of welfare, \nunless you have the day care--of the 10 million children today on \nwelfare, only 400,000 actually get any kind of day care; the other \nchildren do not--unless we are going to manage that, we are not going \nto be able to get the kind of results we want.\n  We are also going to have to at least provide the assurance of some \nhealth benefits for those children under the Medicaid Program.\n  Is it the sense of the Senator that folding into the majority \nleader's program effectively all of the training programs which were \nout there for working families--the dislocated worker programs, or \nworkers that lose their jobs because of either trade agreements like \nNAFTA or GATT, or coal miners or timber industry workers or displaced \ndefense workers, men and women who have worked generally a lifetime, \nall they need is an upgrading of their skills--those programs have been \neffective in helping and assisting these workers, particularly through \nthe community college program, which we are all familiar with and which \nis in all of our States, the good work and the training programs; that \nit really does not make any sense to take away those programs and take \nall of that money, the $30 billion and put it into the other pot; \neffectively, the workfare program, which has been suggested or actually \nmore than suggested, included in the majority leader's program?\n  Is the Senator concerned about what we would be doing to working \nfamilies who have lost their jobs through no action of their own, and \nwho need that kind of upgrading and training so they can get additional \njobs in the future, and that effectively we have just taken all of the \ntraining programs and put it in here to workfare, in too many \ninstances, dead-end jobs that do not do the kind of reform that I know \nthe Senator and others and the Senator from New York are committed to?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and I thank him for his kind words and for his question \nwhich I think puts a finger on something I am very concerned about, the \nanswer to his question is yes, I am concerned.\n  It seems to me there are two great problems pressing in our society \ntoday. One is the problem of people caught in the cycle of poverty--\nusually people on welfare for whom the current system has failed. We \nwant to change that. We want to give those people incentives, training, \nand a reason to go to work.\n  Second, we have a whole group of people in our society who are \nworking-class, middle-class families who have been dislocated for one \nreason or another--defense downsizing, changes in the economy, the \neconomy becoming more high tech, more information-age oriented--and \nthey are profoundly unsettled and worried about their ability to \nprovide for their families in the future.\n  There are a whole set of programs that we have built up, this \nCongress has built up, over succeeding administrations, supported by \nboth parties, to try to provide essential assistance to those working \nmiddle-class families to help retrain them and to get them back to \nwork.\n  What we are trying to do here in the welfare reform proposal is to \ncreate a new effective program to help people at the bottom, to help \nthem up from the bottom and get them into the work force.\n  It seems to me to take from the working family program and to combine \nit with trying to get the welfare people to work will mean that both \nprograms are ultimately going to be underfunded and each group will \nsuffer. Each group really needs not to suffer but to be helped.\n  I hope as this debate goes on, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nwe can work together across the aisle to make sure there is enough \nmoney here to make the promise of work and the requirement of work \nreal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see others on the floor. I welcome the statement of \nthe majority leader indicating that there might be some additional \nopportunity to do some corrective action on the child care program.\n  I hope that we will also have an opportunity to do it in the work \ntraining program. These are two extremely important features of it. \nThat will take some debate and some discussion. I know the Senator from \nConnecticut wants to do it.\n  I welcome the opportunity of working with others in those areas. \nPerhaps if we had more time, we could really make sure we get a bill \nthat is worthy of its name.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the welfare reform legislation before the \nSenate insists on more individual responsibility. It penalizes \ndestructive behavior and it promotes work. The legislation provides new \nauthority to the States, affirming federalism and allowing Governors to \nmake bold reforms. This bill will reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Nutrition assistance is a major part of our Nation's system of social \nprograms. The legislation before us contains a modified form of an \noriginal bill approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee on June 14. \nAll Republican members of the committee voted for the bill, along with \none Democratic member.\n  That bill, now part of the leadership proposal we are considering, \nmakes \n\n[[Page S 11838]]\ndramatic changes in the food stamp program. These changes reflect the \nthree goals of individual responsibility, State empowerment, and \ndeficit reduction.\n  First, the Agriculture Committee bill reduces the Federal deficit by \n$19.1 billion over the next 5 years, and $30.1 billion over 7 years. \nPart of these savings are obtained through a crackdown on fraud and \nfood stamp trafficking. The majority of savings, however, result from \nbenefit cutbacks, tighter eligibility rules, and policy reforms. The \nstandard deduction that is used to calculate food stamp benefits will \nbe lower under this bill than under current law. Similarly, the bill \nwill pay food stamp benefits based on the thrifty food plan, and not \n103 percent of that plan as is the case today.\n  Second, this bill requires individuals to take more responsibility \nfor their actions. The legislation withdraws benefits from able-bodied \nchildless adults who do not work. It disqualifies any individual who \nvoluntarily quits a job or reduces the number of hours worked. It \ndenies benefits to anyone who violates an AFDC work requirement, and \nbars food stamps from increasing when a family's welfare check is cut \nbecause they failed to comply with other welfare program requirements, \nsuch as making sure children stay in school or receive immunization \nshots.\n  This important policy change puts an end to the mixed message that \nour welfare system sends to recipients. Up to now, when a welfare \nrecipient's cash benefits have been reduced as a penalty, his or her \nfood stamps have automatically increased, partly offsetting the loss of \nincome.\n  For food stamp work requirements, the bill establishes new mandatory \nminimum disqualification periods for violators. States will have the \nauthority to disqualify for longer periods. In sharp contrast to \ncurrent law, this legislation will allow States to permanently \ndisqualify three-time repeat violators.\n  The bill will discourage teen pregnancy by requiring that minor \nparents living at home apply for benefits with their parents. In \naddition, the bill will place new responsibilities on anyone sponsoring \na legal alien who then applies for food stamps.\n  Third, the legislation before us will empower the States. States will \nhave a broad range of new authorities to design simplified food stamp \nprograms and conform procedures and rules for AFDC households. The bill \nwill allow States to obtain waivers for welfare demonstration projects \nthat reduce food stamp benefits or restrict eligibility. The bill also \ncompels the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be more responsive to \nState waiver requests by imposing a strict turnaround time for initial \nresponses to these requests, with automatic approval if USDA misses its \ndeadline.\n  Under this legislation, States will be able to pay wage subsidies in \nlieu of food stamps--innovative programs in which the amount of the \nfood stamp benefit is paid to an employer who hires a recipient. The \nemployer then passes the benefit along as a wage.\n  Finally, the legislation allows States to choose an optional block \ngrant instead of the regular food stamp program. States would be \neligible for an amount equal to the higher of their 1994 food stamp \nfunding level or the 1992-94 average. Seventy-five percent of the \namount expended would have to be spent on food assistance, with the \nremainder to be spent on payments in return for work, work \nsupplementation programs, other work-related initiatives, and \nadministrative costs.\n  The bill approved by the Agriculture Committee did not include the \nblock grant option. Although several Senators on the committee \nsupported block grants, a majority did not.\n  I believe that the optional block grant that has been developed over \nthe past several weeks gives States a fair choice. If they are \nconcerned about the possibility of a demographic change or a large, \nrecession-induced increase in their caseload, they may continue to \nparticipate in the Federal food stamp program, and benefit from all the \nflexibility provided in this bill. But if States prefer, they now have \nthe ability to make a one-time choice of block-granted benefits. It is \ntheir decision.\n  Mr. President, we should give States the opportunity to try new \napproaches. We must make it clear to recipients of public assistance \nthat more will be expected of them. And we should spend less money on \nwelfare.\n  The legislation before us passes all three of these tests. I hope all \nSenators will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nwaiting just a few more moments. I think the Senator from Washington \nalso wanted to speak, Senator Murray.\n  Let me just sort of lay out where we are and where we are going. I \ndiscovered a lot of people want to go home, which has some impact on \nwhat we are doing.\n  I think it is fair to say we have had almost 2 solid days of debate \non welfare reform, plus statements by the two leaders on Saturday. And \nI think, without exception, we have had good debate. We have had \ndifferent points of view, different philosophical approaches. But \noverall it has been steady, and we have had very few quorum calls.\n  But it is also clear to me--and I am not criticizing anybody, I just \nknow how this place works--we are not going to finish the bill this \nweek. We could stay all night every night. So the question is, let us \ndo it next week. But I know from counting on this side there would be a \nnumber of absentees, and I assume the same would be true on the other \nside, because people can make commitments.\n  There was an August recess. So I was faced with the reality of what \nwe can do and what we cannot do and knowing we cannot finish this this \nweek. I have talked to the Democratic leader about it. We had a good \nvisit. We were not going back and forth blaming each other. I think the \nconclusion was, the signals were, there was no way we could do it. \nThere were too many amendments, too many people had not been heard.\n  But I would say on this side, today Governor Thompson, who is \nchairman of the National Governors Association, was kind enough to come \nto Washington from Wisconsin, and we met with about, I would say, 18, \n20, 22 Republican Senators. And we heard from a Governor who has cut \nhis welfare caseload 27 percent and a Governor who is saving $17 \nmillion a month. Half of that is Federal money and half of that is \nState. And somebody who knows about child care, health care, \ntransportation, and other things he says are so important to welfare \nreform.\n  He tried to make the point--and did make the point very effectively \nwith a number of my colleagues on different sides of the spectrum \nhere--that Governors get elected by the same people we do. Do you not \ntrust your Governors? Then he went on to say what he had done in \nWisconsin.\n  So, I think we are a little closer together, I would say, on the \nRepublican side, than we were 6 or 7 hours ago. So, today and tomorrow \nand Friday we will be going back to Republicans who had different views \non the so-called leadership bill, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, and \nperhaps the leaders would reserve the right to modify their bills \nbefore we go out on Friday. I think at that point we would be, \nhopefully, very, very close to having every Republican on board. I \nthink maybe Senator Daschle can say the same.\n  These negotiations are going on now. They are going to continue. So I \nhave to make a judgment whether I want the negotiations to go on and \nmake some headway and then bring all that to the floor on Friday, or \nshould we go ahead today and finish three very important appropriations \nbills: Transportation, Interior, Defense appropriations and the Defense \nauthorization bill. That is a lot to do in 3 days. It may spill into \nSaturday. But I have learned from the past that when you have a \ndeadline, things do go more quickly. Suddenly speeches that could have \nbeen made for hours are 10 minutes, and they are better. People \nactually listen to 10-minute speeches. So we hope that is the case.\n  It is my intent to go to the Interior bill, if it is satisfactory \nwith the Democratic leader, and try to finish that, hopefully, tonight. \nWe have had consultations with managers on each side. There are some \ncontentious amendments, but I do hope we can have cooperation of all \nMembers on each side as far as amendments--give us time agreements, \ngive the managers time \n\n[[Page S 11839]]\nagreements. And I think the question is--I think I already know the \nanswer because I have talked to the Democratic leader--I think we have \nagreed to cooperate on this, to work on both sides of the aisle, try to \nget Members to cooperate with us. When we finish these bills, the \nrecess starts. So it is automatic. It is automatic.\n  It is up to every Member when he or she stands up to address an \nissue--and certainly some of these should not be addressed in a--Do not \nmisunderstand this. They are very serious. But I think we can make the \ncase in fairly rapid order.\n  So I ask the Democratic leader if he concurs in this statement, and, \nif so, it would then be the intention of the leader to move to the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do concur. I also want to commend the \nmajority leader for making the decision he has.\n  I think there are three reasons why this makes sense. First, as the \ndistinguished majority leader said, negotiations are continuing. I hope \nto lay the Work First amendment down prior to the time we go to the \nInterior bill for the opportunity it presents all Members to compare \nand to pick apart and critically review both the bill offered by the \nRepublican leadership and the bill offered by the Democratic \nleadership. So the next 3 days could be very helpful in bringing to \nrefinement what we hope are legislative proposals that will unite not \nonly our caucuses but, hopefully, the Senate, ultimately.\n  Second, I think it is also helpful, as the distinguished majority \nleader said, to involve the Governors in a way that they have not yet \nhad the opportunity to be involved. I think the next 3 weeks could be \nthe most meaningful in terms of asking people outside of Washington \nwhat they think. They are the ones ultimately, when this legislation \npasses, who are going to be confronted with the responsibility for not \nonly implementing but administering what it is we are doing here. So, \nhaving their input, having their review, having their ideas will even \nbetter prepare us to come back and conclude the work on this very \nimportant piece of legislation in September.\n  Third, as the distinguished leader said, we have a lot of work to do \non appropriations. I recognize the very difficult decisions that have \nto be made on a number of these bills. I may, personally, vote against \na couple of these bills, but that ought not preclude us from \nconsidering them in a timeframe that will allow us to accommodate this \nschedule in a way that will meet the schedule laid out by the majority \nleader.\n  I hope as many problems and as many difficulties as we may have with \nthis legislation--that is, these appropriations bills --that we agree \nto short time limits, that we do the best we can to resolve what \ndifferences there are, be as willing to confront these bills with time \nlimits to amendments and ultimately, perhaps, even a time agreement in \nconsideration of the legislation itself.\n  I believe we can accommodate not only the welfare reform schedule in \nthat manner but also the rigorous schedule we will have with regard to \nappropriations bills when we return in September.\n  So, for those three reasons I think this makes a good deal of sense, \nand I hope we could get unanimity here in the Senate with regard to \nthis schedule and the appropriateness with which we will take up each \nof these bills and, hopefully, welfare reform when we come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to underscore a point made by the \nDemocratic leader because I had forgotten Governor Thompson indicated \nthey would like a little time, too, the Governors.\n  We sort of unveiled our bill in Burlington, VT, I guess, a week ago \nMonday. The President talked about welfare that same day. The Governors \nbroke up the next day, and they have had one meeting. They are about to \nsend us a letter in general terms saying they support a lot of things \nin different proposals.\n  The Governor made the point this would give them some time in the \nnext 3 weeks to try to bring Governors together--Governors, I am \ntalking about Democrats, Republicans--to see if there is some common \nground. There may not be. So I want to underscore the point made by the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Second, to indicate that when we come back, with the appropriations \nbills out of the way, there has been a lot of talk about a train wreck \nin this town on October 1. When we finish the appropriations bills, we \nwill have finished everything that has been reported out by the \nAppropriations Committee. There is nothing else left to take up.\n  So when we come back on September 5, we will be back on the welfare \nbill, which will give the appropriators time to report out the other \nbills. We want all these bills, if we can possibly do it, down to the \nPresident before October 1. You have to go to conference; you have to \ndo a lot of things. We may have to negotiate with the White House and \nothers. So I think that is very important. We want to try to avoid \nthat. We want the President to understand that the Congress has done \nits work on time, and completing these three appropriations bills will \nbe a big step in that direction.\n  Finally to indicate--not just to indicate, just a fact-- we will \nbring up welfare again on the 5th of September, unless something \nunforeseen happens. That would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday \nof that week, maybe even slip into the next week, into Monday. If we \ncannot finish it in a reasonable time, then I think the Democratic \nleader understands and others understand, we will probably have to put \nit in reconciliation. But first we want to give everybody an \nopportunity.\n  I would rather pass a freestanding welfare reform bill where \neverybody has a right to offer amendments, we have votes on the \namendments--and I think there are going to be dozens of amendments, \nlegitimate amendments. But I would make that statement.\n And that date is September 27, sort of the drop-dead day for that \nprocess. So we do not have a lot of time. I think this makes the best \nuse of our time, and it also permits our colleagues to start the recess \neither Friday or Saturday of this week.\n\n  I thank my colleague, the Democratic leader.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2282 to Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with that understanding, I would like to \nlay down the Democratic substitute at this time and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2282 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would also ask unanimous consent that \nTimothy Prinz, a congressional fellow in my office, be granted \nprivileges of the floor during the debate on welfare reform and the \nappropriations bills to which it would refer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have had a number of opportunities to \ndiscuss this legislation. I did again last night. I probably will \nthroughout the remainder of the week. In the interest of time and \ncertainly appreciation of the long wait that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri has had already, I will make no further statements \nregarding the amendment and save that for a later date.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we will probably be making comments on the \nbill, too, on this side of the aisle. A lot of comments have been about \nour bill, so I assume we will probably make a few comments about this \nbill before the recess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just ask the majority leader for a \nclarification on the opportunity both leaders will have to modify our \nlegislation prior to the end of the week. I think there is an \nunderstanding we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is an understanding we have. \n\n[[Page S 11840]]\n\n  Because I assume the Senator is meeting with his colleagues; we are \nmeeting with our colleagues. We are working out problems, and we would \nlike, where we can, to accommodate different views to those changes. It \nmight save a lot of amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right.\n  Mr. DOLE. So I ask unanimous consent now that we turn to the \nconsideration of H.R. 1977, the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. First, before we do that, I understand the Senator from \nMissouri would like about 8 minutes and the Senator from Washington \nabout 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Leader, I need about 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. And the Senator from Massachusetts, 4 minutes. So that \ngives the appropriators 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I hate to----\n  Mr. DOLE. Excuse me.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I hate to delay this, but I have some things I wish \nto say in answer to the Senator from Massachusetts, and it would seem \nto me important to kind of set the record straight on some of the job \ntraining aspects of this. If I could have just 5 minutes, that would be \nfine.\n  Mr. DOLE. So the appropriators have 25 minutes to arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nH.R. 1977, at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senators.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I am most grateful to the \nleaders. I will accept the admonition to make it brief and do it within \n8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I know there is an old saying that a good sermon in a \nhouse of worship wins no souls after 20 minutes. I think we have \nprobably gotten to the point in the debate over welfare where even the \nmost compelling statement on welfare does not win too many votes after \nabout 10 minutes, and I will accept the challenge to summarize some of \nthe things that I think are very important.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a short \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Missouri has mentioned the need for 10 \nminutes, and I think that was the understanding. I think under the \nunanimous-consent agreement, it was just 8 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Washington \nhave 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am most grateful to my friend from South \nDakota, the minority leader. I will try not to use the full 10 minutes.\n  I wish to say based on what we have heard here today that there may \nbe differences among us. We do have some questions about the Democratic \nleadership amendment that has been introduced, but I gain a great deal \nof encouragement from hearing the comments of my friend from \nConnecticut, who was talking about work and the emphasis we must place \non work.\n  I personally am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the welfare \nbill the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee have \nintroduced. I think that after 30 years of ever more expensive and less \neffective approaches to poverty, we are on the threshold of developing \na plan that will reform welfare in a meaningful way.\n  We have heard from a lot of our colleagues who spent the last 2 days \ndescribing the problems of the current system. I agree with that. There \nare problems. We all recognize the current system is a disaster and it \ndoes not well serve those down and out in society who need a hand up, \nand it does not serve the taxpayers of the country who fund it. If any \nof us have questions about that, I think we can just go home and ask \nthe folks in our home State. We are going to hear that clearly.\n  I would like to describe in brief some of the reasons I think the \nDole-Packwood approach will work in that it strikes a fair balance \nbetween the role of the Federal Government in providing a safety net \nand giving States increased responsibility. I think it is a sound \napproach in fixing the system and clearly the best alternative to those \nwho would completely dismantle public assistance and those who would \nsimply tinker around the edges.\n  We have heard some very eloquent statements in the last hour about \nhow important all the individual programs are and how great they are \nand what wonderful things they have done and how much better they would \nbe if we spent more money.\n  I do not think that is the real world. I hope we can come together on \na bipartisan basis to say more and more individual Federal programs \nwith more and more money is not getting us out of the hole.\n  I have been working on welfare reform 8 years as Governor and longer \nthan that in this Congress in past legislative sessions. I have been \nvery pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, over the last 2 years, and I am delighted that some of \nthe ideas we have worked on are included in the bill before us. The \ncenterpiece of the bill that we included on a bipartisan basis was a \npersonal responsibility contract.\n  This is a fundamental change in the way we would approach public \nassistance. Since the creation of aid to families with dependent \nchildren, public aid has been regarded as an entitlement. If you meet \nthe requirements, if you have the problems and if you have the lack of \nmoney for eligibility and you have the children, you get the cash with \nno strings attached. That just does not work.\n  The current system has rightly been condemned by persons from all \nwalks of life: researchers, advocates, pastors, politicians, even the \nrecipients themselves. The system is impersonal. It is inefficient, and \nit encourages continued dependency. Recipients continue to get cash \nmonth after month after month without thinking about their future and \nwithout giving any help or any encouragement or any prod to become \nself-sufficient.\n  Treating public assistance as a contractual relationship such as is \nbeing done in Iowa, Missouri, Utah, and elsewhere where both parties \nhave responsibility for changes, both parties need to do something, \nrecipients themselves have to work or perform for their benefits, is \nthe way out of the trap.\n  I believe a large reason for the stagnation in the welfare programs \ntoday is that we have not required anything in return for benefits. It \nis a one-way street. The lack of reciprocity has bred an ethic of \ndependence rather than a work ethic. The only way we can turn this \naround is to require something in return for what the taxpayers are \npaying out.\n  Most Americans believe our Government has a responsibility to help \nfamilies in need, and certainly we are going to pursue that. But we \nalso know that individuals have a responsibility to help themselves if \nthey can. I believe that this approach will do a better job of helping \npeople to create a better life for themselves and their families. I am \nconcerned that if we do not require recipients of public assistance to \nwork or behave responsibly, then our efforts at reform will fail.\n  The principle should be, public assistance is a two-way street. You \nwant benefits? You have got to work and behave responsibly in return. \nThe Dole-Packwood bill has a real work requirement. We have, I think, \nin this measure, since we last took on welfare reform in 1988, learned \nthat the States are moving well ahead of the Federal Government. That \nis why we are going to look to the States to lead the way in finding \nnew ways and better ways to get out of welfare dependency.\n  We have tinkered with the problem. We have tinkered with eligibility. \nBut we have not come close to solving the problem of poverty. I am \npleased that we take steps to move responsibility back to the States. I \nthink we are doing an excellent job in reforming the supplemental \nsecurity income program, which has grown out of control and has brought \nreal outrage. I think that we need to change the system with respect to \nnoncitizens. These elements are all in the bill.\n  The Dole-Packwood plan has a real work requirement, unlike the \nexisting system. There would be no automatic exemption from work \nrequirements. Currently, over half the caseload on average in every \nState is exempt from participation in work and job training \n\n[[Page S 11841]]\nprograms. No wonder the American people think the system is a sham.\n  Since we last took on the welfare reform issue in 1988, we learned \nthat our Nation's Governors are far ahead of Washington in generating \nreform ideas and in implementing them. Currently States must undertake \na lengthy and cumbersome waiver process in order to obtain permission \nto implement commonsense reforms. States that want to require welfare \nrecipients to obtain preventive health care for their children, or to \nensure that their children stay in school, or wish to allow recipients \nto keep more of their earnings from a parttime job--good ideas all--\nmust now obtain a waiver from HHS. This is costly, time consuming, and \nsilly. Dole-Packwood permits States to try a variety of ideas to move \npeople into meaningful work and off public assistance, without \npermission from the Feds.\n  Senator Harkin and I had also proposed that recipients be permitted \nto keep more income earned on the job, that teens be allowed to work \nwithout counting against family income, and that States be permitted to \nsubsidize private sector jobs for welfare recipients on a trial basis. \nWe also proposed that benefits be denied to those who fail to behave \nrsponsibly--those who fail to have their children immunized or to \nattend school. Under the system set up by the Dole-Packwood plan, \nStates would be able to try any combination of these ideas, and many \nmore we have not even thought of yet, without permission from \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, in past attempts to reform welfare we have erred on \nthe side of caution. We have tinkered with the programs and generally \nexpanded eligibility. We have not come close to solving the problem of \npoverty; in fact, there are more children living in poverty now than 30 \nyears ago. So we do not want to be overly cautious in our approach to \nthis issue. But neither do we want to throw the problems back to the \nStates. Some of my colleagues propose a mega-block grant which would \nencompass virtually all means-tested assistance. I would argue that \njust because we no longer have to deal with the issue on the Federal \nlevel does not mean that there is no longer a problem. While their plan \nhas the appeal of simplicity, I do not believe it is workable.\n  I have tried to work with those in my State who have the \nresponsibility of running these programs to determine what reform \nefforts make sense. I have come to the conclusion that we should not \ninclude certain programs in this bill, particularly child welfare and \nfoster care programs, and public housing reform. Children who are \nabused and neglected and who become wards of the State are our \nsociety's most vulnerable, and their needs should be addressed \nseparately. And I am pleased that the majority leader and the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee have left these programs out of this bill.\n  Another highlight of this plan, in my view, is its reform of the \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] Program, which provides benefits to \nlow-income disabled individuals. SSI is one of the fastest growing \nwelfare programs in the Federal budget, costing $22 billion per year, \nand without the reforms in this bill, projected to grow 50 percent by \nthe year 2000. SSI provides perhaps the best example of what happens \nwhen the Federal Government provides cash and asks for nothing in \nreturn. Over the last 2 years, we have investigated abuses in the \nprogram. We have discovered that many drug addicts and alcoholics are \nusing the cash payments to subsidize their addictions, that children \nare being coached by their parents to fake a disability, and that new \nimmigrants are being coached to fake disabilities to qualify for \nbenefits.\n  Dole-Packwood would reform the SSI Program without denying benefits \nto those who truly need them. The bill would no longer treat drug \naddiction and alcoholism as disabilities or purposes of qualifying for \nSSI. Noncitizens would only be eligible after working and paying taxes \nfor 5 years. And only children who were diagnosed with a real \ndisability, rather than being said to behave inappropriately for their \nage level, would qualify for benefits.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is not perfect. No legislative \ndocument ever is. Over the course of this week I hope we will make \nimprovements in the area of child care and job training. Certainly \nthere are a number of loose threads. But I am throwing my support \nbehind this plan because I believe it is fundamentally sound from a \nphilosophical and practical standpoint. It recognizes that the Federal \nGovernment cannot possibly provide the innovation and compassion \nnecessary to solve the problem of poverty. It permits States, private \norganizations, and individuals to assume more responsibility in caring \nfor our neighbors. And it recognizes that persons in need of assistance \nin our society will not become self-sufficient unless they are required \nto give of themselves in return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate has jumped into the welfare \nreform debate with both feet. I want to pose a question to the body \nnow, as we enter the process: What is this debate about?\n  I will make it very simple: it is about families. It think all my \ncolleagues will agree that in this country, there can be no substitute \nfor healthy families; they are the bedrock of our society.\n  I hear so much from my constituents about their fears for the \nAmerican family. In the modern world, the family faces more challenges \nthan ever before, from economic opportunity, to education, to child \ncare. We live in a world where more and more both parents must work to \nmake ends meet. We have also seen an increase in single-parent homes \nwhere the challenge to balance work and family can be overwhelming. In \nmy own family, my brothers, sisters, and cousins all share these fears.\n  With this in mind, there is one question I urge my colleagues to keep \nin mind throughout this debate: what can the Government do--or not do--\nto build, and rebuild, families in this country?\n  What can the Government do to ensure economic opportunity? What can \nthe Government do to create a healthy environment for children? What \ncan the Government do to open doors and prevent dependency?\n  What can the Government do--or not do--to foster a sense of security, \nhope, and confidence for families?\n  During this debate, we will hear a lot about failure. In fact, we \nalready have. We have heard about bad actors who abuse the system. We \nhave heard about systemic failure, about substance abuse, crime, \nspousal abuse, child abuse, and everything that plagues a family stuck \nin poverty.\n  We have heard about addicts awaiting the day their checks come in the \nmail. We have heard about mothers who stay on welfare, rather than \naccepting work. And we are going to keep hearing these things used to \njustify radical overhaul of the current welfare system.\n  We may hear about these failures, and we may all agree the current \nsystem needs improvement. But let's not lose sight of what this debate \nis about: families and children. America's children.\n  Mr. President, I bring a unique perspective to this debate on the \nSenate floor. I am a mother with school-age children. I have been a \npreschool teacher, dealing with kids from all economic classes. I have \ntaught parent education classes, counseling young parents to help them \ndevelop their skills as mothers and fathers in the modern world.\n  I can personally tell you what it is like to take a desperate phone \ncall from a young single mom at the end of her rope. She is burning the \ncandle at both ends, trying to work, worrying all day long about her \nkids. For school age kids, they face a tough environment at school; for \ntoddlers, access to quality day care is a constant problem.\n  When this mom gets home, the kids need attention, but she is out of \nenergy. They need love, they need nourishment, and\n she has to summon everything she has got to meet their needs. Take my \nword for it: in today's world this is hard for any parent.\n\n  To succeed in reforming welfare, we cannot talk in vagaries about \naccountability and responsibility, though these concepts are important. \nWe have to understand the everyday challenges of everyday parents.\n  Only by knowing and understanding these challenges can we begin to \ndesign \n\n[[Page S 11842]]\na welfare reform proposal that truly gives struggling families a boost \nto economic stability.\n  Mr. President, shortly after I was elected to the Senate, I decided I \nneeded a better perspective on the challenges faced by young kids in \nour cities. I asked friends from Washington State social service \nagencies, from the juvenile justice system, from the public school \nsystem, and kids themselves to come together in a series of forums \nacross my State.\n  In all three cases, I heard the same message over and over again. \nKids today feel like adults do not care about them, or their problems. \nThey come home to an empty house because one parent is absentee, or \nboth parents have to work to cover expenses. Or they have dysfunctional \nparents.\n  They wake up each morning scared, and all they can think about is \nsurvival. They do not see anything getting better for themselves, and \nto them, it adds up to a world in which adults just do not care.\n  More recently, Mr. President, I have tried to learn more about the \nperspective of typical welfare recipients. I participated in a unique \nprogram called Walk-a-Mile which started in Washington State and pairs \na welfare recipient with an elected official, and the two speak \nfrequently on the telephone about each others' experiences. I was lucky \nenough to be paired with June, a single mother of two from a Seattle \nsuburb who survived an abusive relationship.\n  During her time on welfare, June attended school and earned a degree \nfrom Evergreen State College. Her classroom time was frequently \ninterrupted, however, because her 6-year-old son Jonathan suffers from \nattention deficit order, a side effect of the abuse suffered in their \nprevious home.\n  June has been told by six different day care providers that her son \ncould not be cared for, because of his explosive and erratic behavior. \nDuring this time June has lived in fear she would lose her credits at \nschool, or have to drop out, because Jonathan could not stay in day \ncare, or in school.\n  Since earning her degree, June has divided her time between looking \nfor work and looking for childcare. Her dilemma is a familiar one: in \nthe absence of child care, she cannot work; yet she is qualified to \nwilling to work today.\n  Mr. President, I know what scared single parents, and I know what \nscares the kids. I have seen it firsthand, and I have studied it \nclosely over the past 2 years.\n  These are the fears of moms and their children. This is why moms get \ntrapped in dependency, and why their kids look for their solutions on \nthe streets. And unless we do something to remove these fears, we will \nnot accomplish reform.\n  I am concerned about what the Dole plan means for the State of \nWashington that has quality programs based on current Federal \nresources. I am concerned about parents and families--like June--who \nare currently participating in programs that will move them off welfare \nand into the work force.\n  The Dole plan limits funding to States, and stipulates 2 years of \nbenefits and then you are cut off. This amounts to nothing more than \npassing one of our biggest headaches off to the States for them to deal \nwith. As a former state legislator, I can tell you that is something my \nState does not relish.\n  The Senate has already passed a budget proposing to cut Medicare and \nMedicaid over the next 7 years. Under the dole welfare plan, the same \nworking families will lose another $500 million over the next 7 years.\n  Over 60 percent of my State's budget is public education: There is no \nway it can maintain any kind of excellence in public education if \nCongress forces new responsibilities and under-funded block-grants down \nto the State level.\n  What does this mean in personal terms for June, my Walk-a-Mile \npartner? Under the Dole plan, there is no certainty she and her son \nJonathan will have access to quality child care. In fact, there is a \nstrong possibility they would not, because overall funding is being \nreduced.\n  This plan will not do anything to improve June's situation, and it \nwill certainly add to the message we send to our kids that we do not \ncare about them.\n  The Daschle bill offers credible reform. It proposes to move welfare \nrecipients into the work force swiftly and decisively. It provides \nguidance on how to equip recipients to make this move. And, most \nimportantly, it ensures quality childcare will be available during the \ntransition.\n  For people like June, this means they will have the stability and \npeace of mind to invest themselves in education or training programs \nthat will equip them to move into the work force, without worrying \nabout whether their kids will be looked after during the day.\n  Mr. President, as a preschool teacher, and parent education \ncounselor, I can tell you based on firsthand experience, give the \nchoice between work and kids, the parent, with limited options, will \nstay at home.\n  I can also tell you that unless we neutralize the fears and \nchallenges of poor families, single parents, and their kids, we will \nnot succeed in reforming welfare. We will simply infuse the underclass \nwith a big new group of have-nots.\n  I will conclude my statement where I began this statement. Welfare \nreform should be--must be--about rebuilding families in America. In \nAmerica, we have always taken care of our own.\n  We built the farm program to preserve the family farms. We establish \nSocial Security to make sure Americans live well in retirement. We \npassed a GI bill to give our men and women in uniform ready access to \neducation.\n  Welfare reform should be no different. The central goal of welfare \nreform should be to make sure American families at all economic levels \nhave equal access to economic opportunity in the modern world.\n  We cannot legislate morality. Nor can we legislate family values. But \nwe must promote family values. These are intangibles that are up to \nevery family to address in their own homes. All we can do is provide \nopportunity and a stable environment to let it happen.\n  If we can move people into the work force and create self-\nsufficiency, we will have succeeded. To do this, we must remove \nparents' fears about access to child care, and we must remove kids' \nfears about the future, and we must make skills training and education \navailable; and we must be very firm about our end goals. If we do these \nthings, we will create a stable environment in which families can \nsuccess in their own right, on their own merits.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to commend the majority leader for \nhis decision to postpone further action on the welfare reform bill.\n  Clearly, the pending Republican bill needs more work. Governors, \nmayors, business leaders, workers should all take a close look at what \nis being proposed. As this debate has proceeded, it has become clear \nthat the bill is deeply flawed in two major respects: Its failure to \ninclude adequate provisions on child care, and its grossly defective \ntreatment of job training.\n  No welfare reform bill that fails to deal effectively with child care \nand job training deserves to pass. Without adequate job training, the \ngoal of welfare reform is a charade, since those on welfare will not be \nable to work even if they are willing to work. To raid existing job \ntraining and job education programs in order to solve this problem, as \nthe bill proposes to do, is an unacceptable assault on dislocated \nworkers and all families in all parts of the country struggling to hold \non to their current jobs or to improve their skills to find new jobs.\n  Without adequate child care, this bill is a sham. It makes no sense \nto force mothers on welfare to work and then deny child care for their \nchildren left at home. The last thing the Senate should do in the name \nof welfare reform is pass a ``Home Alone'' bill that jeopardizes \nmillions of children and their chance for a brighter future.\n  Finally, it is clear that the Republican bill is also under assault \nfrom many Republican Senators who think this bill should be even more \npunitive on people on welfare.\n  It is no surprise, therefore, that this defective legislation is \nbeing recalled for further repairs. As President Clinton and Democrats \nhave made clear, we are ready to support responsible and \n\n[[Page S 11843]]\nfar-reaching welfare reform. But it must be more than bumper-sticker \nslogans. It must be genuine reform that makes welfare a hand up, not a \nhandout. This bill flunked that basic test, and it deserves the failing \ngrade it has now received.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, let me say before I start that the \nmajority leader has yielded me his leadership time if I should need \nmore time than the 5 minutes I believe was in the agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to answer several accusations that have \nbeen made about the welfare reform bill. First of all, the bill is \nneither marginal nor is it a sham. The bill that has been put forward \nby the majority leader is an important step forward and makes good \nprogress in dealing with a most difficult problem.\n  There may be some major philosophical differences, and that we would \nall recognize. But the bill addresses three areas that I think are \nimportant to any significant and major welfare reform legislation. One, \nit ends the entitlement for welfare; two, it makes substantial reforms \nin the Food Stamp Program; and three, it provides major and \nconstructive reform of our job training programs.\n  It is job training, Mr. President, that I would like to address \nspecifically. If we are ultimately going to be successful in reforming \nwelfare, we must be realistic about what it takes to do so. We have to \nseparate rhetoric from the reality of what is out there, and we must \ndetermine how we can be supportive while making changes that are \nabsolutely necessary.\n  Effective welfare reform is not simply a matter of increasing \nflexibility or changing incentives, but also of recognizing that \nobtaining and holding a job does not occur in a vacuum. That is why \nquality child care is important and why job training--realistic job \ntraining--is important.\n  This morning, my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, who is \nthe ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, said in \na press conference: ``This is a cynical scheme to pit welfare \nbeneficiaries against laid-off factory workers, unemployed defense \nworkers and millions of other Americans.''\n  Mr. President, that is just not true, and there has been a \nmisunderstanding about what the job training portion of this program \ndoes. Because it was approved by the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, I would like to spend a little bit of time going through \nthat title of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome the Senator's clarification. I just mention, \nin the Senator's bill, as the Senator knows, in listing the various \nprovisions of permissible activities, on page 67, those effectively are \nidentical to what is in the Dole bill, with the exception of one word. \nThe Senator may be familiar with this, and that is on page 337, under \nparagraph O and line 20, which adds the word ``workfare.''\n  So essentially all of the provisions of the Senator's bill were in \nthere. We had other kinds of differences about the construct, but not \nin this area.\n  Then there was the addition of the word ``workfare.'' Just the \nworkfare under permissible activities, at least the way the bill was \ndesigned or appeared to this Senator, would open up the utilization of \nthose funds for the welfare training programs. That is a reason for the \nobservation.\n  I welcome the clarification. I had a chance to read the Senator's \nstatement a minute or two before, but I welcome at least what she \nintended. I certainly welcome the chance to work with her and try and \nremedy it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, yes, I will clarify the workfare \naddition to the permissible activities section. But first let me speak \nmore generally about the Workforce Development Act, a measure which \nprovides a substantial and dramatic reform of our current work force \ntraining and work force education systems. The linkage it provides \nbetween our training and education systems is, I think, enormously \nimportant.\n  The Workforce Development Act was a separate bill, S. 143, that has \nbeen incorporated in the legislation that is before us; that is, the \nwelfare reform legislation or, as it is called, the Work Opportunity \nAct.\n  I want to emphasize from the outset that the Workforce Development \nAct is not a welfare program. It is a comprehensive effort to bring \ntogether myriad Federal programs--about 90 in all--serving everyone \nfrom high school vocational students to dislocated workers in America. \nThese programs are brought together in a way that is going to help \neveryone. The new system will be far more beneficial to individuals in \nterms of offering realistic help in finding jobs that suit them and in \nidentifying the market opportunities that actually exist.\n  Several question whether these provisions should be included in a \nmeasure that focuses on welfare reform, and I understand the concern \nthat misconceptions could occur. At the same time, because the relevant \ntraining activities for welfare and food stamp recipients must be \nprovided by the single system created by the Workforce Development Act, \nthis welfare bill provides the opportunity to consider, what I believe \nto be, a very important initiative. I will, therefore, strongly oppose \nany efforts to remove these titles from the bill.\n  Our current patchwork system is ill-equipped to deal effectively with \ntoday's work force needs. The proliferation of training programs has \ninstead resulted in duplication of effort and is the source of \nconfusion for both employers and job seekers.\n  Moreover, there is little evidence available to tell us what we have \nactually achieved in return for the $20-some billion we spend annually \non all of these programs. The purpose of the Workforce Development Act \nof 1995 is to develop a single, unified system of job training and \ntraining-related education activities designed to ensure that:\n  One, there is a logical relationship among formal education, job-\nspecific training, and the jobs available in our economy.\n  Two, individuals who need assistance in obtaining employment are \neasily able to identify the resources available for that purpose.\n  Three, there is a clear accountability for Federal dollars. To \nachieve this goal, Mr. President, the Workforce Development Act repeals \nall or a major portion of nearly a dozen Federal education employment \nand training statutes and some 90 programs that they authorize. The \nfunds would be combined into a single authorization and distributed to \nStates as block grants, but with accountability measures that ensure \nthere indeed will be a means of monitoring what is to be achieved.\n  Maximum flexibility will be provided to the States to design their \nown work force development systems, based on the following principles: \nOne-stop delivery of job training services; support for school-to-work \nactivities for youth; the development of benchmarks by which to measure \nresults.\n  In addition, private sector employers will be involved at all levels \nof the training system, including the Federal, State, and local levels.\n  Finally, the legislation provides for a transition period during \nwhich States may be granted broad waivers from current regulations to \nbegin consolidation.\n  I think this legislation takes bold steps to reform our training and \neducation programs. I think it is a valuable part of any welfare reform \neffort. More importantly, it is important for us as a country to be \nable to address in a far more realistic and effective way, how to help \nStates design the programs that best fit their individual needs.\n  At this point, I would like to speak specifically to the question \nthat was raised in the press conference where Senator Kennedy indicated \nwe were trying to pit welfare beneficiaries against laid-off factory \nworkers and unemployed defense workers. I think it is important to \nclarify the provision which has been the source of a serious \nmisunderstanding.\n  The Workforce Development Act contains a section on activities for \nwhich work force training funds may be used. It is the same list as \nincluded in the committee-passed bill, but with one addition. That \naddition--workfare--is the source of the current confusion. \n\n[[Page S 11844]]\n\n  It has been represented that this term was added to create a \nloophole, whereby all work force training funds could ultimately be \ndiverted to welfare payments. That is simply not the case.\n  I, too, would oppose the diversion of work force training funds to \nwelfare payments. It was for that reason that I strongly opposed \nprovisions included in an earlier draft of the Work Opportunity Act \nwhich would have permitted up to 30 percent of the work force \ndevelopment funds to be used for other activities in the bill. That \ntransferability provision was deleted.\n  So let me be very clear. Under no circumstances, may funds be taken \nout of State job training systems to be used to pay for welfare \nbenefits or food stamps.\n  On the contrary, any training activities conducted under a State's \nwelfare or food stamp program must be carried out through the State job \ntraining system. That preserves the concept that training activities \nwithin a State will be carried out through a single system.\n  The reason ``workfare'' was added to the list of permissible \nactivities was to link a very specific existing food stamp employment \nand training program into the statewide job training system.\n  Six States currently carry out workfare programs as a component under \ntheir food stamp employment and training program. The purpose of \nworkfare is to improve the employability of individuals not working by \nproviding work experience to assist them to move into regular public or \nprivate employment. In essence, it is another form of on-the-job \ntraining.\n  The sole reason that this activity was added to the bill was to \nensure that those States that currently conduct the food stamp workfare \nprogram can continue to do so through the statewide workforce \ndevelopment system established under title VII.\n  In general, the overall food stamp employment and training program \nhas not been a very effective job training program, Mr. President. \nNevertheless, it remains a part of the food stamp initiative--an \ninitiative which I believe is important.\n  I am prepared to add clarifying language to assure that the intent of \nthis language is completely clear. I hope, Mr. President, that my \nexplanation clears up any misunderstandings about this issue.\n  Before I yield the floor, I just want to say that I regret at this \nlate hour to take such a long time on an issue to which we will return \nin September. But I am convinced, Mr. President, that there is an \nopportunity for both sides of the aisle to come together in a \nsignificant way to address welfare reform.\n  I think it is an important issue. I, in no way, believe that the \nlegislation that has been put forward by the Republican leader, Senator \nDole, is one that minimizes or ruins our support system for those in \nneed. I think, as a matter of fact, it strengthens it; it shows that \nthere is an ability to work through some issues that are of concern on \nboth sides of the aisle. At the end of the day, we are going to have a \nstronger, more effective, and more constructive program.\n  I think that is an opportunity and we should seize it. I think we \nwill when we come back in early September and address the issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for a question?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I do not know how much time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I want all of our colleagues to know--and \nI believe they know already--the respect that all of us on our \ncommittee, Human Resource Committee have for the work Senator Kassebaum \nhas done in working through the job training and consolidation. We have \ncertain areas that remain that we hope to be able to work through. I \nappreciate very much the clarification of the workfare provision \nbecause, as the Senator knows, nowhere in the legislation is workfare \ndesigned.\n  So her explanation certainly gives us the legislative history about \nwhat the reason was for including it, because nowhere in the \nlegislation is it defined. Generally, Governors have defined workfare \nwhatever way they desired to do it, as an augmenting and supplementing \nway of providing assistance or jobs to welfare recipients. It has not \nbeen defined. And being included where it was could, at least under \npermissible activities, open up a range of different possibilities.\n  Clearly, the Senator did not support it. I want to say that I look \nforward to working with the Senator not just on this issue, but on the \nother issues, to try and see if we cannot find common ground. We had \nsome areas of difference. The Senator has been a strong supporter of \nthe child care feature and programs, and also in the consolidation of \ntraining programs. So it is certainly our desire to try and find ways, \nand maybe this period of time will permit us the opportunity to do so.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I certainly would welcome the support \nof the Senator from Massachusetts for this legislation. I look forward \nto seeing if we cannot work these things out in September.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 minutes \nto speak on welfare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Dole has pulled down the welfare \nbill and, therefore, the amendments that I and others had prepared will \nnot be offered today, tomorrow, or at any time during the remainder of \nthe week. So I thought it was very important to outline what I see the \nissues to be and to make the point that some progress has been made, \neven though the bill was only on the floor for 2 days, with no formal \namendments, other than a change that the leader himself sent to the \ndesk and was approved.\n  When we started this debate, there was a lot of common ground between \nSenator Dole's position and the position that I and other conservative \nRepublicans have taken. But there were also some fundamental \ndifferences:\n  First, I felt very strongly that we needed a binding work requirement \nwhich said, in no uncertain terms, that able-bodied men and women \nriding in the welfare wagon were going to be required to get out of the \nwagon and help the rest of us pull. I had concerns about the original \nDole-Packwood bill that came out of committee because it did not \ncontain a binding work requirement and because there was no enforcement \nmechanism to guarantee that people who refused to work would actually \nbe dropped from the welfare rolls.\n  I am very proud of the fact that yesterday Senator Dole decided, in \nwhat I viewed as a gesture toward consensus, to send a modification of \nhis amendment to the desk to add the pay-for-performance provision that \nwas part of both the House bill and the bill that I had proposed with \n24 other Republican Senators. This modification simply says that \nwelfare should operate like any other process in America:\n if you do not show up for work, you will not get paid. This work \nrequirement was added, I think it was a change in the right direction, \nand I think that as a result we are closer to a consensus today than we \nwere 2 days ago.\n\n  I want to see this bill changed to deal with illegitimacy. Under the \ncurrent program, the illegitimacy rate has risen from 5 percent in 1960 \nto almost 30 percent in 1990. Last year, roughly half of all the \nchildren born in the big cities in America and almost a third of all \nchildren born in the entire country were born out of wedlock.\n  It is clear to me that a program which continues to give people more \nand more money to have more and more children while on welfare has got \nto be changed. I have agreed today, in talking to the majority leader, \nto sit down with him, to have our staffs sit down together, and to see \nif we can find an agreement to deal with illegitimacy. I think it is \nclearly necessary not just to pass a bill, but to change the welfare \nsystem in America.\n  I feel very strongly that we should not continue to have immigrants \ncoming to America, looking for a hand out rather than with their \nsleeves rolled up ready to go to work. I do not believe people ought to \nbe able to come to America just to get welfare. We have room in America \nfor people who want to come and work, for people who want to come here \nto realize their own American dream. \n\n[[Page S 11845]]\n\n  We have children of immigrants in the U.S. Senate. Most of us are \ngrandchildren or great-grandchildren of immigrants. We want people to \ncome to America to build their dream, to build our dream, but we ought \nto end this practice of letting people come to America and immediately \ngo on welfare.\n  Senator Dole has agreed today--in fact, our staffs at this moment are \nmeeting--to try to see if we can find language in this area that we can \nagree on, both to settle this issue and to make a fundamental change in \nthis bill. I think if we can do that, then we are making progress \ntoward a consensus.\n  I want a smaller Federal bureaucracy. If we are going to give AFDC to \nthe States, if we are going to let States run this building block of \nthe welfare system, it seems to me we should not be keeping 70 percent \nof the program's Government employees at the Federal level with nothing \nto run. What are these people going to do other than to get in the way \nof States that are trying to reform the system?\n  In working with Senator Ashcroft, I have proposed that we give those \nFederal programs which are going to be block granted to the States no \nmore than 10 percent of the Government positions they have now, so that \nthey can monitor what the States are doing. Although I would rather \nhave audits by independent firms, I cannot see any logic in giving \nAFDC, a program which we are eliminating at the Federal level, the \nability to keep 70 percent of their Government employees in place. Is a \nGovernment job the only immortal thing in the temporal world? I would \nanswer no, but Congress continually says yes.\n  Finally, I would like to expand the number of programs that we are \ngiving to the States. We will try to block grant food stamps and I \nbelieve that there will be a cross section of Senators voting together \nin favor of this proposal.\n  The point is that although some progress has been made, we need to \ncontinue to work. In the past, we have reformed welfare many times, but \nwe have never truly changed it. I want this bill to be different.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11827-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11845-S11888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Such deposited \n     revenues shall be available for preparation of additional \n     timber sales and completion of additional recreation projects \n     in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection \n     (b).\n       (d) The Secretary concerned shall terminate all payments \n     into the Agriculture Fund or the Interior Fund, and pay any \n     unobligated funds in the affected Fund into the United States \n     Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, whenever the Secretary \n     concerned makes a finding, published in the Federal Register, \n     that sales sufficient to achieve the total allowable sales \n     quantity of the national forest system for the Forest Service \n     or the allowable sales level for the Oregon and California \n     grant lands for the Bureau of Land Management, respectively, \n     have been prepared.\n       (e) Any timber sales prepared and recreation projects \n     completed under this section shall comply with all applicable \n     environmental and natural resource laws and regulations.\n       (f) The Secretary concerned shall report annually to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the U.S. Senate and the House \n     of Representatives on expenditures made from the Fund for \n     timber sales and recreation projects, revenues received into \n     the Fund from timber sales, and timber sale preparation and \n     recreation project work undertaken during the previous year \n     and projected for the next year under the Fund. Such \n     information shall be provided for each Forest Service region \n     and Bureau of Land Management State office.\n       (g) The authority of this section shall terminate upon the \n     termination of both Funds in accordance with the provisions \n     of subsection (d).\n       Sec. 328. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds provided in this or any other act shall be \n     available for travel and training expenses for the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs or the Office of Indian Education for \n     education conferences or training activities.\n       Sec. 329.

Nothing in this \n     subsection shall prohibit payments made in exchange for goods \n     and services.\n       (c) No grant shall be used for seasonal support to a group, \n     unless the application is specific to the contents of the \n     season, including identified programs and/or projects.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I lay before the Senate this afternoon the \nfiscal year 1996 Department of the Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill.\n  This bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, totals \n$12,122,927,000 in discretionary budget authority, $73,000 below the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation. The outlay scoring totals \n$13,167,502,000, $6,498,000 below allocation. The bill is \n$1,777,000,000 less than the President's budget request for budget \nauthority and $991 million below the President's budget request for \noutlays.\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate represents intensely \ndifficult choices and real cuts in spending of $1.5 billion below the \nfiscal year 1995 level or a reduction of 11 percent.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that last statement. There is $1.5 \nbillion less in this bill than there was in the bill passed by the \nCongress, signed by the President, covering the current 1995 fiscal \nyear. That is 11 percent less money from that 1995 base.\n  As a consequence, in crafting this bill, we have had to engage in the \nprocess of distributing poverty or distributing reductions. For all \npractical purposes, there are no programs of any significant size that \nare increased in this bill and very, very few which we have been able \nto keep even.\n  Members will be frustrated--and I think perhaps rightly frustrated--\nby the fact that some of their important priorities have suffered \nreductions and can only effectively deal with those reductions when \nthey compare them with the overall reductions in the bill as a whole.\n  Now, agencies covered by this bill primarily in the Department of the \nInterior do not share equally in the 11-percent reduction. For \ninstance, the land management agencies are reduced by 4 percent, \ncultural activities by 15 percent, Indian programs by 8 percent, and \nDepartment of Energy programs by 10 percent.\n  Other Members have raised concerns about the sensitivity to the \nbudget resolution recommendations. This proposal reflects the meshing \nof the budget resolution, the bill priorities of the subcommittee which \nwrote this bill, and of members of the full Appropriations Committee \ntogether with concerns of individual Members and the administration's \nown priorities.\n  In fact, as another aside, Mr. President, I can say that the \nallocations out of which this bill were built are slightly higher than \nthose that were considered and passed by this body in the budget \nresolution.\n  If we had followed the budget resolution to the exclusion of all \nother considerations, the total amount spent would have been even \nlower. For instance, members of the administration in the broadest \npossible sense have placed a high priority on the preservation and \nenhancement of the National Park Service. As a consequence, the Park \nService was reduced by only 6 percent overall, with no reduction for \nPark Service operations.\n  In the budget resolution, a moratorium on land acquisition was \nassumed. Member interest, however, necessitated funding to some land \nacquisitions even though they are at drastically reduced levels.\n  Also, an item, which seems to have been lost when considering the \nbudget committee recommendations, is the $379 million reduction for \nunidentified Interior bill overhead. I remind Members that overhead \ncosts exist in all agencies. We faced the question of how that should \nbe dealt with. If applied to some of the smaller agencies, such a \nreduction would have had a devastating and unacceptable effect.\n  As has been the practice in past years, the bill before us today was \nformulated in a bipartisan manner. I wish to thank Senator Byrd and his \nstaff for their assistance and cooperation in drafting the Interior \nbill\n  Again, Mr. President, off of my prepared text here, I should like to \nexpress my deep admiration for Senator Byrd, the ranking member of this \nsubcommittee. I am brand new to this responsibility. He has held more \noffices in this Senate, including majority leader and President pro \ntempore, than has any other individual in its history. He was, last \nyear, in addition to being chairman of the overall Appropriations \nCommittee, chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior and Related \nAgencies. It, obviously, has to be very difficult to give up that \nposition and that authority to someone who is new to these \nresponsibilities entirely, but Senator Byrd has been not only gracious \nand cooperative, but has provided me with a wonderful education in the \npriorities and responsibilities that fall to me as chairman of the \nsubcommittee and as manager of this bill. I want to thank him for that \ngraciousness, and for that education.\n  Now, Mr. President, I should like to report that the subcommittee \nreceived more than 1,400 requests for amendments to the bill, or for \nprojects within the bill. Even that represents a major step forward \nfrom what Senator Byrd faced last year, which, if my memory serves me \ncorrectly, was more than 3,000 such requests. Perhaps that reduction \ndoes reflect the fact that most Members understand that we have this \nmajor cut. But they have made it difficult to honor more than a \nrelatively few of them.\n  Many of those 1,400 requests, which total up to $2.1 billion, \npresumed the enactment of amounts contained in the President's budget \nand then proposed to add something beyond that number. With the budget \nconstraints that we faced, our starting point had to be the fiscal year \n1995 budget, with extensive review and attention to the President's \nbudget proposals, but with the necessity to reduce significantly below \nthat 1995 level.\n  There are, obviously, many programs which individual Senators would \nlike to see funded at higher levels. In many cases I agree. I do have \nto emphasize, and remind these Senators, however, of the funding \nconstraints that the subcommittee faced and the difficult choices that \nhad to be made.\n  Any amendments to increase any program area must be offset by \nreductions elsewhere to remain within our allocations in the \nAppropriations Committee and, of course, within the budget resolution \noverall. Now, let me turn \n\n[[Page S 11862]]\nbriefly to the recommendations that are before you today. These are \nonly highlights.\n  Programs for Native Americans and Alaska Natives are funded at \n$3,532,042,000 within the bill, almost 30 percent of its entire amount. \nWithin the funding constraints faced by the committee, efforts were \nmade to protect basic health care services provided through the Indian \nHealth Service, and the education, trust, and natural resources \nprograms within the Interior Department.\n  Funding has been provided for the Office of Special Trustee for \nAmerican Indians, by transferring funding for natural resources \nmanagement, trust services, resource management construction, and \nmiscellaneous payments for Indian land and water settlements from BIA \nto the office. The activities that remain within the BIA are primarily \nservices that are typically provided through local governments.\n  Concerns have been raised by the chairman and ranking member of the \nIndian Affairs Committee concerning potential impacts of the \ncommittee's proposal on the confirmation of the special trustee. As a \nresult, I plan to offer an amendment that will transfer the most of the \nactivities proposed for the Office of Special Trustee for American \nIndians back to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Only the financial trust \nmanagement functions and the immediate office of the special trustee \nwill remain. I hope that the merits of the committee's proposal will be \nconsidered as the Indian Affairs Committee considers legislation \nreorganizing the BIA. In any event, this is properly its \nresponsibility.\n\n\n                            land management\n\n  On the next subject, the subcommittee has attempted to protect the \noperational base of the land management agencies as much as possible. I \nhave already spoken to the fact there are no such reductions for the \nNational Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service has a 3-percent \nreduction, the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service each 5-\npercent reduction.\n  To assist with the growing recreation demands on the agencies in this \nbill, a pilot recreation fee proposal is included in the bill after \nconsultation with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  The construction accounts for the land management agencies have \ndecreased $88 million in total--20 percent. The majority of the \nconstruction projects involve the completion of ongoing projects and \nthe restoration or rehabilitation of existing facilities. No new starts \nfor visitor centers are provided.\n  Overall funding for land acquisition for the land management agencies \ntotals $127 million which is about halfway between last year's level \nand the outright moratorium included in the budget resolution. The \ncommittee has identified specific projects, while the House bill did \nnot. Priority is given to completing ongoing acquisitions and avoiding \nnew starts that will increase outyear demands.\n\n\n            natural resources science agency (formerly NBS)\n\n  The committee has recommended retaining the Department of the \nInterior's biological research as a separate entity. Direction is \nprovided to refocus the agency's work on issues most critical to the \nland managers, but language is included to protect private property \nowners.\n\n\n                            mining agencies\n\n  The committee has not included a moratorium on accepting and \nprocessing applications for mining patents, and that will be subject \nto, perhaps, an amendment that will be proposed very, very soon.\n  The mining and minerals related agencies are collectively funded at 8 \npercent below the fiscal year 1995 level. The committee mark funds the \nBureau of Mines at the request level of $132.5 million, a decrease of \n$20 million from fiscal year 1995. Field facilities proposed for \nclosure in the budget will be maintained at lower staffing levels.\n  The mark also includes OCS moratoria language covering the same areas \ncovered by last year's bill.\n\n\n                          department of energy\n\n  The Energy Conservation Program is funded at $577 million. The low-\nincome Weatherization Program is funded at $137 million, or about $26.5 \nmillion above the House-passed level. The State energy block grants are \nfunded at $31.5 million, $5 million above the House level. Bill \nlanguage has been included to prohibit DOE from proposing or issuing \nany new or amended standards for fluorescent lamps ballasts.\n  Fossil energy research and development is a decrease of 11 percent \nbelow the fiscal year 1995 level. Similar reductions are expected over \nthe next several fiscal years.\n\n\n                           cultural agencies\n\n  Within the constraints of our bill, we have made a concerted effort \nto address the critical repair and renovation needs of the cultural \norganizations, such as the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian \nInstitution, and the Kennedy Center, for which we have the primary \nresponsibility in order to protect collections and structures of \nimportance to the American people. Reductions to operating accounts, \nwhile unavoidable, have been kept relatively small in recognition of \nthe wide array of public services which in part define the mission of \nthese agencies.\n  As a result, more significant reductions have been necessarily taken \nto the budgets of the Endowments, whose mandates are fulfilled in \nvarying degrees based on the availability of funds, but whose \nbeneficiaries, of course, have many other sources of support. We make \nno assumptions with respect to the continuation or termination of the \nEndowments, believing that to be the function of the authorizing \ncommittee.\n  In short, we have done the best we can with severely limited \nresources, concentrating our efforts on those agencies that rely on the \nCongress for all, or about all, of their support.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the introductory \nremarks of the chairman.\n  May I say at the outset that this chairman is one of the finest \nsubcommittee chairman that I have seen in my years here. He has shown a \nvery studious approach and has in my judgment mastered this very \ncomplex bill. It is a bill that funds 40 agencies, and I salute him \nwithout envy by stating that he has come to grips with this bill and I \nthink has understood its complexities more in this 1 year than I have \nbeen able to understand in the several years I have been chairman and \nranking member, back and forth from time to time. I have found him to \nbe very fair and reasonable. He is sharp and he is dedicated. I think \nhe is a man who is molded for this particular subcommittee.\n  It is a subcommittee that I would have to say is probably far more \nwestern in its orientation than others. He comes from the West and he \nis familiar with those issues that are of such interest to the West. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him, and I have learned from him.\n  I will not engage in a lengthy summary of the bill because I believe \nthe major issues confronting the subcommittee have already been laid \nout.\n  This is not an easy bill to put together. The interests are \ncompeting, and the policy issues are of great importance to many \nSenators. As I have said, Senator Gorton has grasped the ramifications \nof these issues quickly, and has been very thoughtful in his approach \nto this bill. He has tried to make the best out of a very difficult \nsituation. The cuts in this bill are very real, but the chairman was \nleft with little choice because of the dictates of the budget \nresolution. Members should remember that in total, this appropriations \nbill is $1.1 billion, or 11 percent, below the fiscal year 1995 level.\n  In general, this bill protects the operating accounts of the \nagencies, and constrains construction and land acquisition funding \nbelow prior year levels. Despite these efforts to protect the core \nprograms that deliver services to the American public, the Interior \nDepartment has estimated that it may have to reduce its current work \nforce by 4,000 positions. Some of these reductions will occur in \nWashington, DC, but the vast majority of them will occur where the \nprograms are conducted--in places like Pittsburgh, Denver, Sacramento, \nPortland, Billings, Tuscon, Gainesville, Charleston, and the like. This \nbill is evidence that when the Appropriations Committee has to \ndistribute spending cuts of the magnitude imposed by the budget \nresolution, programs will be reduced, and so will the number of people \nwho deliver them. As one agency director reminded me, we \n\n[[Page S 11863]]\nare beyond the point of doing more with less--we are now having to do \nless with less.\n  Despite these constraints, Mr. President, the programs of this bill \nare endorsed warmly when it comes to specific requests for individual \nprojects, especially for more land acquisition and construction. Even \nafter the budget resolution recommended a moratorium on land \nacquisition and cuts in construction, the subcommittee was besieged by \nrequests from both sides of the aisle for these types of projects. The \nchairman and subcommittee have sought to accommodate the most critical \nprojects, while still reducing the overall program.\n  The committee has not concurred with some of the program terminations \nproposed by the House. The subcommittee has recommended a reduced, yet \nresponsible, level for natural resources research within the Interior \nDepartment. Funding is also provided to ensure that critical health and \nsafety, mineral information, and pollution abatement activities of the \nBureau of Mines are addressed, although at a level $20 million below \nlast year.\n  Mr. President, there will be an amendment offered to this bill to \nreduce funding in various operating accounts in order to put more money \ninto the programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Senator Gorton and I \nwill join together in opposition to this effort to undo the carefully \ncrafted compromise we bring to the Senate today.\n  Mr. President, this bill is right at its 602(b) allocation, so \namendments will need to be offset. Nearly all of the accounts in the \nbill are funded well below last year's level, the exceptions being the \nNational Park Service operating account and the Indian Health services \naccount, which are essentially frozen at the current level, with no \nallowances for the effects of fixed cost increases, pay, inflation, and \nthe costs of new facilities.\n  I encourage Senators who may have amendments to this bill to come to \nthe floor, and let us begin to address the amendments. This bill faces \na difficult conference, and the sooner we finish our work in the \nSenate, the better the chances are of completing action on this bill \nprior to the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1. Many of the \npotential amendments to which the subcommittee has been alerted have \nbeen debated previously on this bill, and I hope Senators will be \ncooperative and willing to enter into time agreements so that we can \ncomplete this bill as expeditiously as possible.\n  Lastly, I wish to thank Senator Gorton and his staff for the \ncooperative working relationship we have had in this bill.\n  In particular, I thank Sue Masica, my own very competent and \ndedicated staff person, for the excellent work that she consistently \nperforms and has performed over the years she has been with the \ncommittee.\n  I also thank Cherie Cooper for her fine work and pleasant way of \ndealing with all of us and her very cooperative and congenial manner.\n  The choices are difficult in this bill, but the task has been made \neasier by the fair manner in which this bill has been handled by the \nchairman and by his staff as well as by my own staff.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia for those comments and for that support.\n  Nevertheless, he and I both realize from our past history that this \nis a bill which attracts a great deal of interest, a certain degree of \ncontroversy and a significant number of amendments.\n  I am personally gratified by the fact that we have Members already \nwilling to propose those amendments. I just have a couple of other \nannouncements and I hope a motion.\n  Normally, we would now adopt committee amendments. I had hoped to \nadopt the committee amendments en bloc and have the bill in condition \nto be further amended. But first there were three objections to \nparticular committee amendments which Members wished to amend \nthemselves. And then the senior Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], desired \nto read all of the committee amendments to determine which he wished to \namend first. So I am not going to move to adopt any committee \namendments now.\n  We have worked as diligently as we can with Members who have \nrelatively noncontroversial amendments and two that are very large but \nnonetheless are agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 2283 through 2291\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would propose at this point to send a \nset of en bloc amendments to the desk and ask that they be considered. \nI will explain them. If any Member wishes to object to any one of them, \nthat Member is free to do so. But I trust there will be no such \nobjections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes en bloc \n     amendments numbered 2283 through 2291.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2283\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study \n  concerning the equity regarding entrance, tourism, and recreational \n    fees for the use of Federal lands and facilities, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       Insert at page 126, between line 7 and line 8:\n       ``(g)(1) It is the policy of the Congress that entrance, \n     tourism, and recreational use fees for the use of Federal \n     lands and facilities not discriminate against any State or \n     any region of the country.\n       ``(2) Not later than October 1, 1996, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in cooperation with the heads of other affected \n     agencies shall prepare and submit to the Senate and House \n     Appropriations Committees a report that--\n       ``(A) identifies all Federal lands and facilities that \n     provide tourism or recreational use;

The first of these amendments, No. 2283, is the amendment \nby the Senator from Colorado, [Mr. Brown] on a Department of the \nInterior study of recreation fees.\n  The second, No. 2284, is an amendment from Senator Chafee on the \nEndangered Species Act to clarify that the listing moratorium lasts \nonly during the pendency of this bill, that is to say, through \nSeptember 30, 1996. That is what we had intended to do and meant the \nbill to do. It was unclear. And just to make certain, it lasts only for \nthat period of time at the longest and will also terminate as and when \nthe Endangered Species Act itself is reauthorized.\n  The next, amendment No. 2285, is one by myself which substitutes the \nword ``final'' for the word ``draft'' in section 314.\n  The fourth, No. 2286, is a technical amendment of mine on the \npetroleum reserve.\n  The next, No. 2287, is a technical correction making the proper \ncitation to a statute.\n  Amendment No. 2288 is a technical correction which inserts the word \n``not'' in a phrase relating to various Indian tribes in the State of \nWashington, which was the original desired meaning of the language.\n  Amendment No. 2289 is one on mandatory rock painting required by \nvarious Federal agencies when highways are built.\n  And then there are two that are not technical amendments that are \nagreed to: Amendment No. 2290 for myself, the Senator from Arizona, the \nSenator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], and the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nDomenici] which will retain trust fund management and special trustee \nfunding within the Office of Special Trustees for American Indians but \ntransfer all of the other major funding accounts that were included in \nthis bill back to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  The special trustees office was authorized last year. I think we \nanticipated greater powers for it than the authorizing committee, the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, is prepared to grant to it at the present \ntime. And the subject is properly a matter for that committee to \nconsider. So this places only those clear trustee responsibilities in \nthe trustee and returns the rest to BIA.\n  The amendment transfers back to the Bureau of Indian Affairs all \nfunds and FTE's for the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, \nexcept for $15,891,000 for Financial Trust Management activities and \n$447,000 for the immediate Office of the Special Trustee.\n  A total of $393,690,000 is transferred back to the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, including $263,700,000 to the Operation of Indian Programs \naccount, $47,245,000 to the Construction account, and $82,745,000 to \nthe Indian Land and Water Claims Settlements and Miscellaneous Payments \nto Indians account. The Indian Land and Water Claims Settlements and \nMiscellaneous Payments to Indians account is transferred in its \nentirety.\n  Within the funds transferred to the Operation of Indian Programs \naccount, a total of $73,784,000 is transferred from Trust Asset \nManagement and Protection in the Office of Special Trustee to the Other \nTrust Services activities, including $28,692,000 for Tribal Priority \nAllocations, $30,227,000 for Non-recurring Programs, $9,935,000 to Area \nOffice Operations, and $4,930,000 to Central Office Operations.\n  Within the net amount transferred for Trust Services for Tribal \nPriority Allocations, a reduction of $1,605,000 has been taken that \nincludes: $846,000 for pay costs; $527,000 for general trust services \nand $231,000 to real estate services to eliminate increases above the \nFY 1995 level; and $1,000 to other trust services. For Non-recurring \nPrograms, a reduction of $237,000 for pay costs has been included and \n$13,472,000 has been transferred for water rights negotiation/\nlitigation. For Area Office Operations, there is a total reduction of \n$591,000, including a reduction of $291,000 for pay costs, and a \nreduction of $300,00 for land records improvement. For Central Office \nOperations, a total reduction of $58,000 has been taken for pay costs \nand $2,900,000 for land records improvement.\n  A total of $142,471,000 is transferred from Resource Management and \nProtection in the Office of Special Trustee to the Resources Management \nactivities in the BIA's OIP account, including $65,357,000 to Tribal \nPriority Allocations, $35,556,000 to Other Recurring Programs, \n$31,395,000 to Non-recurring Programs, $3,996,000 to Area Office \nOperations, $1,470,000 to Special Programs and Pooled Overhead, and \n$4,697,000 to Central Office Operations. Any committee direction for \nthe programs to be transferred still applies once the programs are \ntransferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Within the net amount transferred for Resources Management, a \nreduction of $3,020,000 for Tribal Priority Allocations has been taken \nthat includes $1,635,000 for pay costs, $620,000 to maintain Wildlife \nand Parks at the fiscal year 1995 level, and $765,000 to maintain Other \nResources Management at the fiscal year 1995 level. For Non-recurring \nPrograms, there is a total reduction of $428,000 for pay costs. For \nArea Office Operations, a total reduction of $505,000 includes $90,000 \nfor pay costs, $90,000 for Forestry, $50,000 for Water Resources, \n$200,000 for Wildlife and Parks, and $75,000 for Minerals and Mining. \nFor Central Office Operations, $80,000 was reduced for pay costs.\n  A total of $1,045,000 is transferred from Executive Direction in the \nOffice of Special Trustee to Central Office Operations within OIP, \nincluding $795,000 to the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs for the \nOffice of American Indian Trust, and $250,000 to Other General \nAdministration.\n  A total of $46,400,000 is transferred from Administrative Support in \nthe Office of Special Trustee to Operations of Indian Programs in BIA, \nincluding $40,000,000 to Tribal Government within Tribal Priority \nAllocations and $6,400,000 to Other General Administration within \nCentral Office Operations.\n  A total of $47,245,000 is transferred from the Office of Special \nTrustee to the Construction account of the Bureau of Indian Affairs for \nResource Construction Management. Reductions include $139,000 for pay \ncosts, $500,000 for Engineering and Supervision, and $12,024,000 for \nSafety of Dams. For the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project, \n\n[[Page S 11865]]\n$25,500,000 is provided and $1,500,000 is provided for the southern \nArizona project.\n  The last one, Amendment No. 2291, is by the same four Senators has to \ndo with tribal shares within the central office of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs.\n  The amendment deletes the committee amendment pertaining to \ndistribution of tribal share from Central Office Operations and Special \nPrograms and Pooled Overhead. The usual reprogramming guidelines of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee should apply to any amount \nnegotiated to be transferred as tribal shares to tribes or tribal \norganizations under Public Law 93-638, as amended.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2283\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment to the Interior \nappropriation bill, based on a bill I introduced earlier this year, S. \n340, Public Facilities Fees Equity Act of 1995. This amendment is \nsimilar to an amendment accepted by the Senate on the California Desert \nAct last year. This amendment involves three parts. One is a simple \nstatement of policy, It is to suggest there should not be \ndiscrimination in the kind of fees we levy across this country; \ndiscrimination among the States and discrimination between the various \nregions of the country. In other words, we ought to be working toward a \nuniform policy that affects the Nation fairly and evenly.\n  Second, it calls for a study of the fees we charge for entrance to \npublic facilities, whether they involve tourism or other public \nfacilities.\n  Third, it calls for recommendations to achieve the policy statement \nthat is for even and fair treatment. It relates specifically to this \namendment because it is not beyond the realm of possibility that fees \nwill relate, but its ramifications are broader than that. I think it \nmoves us toward a position of equity for the whole Nation.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. On the amendment by Senator \nChafee, I think I heard you say this but I was watching on television, \nnot here on the floor. I heard you say that it would be extended during \nthis next fiscal year and/or when the Endangered Species Act is \nreauthorized?\n  Mr. GORTON. Whichever is earlier.\n  The Senator from Arizona is here. I do not know whether he wanted to \ncomment on the trust fund or not or is ready to accept these amendments \nen bloc.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am prepared to accept the amendments en bloc and then \ncomment on that amendment as part of some general remarks I would like \nto make and some questions I have for the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. GORTON. Fine. Then, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the \namendments en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 2283 through 2291), en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. In attempting expeditiously and efficiently to organize \nthe debate, I asked the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, whether or \nnot he would put up his annual amendment on mining patents, and he has \nagreed to do so. I understand he is on the way to the floor. When he \ndoes that, I will move the committee amendment to which that would be \nan amendment.\n  In the meantime, I would yield the floor for any remarks the Senator \nfrom Arizona would like to make.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I would like to congratulate both \nthe manager of the bill and the distinguished Democratic leader on the \nvery difficult decisions that have been made in overall reductions in \nspending over last year.\n  I do have several concerns I would like to raise with the manager of \nthe bill, and perhaps I can discuss them with him. First of all, when \nthe committee amendments are proposed--I have already discussed this \nwith the Senator from Washington--I would seek an amendment to \nauthorize the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts by both \nHouses.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Does he mean that he would authorize them in this bill or would \ncondition the appropriations----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would condition the appropriations with the authorization \nby both Houses.\n  And I have already discussed that with the distinguished chairman. I \nwould say to the chairman, on page 19, there is a provision that \nstates:\n\n       $1,500,000 of the funds provided under this head, to be \n     derived from the Historic Preservation Fund, established by \n     the Historic Preservation Act of 1966 * * * shall be \n     available until expended to render the site safe for visitors \n     and to continue building stabilization of the Kennecott, \n     Alaska copper mine.\n\n  I believe I have reached an agreement with the Senator from Alaska on \nthis particular part of the bill. And I think that we will be ready \nsoon to propose an amendment that basically says that the changes in \nthe language says that ``it may be available until expended to render \nsites safe for visitors.'' I think that is an appropriate correction to \nthat part of it.\n  Mr. GORTON. I note the presence of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note his presence also. And I think he might be ready \nin just a few minutes. Let me just go on because I have some questions \nfor the distinguished chairman.\n  On page 27 of the bill, line 23, it says:\n\n       Provided further, That notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Secretary is authorized to convey, without \n     reimbursement, title and all interest of the United States in \n     property and facilities of the United States Bureau of Mines \n     in Juneau, Alaska to the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska; \n     in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to The University of Alabama; in \n     Rolla, Missouri, to the University of Missouri-Rolla; and in \n     other localities to such university or government entities as \n     the Secretary deems appropriate.\n\n  Am I correct in assuming that that transfer has not gone through the \nappropriate GSA screening process?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would assume that to be the case.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On page 68, beginning at line 6, it says--I am requesting \ninformation on this portion of the bill:\n\n       Provided further, That $2,500,000 of the funds appropriated \n     herein shall be available for a grant to the ``Non-Profit \n     Citizens for the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center'' for the \n     construction of the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center: Provided \n     further, That the Forest Service is authorized to grant the \n     unobligated balance of funds appropriated in fiscal year 1995 \n     for the construction of the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center * \n     * * \n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. Then it goes down further:\n\n       notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds \n     originally appropriated under this head * * * for the Forest \n     Service share of a new research facility at the University of \n     Missouri, Columbia, shall be available for a grant to the \n     University of Missouri, as the Federal share in the \n     construction of the new facility: Provided further, That \n     agreed upon lease of space in the new facility shall be \n     provided to the Forest Service without charge for the life of \n     the building.\n\n  Can the distinguished chairman illuminate me on what the meaning of \nthat portion of the bill is?\n  Mr. GORTON. The chairman can do so with respect to the Columbia Gorge \nprovisions, which are a part of an ongoing project that was involved in \nthe creation of the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area in, I believe, \nthe year 1986, which at that time authorized various visitors centers \nand the like on both the Washington and Oregon sides of the Columbia \nRiver within that area, which is almost a form of national park.\n  All moneys, to the best of my knowledge, have been appropriated for \nfacilities on the Washington side of the river. This is either the end \nor close to the end of the appropriations that had been authorized for \ncenters on the Oregon side of the river.\n  I suspect when the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nHatfield, is on the floor, he may be able to provide more details. But \nto the best of my knowledge, this is the culmination of projects \nauthorized by a bill in 1986 and passed then in connection with the \nColumbia Gorge.\n  In connection with the Missouri facility--I may have to supplement my \nanswer to this, but I cannot give an answer that is much better than \nthe text itself--that funds have already been appropriated for the \nForest Service's share of the research facility at the University of \nMissouri, and this simply turns whatever that original appropriation \nwas into a grant, provided that the Forest Service will have room in \nthe building when it is completed.\n\n[[Page S 11866]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank my colleague for his explanation. \nObviously, I will seek an additional explanation on both of those since \nit has the appearance of earmarking, but I will withhold judgment until \nI am able to receive an explanation on that issue.\n  I repeat my concern about the conveyance without reimbursement of \nvarious facilities without going through the proper screening process.\n  As I mentioned, at the appropriate time, I will seek an amendment \nrequiring authorization funding for the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  But in the meantime, I see my friend from Alaska who has, I believe, \nvery kindly agreed to change the wording of the language on page 19. I \nam prepared to propose that amendment at the convenience of the manager \nof the bill and the Senator from Alaska. I will be glad to yield to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I was typing up the \namendment. Does he have it already prepared?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe momentarily.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think it is coming. I might say to my friend from \nArizona, Mr. President, it accomplishes the same result. We know that \nthat money is earmarked. It merely confirms earmarking, and the \nlanguage puts it on the basis of a permissive action but gives \nattention to the fact that action should be taken.\n  I am happy to accept that. I know we will go forward and want it to \nbe noted by the Department that it has high congressional priority.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Alaska. I am sure it is a very \nworthwhile project. The Senator from Alaska and I have discussed many \ntimes my view on this kind of bill language. I believe that this \nlanguage will now allow the Corps of Engineers to make the kind of \njudgment necessary to carry out the work and complete the task as \nenvisioned by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I do not have the amendment ready at this moment. As \nsoon as I receive it, I will propose it, hopefully before the Senator \nfrom Arkansas begins since I suspect he has a fairly lengthy exposition \nand I perhaps would like to get this done. Here it is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its----\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator withhold? Does the Senator now have the \namendment he was speaking about with the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n\n\n           Committee Amendment on Page 19, Lines 8 through 14\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe I should offer the committee \namendment found on page 19, lines 8 through 14, as I suspect this is an \namendment to that committee amendment. Mr. President, I call up the \ncommittee amendment on page 19, lines 8 to 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Committee amendment on page 19, lines 8 through 14.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 2292 to the Committee Amendment on Page 19, lines 8 \n                               through 14\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor his attention to my amendment. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2292 to the committee amendment on page 19, lines 8 \n     through 14.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all in the committee amendment on page 19, lines 8-\n     14, and insert in lieu thereof the following: ``Provided \n     further, That funds provided under this head, derived from \n     the Historic Preservation Fund, established by the Historic \n     Preservation Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 915), as amended (16 \n     U.S.C. 470), may be available until expended to render sites \n     safe for visitors and for building stabilization''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Alaska. \nI believe this is appropriate, and I have no more remarks on the \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2292) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \namendment on page 19, lines 8 through 14, as amended.\n  So the committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          Committee Amendment on Page 128, Lines 16 through 21\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to call \nup, out of order, the committee amendment on page 128, lines 16 to 21, \nto which the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas will be a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Committee amendment on page 128, lines 16 through 21.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2293 to the Committee Amendment on page 128, lines 16 \n                               through 21\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Feingold, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2293 to the committee amendment on page \n     128, lines 16 through 21.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Add the following at the end of the language on lines 16-21 \n     on page 128 proposed to be stricken by the Committee \n     amendment:\n       ``The provisions of this section shall not apply if the \n     Secretary of Interior determines that, for the claim \n     concerned: (1) a patent application was filed with the \n     Secretary on or before the date of enactment of the fiscal \n     year 1995 Interior Appropriations Act, and (2) all \n     requirements established under Sections 2325 and 2326 of \n     Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 29 and 30) for vein or lode \n     claims and Sections 2329, 2330, 2331 and 2333 of the Revised \n     Statutes (30 U.S.C. 35, 36 and 37) for placer claims, and \n     Section 2337 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 42) for mill \n     site claims, as the case may be, were fully complied with by \n     the applicant by that date.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before he begins, will the Senator from \nArkansas yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Does the Senator have any idea how long he wishes? Can we \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement on the time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I promise you, this is a fairly narrow \nissue. This is not mining law reform. I promise you, while I will not \nunduly delay it, I would like to make my opening argument and see how \nmuch time we use, and we can use that as a judge as to how much time it \nwill take.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arkansas starts the \ndebate, I have tried to work with my colleagues on the other side, and \nit appears at this stage what we probably will do after we finish the \nSenator's debate and say a few words in opposition to it, is move to \ntable it at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Arkansas has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, in a sense, I hate to stand here and \nmake this argument. This is the eighth consecutive year that I have \ntried to bring some sanity and reason to an 1872 law which can only be \ndescribed not as an anachronism, but a scandalous anachronism.\n People who do not understand this issue can be easily deceived by what \nwe are talking about. But here \n\n[[Page S 11867]]\nare the simple, basic facts. I have called a few of the freshman \nSenators, and it is very difficult for anybody to believe that the \npractice I am trying to stop is actually going on.\n\n  In 1872, Ulysses Grant signed the 1872 Mining Law. Under that bill, \npeople were encouraged to go west and settle. The West was still pretty \nwild. And Congress said, essentially, if you will move out to the West, \nwe will let you file claims for hard rock minerals in 20-acre \nincrements. You put down four stakes anywhere you want for 20 acres, \nand put down as many as you want. If you want 100 acres, put down \nclaims on five 20-acre tracts. If you want 500 acres, put down 25 20-\nacre plots. And today, 124 years after Ulysses Grant signed the bill, \nit is still law.\n  Do not everybody bolt for the door to rush out west and file claims. \nBut if you want to, you can. You just find yourself any one of the 550 \nmillion acres of land that the Federal Government still has open for \nmining and you put your stakes down, and it is yours. You have to pay \n$100 a year if you have more than 25 claims. If you do not, you do not \npay anything.\n  But here is the real kicker: If you find any hard rock minerals--\ngold, silver, palladium, platinum--if you can convince the Bureau of \nLand Management that you have any of those hard rock minerals in \ncommercial quantities under this land, you can demand a deed. You say, \nI want a deed to this 500 acres. You know something else? They cannot \nrefuse you. They have to give you a deed to it.\n  So in the last 124 years, we have given away more than 3.2 million \nacres. That is acreage the size of the State of Connecticut. For how \nmuch? Mr. President, $2.50 an acre. Sometimes, $5 an acre. That is the \nmaximum. In that same period of time, $241 billion worth of minerals \nhave been taken off that land. And what do you think ``Uncle Sucker'' \ngot? He got somewhere between $30 billion and $70 billion in \nreclamation costs to clean up the thousands of mining sites that are \nabandoned and, you guessed it, not a dime in royalties.\n  The taxpayers of this country gave away 3.2 million acres of land for \n$2.50 an acre. The mining companies took $241 billion worth of gold and \nsilver, and we got the shaft. Now, every time I tell that story to \nsomebody, they say you know that could not be true. I have heard a lot \nabout corporate welfare. But I have never heard anything even \napproaching this.\n  Madam President, do you know what else? Once you get a deed, you do \nnot even have to mine it. Do you know what you can do with it? You can \nsell it to somebody for a ski resort. You can sell it to somebody to \nbuild condominiums on. It is yours, you have a deed to it. Do you know \nsomething else? Every time we give somebody a deed to that land, that \nmeans it is theirs, and we can never again charge them a royalty on the \nland.\n  What is it about the mining companies that gives them such a \nstranglehold over this body? Last year, for the first time, the \nInterior Appropriations Conference finally included a moratorium and \nsaid, no more, do not process any more patent applications. We \ngrandfathered-in 393 patent applications that were pending. But at \nleast that was a step in the right direction. For the first time in \nhistory, Congress agreed to put a moratorium and say no more patents.\n  This year, I am saying let us renew it, let us put this moratorium on \nthis year and next year, until we get some kind of reform law through \nhere.\n  Last year Senator Johnston from Louisiana, the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, negotiated for 18 months--really 2 years --with everybody in \nsight, to try to reach a deal on reform. He gave, he compromised, he \nconciliated, he did everything in the world to try to accommodate \neverybody's concern, but to pass a law that had some sense of sanity to \nit.\n  Let me ask every Member of this body, do you think it is fair for a \nnew mining company to pay an 18 percent royalty on their lands in \nNevada? And a few miles away mine gold off Federal lands and not pay \none red cent? And then argue that if they had to pay a royalty on \nFederal lands the mining companies will all go broke and everybody will \nbe without a job? If they mine on private lands, they are happy to pay \na royalty of 18 percent, and they go like gangbusters. But if you even \nsuggest charging them a royalty on Federal lands, or that they not be \nallowed to mine in every national park and wilderness area in the \nUnited States, they go broke.\n  Why is it that the mining companies have such a stranglehold on this \nbody? If you want to mine coal on Federal land, that is fine, but you \npay ``Uncle Sugar'' a 12.5 percent royalty if you take coal off the \ntaxpayers' land. On underground mines, some of them a mile deep, think \nof the cost of extracting coal from a mile down. They pay an 8 percent \nroyalty. No questions asked. You pay it, or you do not mine. Natural \ngas, 12.5 percent. Oil 12.5 percent. Goal, silver, platinum, palladium, \nall the rest of them, zero. What is the difference? Why is that? Mr. \nPresident, you need not look any further than the 1872 Mining Law.\n  Since the Senate first defeated the patent moratorium in the fiscal \nyear 1991 appropriations bill, we have had 468 patent applications \ncovering 159,000 acres, 346 first-half final certificates have been \ngranted; 79 patents granted covering 11,365 acres; the taxpayers have \nreceived the handsome sum, for all those patents--``Uncle Sugar's'' \ntaxpayers have received the magnificent sum of $56,000, and we have \ngiven away on those lands $11 billion worth of gold, silver, platinum \nand palladium, and we received not one red cent in royalties.\n  Madam President, this amendment is the same one that the Interior \nAppropriations Conference unanimously agreed-to last year. We do not \ndisturb the 393 patent applications that we grandfathered-in last year. \nBut there are 233 more that are subject to the moratorium. If my \namendment fails, Madam President, listen to this, all you people who \nare voting to cut Medicare, Medicaid, school lunches, earned income tax \ncredits, National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, Public \nBroadcasting, and all you people voting to eliminate those things or \ncut them very severely, you vote against my amendment and you are \ngiving away $11 billion to the biggest corporations in America.\n  Go home and defend that one. It must not be tough. I have been \nworking on mining law reform for 7 years now. All the news magazines \nhave done a segment on this outrageous law. One Senator called me after \na particularly harsh show on ``Prime Time Live'' and said, ``For God's \nsakes put me on as a cosponsor.'' Two months later when we voted, he \nvoted against it. He said his phone was ringing off the wall, and well \nit should be.\n  We have the opportunity here to give away $15.5 billion in minerals \nthat belong to the taxpayers of this country, while we are trying to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, and cutting dramatically the most \nvulnerable people in America, and giving $15.5 billion to the biggest \ncorporations in America.\n  Last year, Madam President, on May 16, 1994, the Secretary of the \nInterior was forced to give a Canadian corporation--not even an \nAmerican corporation--a deed to 1,800 acres of land for the princely \nsum of $9,000. That 1,800 acres had 11 billion dollars' worth of gold \nunder it.\n  People who may be listening to this say two things: No. 1, you know \nhe is embellishing that, that could not possibly be true. As bad as it \nis, the Government would never do a thing like that.\n  Then they will hear people get up and answer this. They say, ``We \nhave offered to pay fair market value.''\n  Really? For what?\n  ``For the surface.''\n  Oh, the surface. ``You are willing to pay fair market value for the \nsurface?''\n  ``Yes, sir.''\n  On that 1,800 acres, the fair market value is about $100 an acre, and \nit has 11 billion dollars' worth of gold under it. Do not fall for that \nfair market value argument. I will give you 100 times more than fair \nmarket value. Bring me a deed and I will pay you right now, give you \n100 times more than the fair market value of the surface.\n  We are not talking about surface. We are talking about what is under \nthe surface. The Stillwater Mining Co. is owned by Chevron Resources \nand the Manville Corp., a couple of local paupers. This mine is located \nin the Custer and Gallatin National Forest in Montana, 35 miles north \nof Yellowstone.\n  In 1990, I came within two votes of getting a moratorium exactly like \nthe \n\n[[Page S 11868]]\none I am proposing today. I came within two votes in 1990 of getting \nthat moratorium put on. Four days later, the Stillwater Mining Co. \nfiled an application for patents on 2,036 acres--scared to death \nbecause I came within two votes of stopping these outrageous practices. \nDo you know what is under that 2,036 acres? This is their figure, not \nmine--this is what they say--225 million ounces of platinum and \npalladium worth $38 billion. For the princely sum of $5 an acre, \nStillwater will pay to Uncle Sugar, a total of $10,180, and we will \ndeed the Stillwater Mining Co. 225 million ounces of palladium and \nplatinum worth $38 billion.\n  I do not know how you explain this to your constituents. You do not, \nbecause it never comes up. My father used to say: ``Everybody's \nbusiness is nobody's business,'' and this is where it comes in. Very \nfew people outside the roughly 11 Western States even know about the \nissue.\n  This is not an antiwestern issue. It is not antianything. It is \nsimple justice for the taxpayers of this country.\n  A family in Oregon got a deed under this process for 780 acres of \nland of sand--believe this--sand. They wanted the sand, so they bought \nit for $1,950, 780 acres of sand. Guess where it was? It was in the \nNational Dunes Recreation area of Oregon, and they paid $1,950 for it. \nThere was a hue and cry about selling this sand in a national \nrecreation area. So we started negotiating to get it back. The family \nhad paid $1,950 for the land. What do you think they want for it back, \nSenator? Somewhere between $11 million and $12 million.\n  Now, this is not only not collecting royalty, this is having to give \nsomebody $11 million to $12 million back because we should not have \nsold it to them in the first place.\n  In 1983, a speculator demanded a deed for 160 acres of Forest Service \nland near the Keystone Ski Resort. He got it for $400. He sold 44 acres \nfor $500,000. I do not know why anybody stays in the Senate. We ought \nto be all out West with our pickaxes. If you do not have a pickax, just \nsend your application in.\n  In 1987, while DOE was examining Yucca Mountain as a possible nuclear \nwaste site, a man went in and filed for 27 claims for $135, and DOE \npaid him $249,000, almost immediately, for the land. We gave him the \nland for $400 and turned right around and paid him back $249,500.\n  Have you had enough? I will give you one more.\n  In 1987 the Government sold land just outside the city of Phoenix to \na miner for $2.50 an acre, and 10 years later, 10 years later he sold \nthe land to a resort developer for $400,000 plus an 11 percent interest \nin the resort.\n  When I first started discussing this subject, a Senator on the other \nside, a man who is not here anymore, a fine Senator, a man I respected \ngreatly and I thought if there was anyone over there who would like to \njoin me on this, he would be it, I gave him the pitch you just heard me \ngive, ``How about joining with me as a sponsor?\"\n  He said, ``No, I am heading for Nevada so I can file a claim.'' I \napplauded his honesty.\n  Mr. President, I wish every Member of the body were here because I \nwould really like to see 100 Senators sitting in their seats and ask \nthis question:\n  How many times have you told the Chamber of Commerce about how \nterrible the deficit is? How many times have you told them you are \ngoing to do everything you can to get the deficit down? How many times \nhave you told them and the Rotary club, ``I will treat your money like \nit were my own\"?\n  Really?\n  I used to own a farm. I sold it about a year ago and it broke my \nheart. I suddenly realized I was not going to build that dream home \noverlooking the lake on my farm. I never made any money. Made enough to \npay the taxes and keep the fences up, but I loved it. And under that \nfarm was some natural gas. If somebody had come to me and said, \n``Senator Bumpers, we are going to set up a well over here; we are \ngoing to take this gas out from under your land.''\n  ``Now wait, just a minute.''\n  ``No. The Government gave us a deed to it, so we want to set up shop \nhere and we are going to take your gas.''\n  What would you say, Senator? If you had a 12-gauge handy, you would \norder them off your land.\n  Do you know what the landowner out in Nevada said to Newmont Mining \nCompany? ``Sure, come in here and mine this gold. Just give us 18 \npercent of anything you sell it for.''\n  I do not want to belabor this. I want to talk about it long enough \nthat people have some semblance of an idea of what an outrageous \nscandal it is to continue giving away the Federal domain for $2.50 an \nacre. Three years ago, in talking about this, some of the Senators from \nthe West said they would consider paying a 3 percent royalty on the net \nprofits. I had always held out for 8 percent of the gross income, or a \nnet smelter return, which is the common practice for royalties on \nprivate land. Eight percent probably--certainly not in this climate--is \nnot realistic. At the time we discussed this 3 years ago, when the \nindustry said a royalty would bankrupt them, gold was $333 an ounce. \nToday it is exactly $50 higher than that, $383 an ounce. Platinum has \ngone from $354 to $422, $68 dollars more per ounce than it was at the \nbeginning of the 103rd Congress.\n  But today--you see, they could have paid an 8 percent gross royalty \nand just think how much more they would still have than they had then. \nBut today you suggest a 3 or 4 percent royalty: ``Oh, it will bankrupt \nus. It will put us out of business.''\n  Let me refresh your memory on what this amendment does and what it \ndoes not do. You make up your own mind. If you want to go home and \ndefend this, be my guest. All I ask of you is just be honest when you \nare defending it.\n  My amendment reinstates the moratorium against the Interior \nDepartment processing any new patent applications. Bear in mind, there \nare 393 patent applications that were grandfathered-in last year. When \nthe Conference agreed to this, I knew that mining law reform would not \nbe enacted.\n  The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] worked his heart out last \nyear to try to enact reform. And at the last minute, when everybody \nknew it was too late--``Sorry, we just do not have time to do it this \nyear.''\n  All I am trying to do is reinstate exactly what we did last year, put \na moratorium on patenting, let the 393 applicants go forward. But for \nGod's sake, do not add any more.\n  And finally, on a more pathetic note, I have always admitted to be a \nsocial liberal and a fiscal conservative. I have stood behind that desk \nand shouted to the rooftops, just as I have tonight, trying to warn \npeople about what the deficits are doing to this Nation, and it often \nfell on deaf ears.\n  Let me ask you this. If you can explain to people why you are going \nto do this, also explain to them how you had to cut education by 30 \npercent over the next 7 years. Explain to them why you had to cut \nMedicare by $270 billion. Explain to them why you had to cut Medicaid \n$170 billion.\n  Explain to them why you had to cut Earned Income Tax Credits, the \nbest program the Nation ever had to keep people off welfare. Explain to \nthem why the only civilized thing their children get a chance to see is \non PBS, and they want to torpedo that--cannot afford it.\n  Explain to them why you want to cut the Endowment for the Humanities, \nwhich trains 3,500 teachers every year in civilized conduct, and they \ngo back home and they pass their lessons, what they learned, on to \n500,000 students--you have to cut that out. The National Endowment for \nthe Arts--it is not all pornography, you know. It is ``The Civil War,'' \nit is ``Baseball,'' it is the Arkansas Symphony--we have to cut all \nthose things out.\n  At the same time Senators, go home to your constituents and try to \nexplain how you voted to continue to give away public land and billions \nof dollars worth of minerals. Houdini could not perform that trick and \nget away with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I hope we will support the Bumpers \namendment. As Senator Bumpers indicated, we worked in the last Congress \nvery hard to get a mining law reform bill. There was a lot of good-\nfaith work by a lot of people on both sides of the issue. But, Madam \nPresident, at no point was it ever seriously considered that we give \naway the public land by patenting for $2.50 an acre. The companies know \nbetter than that. They know \n\n[[Page S 11869]]\nthat this is a giveaway program. They are not even trying for that when \nit comes to serious negotiations on the mining law reform bill.\n  Madam President, if we give away the public land for $2.50 an acre, \nit does not pass the straight-face test. There is nobody who can stand \nhere on the floor of this Senate and say that is seriously what we \nought to do, because we all know better. The companies no better.\n  Madam President, we have still some chance in this Congress to get a \nmining law reform bill. The bigger companies--I have talked to them--\nreally understand the dynamic. They understand, first of all, the \npolitical dynamic. They understand that the people of this country are \ngetting a rising tide of disgust at what we are giving away with the \nmining law bill. The 1879 mining law bill needs reform. They know it. \nThey are willing to do it.\n  Frankly, it is many of the smaller companies which are not willing to \njoin in a coalition to get a mining law reform bill. It is only a \nmatter of time. I have counseled with those bigger companies and have \ntold them that, in my judgment, it is in their interest to get a mining \nlaw reform bill this year. They know the general outlines of that bill. \nAnd the general outlines are you have to end patenting because the \npeople of the country can understand this. There are many things that \nthe people of this country cannot understand, such as complicated \nformulas, tax provisions, corporate provisions. Some of these laws that \nwe put here, they cannot understand. They can understand patenting. \nThey can understand getting the public domain at $2.50 an acre, and \nthey know that is wrong. It is simple. It is clear. It is \nunderstandable, and it is, in the minds of the people of this country, \noutrageous.\n  So I hope we will vote for the Bumpers amendment. Then I hope that we \nwill work in the rest of this Congress to get a fair and good mining \nlaw reform bill.\n  As I told my colleagues from the West last year as we were trying to \nperfect a mining law reform bill, I believe we can put together a fair \nmining law reform bill that does not cost one single job in the West--\nnot one; that does not break or bankrupt any company--not one company; \nbut which gets for the American taxpayer, gets for Americans across \nthis country, a fair return on what is theirs, what belongs to all \nAmericans, that is, the public domain.\n  So, Madam President, I hope we will support the Bumpers amendment. It \nis fair. If this amendment should fail to pass, and we patent for $2.50 \nan acre all those amounts of the public domain, it will not set well \nwith the American public. It will not set well with the American \npublic. And that, believe me, is something they can understand. I hope \nwe will vote for the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  This is not the first time that we have debated the Bumpers amendment \non appropriations with regard to the mining bill and the patent issue, \nspecifically. I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  There are lots of arguments that have been used and a lot of \ngeneralizations that have been made. But what we all agree on is that \nmining law reform should be done appropriately in the authorizing \ncommittee. We all agree further that there is a need for substantial \nreform, and we have initiated a bill. We have had considerable \ndiscussion in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The \nrealization is that every Member agrees that we need this reform.\n  But the question today is, are we going to pass mining law \nlegislation as part of an appropriations bill? Most Members would say, \nno, we should not do that.\n  I am chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nand I can assure each Member of the Senate that we have made extensive \nprogress on comprehensive reform.\n  This is a difficult domestic issue. It is an issue ultimately of \nwhether we are going to depend on imported minerals coming into this \ncountry and export our dollars and export our jobs, or are going to be \nable to continue to sustain a mining industry that provides high-paying \njobs in this country.\n  Make no mistake about it. One of the interesting reflections we hear \nall of the time from the labor community is, What is happening to the \nhigh-paying jobs in this country? We have more people employed, but the \njob pay range is lower. It is quite obvious; we are not developing our \nresources in mining, in oil and gas, and in timber. We are simply \nimporting those resources and exporting our dollars.\n  We have held hearings on mining law legislation before the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. We are getting closer to reaching an \nagreement. There is no question in my mind as chairman that we have \nenough votes currently to report out a bill. A mining claim patent \nmoratorium is going to delay that process. Moratoriums, such as the one \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas, become the means by which \nCongress avoids its responsibility under the law and to make changes in \nstatutes such as the mining laws.\n  The moratorium is going to slow it down. It is going to perhaps kill \nany incentive that exists at the present time to complete action on \nthis comprehensive bill. And I am sure my friend from Arkansas would \nagree.\n  We have heard these horror stories from Senator Bumpers each year--\nthey get better each year--about the Federal land giveaway. Yet, when \ngiven the opportunity, he apparently wants to take away the very \nincentives which should drive Members to enact comprehensive reform. It \nis not a giveaway. He does not address the investment that goes into \nexploration and the realization that in many cases when you are looking \nfor reserves which you do not find, or if you do find them, you do not \nfind enough of them, or you may find an ore body and it dribbles out \nand it is lost, and, as a consequence, the ability for the investment \nto make a recovery is a relatively high-risk prospect.\n  Maintaining the status quo--what effect does it have on the mining \nindustry? It certainly has none. If we are proceeding with a bill with \nwhich we want to enact true reform, then it is the authorizing \ncommittee that has the responsibility to complete action on a \ncomprehensive bill. And that is what we are doing.\n  The rules for patent application are steeped with longstanding \nagreements and legal history in accordance with Federal law. Compliance \nis costly. Compliance is time consuming. Many people fail to recognize \nthat. They think one goes out and simply picks up and sells the \nminerals. By the time a miner has filed a patent application--in many \ncases, they have invested tens of thousands of dollars, in some cases, \nmillions of dollars--in proving the discovery of a valuable mineral \ndeposit. You do not locate it without a significant investment of time. \nYou have to prove it up. It has to be able to sustain the investment \nnecessary to bring about a return on the investment.\n  There are some claims that have been discovered that are rich, and \napparently the risk associated with the investment has provided a \nhandsome return. But there are hundreds of thousands that have been \nexpended in what constitutes dry holes in the sense of an oil \nreference, but in minerals that simply have been petered out because \nthey have not been able to sustain either the quantity or quality \nnecessary to develop it.\n  A moratorium is a kind of misguided Federal policy that simply \ncreates confusion and distrust among the American people and tramples \non their inherent rights. And those rights involve private property. We \nhave an obligation here under the sanctity of private property, and the \nmining law created a system by which citizens of this country are \nawarded real property rights in mineral lands in return for developing \na valuable mineral deposit.\n  The generalization is, well, this is a giveaway.\n  How is it a giveaway? They go out; they make expenditures; they do \nexploration. And if, indeed, they develop that property, they provide \nemployment; they pay taxes; and they generate a return. I can show you \neach year mines that shut down. They do not shut down because they did \nnot find ore. The ore is not rich enough to \n\n[[Page S 11870]]\nsustain the investment and as a consequence they have to shut down and \nlay people off work.\n  The Supreme Court has held that the right conveyed in a patent is a \nproperty right in the highest sense of the term. The Senator from \nArkansas wants to do away with that. Senator Bumpers' amendment \ngrandfathers a few patent applications currently pending at the \nInterior Department but his amendment also tramples on numerous pending \npatent applications.\n  There is already a de facto moratorium on processing patents, and \nthat is as a consequence of the prevailing attitude at the Department \nof Interior. Secretary Babbitt has made no secret of the fact that he \nstrongly opposes the patent system under current law. The Secretary has \ntaken numerous actions designed to indefinitely delay processing of \npending mining mill site claim patent applications.\n  In fact, for the first 2 years of Babbitt's tenure the Department of \nInterior did not issue a single, not a single mining or mill site claim \nunder existing law except what the Court ordered the Secretary to do.\n  Now, two Federal courts have ruled that the delays caused by the \nSecretary's action have been unreasonable and unfounded. As a result of \nthe Secretary's de facto moratorium, we have seen a huge backlog of \npatent applications develop. We all know that even if the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arkansas fails, the Secretary of the Interior is going \nto continue his de facto moratorium, so in essence Senator Bumpers' \namendment is more politics than substance.\n  In reality, Madam President, the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers \nis unnecessary and we should defeat the Bumpers amendment. Let the \nEnergy Committee complete its action on comprehensive reform, debate \nthat bill in the Chamber of the Senate, because as I have indicated \nbefore we do have the votes to vote it out of committee, and not fool \nwith a piecemeal moratorium on appropriations bills.\n  Now, Madam President, by defeating the Bumpers amendment, I think we \ncan send a strong message, a message that needs to be sent, to the \nauthorizing committee to enact comprehensive reform.\n  Let us talk about that comprehensive reform because it has been \naddressed by the Senator from Arkansas and others. Make no mistake, \nMadam President, on the issue of patents miners should be required to \npay fair market value for the surface estate. That is what we propose \nin our legislation, fair market value for the surface estate.\n  So do not tell me this is a giveaway. It is not a giveaway. We are \ntalking about fair market value. Some people have a way of generalizing \nand seeing what they want to see and not listening and not \nunderstanding what the intent of this reform is. They would pay fair \nmarket value for the surface estates.\n  Now, we have heard a lot of conversation about speculation or using \npatents for nonmining purposes. That has happened in the past, but it \nwill not happen again. The National Mining Association supports this \nlegislation. They agree that miners should be prohibited from using \nfuture patented lands for anything but good-faith mining purposes. If \nthe land is used for other purposes, Madam President, we should require \nthe land to revert back to the Federal Government.\n  Now, let us make sure we understand the reforms we are talking about. \nYou pay fair market value for the patent, unlike the characterization \nof my friend from Arkansas, who says this is a giant giveaway.\n  Speculation or using patents for nonmining purposes would end under \nthe proposed legislation. You could not use it for anything other than \ngood-faith mining purposes. If you use it for anything else or attempt \nto, it goes back in the Federal domain.\n  Now, the issue of royalty, talking about what is a return to the \nFederal Government. We should assure that the Federal Government \nreceives a fair return on all minerals production by imposing a net \nroyalty.\n  Some Members of this body have suggested that true mining reform must \nimpose the same concept of gross royalty on hard rock minerals as \napplies to the oil and gas industry. But those who suggest that fail to \nunderstand the difference between the two industries and that both the \nnet royalty and gross royalty basically achieve the same results. It \ndepends on how they are structured.\n  Mineral production and oil and gas extraction are fundamentally \ndifferent operations. Oil and gas are removed in almost a marketable \ncondition. Very little has to be done. Gas comes out and you condition \nthe gas. The oil comes out and you take some of the residue out of it. \nBut you basically have, when you take it out of the ground, a salable \nproduct at that point. But gold, silver, copper, hard rock minerals are \nextracted in a raw form. When you roll that mineral out of the mine, \nyou have basically a big rock in front of the mine. What is it worth? \nNothing. It may have gold in it, copper in it, silver in it. But in \nthat form it is a rock-like material. Raw ore is almost valueless until \na mining company has added the significant value to the product. That \nmeans transporting it to a mill. That means crushing it. That means \nrecovering the ore. That means disposing of the rock. That means the \nreclamation process back in the mine.\n  Recognizing that these costs are necessary, to put the hard rock \nmining royalty on a par with the oil and gas industry is simply not \napplicable. You have these steps that have to be taken--concentrating, \nsmelting. When you take the mineral out of the mill, then you have it \nin a powder form. You have to take it to smelting, put it in the \nfurnace. These are all unlike the availability of a product that is \nsalable when it comes out of an oil or gas well.\n  Now, on the issue of reclamation, the mining law should give the \nStates the primacy for assuring that surface effects from mineral \nactivities are reclaimed. We have reclamation in the bill. We have the \nWestern Governors Association which opposes restrictive Federal \nstandards that many believe can be seen as another unfunded mandate \nfrom Washington. We have had enough of unfunded mandates. In addition, \nlet us not forget the position of the National Academy of Sciences. It \nhas concluded that uniform reclamation standards similar to those \napplicable to reclamation of coal mine lands are not appropriate for \nhard rock mining. So we have a difference.\n  In short, mining law reform should protect the U.S. mining industry, \nprotect U.S. jobs, protect the environment, and provide a fair return \nto the U.S. Treasury. That is just what we are attempting to do with my \ncomprehensive mining law reform legislation.\n  Now, Senator Bumpers has been at this a lot longer than I have \nrelative to his efforts to terminate the mining industry in the United \nStates as we know it today. Under the direction of my good friend from \nArkansas you would have prescribed a royalty that would simply drive \nthe industry out of the United States.\n  We have seen the experiments in Mexico and Canada where they have \ndeveloped a royalty system very similar to that which was proposed by \nthe Senator from Arkansas, and they have revised it because it simply \nhas not worked. It has resulted in the industry moving out of both \nMexico and Canada.\n  We ought to learn something by experience around here. The Bumpers \namendment may look good on the surface, but like any book, when one \nbegins to read the text, one quickly learns that one should not judge a \nbook by its cover.\n  Mining law reform belongs in the Energy Committee, not in the fiscal \nyear 1996 Interior appropriations bill. Some of the senior Members who \nhave argued long and fast for legislation on appropriations should be \nsensitive to authorizing legislation on an appropriations bill. Senator \nBumpers has offered similar amendments in the past. Each time this body \nhas opposed his proposal based on the same logic that I am proposing \nthat you consider here today.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to defeat the Bumpers amendment, \nresolve mining law reform through the legislative process, not the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I promise, Madam President, to yield the floor to \nSenator Craig.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. As my chairman knows, I have sent him a letter to the \n\n[[Page S 11871]]\n  effect that I believe we could pass mining law reform based on three \nprinciples. First, an end of patenting; second, what we call a net \nsmelt royalty of 2.5 percent; and, third, an assurance that we give \naway no powers that are presently held by the Secretary of the Interior \nwith respect to the ability to regulate mines. Those three principles, \nas I said in my letter to the distinguished chairman from Alaska, I \nbelieve would get us a bill that would not only have strong bipartisan \nsupport, but could be signed by the President.\n  Does the Senator acknowledge that that offer is out on the table now \nin effect from those of us on this side of the aisle?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to respond to my good friend from \nLouisiana relative to his points on the net smelt or the end of \npatenting.\n  The concern that we have expressed time and time again is relative to \nvalue. And we are proposing that the patent reflect a fair market \nvalue. We further propose that there be a mandate that would eliminate \nthe use of that land for anything other than its intended mining \npurposes.\n  Now, there is a concern in the committee relative to the authority of \nthe Secretary of the Interior. There is a certain sensitivity about not \nduplicating oversight, not taking away from the States the inherent \nright that they would have, say, to control and have authority over \nwater issues, which obviously the States are very sensitive to.\n  So, I think we are very close to accommodating most of these \nconcerns. But the devil is in the details.\n  Again, the Senator from Arkansas wants to eliminate patenting. We are \nsuggesting that we pay a fair market value, that the small miners have \nan assurance that they have the right to patent. It is not so much an \nissue for the larger corporations that have the sophistication \ninternally to have the assurance that their interests are protected.\n  We have also proposed that there be a reverter back to the Federal \nGovernment upon a determination that either the mine has been worked \nout--then the land could go back to the Federal Government.\n  So on many issues the Senator from Louisiana, as former chairman and \nranking member of the Energy Committee, and others, have worked \ntogether and I think have made accommodations. As I have indicated--the \nSenator, I think he is aware of this--that the Secretary of the \nInterior--he and I have had conversations about a willingness to try \nand work out something to resolve this issue. But clearly the position \nof the Bumpers amendment, with a moratorium, circumvents that effort. I \nthink it puts us substantially behind our goals of reaching \naccommodation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator from Alaska agree with me that the \noffer which I made on behalf of this side of the aisle and this \nadministration is still on the table? That is, any time we want to get \na reform of the 1879 mining law reform bill, based upon an end of \npatenting, 2.5 percent smelt royalty and giving away no present powers, \nthat bill can be put together at--I will not say on a moment's notice--\nbut I think very quickly.\n  I just wanted to assure my colleague that that offer is still in \nexistence.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Louisiana. Again, I do not \nthink we are that far apart in the legislative language. That is why I \nwould urge all of my friends to vote against the Bumpers amendment and \nrecognize the advancements that we are making and the fact that we will \nhave a bill before this body in the near future.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2294 to Amendment No. 2293\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me join with my colleague from Alaska who is chairman \nof the full Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the argument I \nthink he has so clearly just placed before this Senate as it relates to \na Senate bill that I introduced some months ago, S. 506, which reforms \nthe 1872 mining law, and deals with the very issue that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is attempting to deal with this evening.\n  It recognizes the patenting process which those of us who I think \nunderstand mining on public lands recognize as a clear and necessary \npart of causing private industry, be it a small miner or a large miner, \nto gain access to those properties for the purpose of mining.\n  Now, there have been a variety of other approaches argued over the \nyears. But none of them seem to work in the sense of being able to \nallow that person to have title to the property and the surface of that \nproperty so they can begin to develop a mining operation. There is no \nquestion that there are those like the Senator from Arkansas who view \nthe ability to block patents as a way to block access to the resources \nof our public lands.\n  The thing that I think most of us recognize, and clearly I recognize \nin S. 506, is that patenting was an important process. But the 1872 \nmining law bestowed that property right on an individual who had \nbrought forth a valid claim. That property right was bestowed for $2.50 \nan acre. That is obsolete.\n  And it is the $2.50-an-acre clause, if you will, provision within the \nlaw, that most people have been able to hang their hat on as an \neffective argument for saying for some reason we are simply giving away \nthe public domain, failing to recognize the millions and millions of \ndollars that has to be put on that $2.50 land for that property and \nthat resource to become productive, and as a productive resource to \nemploy people, to pay taxes, and to do the very kinds of things that \nthose of us who are guardians, if you will, of the public domain \nbelieve to be a responsible use of that resources estate.\n  So historically the surface of the land was of little value, not of \nno value, but a very limited value. And the Government in 1872--the \nGovernment today should not use the value of the land as a barrier to \ngain access to the resource below it, the mineral estate for that \nmineral being used in the economy of our country to employ people, to \nserve our industrial base, and to do all that we have always expected \nour minerals and our natural resources to do for us.\n  So, in S. 506, what I say in proposing that legislation that is \nbefore the committee is that we do fair market value. Let us take that \nissue away. Let us do not offer that argument anymore of $2.50 an acre. \nLet us deal with fair market value.\n  Well, how do we arrive at it? There is really no magical process at \nall. It is simply the standard appraisal process that the BLM would use \nin this instance of equivalent values of acreage during the patenting \nprocess to allow that title to pass for value, in this case, fair \nmarket value.\n  Now, in some Western States that might be as low as $100 an acre \nbecause that is what the surface value would go for of like lands in \nthe immediate area. And most of these lands we recognize oftentimes are \na long ways away from any private property of value to use as a \ncomparative in the appraisal process. So I think that is not a \ndifficult thing to arrive at. That is exactly what we have been trying \nto arrive at.\n  We have offered legislation in good faith. We have held a hearing. We \nhave been in negotiations. And yet this administration wants something \nsubstantially different. In most instances, they have already argued \nthey would like to prohibit mining on public lands. They no longer view \nit as a compatible use of our natural resources and, in many instances, \nthey have proposed ideas that would be so restrictive that the mining \nindustry that operates in our country today would choose not to mine \nanymore, and they would go as they are now going: Offshore to foreign \ncountries to invest their money where they can receive a much higher \nrate of return with much fewer Federal regulations with which to \ncomply.\n  I believe, and I think many Senators do believe, that public policy \nsays that mining of public resources for the value of our country, our \nmineral estate, our industrial base and for employment is a good public \npolicy. So then let us be allowed in a reasonable fashion to move \nthrough authorizing legislation to assure that that public policy \nexists.\n  We have tried to now for 4 years, and the Senator from Louisiana, \nwhen he chaired that committee last year, in good faith tried. But you \ncannot please everyone and, in many instances, those accommodations \nwere tried and simply failed, and today we believe we have a good bill. \n\n\n[[Page S 11872]]\n\n  We have sat down in good faith with the Senator from Louisiana to \nnegotiate, and I believe he has attempted to negotiate in good faith. \nYet, we have not arrived at anything, largely. Yes, the offer is still \non the table, but I can tell you in all fairness, I am tremendously \ndisappointed that the kind of offer back that we get is so penalizing \nand so restrictive to the ability to produce a viable industry on the \npublic land resource that we are trying to, in a responsible way, offer \nout to the public simply disallows us from moving forward.\n  As a result of that deleterious kind of amendment, as that offered by \nthe Senator from Arkansas, that says no more patenting, a patent \nmoratorium--in other words, shut the industry down until the Congress \ncan function, but the Congress cannot function because the Congress \ncannot agree.\n  So when you put a moratorium on patenting, you have really put a \nmoratorium on future mining, and if there is no future in future mining \nin this country, then the industrial base, the mining base of that base \nbegins to move offshore, because the resources that are being mined \ntoday in the mines that are operating today, like all mines, some day \nwill wither away, the resource is used, it is completely depleted, and \nthat mine has to close.\n  To maintain a successful industrial base and viable mining industry, \nthere always has to be a future, there has to be the ability to \nexplore, the ability to discover, the ability to claim, and the ability \nto patent, to gain the fee title to that property so that the mining \noperation can continue.\n  It is with those concerns this evening that I approach this \namendment, as we have in the past, from the Senator from Arkansas. And \nI must say in all fairness, the arguments we have heard tonight are not \nnew arguments. The arguments the Senator from Arkansas has used have \nbeen used year after year. If you cannot find new arguments, where is \nthe problem?\n  Most of us recognize that the problem did exist, the problem was \nthere, but the problem no longer exists today, largely because of this \nSenate's responsibility and concern about the environment and the \nputting of the environmental laws in place that has made the modern \nmining industry of today substantially different than it was 30 years \nago.\n  But the 30-year-old arguments still get drawn to the public eye. The \nstraw person, if you will, of this is the past and not the present. So \nnot only do we have to argue about the future, we have to convince many \nof us that the current situation is OK. I believe it is, and I believe \nthe mining industry of this country is a responsible industry that \nperforms in an environmentally sound way, complying with the Clean \nWater Act and complying with the Clean Air Act and doing what they must \ndo inside the regulatory structure that our Government, through public \npolicy formulated by this Senate, has provided. That is not at issue.\n  Then what is the problem? Why is this amendment deleterious? Why \nwould it shut down the industry? For the simple reason that it \nforecloses the opportunity of a future; it forecloses the ability of \nthe industry to go out and explore and gain patent and be able to have \nthe assurance of future resource for future development as the current \nresource grows progressively depleted.\n  It is with those concerns that tonight I offer a second-degree \namendment, and I send that to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. CRAIG. A second-degree amendment to the Bumpers amendment that \nwould require a fair market value.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, can we have the amendment read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] for himself, Mr. Reid, \n     and Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 2294 to \n     amendment No. 2293.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all the language in the amendment and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     ``SEC. (a).

Yes.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n\n          Committee Amendment on Page 128, Lines 16 through 21\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I move to table the underlying \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The underlying committee amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The underlying amendment is not before us.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, he cannot object to the request for a \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued calling the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to table \nthe committee amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Parliamentary inquiry. Will that motion to table, if it \nis accepted, take not only the committee amendment but the Bumpers \namendment and the Craig second-degree amendment with it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table will only take down the \ncommittee amendment. It would not take down the Bumpers and Craig \namendments. They would be pending after the motion to table.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, were the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They were not ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, what is now the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No 2294\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Craig amendment \nnumber 2294.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have had a fairly extensive debate on \nthis general issue of mining patents. We now have a second-degree \namendment before us in behalf of Senator Craig.\n  I wonder if I could ask the principals whether or not we could have a \nrelatively short time agreement on the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to the manager of the \nbill, perhaps 30 minutes evenly divided. I would agree to a reasonable \ntime limit as long as there is agreement on the Bumpers amendment, \nwhich has already been extensively debated. So I think we should have a \ntime agreement on both rather than just the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 30 \nminutes equally divided on the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to know whether we cannot \ndeal with the entire issue now. After the disposition of the Craig \namendment, I ask the Senator from Arkansas, does there need to be \nfurther time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have no further amendments. As I understand it, Mr. \nPresident, the parliamentary situation is that my amendment is pending; \nis that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Idaho is \npending.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me rephrase it. The second degree amendment of the \nSenator from Idaho to my amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Once his amendment is disposed of, then my amendment \nwill be pending; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I direct the question to the manager of the bill.\n  Will the manager of the bill then explain to the membership of the \nSenate what the parliamentary procedure would be if in fact the Craig \namendment is adopted?\n  Mr. GORTON. The manager of the bill is not certain he can provide \nthat explanation and will ask the Chair to correct him.\n  As the manager understands it, if the Craig amendment is passed, the \nBumpers amendment is then identical to the Craig amendment, and one \nwould presume that that would be able to pass by a voice vote. But then \nin order to have the Craig language be the language of the bill, I ask \nthe Chair, I believe the Craig amendment would then have to be further \nchanged or turned into a different form in order to be the judgment of \nthe Senate with respect to mining patents? May I make that \nparliamentary inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senate wants to go to conference on the \nCraig amendment, a subsequent amendment would have to be offered \nbecause the Craig amendment would fall with a motion to strike.\n  Mr. GORTON. But the subsequent amendment would be identical to the \npresent Craig amendment in its language?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is the hope of the manager of the bill that a single \nvote \n\n[[Page S 11874]]\non the Craig amendment will settle this issue and that by voice votes \nwe could, if it were to succeed, move to have it as a part of the bill. \nSo under those circumstances, I would hope that the unanimous consent \nrequest for 30 minutes equally divided on the Craig amendment will \nsettle this issue.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am agreeable to that, and I think that \nis almost automatic anyway, because if the Craig amendment prevails, \nthen that becomes my amendment and so we could voice vote it.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Nevada is now willing to enter into a \ntime agreement on the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be willing to enter into an \nagreement on the Craig amendment. I have been here all evening \nlistening to the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Why on Earth did the Senator vote no if he listened?\n  Mr. REID. I would ask, of the 15 minutes, I be allotted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. There has been an objection, so I will ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 30 minutes equally divided on the Craig \namendment, with 5 minutes of the proponents' time to be allocated the \nSenator from Nevada [Mr. Reid].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask that the Senator from Idaho yield the Senator \nfrom Nevada 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Nevada 5 minutes \nof our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, let us talk about patents. We \nhave argued this issue before time and time again.\n  This matter has been debated numerous times. For example, in 1992, I, \nalong with Senators Domenici, Bryan, and DeConcini, offered an \namendment which passed this body that would have established fair \nmarket value on this land that is seeking to be patented; a \nreversionary clause, meaning that if it was used for some purpose other \nthan mining, it would revert back to the Government; there was also a \nreclamation clause in the bill that passed the Senate, and a holding \nfee that passed the Senate.\n  We have tried to work this out on numerous occasions. This was killed \nin conference because they wanted to keep the issue.\n  Mr. President, let me also make sure this body understands that \npatenting is hard to obtain. It is not easy to get to the point where \nyou obtain a patent. The $2.50 is blown out of proportion, and that is \na gross understatement.\n  For example, a mining company in Nevada just announced that it was \ngiving up the land it had patented after having spent $33 million in \nattempting to arrive at a point where they could obtain that patent--\n$33 million.\n  Sometimes, Mr. President, these explorations are successful. Near the \ntown where I was raised, Searchlight, NV, Viceroy Gold, after 8 years, \nwas able to start a patent mining operation. To arrive at that point, \nwhere they could take the first shovel full of dirt out of the ground, \ncost them $80 million. I repeat, $80 million.\n  This, Mr. President, is why the Senator from Arkansas is wrong in \nsaying that patents are giveaways. If you are talking about finding out \nhow much money is under the ground in the way of minerals, you would \nhave to be some kind of a genius--which does not exist in the world. No \none knows what is under the ground, as exemplified by the company in \nNevada which just last week gave up after having spent $33 million. And \nthe company near the town of Searchlight, NV, which, before they could \ntake a single shovel full of dirt out of the ground in their operation, \nspent $80 million.\n  Mr. President, we need to keep the mining operations going throughout \nthe country. It is one of the few industries that has a favorable \nbalance of trade. We now have a favorable balance of trade in gold. But \nwhat we are doing here is we are driving them offshore like we are \ndriving many companies offshore because they are afraid of the efforts \nof people like Senator Bumpers and others that they are not going to be \nable to do business in the United States.\n  This amendment of Senator Craig is fair; it is reasonable, and it \nalso establishes that the patents now in the pipeline will have to be \nprocessed.\n  Secretary Babbitt has purposely refused to go forward with the work \non these patents. He has one person in Nevada working part time issuing \nthese patents. Therefore, none of them are issued. Judges throughout \nthe United States have said it is shameful what Secretary Babbitt is \ndoing with these patents. It is shameful. That is the word from a \nFederal judge.\n  We need to move forward with this amendment. No. 1, it would process \nthe patents that are in the chain. It would also establish a fair \nmethod on the patents that are issued. There would be a reversionary \nclause, and you would pay fair market value.\n  The Members of this Senate should vote to support a viable, strong \nmining industry to make sure it stays that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my second-degree amendment sets forth a \nvariety of solutions to a problem that has plagued this Senate and this \nCongress for several years as we have debated changing the 1872 mining \nlaw.\n  If we have heard it once, we have heard it many times from the \nSenator from Arkansas saying, ``Isn't it a crime that we are giving \nFederal land away for $2.50 an acre under this old law?''\n  Mr. President, I think we all recognize that there was, on the \nsurface of that issue and that argument, a problem. That was a fair \nmarket value for the surface of the land in 1872. It is not today. My \nsecond-degree amendment is very clear. It says that that $2.50 an acre \nnow changes to a charge of fair market value.\n  And what is that? That is a value established by the Federal agency \nin charge, the BLM in this instance, by a general appraisal method that \nthey now use to establish land values. According to a recent study \nconducted by the University of Nevada Natural Resource Industry \nInstitute, a fair market value in Nevada would range--we are talking \nsurface value now--anywhere from $100 to $250 an acre, instead of the \n$2.50 an acre.\n  The fair market value for the surface estate is not a solution to the \ntotal problem of reform that all of us have tried to achieve over the \ncourse of the last good number of years. But I would like to suggest to \nthe Senators this evening, and encourage their support for this second \ndegree, that it is a major step forward, that we are beginning to solve \nthe problem of the 1872 mining law by offering this.\n  Now, those who would argue that we ought not allow Federal land to \ncontinue to be owned in private ownership, we have provided a reverter \nclause in here that says when that property is used up, when it is no \nlonger being mined, when there is no longer a mining value or a mining \npractice going on, that land reverts back to the Government. That is a \nstrange idea. We are giving title. We are making the private individual \npay for the title. But we are doing that only for the purpose of \nmining. No more of the arguments of condominiums and no more the \narguments over development outside of the intent of the public policy \nto mine.\n  So, we have addressed that. And we have said that land would revert \nback. And that is, I think, a great achievement if this Senate can pass \nthat through to the conference and cause the Congress to deal with that \nimportant issue.\n  And then in the end we assist the Secretary, as the Senator from \nNevada spoke, in resolving his problems by giving him the extra \nresources to solve the patenting stalemate that he has currently got \ngoing on in the Department of the Interior. The Secretary today at \nbreakfast agreed that first-part patents were a property right, and he \nhad to proceed. But he was handicapped by no staff or the inability to \n\n[[Page S 11875]]\ndeal with that issue. And the third portion of this amendment would \noffer him that opportunity.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. With the utmost respect to my friend--he is my friend; \nwe have an excellent relationship on and off the floor--but, honestly, \nI do not know how anybody could make a statement about fair market \nvalue, this kind of fair market value, and keep a straight face.\n  You know what we are talking about here? We are talking about fair \nmarket value of the surface. We are talking about fair market value of \nthat 1,850 acres that Barrick paid about $9,000 for. Barrick paid \n$9,000 for 1,850 acres. That was $5 an acre, I guess. And the Senator \nfrom Idaho says he wants them to pay fair market value. Fair market \nvalue in that case would have been probably somewhere between $100,000 \nand $200,000. Big deal. There is still 11 billion dollars' worth of \ngold under the 1,850 acres.\n  A Senator came up to me a while ago and said, ``How about this Craig \namendment? He says they ought to pay fair market value.'' The only scam \nI can think of that is worse than what has been going on is to try to \nmake the Senators believe that they are paying fair market value. If \nthey were paying fair market value, they would be paying about $2 \nbillion, not $100,000--$100 an acre. Most of it is probably worth $100 \nan acre, $200 at the most.\n  You know what the western land looks like when you have grazing? They \ntell you it is not worth anything. But now they say, fair market value, \nand never bother to tell you that is just the surface. They are not \ntalking about the 11 billion dollars' worth of gold underneath that \nsurface. That is free. You do not pay for that.\n  Then they say, ``We have got a reverter clause in this amendment. We \nwill give you the mine back when we are finished with it.'' Please, for \nPete's sakes. You have already given us 59 Superfund sites back, as \nwell as thousands of other mines that are not on the Superfund list. Do \nnot, for Pete's sake, give us any more. We are liable for up to $40 \nbillion to clean up the ones we have got. And the Senator from Idaho \nsaid, ``We are going to give them all back to you when we get through \nwith them.'' Please, do not give them back to us. We cannot afford any \nmore gifts like that.\n  Unhappily, there are very few people in this body that know the \nissue. I do not know that we would do much better if they all knew it. \nWe all know what is going on here. There are people who are voting \nagainst this moratorium because they have a mining industry in their \nState. I can almost understand that. But there are a lot of Senators \nover there who do not have any mines in their State.\n  I cannot understand it. The National Taxpayers Union, the Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste--they all say this is the biggest scam going \non in America. They are all opposed to continuing this outrageous \ngiveaway of the public domain.\n  The mining industry argues that we are going to put somebody out of \nwork. Really? Why is it that Montana can charge at least 5 percent of \nthe fair market value for raw metallic minerals on State lands, but if \nwe tried to charge 1 percent on Federal lands, they are all going to \nshut down and put everybody out of work?\n  How is it that Arizona can charge 2 percent of gross value on State \nlands, but if you charge them 0.5 percent on Federal lands, they are \ngoing to shut down and put everybody out of work?\n  How is it that Utah can charge 4 percent of gross value on \nnonfissionable metalliferous minerals on Utah State lands and a 2.6 \npercent taxable value severance tax, but if you charge 1 percent for \nmining on Federal lands, they are going to shut down and put everybody \nout of work?\n  Wyoming, 5 percent of gross sales value on gold, silver and trona on \nState lands, plus a 2 percent of the minemouth value severance tax. If \nyou charge them one red cent on Federal lands, they are going to take \ntheir marbles and go home.\n  Oh, my, such cynicism, such hypocrisy while the American taxpayers \nplead for relief. We do not mind cutting Medicare $270 billion to \nprovide a tax cut. But 16 of the biggest 25 mining companies in America \nare even foreign owned. I would like to go to England and start putting \nclaims down on British-owned land and say, ``I think I will mine all \nthe minerals off this land.'' You would be in the slammer in about 3 \nminutes.\n  But here, simply because they have the political clout--everybody \nknows precisely what this debate is about. And I do not mind people \nvoting up or down and just saying, ``I don't care. I'm not going to \nvote to stop it.'' But for Pete's sakes, do not put this sham out there \nabout fair market value.\n  There is a lot of natural gas production in my State. Do you think \nthat they get a break when they mine on Federal, State, or private \nland? Of course not. They pay royalties to the landowner.\n  Look at this chart one more time: Coal, natural gas, oil, they all \npay 12.5 percent, except for underground coal, which is 8 percent. The \nmining companies, because they have the clout and control over Senators \nwhere they have operations, continue to pay nothing.\n  For 7 long, agonizing years, I have listened to that argument about \nhow we are going to work this out, we need mining law reform, but if \nyou adopt the Bumpers amendment, it is just going to thwart our \nefforts. I looked at a colleague letter that went out to every Senator \nhere, saying, ``Senator Bumpers is going to offer that old amendment \nagain and you are going to oppose it. If you adopt that old terrible \nBumpers amendment, we will never get mining law reform.''\n  I have heard that argument for 7 long, agonizing years. And we will \nhear it again next year and the next year and the next year and the \nnext year--anything to put it off. They will also continue to use \nploys, such as charging for the fair market value for the surface, to \navoid the issue. Anything to give these guys something to hang their \nhat on and go home and say to the unsophisticated voter: ``Yes, I voted \nto make them pay fair market value.'' You will never hear anything \nabout just for the surface, which is worthless.\n  Few understand the issue, one of the reasons why Congress has such a \nhigh approval rating in this country. There are a few people who know \nwhat is going on. There are a few people who will know that we are \ncutting programs for the most vulnerable, helpless people in America \nand providing corporate welfare for the biggest corporations in \nAmerica.\n  Now, if those are the kind of values you want to go home and tell \nyour folks about, be my guest. We know the die is cast. Three Senators \nwho voted with me in the past did not vote with me tonight or we would \nhave won. I do not know why they changed.\n  All I know is, I did not lose. It is nothing personal to me. The \npeople of this country lost a lot. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  I am proud to endorse the amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho. The issue of \nmining law has been before us each and every year since I have come to \nthe U.S. Senate, and each and every year, the industry is subject to \nthe usual criticism: You are not for changing the mining law of 1872. \nThis is an act of Congress that was enacted at the time that Ulysses S. \nGrant was President, and you all just simply do not want to change.\n  Mr. President, for my colleagues who are listening, there are four \nissues involved in mining law reform: Fair market value for the surface \nestate, a reasonable royalty, reclamation provisions, and a provision \nthat the land shall revert back to the Federal Government if it is no \nlonger used for mineral exploration and development purposes.\n  We agree with those changes. In the last session of the Congress, the \nSenate passed out such a bill authored by the senior Senator from Idaho \nand which I was proud to cosponsor.\n  What is at issue in this debate is jobs, good jobs for us in Nevada \nwhich \n\n[[Page S 11876]]\nproduces more gold than all of the other States combined. It is 12,000 \njobs. The average salary is $43,000 a year.\n  What is at issue for America is the loss of an industry that last \nyear recorded a 13-percent decline in mineral development and \nexploration and, correspondingly, so many of these companies are now \nmoving to Latin America where mineral exploration has more than doubled \nin the past year.\n  So what we are seeking is reason and fairness.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, there are some whose unstated \nagenda is to prevent mineral development and exploration on the public \nlands, and it is with that unreasonable element we have been unable to \nreach an accord, even though we share a common agreement that fair \nmarket value, a reasonable royalty, reclamation and reversionary \nprovisions ought to be part of the fundamental changes to the mining \nlaw of 1872.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the floor manager \nof this issue, the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes and 54 seconds left.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Alaska, the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Craig \namendment and in opposition to the Bumpers amendment. The Senate has \nrejected similar amendments in the past.\n  The amendment that we are offering, which I am proud to cosponsor, \nwould require, make no mistake about it, patent applications to pay \nfair market value for the surface estate. It is not a giveaway. It \nrequires patented land to revert back to the Federal Government if the \nland is used for anything but good-faith mining purposes. The balance \nis there; direct the Secretary of the Interior to clear all pending \npatent applications at the Department of the Interior within 2 years of \nenactment of the bill and restore the third-party mineral examination \nprogram at the Department of Interior so that the Secretary can process \nthe pending backlog of patent applications within 2 years.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake about it, patents are almost \nimpossible to get. On June 14, 1993, the BLM director, with Babbitt's \napproval, issued a BLM instruction memorandum which established an \nextremely convoluted procedure for processing patents. For example, the \napplication must be reviewed by the local BLM staff, the BLM State \ndirector, the regional solicitor, the DOI solicitor, the BLM director, \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior \nand, after that process, the application must then go back to the BLM \ndirector and, finally, back to the State BLM director.\n  A mineral examination is then conducted by a mineral examiner who \nprepares a mineral report.\n  Is this what the administration calls streamlining the Federal \nbureaucracy?\n  Our amendment will end Mr. Babbitt's de facto moratorium by requiring \nthe Secretary to move forward with processing pending patent \napplications.\n  In short, Mr. President, I believe we need to enact comprehensive \nreform. Unfortunately, Senator Bumpers is forcing us to offer a \nsolution to the patent issue on the Interior appropriations bill. We \nall know that is not where it belongs. It should be in the Energy \nCommittee.\n  Currently, my committee is considering three--three--mining law \nreform bills: The one introduced by Senator Bumpers, one introduced by \nSenators Craig and Reid and myself and S. 639, introduced by Senator \nJohnston.\n  The majority and minority have been negotiating on this issue in good \nfaith, and I am hopeful that during the coming weeks we can reach an \nacceptable compromise that I can bring before this body; that we can \ndebate fully on this floor where it belongs. Until then, as a result of \nMr. Bumpers' amendment, I believe the proper solution to the patent \nissue is to require miners to pay fair market value--fair market \nvalue--for the surface estates of future patented land.\n  Our amendment will achieve this goal, and I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to support the Craig amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time back to the floor manager, Senator \nCraig, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, does the Senator from Arkansas wish to \ncomplete his argument? Does he wish to yield back his time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I did not hear the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would offer the Senator from Arkansas the opportunity to \ncomplete his time before I close.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 48 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield back 4 minutes of that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator would wish to complete his statement, I \nwill close out the debate on my second degree. Go ahead. You have \nyielded all time back?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You first. I yielded all but 48 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Do you wish to use your 48 seconds at this time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this time be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had hoped the Senator from Arkansas, \nbecause this is my amendment, would allow me the respect of allowing me \nto close debate. But I will go ahead and close out the remainder of the \ntime that I have left.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Arkansas would choose to \nargue royalties. Royalties are not an issue before this Senate at this \nmoment. We have used the authorizing committee to attempt to resolve \nthat issue so that the Government could receive some return on the \nvalue of the subsurface asset, and we are still working on that. But \nwhat this amendment does--separate from that as a step and a process \nalong the way--is that it asks those who are asking for a patent \nthrough the process of mining law to pay fair market value for the \nland--not $2.50 an acre, but whatever the appraisal process goes \nforward as. Once that is established, once the mine completed its work, \nthe property reverts back to the Government.\n  This is not a total answer to the problem of reform of the 1872 \nmining law, but it is a step down the path toward arriving at that \nsolution. I hope my colleagues will support us in this second-degree.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if what the Senator from Idaho just said \nwere true, I would be voting with him. He said the ``fair market \nvalue.'' He did not say the fair market value of a surface. There are \nseveral billion dollars difference between what he is offering and what \nthe taxpayers of this country have a right to expect.\n  His amendment says fair market value of the surface. Well, on $50 \nbillion of the gold, $30 billion, or whatever it is underneath the \nland, you do not get that at fair market value. You get that free. That \ncomes free. His amendment gives you the surface, which is worth about \n$100 an acre, and with it comes the largess of anywhere from $15 \nbillion to $30 billion from Uncle Sam and the taxpayers of America.\n  Do not be diluted by that fair market value language.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Idaho and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Craig amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S 11877]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered on the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to vitiate the yeas and nays on the \nCraig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2294\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Craig amendment (No. 2294).\n  The amendment (No. 2294) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ted \nMilesnick, a Bureau of Land Management employee on detail to the \nInterior Subcommittee, be granted the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of the debate on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to en bloc, with the exception of the amendment on \npage 95, lines 19 to 21; the amendment on page 9, line 23; the \namendment on page 10, line 12; the amendment on page 16, line 4 through \npage 17, line 14; the amendment on page 21, line 24 through page 22, \nline 2; and the amendment on page 22, line 5 through page 23, line 19; \nand that the bill as thus amended be regarded for the purpose of \namendment as original text, provided that no point of order shall have \nbeen considered to have been waived by agreeing to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I presume the amendment \ndid not include the amendment relative to the National Endowment?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct. The Senator's ability to amend the \nNational Endowment will remain intact.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. And the museum?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2295\n\n  (Purpose: To delay implementation of the Administration's rangeland \n                            reform program)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Thomas and Senators Campbell, Burns, Kempthorne, Bennett, \nSimpson, Murkowski, Craig, Dole, Pressler, Hatch, Brown, Kyl, and \nBaucus. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \ncommittee amendment is set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Thomas, \n     for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dole, Mr. \n     Pressler, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Brown, Mr. Kyl and Mr. Baucus, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2295.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S \n                   RANGELAND REFORM PROGRAM.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this or any other \n     Act may be used to implement or enforce the final rule \n     published by the Secretary of the Interior on February 22, \n     1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 9894), making amendments to parts 4, 1780, \n     and 4100 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, to take \n     effect August 21, 1995, until December 21, 1995. None of the \n     funds made available under this or any other Act may be used \n     to publish proposed or enforce final regulations governing \n     the management of livestock grazing on lands administered by \n     the Forest Service until November 21, 1995.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, here we go again. On the 21st of this \nmonth our country's western agricultural way of life will face an \nassault unlike anything that it has faced before. On that date the \nDepartment of the Interior's rangeland reform regulations are scheduled \nto become the ``law of the land.''\n  Originally, those regulations were to go into effect on February 21. \nHowever, at that time a 6-month moratorium on their effectiveness was \ngranted. Then my good friends, Senators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig \nbegan working on balanced legislation both to codify existing \nregulations and to incorporate parts of Interior's ``Rangeland Reform'' \nregulations into a more workable plan.\n  The sponsors have made a gallant effort to enact this legislation by \nthe August deadline. However, the slow pace of Congress--we have such a \nheavy volume of legislation to consider this year--has prevented us \nfrom finishing this legislation in a timely manner.\n  In short, Mr. President, Congress needs more time--90 more days at \nleast--to do the people's work on this vitally important issue. At a \nmeeting this morning, Secretary Babbitt told me and a number of my \ncolleagues that, in effect, regardless of the fact that we are trying \nto work on definitive legislation that addresses this issue, he will \nnot grant another moratorium. So, we have no alternative but to acquire \nadditional time through legislation.\n  During this debate we may hear the opponents of this pending \nlegislation argue that additional time is not needed--that the \nInterior's regulations are \n\n[[Page S 11878]]\nfair, and will adequately address all the problems so that we need \nworry about. All I suggest that any Senators who believe this should \nask the majority of the people in my State--or virtually any other \naffected western State--who are familiar with these regulations whether \nthey are fair. If you do, you will hear a resounding and unanimous \n``no.''\n  If these regulations are indeed ``fair,'' then why has the Interior \nDepartment felt the need to embark on a mission to override public \nopinion, and to stall or even kill the Domenici legislation? As my fine \ncolleague, Senator Thomas, has pointed out, this seems to surely skirt \nthe edge of the statutory prohibition on lobbying with appropriated \nfunds. Perhaps this desperation arises out of the knowledge that they \nwill not be able to run roughshod over yet another aspect of American \nlife. Or perhaps they are concerned that their subtle but fully \ndeliberate plan to totally drive the western rancher and his or her \nlivestock off of public range lands is threatened by the Domenici bill.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to give Congress a chance \nto at least debate this issue on a stage that is free from the outside \npressures of an agency hell bent on the reckless enactment of unsound \nrules and regulations just to spite the Republican Congress. If, in the \nend, the legislation fails and the regulations go into effect, so be \nit. At least and we can then say that we have had a debate that was \nspirited, fair, and impartial and free from an agency attempting to \nfurther its own agenda.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Thomas \namendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I do not know if I am the only one \nhere with a sense of deja vu, but I for one am frustrated to find \nmyself here with my western colleagues, fighting yet again to maintain \nthe western way of life.\n  Two years ago we faced an amendment to the Interior Appropriations \nbill that would have raised grazing fees arbitrarily to a point that \nsmall ranchers would have been forced off the land. Today, we face \nregulations which will have that same effect. If unchecked, those \nregulations will go into effect in less than two weeks.\n  The Senate voted two years ago to stop those regulations. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so again. A moratorium will give Congress an \nadditional 90 days in which to assert its right to set the guidelines \nof federal policy.\n  Opponents will tell you that these regulations have had ample public \ninput and participation. It is true that the Secretary has held \nhearings across the country in the time since he first made this \nproposal, and I commend him for dedicating so much effort and time.\n  But do the final regulations reflect the input he received? I am \nconcerned that there are a few key points on which these regulations do \nnot. The public called for flexible management with a local focus. \nThese regulations allow States to chose, but from among federally \ndictated management plans.\n  The public called for clear and direct management processes, but \ninstead the regulations propose a process weighted down with increased \nreview and scrutiny. The final proposed regulations would have the \neffect of making the day to day operation on Federal land so cumbersome \nand costly that we might as well be talking about the arbitrary grazing \nfee from 2 years ago when you talk about the potential effects.\n  I asked the Secretary of the Interior just this morning whether or \nnot he wanted to see grazing on Federal lands 20 years from now * * * \nor whether he even thought that grazing belonged on Federal lands.\n  He told me that he views grazing as an integral part of the biology \nof the range. The Secretary specifically pointed out that wild, open \nspaces evolved under the hand of wildfire and wildlife, roles which \ngrazing now fills. But these regulations would stifle the individual \ninitiative which gives the west its character, and smother the efforts \nof the stewards of those Federal lands. If we let our Federal lands \nbecome wastelands, not only will 27,000 ranching families, and hundreds \nof rural communities pay the price. We will all be the poorer. This \nmust not happen.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is on another issue which \nhas from time to time been controversial with respect to grazing and \ngrazing fees.\n  The amendment is a simple 90-day moratorium on the regulations of the \nSecretary of the Interior, designed to permit the committees to come up \nwith an authorizing bill.\n  It has been agreed to and cleared on both sides.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2295) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to express to my colleagues in the \nSenate my concerns about a provision in this legislation that pertains \nto funding of our national system of fish hatcheries.\n  First, let me say that I am grateful for the actions of our \ndistinguished Chairman, Senator Gorton, in the committee mark-up of \nthis bill. The report calls for a moratorium on any possible closures \nof fish hatcheries until March of next year pending the report of a \nstudy group that will be convened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nfor the purpose of making recommendations on the future of the hatchery \nprogram.\n   Mr. President, recreational fishing is an incredible industry in our \ncountry, and in my home State of Arkansas in particular. The number of \njobs created, the amount of State and Federal taxes collected from the \nsale of lures, boats, gasoline, hotel accommodations, food, etc., are \nenormous. It is absolutely perplexing to me that an agency of our \nFederal Government would ever propose to close hatcheries without an \neconomic analysis of the impact, both to local economies and to the \nFederal treasury.\n  It is troublesome to me that an agency of our Government would \nconsider eliminating hatcheries that mitigate for damages to fishery \nresources that Federal water projects caused.\n  This legislation contains a provision to either transfer ownership or \nclose 11 Federal fish hatcheries. The Department of the Interior has \nintentions of closing additional hatcheries in fiscal year 1997. It is \ntheir intention of using the study group to define the criteria by \nwhich hatcheries would be chosen to be transferred or closed. I believe \nthis premise is wrong.\n  I understand and support our President when he attempts to reduce \nFederal spending by eliminating unnecessary and wasteful programs. \nFederal fish hatcheries are neither. It is a burden to try to \nunderstand that on the one hand we have Federal agencies, such as the \nEconomic Development Agency and the Department of Commerce, whose roles \ninvolve the creation of jobs and strengthening our economy. On the \nother hand, we have the Fish and Wildlife Service, which can take \nactions which harm or destroy jobs under the guise of budget reduction \nand mission redefinition.\n   Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that I am going to stay \ninvolved in this issue. I do not accept the premise that some \nhatcheries have to be closed, that it is inevitable. If a hatchery is \nmitigating for damages to a fishery, if the tax revenues that result \nfrom economic activity generated by recreational fishing exceed the \ncost of operating and maintaining that hatchery, then I am going to \ntake the attitude that the Federal Government has an interest in that \nhatchery. Our taxpayers paid for its construction and operation, and we \nshould not be arbitrarily closing or giving it away. We have an \nobligation to those taxpayers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in conjunction with this bill, I note \nthat the New England Holocaust Memorial Committee is building a \nmemorial to the Holocaust adjacent to the Boston National Historical \nPark. The Memorial Committee will be entering an agreement with the \nSuperintendent of the Park for maintenance of the Memorial and will be \nmaking a contribution to the Boston National Historical Park Donation \nFund. This type of cooperation is contemplated by the Historic Sites \nAct of 1935. It is a good example of the Government working with \n\n[[Page S 11879]]\nothers on behalf of an important remembrance, and I welcome this \nopportunity to commend all those involved in this worthwhile project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I want to send \nto the desk. I am offering it in behalf of myself, Senator Inouye, \nSenator McCain, Senator Campbell, Senator Kyl, Senator Simon, Senator \nDorgan, and Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the manager of the bill yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the amendment may hit the bill in \nmore than one place. I ask unanimous consent that it nonetheless be in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I inquire of the manager of the bill what he foresees \nthe work program as we proceed into the evening. It would be helpful to \nknow.\n  Mr. GORTON. That question could not possibly be more in order. I, in \nturn, was going to ask the sponsor of the amendment whether or not he \nand his cosponsors would agree to come to a time agreement on this \namendment. The majority leader does want this amendment to be completed \nand disposed of, and it will require a rollcall vote before the evening \nis over.\n  So if we can find out how long it will take to debate the amendment, \nwe can answer the question of the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to Senators who are \ninterested in the timing that we have a number of Senators on our side. \nAnd essentially we have three principal sponsors--not just this \nSenator, but Senator Inouye, who used to be chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, and Senator McCain, who is now chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, and myself.\n  We have talked about this, and we believe that we need 1 hour on this \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I then state that I doubt that the \nopponents will take an hour, but for the purpose of the amendment, I \nask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \ngoing to, of course, argue with the majority leader. He stated he wants \nto dispose of this matter. But I wonder if he would consider \nreconsidering that in view of the fact that we are looking at something \naround 11 o'clock before our vote on this amendment. I wonder if the \nmanager can speak for the majority leader in this area where we might \nhave a vote actually in the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will cut it down to 45 minutes, if that helps \nanyone.\n  Mr. President, if we are going over to the morning, I want some time \nin the morning.\n  Mr. GORTON. I do not believe we are going to go over to the morning. \nAn hour and a half equally divided is appropriate. I would recommend \nit, and I gather the majority leader would agree that after we have \ndisposed of this amendment, we may debate the next amendment, but we \nwould not vote on that until the morning.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Is there any disadvantage to just debating the amendment \ntonight and voting in the morning?\n  Mr. GORTON. The disadvantage would be that no one would be here to \nhear the debate.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I promise I will go home and watch it on the monitor, Mr. \nPresident. [Laughter.]\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2296\n\n (Purpose: To restore funding for programs within the Bureau of Indian \n                                Affairs)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator allow the clerk to report the \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we should do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for himself, \n     Mr. Inouye, Mr. McCain, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Simon, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2296.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The OFFICER.

Mr. President, the majority leader is willing to accede \nto the evident desire of most of the Members, and I would state that \nunder these circumstances, I guess we will ask for 1\\1/2\\ hours equally \ndivided this evening on the amendment, and 30 minutes equally divided \ntomorrow morning before 9:30 and a vote to occur at 9:30 in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you. In behalf of many of my colleagues, we want to \nthank the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before you leave, I have not agreed to that yet. I just \nwanted everybody to understand this is a very important amendment. This \nhas to do with the future of the Indian people in the United States and \nwhether we are going to take care of them in an ordinary, reasonable \nway or whether we are going to give them an inordinate amount of budget \ncuts. So everybody knows, it is extremely important to many of us.\n  I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Let me, Mr. President, make my announcement in the form \nof a unanimous-consent agreement and add to that that no other \namendments be in order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is that request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that \nthere is a unanimous-consent request that there is 1\\1/2\\ hours of \ndebate this evening equally divided between each side and that there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate in the morning equally divided prior to \nthe time of 9:30 a.m. and that no other amendments are in order during \nthe pending of the amendment.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized by the majority leader to \nsay there will be no further votes this evening and the first vote \ntomorrow will be at 9:30 in the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I have been told more \nthan one time as we move through a budget, as we move through \nappropriations, that we have a very important function as Senators, and \nthat is to set priorities. When you are cutting budgets and restraining \nGovernment, it does not mean that you treat everything alike and that \nyou say everything gets cut an equal amount. The purpose for our being \nhere is to establish some kind of priority based upon either our \ncommitments or what we think is most important.\n  Mr. President, I happen to come from a State--it is not a large one \nin terms of population. But 10 percent of the people in the State of \nNew Mexico are native American Indians. We have 18 of the small \ngroupings called Pueblo Indians. We have 19 Pueblos, two Apaches, and \none-third of the Navajo Nation. So we have 10 percent of our population \nthat are and have been directly related to and to a great extent \ndependent upon the Federal Government.\n  There are many who will say theyshould not be so dependent. But, Mr. \n\n[[Page S 11880]]\n\nPresident, it is our law that says they are entitled to their tribal \nways. We have treaties with them with reference to their ownership and \nwhat we are entrusted to do for them. And we have over a long period of \ntime helped them with their government, the ordinary functions of \nIndian government. They do not levy any taxes. That is the way it has \nbeen for a long, long time.\n  We have decided only one time in modern history to try to change this \nrelationship, one of trust and treaties. We tried for a little tiny \npiece of history--2 years--to say we do not want to have this kind of \ntreaty relationship. Let us go ahead and assimilate the Indian people. \nAfter 2 years, we decided we had made a mistake, and we went back to \ntreaties and the trust relationship between the National Government and \nthe Indian people.\n  Now, I am not here saying that works perfectly well and that \neverything is great in Indian country. What I am suggesting is that my \nState is a perfect example of what is wrong with this bill that is \nbefore us. I will be the first to say Senator Slade Gorton, as chairman \nof this subcommittee, with Senator Byrd as the ranking member, has done \nan excellent job with the resources they have. But I think they make \none glaring mistake. Frankly, there may be some who will say the budget \ndid not give us enough money. Well, that may be the case, but we did \nnot assume in the budget resolution which passed this Senate that we \nwere going to cut Indian programs. We said they are of the highest \npriority, and we assumed they would be funded at the 1995 level for \nmany reasons. This Senate voted for that.\n  In my State, there are all those Indian governments that are entitled \nto a direct relationship as tribal governments to the U.S. Government. \nThe State of New Mexico does not run the government in the Isleta \nPueblo or Navajo country. The Indian people run it. We have a Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, and if ever we could find a way to make it more \nresponsive, we ought to do that.\n  What happened in this bill--and I know my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the subcommittee, will talk about Indian \nprograms being reduced by 8 percent, and that is treating them as well \nas any other programs within the Interior Department of the United \nStates.\n  The truth of the matter is that the only way you can get to that 8 \npercent is if you put the Indian Health Service and other Indian \nprograms that are not within the Department of Interior into that mix.\n  Behind me is a chart, and it simply shows the Department of \nInterior--forget about Indian health which is another part of \nappropriations--which has the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and \nWildlife, Natural Resources Science Agency, National Park Service, and \nso on. Just look at that, and what it will tell you very plain and \nsimple is that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is 26.6 percent of the \nDepartment of Interior.\n  Mr. President, 26.6 percent of the Department of Interior is Indian \naffairs--27 percent. Now, just follow that line over a little bit and \nat what percent did they take of a cut in the Department of Interior? \nIt is 45.6.\n  Let me repeat that. That is plain and simple. This is a colored pie \nchart. It is the Department of Interior--not Indian health, the entire \nDepartment of Interior, and the white is 27 percent Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. However, when it comes to cutting the Department of Interior, \nin this chart, it has been cut 45.6 percent.\n  Now, Mr. President, this part of Indian assistance and Indian \nprograms that is being cut is all of Indian governance. It is how they \ngovern their people on a daily basis. It is how they provide policemen \nand jails, how they provide juvenile courts, and all the things that an \nIndian government, like ours, should provide for its people.\n  We just cannot say, well, let them go raise taxes or do something \nelse. It just does not happen that way. They will not have any money \nfor these things. That is not an 8-percent cut. In the Department of \nInterior the Bureau of Indian Affairs is getting cut 45.6 percent when \nthey only make up 27 percent of the Department of Interior budget. That \nis not right.\n  Now, there are only two ways to fix it. One is to say, well, let us \nhave a lot more money for the Department of Interior, and then we will \nsay ``and give some of that to the Indian people.''\n  But that is not going to happen, and I am not here asking that it \nhappen. There is not going to be more money dropped in from Heaven, nor \nwill the Appropriations Committee find it and send it over to this \nsubcommittee.\n  So the only other thing we can do is say what are we going to put \nfirst. You prioritize. What are we going to put first? The Indian \npeople and their daily lives and the ability to live a reasonably \nnormal life with law enforcement, with some juvenile courts, with some \nof the things that you just have to have to stay alive. Or are we going \nto say to them you are just going to have to do without for the rest of \nthis Department, made up of the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. \nGeological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Biological \nService, Minerals Management Service, and the Office of the Secretary, \nto be funded. We must decide that we will put the Indian people on a \nhigher priority than those Interior Department line agencies of the \nFederal Government.\n  You choose, Senators. Do you want to fund Fish and Wildlife at what \nwe would suggest, $30 million less out of a $511 million budget, or do \nyou want to cut the Indian programs 45.6 percent? Which do you want? \nWhich is fair?\n  I submit what is fair is to put some money back into the Indian \nprograms that I have described and take it out ofline agencies of the \nFederal Government, which I believe under any stretch of the \nimagination should be second position to a primary responsibility to \nthe Indian people and the trusts that we have with them.\n  So we have suggested plain and simple that we not put all the money \nback that was taken out because we cannot afford it. So we are \nsuggesting that we put back $200 million and the budget authority that \ngoes with that.\n  These programs that I am referring to here have actually been cut \n$270 million. We are going to put $200 million back, and we are taking \nit out of the agencies that I have just described.\n  We are going to hear that we just cannot do that to Fish and \nWildlife; we cannot do that to the U.S. Geological Survey; and we are \ngoing to be told they have already been cut.\n  Mr. President, they have not been cut the amount that the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs programs for our Indian people have been cut.\n  So we are suggesting that when we are finished we take $46 million \nout of the Bureau of Land Management, leaving a total of $519 million; \nthat we take $30 million out of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, leaving \n$467 million; that we take $45 million out of the National Biological \nService, leaving $100 million; Mineral Management Service, $55 million, \nleaving $157 million, and the Office of the Secretary, $7 million out \nof a total fund for his office, leaving $51 million.\n  What do we choose? Do we choose to cut those departments, those parts \nof the Department of Interior, or do we say to the Indian people you \ntake the cuts; you take a 45.6-percent cut in these programs that \naffect the daily lives of the poorest people in America.\n  I am sure Senator McCain will offer us a glimpse of the kind of \npeople we are talking about, their status in life, what they are up \nagainst, what they cannot afford, what they do not have. I believe the \nSenate, in its ultimate wisdom and fairness, will say we had better \ntake care of the treaty relationships, the trust relationships that we \nhave with the Indian people across this land and the Indian people in \nmy State.\n The Indian programs represent 27 percent of total Department of \nInterior funding. If the committee bill is adopted, BIA will suffer 45 \npercent of all of the Interior reductions in this bill. I do not think \nthat is fair when many others are getting cut 8 percent, 9 percent, 7 \npercent, and even a couple are not getting cut at all.\n\n  I yield--how much time does Senator McCain want?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator McCain 15 minutes, then Senator \nInouye.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank my friend from New Mexico for this \namendment. It is a very important one. And I suggest to my colleagues \nthat this amendment has more impact than any that I know of that we \nwill address \n\n[[Page S 11881]]\n\nthis year or perhaps for years to come. Because if the Domenici \namendment is rejected, it will reflect the words of the great Indian \nlegal scholar, Felix S. Cohen, who wrote in 1953:\n\n       Like the miner's canary, the Indian marks the shift from \n     fresh air to poison gas in our political atmosphere; and our \n     treatment of Indians, even more than our treatment of other \n     minorities, reflects the rise and fall in our democratic \n     faith.\n\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, that if we reject the Domenici \namendment, it will reflect a fall in our democratic faith and an \nabrogation of our obligations, solemnly undertaken and solemnly \nviolated throughout the history of this country.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici covered, I think, the appropriations \nsituation. I have been doing a little research on our relations with \nthe Indians. And I would like to quote from the Congressional Record of \nFebruary 14, 1854, the remarks of Mr. Sam Houston, who represented the \nState of Texas. He talks about a visit of Cherokee Indians to our \nNation's Capital. He says:\n\n       They presented themselves in Washington city under the \n     auspices of the superintendent, and I was directed by the \n     President of the United States, or by the Secretary of War, \n     to attend at the Executive mansion upon a certain day--in \n     1818--I think, in March.\n       Upon the Indians presenting themselves to the President of \n     the United States, he made a few remarks to them; told them \n     he was desirous to hear what they had to say to him; that \n     they had come a great distance to see their Great Father; \n     that he had understood from the agent they had important \n     communications to make and favors to ask, and that he was \n     prepared to hear them with the greatest consideration. They \n     represented in detail pretty much what I have given as the \n     history of their tribes, and the circumstances under which \n     they had become located in the far West. The President, after \n     hearing all they had to say upon the subject, gave a reply, \n     in which he assured them of the constancy, friendship, and \n     protection of the Government of the United States; the \n     consideration to which they were entitled from the fact of \n     their having emigrated west of Arkansas at the suggestion of \n     the President, and assured them that it entitled them to the \n     most favorable consideration of this Government. He told \n     them, you are now in a country where you can be happy; no \n     white man shall ever again disturb you; the Arkansas will \n     protect your southern boundary when you get there. You will \n     be protected on either side; the white man shall never again \n     encroach upon you, and you will have a great outlet to the \n     West. As long as water flows, or glass grows upon the earth, \n     or the sun rises to show your pathway, or you kindle your \n     camp fires, so long shall you be protected by this \n     Government, and never again removed from your present \n     habitations.\n\n  Mr. President, Sam Houston went on to say:\n\n       I need not rehearse to gentlemen who are familiar with the \n     past, the tragedies that followed, the sanguinary murders and \n     massacres, the midnight conflagrations--these attest the \n     inharmonious action which arose from this faithless conduct \n     on the part of the Government or its agents. I know this may \n     appear a very harsh assertion to make here, that our \n     Government acts in bad faith with the Indians. I could ask \n     one question that would excite reflection and reminiscences \n     among gentlemen. When have they performed an honest act, or \n     redeemed in good faith a pledge made to the Indians? Let but \n     a single instance be shown, and I will be prepared to \n     retract. I am not making a charge against the Government of \n     the United States which is not applicable to all civilized \n     Governments in relation to their aboriginal inhabitants. It \n     is not with the intention to derogate from the purity of our \n     national character or from the integrity of our institutions \n     that I make the accusation; but it is because it is verified \n     by history.\n\n  Mr. President, we made a treaty with the Apache in 1852.\n  Article 10:\n\n       Foreign consideration of the faithful performance over all \n     the stipulations herein contained by the said Apache Indians, \n     the government of the United States shall grant such Indians \n     the donations, presents and implement and adopt such other \n     liberal and human governors as said government may deem and \n     meet proper. Apache Indians shall not be held responsible for \n     the conduct of others and that the government of the United \n     States shall so legislate an act to secure the permanent \n     prosperity and happiness of said Indians.\n\n  That was an 1852 treaty.\n  Mr. President, there are lots of other treaties that I have read. So \nwhy do we not look for a minute at the condition of native Americans?\n  The chart, please, on tuberculosis, diabetes and alcoholism. American \nIndian families live below the poverty line at rates nearly three times \nthe national average. Nearly one of every three native Americans lives \nbelow the poverty line. One-half of all Indian children on reservations \nunder the age of 6 are living in poverty.\n  On average, Indian families earn less than two-thirds the incomes of \nnon-Indian families. As these statistics indicate, poverty in Indian \ncountry is an everyday reality that pervades every aspect of Indian \nlife. In this country we pride ourselves on our ability to provide \nhomes for our loved ones. But in Indian country a good, safe home is a \nrare commodity.\n  There are approximately 90,000 Indian families in Indian country who \nare homeless or underhoused. Nearly one in five Indian homes on the \nreservation are classified as severely overcrowded. One-third are \novercrowded. One out of every five Indian homes lacks adequate plumbing \nfacilities. Simple conveniences that the rest of us take for granted \nremain out of the grasp of many Indian families.\n  Indians suffer from diabetes at 2\\1/2\\ times the national rate. \nIndian children suffer the awful effects of fetal alcohol syndrome at \nrates far exceeding the national average. Perhaps most shocking of all, \nIndian youth between the age of 5 and 14 years of age commit suicide at \ntwice the national rate. The suicide rate for Indians between the ages \nof 15 and 24 is nearly three times the national rate.\n  Mr. President, I cannot justify those numbers. I cannot account for a \nlot of it. I would like to look at just this chart here that shows the \npercent of related children under 6 with income below the poverty line \nin 1989. In the United States it is about 20 percent; at the Pine Ridge \nOglala Reservation, 73 percent. At the Quileute Reservation in the \nState of Washington, it was 81 percent. At San Carlos Apache--they were \nthe best off--they were 69 percent.\n  Mr. President, these cuts are harsh. They are disproportionately \ndeep, as the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out. Forty-seven \npercent of the cuts proposed are applied to Indian programs, Indian \nprograms. Yet in fiscal year 1995, Indians account for 27 percent of \nthe total Interior Department budget.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out another aspect here. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico, my dear friend from Hawaii, and I have worked on these \nissues of native Americans for many years. It does not get a lot of \nattention. I have never seen a headline about an Indian issue unless it \nwas the tragedy at Wounded Knee. I have never seen people write or call \nparticularly about native American issues, although since Indian gaming \nhas been on the rise, it certainly has gotten a lot of attention.\n  But I have to say in all candor, Mr. President, I have not seen a lot \nof Americans who are concerned about the fact that 80 percent of the \nchildren at the Quileute Reservation are below the poverty line. And \nwhat the Senator from Hawaii, as chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and I and the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, have tried to do, with help from others, is we have \ntried to emphasize that we believe the answer is Indian self-\ndetermination and Indian self-governance. Ten cents out of every dollar \nfrom the Bureau of Indian Affairs actually ends up in the pocket of an \nIndian.\n  Our entire effort literally has been to respect these treaties, these \ntreaties that I just read that treat native Americans in a government-\nto-government relationship and give the money to the tribes to dispose \nof as they see best for the members of these tribes.\n  Where do the majority of these cuts come from? Exactly those \nprograms. Exactly those programs that we have been trying to push all \nthese years.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what is going to happen to native \nAmericans if we implement these cuts. I guess they will survive. I \nguess there will be the kind of situations that we have seen throughout \nthe last 200-some years of our Nation's history. I guess there will be \nhigher fetal alcohol syndrome rates, higher suicide rates, more \nhomelessness. There are places on reservations in my State where Indian \npeople already live in holes in the ground. I am not sure that those \nholes could be much worse.\n  But I do know that over the last approximately 10 years, we have seen \nimprovements in the Indian country. We \n\n[[Page S 11882]]\n\nhave seen it for a broad variety of reasons, including educated native \nAmericans assuming positions in their government, including a better \nand perhaps more understanding treatment on the part of the Federal \nGovernment and the Congress.\n  But if these cuts are enacted, I have no doubt--and I speak from 12 \nyears of dealing with native American issues--I have no doubt that \nconditions will rapidly become far more appalling and disgraceful than \nthey are today.\n  Felix Cohen, I think, said it far better than I could: The gauge of \nhow we view our society is directly related to our treatment of native \nAmericans.\n  There is not a powerful lobby of native Americans in Washington. \nThere is not a lot of impact of even the native American gaming tribes. \nPeople who come to Washington from time to time and visit Senator \nInouye, me, Senator Domenici, they cannot understand why it is that, \nwhen their forefathers signed a solemn treaty with our Government, that \nwe find it impossible to find it in us to provide them with what we \npromised them.\n  Relations between the aboriginal tribes, as was stated by Sam \nHouston--although I would not use those words--but no doubt the \nrelations between native Americans and non-Indians have been complex, \nand the reasons why some of the things have happened are not entirely \nthe fault of the non-Indians.\n  But I suggest to you, Mr. President, that somewhere in our zeal to \ncut the budget, to reduce this $5 trillion debt that we have laid on \nfuture generations of Americans, I think we have forgotten our \nobligations. Should there be reductions in Indian programs? Yes, should \nit be to the tune of 28 percent of their programs? I do not think so.\n  I believe that what we do in our vote tomorrow around 9:30 will \ndetermine to a significant degree how history judges this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will look at this amendment in that \nfashion and that we will support the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Inouye wants 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, 200 years ago when our Founding Fathers \nwere engaged in the formation of this great Nation of ours, they gave \nmuch thought to the relationship of the new country and Indian Nations. \nAnd if one should read the debates of the Continental Congress and look \nat the Constitution, you will note that our Founding Fathers recognized \nthe sovereignty of the Indian tribes and reserved for the Congress of \nthe United States plenary authority over the conduct of relations with \nIndians.\n  Sometime later, following the so-called Indian wars, this Nation of \nours entered into treaties with Indian Nations. We, Members of the U.S. \nSenate, are responsible for ratification of these treaties. History \nshows that there were 800 treaties entered into between the Presidents \nof the United States, representing our country, and the heads of the \nNations of Indians.\n  Of the 800 treaties, Mr. President, history tells us that 430 were \nignored by this body--they are still in the files--370 were ratified, \nand of those 370, every one was violated. We have a perfect score.\n  These treaties, as my colleagues from New Mexico and Arizona have \nstated, were eloquent documents. They spoke of the sun rising in the \neast and setting in the west, and when the waters flow from the \nmountains to the rivers, for as long as this happens, this land is \nyours. And these treaties promised the Indians 550 million acres. The \ncircumstances of history now cause the remainder of 15. What happened \nto the 500 million acres?\n  But for these treaties, these Indians made a downpayment to our \ncountry. They paid for their health, education and their survival.\n  One would think that after such treatment that they would hate this \ncountry. To the contrary, Mr. President. In 25 days, the people of this \nNation will pause briefly to observe the end of World War II. On \nSeptember 2, 50 years ago, the Japanese surrendered. I think we should \nrecall that in all the wars of this century, on a per capita basis, \nmore native American Indians put on the uniform of the United States \nGovernment than any other ethnic group. More of them stood forward and \nsaid, ``We are willing to shed our blood and give up our lives for the \npeople of the United States.''\n  So these people have paid their dues. The ceding to this Nation of \ntheir lands, this whole Nation, represents an unprecedented and still \nunequaled consideration for the obligations that this Government of \nours assumed for the protection of lands and resources, provision of \nhealth care, education and the guarantee of permanent homelands.\n  It is this prepayment in the form of lands which present-day value \nfar exceeds the national debt and the commitments that were made in \nexchange for these lands that are so easily either forgotten or \ndiscounted in contemporary times when there are competing priorities \nfor diminishing resources.\n  But as my colleagues from New Mexico and Arizona have stated, ours is \nmuch more than a moral obligation, as the U.S. Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly and consistently underscored over the years. Ours is no less \nthan a legal obligation of the highest order,\n for their is no other group of American citizens for whom the United \nStates has assumed a trust responsibility or legal relationship of this \nspecial nature. There is also no other group of Americans that have \nbeen forcibly removed from their aboriginal homelands and placed on \nreservations on some of the most desolate lands in the country. And \nthere is probably no other group of Americans whose lives are more \ndirectly affected by the actions and inactions of our Government.\n\n  We are not here to undo the history of misery and deception. But we \nare hoping that, by the action of this Senate, we will not compound \nthis history. I just hope that my colleagues will join my distinguished \nfriends from Arizona and New Mexico to, in some small manner, undo some \nof the wrongs that we have committed.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona cited important statistics. \nThe managers of this bill will undoubtedly tell the Senate that, \noverall, Indian programs were cut by only 8 percent. There are two \nmajor accounts. One is the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the other the \nIndian Health Service. In the Indian Health Service, for very good \nreason, they increase the amount not to the amount the administration \nrecommended, which was much more, but nevertheless increased it, \nbecause the health statistics are such that even a Third World country \nwould be embarrassed to repeat them.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I stand before you, Mr. President, embarrassed to \nrecite these numbers. The mortality rate from tuberculosis among \nIndians is 400 times the national average; the mortality rate from \nalcoholism is 332 times the national average; the diabetes-associated \nmortality rates among the Indians are 139 times the national average; \nthe mortality rate from pneumonia and influenza is 44 times the \nnational average; and as my friend from Arizona indicated, the \nmortality rate from suicide exceeded the national average by 28 \npercent.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Alaska on three occasions. On two of \nthese occasions, I went beyond the Arctic circle. There was one village \nthat I was not able to visit because I was told by the authorities that \nthis village was quarantined because 92 percent of the citizens of that \nvillage had hepatitis. This is in the United States, Mr. President. I \nwas also told that, in Alaska, for young men between the ages of 20 and \n23, the suicide rate was 14 times the national average.\n  Something is wrong. We must do something to bring down these \nstatistics. Quite recently, as chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, I visited Indian land, and I was horrified to see the health \nconditions. In a clinic, I saw an x ray machine. I looked at the \nmachine, and this was a World War II vintage x ray machine. I called \nupon the U.S. Army to look around their inventory to see if they had \nany spare ones and, yes, they had a few spare ones, so they took it to \nthis clinic. But then they called me back and said, ``We cannot install \nthis because the room there \n\n[[Page S 11883]]\nis not appropriately guarded by lead walls.'' In this clinic, an x ray \nmachine was operating next to the dental clinic with just a one-inch \nwall separating the two rooms. I am just wondering how many children \nwho got dental treatment there are now suffering from x ray radiation.\n  Mr. President, there are many more statistics, but I find it very \ndifficult to go through them because it is painful. But I hope that in \nour vote we will try to undo some of this pain and misery. We owe the \nIndians. They paid for this.\n  My final thought: Anthropologists tell us that at the time of the \ncoming of Columbus, there were approximately 50 million Indians living \nin what we now call the 48 States. At the end of the Indian wars, just \nprior to the treaty period, there remained in the 48 States \napproximately 250,000. We nearly succeeded in wiping out the Indians. \nIf we do not amend this measure, we may succeed.\n  So, Mr. President, let us not compound the misery we have thrown upon \nthe Indians. Let us, for once, do what is right and support this \namendment.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this amendment, which was \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, I rise in strong \nsupport of the effort to restore funding to critical tribal government \naccounts.\n  Mr. President, I want to refer for a moment to the Budget Committee's \nreport on the budget resolution because I believe it goes directly to \nthe heart of the issue at hand:\n\n       The Committee recognizes the unique trust relationship \n     between the U.S. government and the nation's Indian tribes \n     and pueblos. That trust relationship is based upon a \n     government-to-government principle embodied in treaties and \n     subsequent actions by both the Executive and Legislative \n     Branches of Government, and the courts. The Committee \n     acknowledges this trust relationship, and assumes that \n     programs serving Native Americans through the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs will be given priority consideration for \n     ongoing federal support.\n\n  I want to emphasize a few points made by our Budget Committee, \nbecause we are not talking just about shifting priorities within an \nappropriations bill--although the Appropriations Committee has every \nright to do that. We are talking about something more fundamental: A \ntrust relationship which finds its roots in treaties, and in actions \ntaken by the President, the Congress, and the courts. It is a trust \nrelationship that the Senate acknowledged when it passed the budget \nresolution back in May, and that did not go unnoticed among Indian \npeople. Indian people looked to the budget resolution as an indication \nof Congress' commitment to their needs and concerns. We ought to affirm \nwhat we said just 3 months ago in the budget resolution and pass the \nDomenici amendment today.\n  Mr. President, the reductions the committee has proposed affect one \nof the most vulnerable populations in the country. The committee bill \nwould cut funding for basic governmental and social service programs on \nIndian reservations, including child abuse prevention and tribal court \nenhancement programs. These are programs that should be funded first, \nnot cut first.\n  The poverty rate on the Pascua Yaqui Reservation in Arizona is in \nexcess of 62 percent. More than 33 percent are unemployed. The poverty \nrate on the Gila River Indian community is more than 64 percent. More \nthan 30 percent are unemployed. On the Navajo Reservation, unemployment \nis more than 30 percent and 56 percent live in poverty. The figures are \nstaggering and they go on and on.\n  These are communities that need more help, not less. At the very \nleast, funding for essential services should not be reduced.\n  This amendment changes priorities; it does not add to the deficit or \nimpede progress toward a balanced budget. The additional spending on \nIndian programs would be fully offset by cuts in our Interior \nDepartment accounts. All we are saying here is that Indian programs are \nof higher priority.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Domenici \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes, 42 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. And for the proponents of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. I would be remiss \nif I did not thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for the Indian \nhealth portion of this bill because, essentially, there is no other \nhealth care for the Indian people if it is not Indian health. They have \nat least seen to it that the Indian Health Service is not being cut. I \nthank them personally for that. We have had very serious problems with \nthis administration about Indian health.\n  One final comment. If you look just at the Department of the \nInterior, not Indian health, just the Department of the Interior, you \nwill find that the Indian programs therein were cut 45.6 percent, and \nthat is the issue we are talking about. BIA represents 27 percent of \nthe total funding within the Department of the Interior, but it was cut \n45.6 percent in this bill. Overall, Indian programs were not cut that \nmuch when you include the Indian Health Service and other Indian \nprograms in this bill. We are not even restoring all of that funding in \nthis amendment.\n  I do not believe the Indian people are going to make it through the \nnext winter and the next summer if they are cut this much in their \ndaily programs for justice, juvenile homes, the day-to-day government \nthat each of the tribes and pueblos have. For that reason, I am very \nworried, and that is why I brought the amendment to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington wish to use \nhis time in opposition?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I find much not only to commend but to \nagree with in the eloquent statements of my three colleagues from New \nMexico, Arizona, and Hawaii. I most particularly want to agree with the \nopening statements of the Senator from New Mexico with respect to the \nfact that this bill, as is the case with every other bill, must set \npriorities, and that it would be entirely inappropriate simply to take \nevery program funded in 1995 and reduce it by an identical percentage.\n  This is particularly difficult in connection with the appropriations \nfor the Department of the Interior, because more, perhaps, than most \nothers, we, the Congress, are the sole source of moneys--or almost the \nsole source of moneys for many of the programs which are included \nwithin the Department.\n  Because this Department, together with the Forest Service, owns and \nmust manage for all practical purposes, all of the real property of the \nUnited States. We are not dealing with a responsibility that we can \nlightly brush off or abandon.\n  However, I part company with my friend from New Mexico and my other \nopponents on this side when they paint the type of picture that they \npresented about reductions in the appropriations for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  The appropriations for that Bureau amount, Mr. President, to only \none-third of all of the moneys devoted to Indian programs in this \ncountry. It is almost as if during the debate earlier today on welfare \none of these Senators had said, ``You are reducing aid to those most \nneedy in our society by cutting AFDC by a given percent,'' and ignoring \nMedicaid, other forms of health care, food stamps, and all of the other \npanoply of social programs.\n  It is almost like saying if we cut the appropriations for the U.S. \nArmy by one-third we would be reducing the defense budget by one-third. \nThat simply, Mr. President, is not the picture.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has pointed out that we did not only not \nreduce or cut the Indian Health Service, in fact, it is, I believe, the \nonly program of significant size in this entire budget bill that has an \nincrease as modest as it is, and that the education programs which fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of this committee are kept almost dead even.\n  When we deal with the Indian programs that are within the \njurisdiction \n\n[[Page S 11884]]\nof this committee, the reduction is 8 percent from what was \nappropriated after the rescissions bill for Indian programs, a smaller \nreduction, Mr. President, than the overall loss in the bill, which is \n11 percent. With few exceptions, every other program in this bill \nalready has a greater reduction than the Indian programs covered by \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, even that does not approach the amount of money \nappropriated for Indian or for Native American affairs, because this \nbill itself accounts for only two-thirds of those moneys.\n  If we look at the President's budget, because these other \nappropriations bills have not yet passed, the President's budget \nincludes $356 million in the Department of Agriculture, $20 million in \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, $5 million in the Department of Commerce, \n$470 million in the Department of Education, $214 million in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, $485 million in the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, $4 million in the Department of \nJustice, $200 million in the Department of Transportation, and $85 \nmillion in the Environmental Protection Agency, for a total of $1.842 \nbillion.\n  Now, if you were to add that figure, even discounted to the total in \nthe Department of Interior, we would end up with an overall reduction \nfor Indian programs of approximately 5 percent.\n  Mr. President, there are going to be few, if any, other proposals on \nthe domestic side of this budget this year which are not hit harder \nthan this one hits.\n  Mr. President, we can deal with this question as a matter of internal \npriorities or I suppose we can deal with this question from a deeper \nphilosophical level of the impact of all of these programs.\n  The Senator from Arizona spoke of the goals of Indian policy as being \nself-determination and self-governance.\n  Now, nothing in this bill undercuts the right of self-determination \nor of self-governance.\n  The third phrase that the Senator from Arizona missed was \nindependence--an ending of a dependency more than a century long on \nprograms of this nature.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I heard you say nothing in this bill in any \nway infringes upon Indian self-determination and governance; do you \nremember your exact words?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, would it not strike you if you take 27 percent \nof the money that is used to run the Indian governments day by day, \nthat whether you have substantively or policywise changed the \nrelationship or not you have made it so they cannot function?\n  Mr. GORTON. My answer to that question is a very simple answer.\n  The Senator from New Mexico as the chairman of the Budget Committee \ndoes not feel that by reducing the President's budget for all of the \nactivities of the Federal Government by many billions of dollars, he \nreduces the ability of the American people to self-government or self-\ndetermination.\n  The ability of these tribes to govern themselves is not affected by \nthe amount of money they are given by us.\n  Continuing, the third self which the Senator from Arizona omitted and \nthe Senator from New Mexico omitted, is self-sufficiency. Other local \ngovernments in the United States are primarily responsible for \nfinancing the activities in which they engage.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico so eloquently said, Indian tribes do \nnot levy taxes on their Members. This is not a function of poverty. \nThey do not levy taxes on those who are doing well. These programs, the \nother programs which I have outlined, provide housing--not provided to \nmost other Americans --provide health care without any contribution--\nnot provided to most other Americans. This entire panoply of \nactivities. I know because I have heard these debates before, and a \nmajor goal of these policies is to create a degree of self-sufficiency.\n  Yet, earlier in the debate over this bill when we asked that there be \nsome kind of means testing for the distribution of money from the \nBureau of Indian Affairs to tribes that would reflect the fact that \nsome have incomes from natural resources and some have income from \ngambling, that proposition was anathema to those on the Committee on \nIndian Affairs. Because that was a substantive decision, we abandoned \nit.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing on which we all agree, it can \ncertainly be the proposition that the policies so eloquently defended \nhere by my three colleagues have clearly not even begun us on the road \nto self-sufficiency.\n  It is strange how many different hats we can wear and not relate \nthose subjects to one another. Until 4 o'clock this afternoon we were \ndebating welfare reform. While there are profound differences among \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, I think within the membership on \neach side of the aisle, one of the areas on which I heard no \ndifferences between the two parties even was the proposition that \nwelfare should be temporary; that for many or most people there should \nnot be more than 5 years, with certain exceptions during which \nindividuals were entitled to welfare programs.\n And yet these programs, these programs are all forever. They are all \nforever. The psychology that people should be encouraged to engage in \nindividual self-determination and self-sufficiency is absolutely \nabsent.\n\n  While it really is not an appropriate part of this debate, which is \nonly on an appropriations bill and not on substance, it would seem to \nme that, as we are required to examine what a national welfare system \nhas done to the people who are its supposed beneficiaries, it is long \npast time that we should examine whether or not a system of permanent \ndependency on the Federal Government--what kind of effect it has had on \nits so-called beneficiaries and whether or not many of these \npathologies are not contributed to by the very programs that are being \ndefended here.\n  But, as I say, that is not necessarily appropriate for this debate. \nWhat is appropriate for this debate are really two factors. One, Indian \nprograms taken as a whole have not only not been singled out for \ndiscriminatory treatment, they have been treated considerably more \ngenerously than other programs within this appropriations bill. And \nwhen we add to them appropriations which will inevitably come through \nother appropriations bills not dealt with so far, they will end up \noverall being fairly close to even.\n  So, to concentrate on one line in this proposal, for one significant \nbut not overwhelming part of the way in which this Government \nsubsidizes Indian individuals and Indian tribes, is to be disingenuous \nif we are to look at the degree of support which is being provided to \nthis group of citizens in the United States. It is, in comparison with \nthe budget which has been provided for us by the Senator from New \nMexico, extremely generous.\n  Now, where does the money come from? This is a big amendment in this \nbill. This is $200 million to be placed back in the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs so that, overall, Indian activities within this bill are almost \nheld even while everything else goes down very, very significantly.\n  Mr. President, if we ended up with a bill that went to the President \nand was signed by the President with these reductions in it, what would \nhappen to the responsibilities we have for the property that is held, \neffectively, in trust for all of the people of the United States, in \nour National Park System and our wildlife refuges, by our Bureau of \nLand Management?\n  Mr. President, I do not have to guess as to that. These organizations \nhave told us what will take place. I can simply read with respect to \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service. Our bill includes $41 million less for \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service than the President's requested level. \nThis $30 million reduction, according to the Service itself, would shut \ndown or dramatically scale back major operating programs that benefit \nall Americans.\n  With a cut of this magnitude, Fish and Wildlife would have to close \nas many as 50 heavily visited national wildlife refuges: two in the \nState of Alaska, Kenai and Tetlin; one in Arizona, White River in \nFelsenthal, AR; Sacramento and San Francisco Bay, California; four in \nthe State of Florida; Okefenokee in Georgia; Crab Orchard \n\n[[Page S 11885]]\nin Illinois; Desoto on Walnut Creek in Iowa; Quivera and Kirwin in \nKansas; Sabine and Cameron Prairie and Tensas, in Louisiana; Minnesota \nValley in Minnesota; two in Mississippi; two in Missouri; two in \nMontana, two in Nevada; three in New Jersey; three in New Mexico, three \nin North Carolina; one in Oklahoma; three in Oregon; three in South \nCarolina; Hatchee in Tennessee; Mr. President, five in Texas; one in \nUtah, one in Virginia; four in Washington; one in Wyoming; and \nwaterfowl production areas in five other upper Midwest States.\n  Recreation programs at other refuges, including hunting, fishing and \noutdoor education, would be reduced or eliminated to preserve funds for \nhabitat protection or improvement. Closure of 20 hatcheries would \nimpact the Fish and Wildlife ability to restore populations of sport \nand commercial fisheries in both the Atlantic and Pacific Northwest.\n  And so on. The total economic benefits generated from shipments of \nwildlife imported and exported from the United States are $800 million \na year. The Bureau of Land Management has already been reduced by $50 \nmillion from the President's proposal. This, according to BLM, would \nforce it to shut down services to a wide array of public land users, \nincluding mineral extraction--on which we had a long debate and votes \nearlier this evening--livestock, timber, recreational users, hunters \nand fishermen.\n  Mr. President, the list of closures of enterprises of the Geological \nSurvey fall into the same category. There are more than a dozen such \nclosures which would result. And in every case, these are \nresponsibilities which are undertaken by the Federal Government on \nbehalf of, not one group of Americans, but all Americans. And in the \ncase of the two land management agencies, they are, in fact, areas in \nwhich we own and must manage the lands of the United States. And, very \nbluntly, they would be devastated by this amendment.\n  In fact, I am certain, if this amendment were agreed to, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and I would not be able, in a conference committee--\nwould not wish, in a conference committee--to keep these reductions. \nWhat we would have to do would be to spread them out over all of the \nother responsibilities through the National Park Service and the \nNational Forest Service. Bluntly, it would include almost all of the \nconstruction and land acquisition projects which Members have asked and \nhave received from the Senator from West Virginia and myself, most of \nwhich are not included in the House bill.\n  Mr. President, we do have a very real responsibility. We have a \nresponsibility for all of the agencies of the Department of the \nInterior, for the Forest Service, part responsibility for the \nDepartment of Energy, and for the cultural institutions of the United \nStates. It has been neither an easy nor a pleasant task to determine \nwhere and how we can reduce those appropriations by $1.5 billion.\n  I started my remarks this afternoon with the point that we have $1.5 \nbillion less to spend in the next year than we do in this year. About \n20 percent of that money, $300 million or so of that $1.5 billion, has \nbeen taken from Indian programs within this field of responsibility. \nThat is a smaller share of what they are receiving this year than it is \nfor the entire balance of this appropriations bill. This is not only \nnot a discriminatory reduction, it is a less-than-average reduction.\n  It is a less than average reduction in an area in which we have \nprotected the most important functions of health care and of education, \nand not impacted the rights of Indian tribes to make decisions for \nthemselves but in effect has said what is absolutely inevitable. Again \nI find it curious in the debate with my friend--perhaps my closest \nfriend in the U.S. Senate, the Senator from New Mexico, who chairs the \nBudget Committee, on which the Presiding Officer and I serve--who has \ntold us, and caused us to pass a budget resolution which will call for \nreducing expenditures in all of these areas, not just for one year but \nfor 7, which will inevitably result in reductions like this, and many \nfeel that somehow or another we can protect this field, and only this \nfield, from such reduction and not ask for even a quite proportional \ncontribution from Indian groups and a beginning of a movement on their \npart from the dependency to independence, to self-support for at least \nthe governmental functions which they carry out themselves.\n  This is a fair proposal, Mr. President, in its present form. It saves \nthe most important Indian programs. It reflects the fact that Indian \nprograms and other appropriations bills are likely to save even perhaps \nthe increase. It reduces other elements in this bill by more than it \ndoes in Indian programs themselves. But it protects those functions \nfrom any cuts at all over which we have full 100 percent \nresponsibility, such as the operations of the National Park Service and \nthe cultural institutions of this city which are a part of the \nresponsibility of this Congress. And those are the only areas other \nthan Indian health which are not reduced in this bill.\n  Mr. President, to adopt this amendment is to breach a trust. It is to \nbreach the trust which we have imposed on the Government of the United \nStates properly to manage its millions of acres of public domain for \nall of the people to provide recreational activities, to provide \nscientific research, to provide for the use of our natural resources. \nAnd these reductions in this bill will gut our natural science through \nthe biological service; through the geological service; will gut our \nability to manage our wildlife refuges and our land management lands, \nand will severely impact on the ability of the American people to enjoy \nthose lands and to use them for recreational purposes.\n  Mr. President, the amendment should be rejected.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 10 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator will yield whatever amount of time my \ncolleague wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 19 minutes remaining in opposition.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I fully support the case that has been so ably \nexpressed against the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton]. I cannot improve upon it. As a matter of fact, \nI could not equal it.\n  The amendment proposes to reduce over $200 million from various \naccounts in the Interior appropriations bill as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee in order to put money into the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  The effect of this amendment is to impose greater reductions on \nprograms in the bill which have already been introduced in order to \nrestore funding to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The intention of the \namendment is to insulate the Bureau of Indian Affairs from the \nreductions necessitated by the budget resolution and the drive for a \nbalanced budget.\n  I appreciate the concerns of the sponsors of this amendment about the \neffects of this Interior bill on the BIA programs. However, I must \nremind all Senators that the Indian programs consumed about 30 percent \nof the total resources of the Interior bill.\n  In the recommendations pending before the Senate today, the committee \nhas protected the critical functions of education for Indian children, \nhealth care for Indian people, fulfillment of legislative payments due \nto settlement of land and water claims of Indian tribes, and protection \nof the core trust responsibilities for Native Americans.\n  The reductions in Indian programs are directed at tribal government. \nJust as we are expecting the Federal Government to downsize and do more \nwith less, so too must tribal governments. This is not to suggest that \nwhat the tribes use their funds for is not important. Rather, it is yet \nanother example of what gets affected when discretionary spending is \nreduced. And we have not seen anything yet. Just wait until next year.\n  As indicated when we began debate on this measure, this \nappropriations bill is funded $1.1 billion below the fiscal year 1995 \nenacted level. I will repeat--$1.1 billion below last year.\n  The only way to comply with the allocation assigned to this \nsubcommittee was to engage in spending cuts. The subcommittee sought to \nbe responsive to the variety of demands for the programs in this bill. \nThere were well over 1,000 requests submitted by Senators for items to \nbe funded in this bill. The \n\n[[Page S 11886]]\nvast majority of these were for items in the natural resource accounts, \nparticularly land acquisition and construction. It was not possible to \nprotect any account fully and still advance many important projects \nbrought to the subcommittee for consideration.\n  Mr. President, the types of reductions imposed by this bill are the \nconsequence of the bottom line of the budget resolution. While the \nassumptions of the budget resolution are not binding on the \nAppropriations Committee, the bottom line for discretionary spending is \nvery binding--very binding--unless 60 Senators wish to waive the Budget \nAct and allow an appropriations bill to exceed its 602(b) allocation.\n  In considering the allocation of the domestic discretionary spending \ncategory amongst the various appropriations subcommittees, the Interior \nsubcommittee was fortunate in that the allocations from the full \ncommittee did not track the budget resolution dollar for dollar. Had \nthat occurred the cuts in this bill would have been even greater. The \nbudget resolution would have assigned an allocation to this \nsubcommittee that would have been $443 million less than that currently \nin place for the Interior bill.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of the amendment may contend that the \nbudget resolution would not have imposed these types of reductions in \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs, and that may be true. But let me describe \nfor Senators just some of the things that the budget resolution would \nhave done that this subcommittee chose to handle differently.\n  The budget resolution assumptions rejected every single land \nacquisition project--not just for this year but for the outyears as \nwell; not a reduced land acquisition program, but an outright \ntermination of the program.\n  In response to Senators, Senator Gorton and I chose to fund a limited \nyet responsible land acquisition program. In order to do this we had to \ntake cuts in other areas.\n  The budget resolution assumptions would have reduced energy programs \nin this bill in half, and this would mean even greater cuts than those \nrecommended in areas such as grants for home energy weatherization for \nthe low income and the elderly, energy efficiency improvements in \nbuildings, natural gas research and development programs, including \nthose for high-efficiency turbine systems and fuel cells, and \ndevelopment into alternative fuel systems for vehicles and other \napplications.\n  The committee opted to put all of these programs on a declining path \nbut to do so in an orderly fashion so that investments would not be \nwasted, investments today.\n  For those who think that the bill has not done enough to stabilize \nthe timber supply program and the natural forest system lands, the \nbudget resolution would have imposed greater cuts on the Forest Service \naccounts than the 22 percent cut already taken in the committee's \nrecommendation.\n The budget resolution assumptions would have imposed a reduction of \n$68 million on the National Biological Service, as compared to the $27 \nmillion cut recommended by the committee. The committee's action, \nhowever, preserves ongoing operations at longstanding facilities in Ann \nArbor, MI; La Crosse, WI; Jamestown, ND; Lafayette, LA; Gainesville, \nFL; Columbia, Missouri; Anchorage, AK; and, yes, Leetown, WV; and \nSeattle, WA. At the funding level for NBS in the House bill, all of \nthese facilities would be affected by closure.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the subcommittee opted to distribute the cuts \nmandated by the budget resolution in a different fashion. Had we \nexempted 30 percent of the bill from any consideration of spending \ncuts, the ramifications would have been even greater elsewhere.\n  The committee recommendations include an 8 percent reduction in \nIndian program funding. By comparison, natural resource programs for \nthe land managing agencies are reduced by 14 percent. The Department of \nEnergy, which makes up a far smaller portion of the bill than the \nIndian programs, was reduced by 10 percent. The cultural programs that \nmake up just 6 percent of the bill are reduced by 15 percent. Thus, the \n8 percent reduction for Indian programs is not disproportionate in the \ncontext of a declining budget.\n  Senators should remember that the committee's recommendations protect \nIndian health care services, education, and trust responsibilities. \nThis bill funds recently authorized negotiated settlements at a time \nwhen many other authorizations for other programs are unable to be \nfunded. Reductions are imposed on the Indian programs just as they are \nimposed on nearly every program in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the words of my distinguished \nfriends who are sponsors of this amendment. They make a good case. And \nI sympathize very much with what they have said. This is one of the \ndisagreeable responsibilities that we have to fulfill in this body, \nopposing the Senators who are our friends, who make a good case for the \ncause which they are presenting.\n  It is a situation that we are going to find more and more \ndisagreeable as we go along by virtue of the fact to a considerable \ndegree we are being asked to increase military funding by $7 billion \nover and above the President's request. But it is going to come out of \nthe hide of domestic discretionary spending. There is no way to divide \nthis child between those, on the one hand, who make a justifiable plea \nfor this or that or the other cause and, on the other hand, be fair, \nintemperate and respond favorably to those on the other side in a given \nsituation.\n  I share 32 years with my friend, the Senator from Hawaii--32 years. \nNever have we had a disagreement, never have we had an angry or heated \nexchange on this floor or in any committee or subcommittee. I have many \nfriends in this body on both sides of the aisle, and he is one of my \nvery, very best and one whom I greatly admire. If there is a friend in \nthis body of the American Indian--and there are many friends--the \ndistinguished and able Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is that true \nfriend. So I find it very disagreeable to myself to have to oppose his \nposition on this amendment.\n  My friend, the Senator from New Mexico, is one of the brightest \nSenators in this body. His intellect I admire greatly. His \neffectiveness is unexcelled. He, too, is my friend, and I find it \ndifficult to take a stand against the position he has proposed.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona is a true patriot, and his \ndemonstration of patriotism is repeated many times and it is \nunassailable. He is a dedicated Senator. He does his homework well, and \nI have great admiration for him. But in closing, I must say that we do \nhave to make a choice. I think the distinguished manager of this bill \nhas been fair. He has been reasonable. He has done the best that he \ncould do with what he has with which to do. I support him fully in \ntaking the position in opposition to the amendment, and I do so, as I \nsay, apologetically to my dear friends who have made their case, but I \nthink we can only do so much with what we have.\n  The Senator from Washington has weighed the pros and cons in the \nbalance, and when Senators consider what is in the bill and also what \nthe committee has had with which to spread the funds among the various \nagencies--and there are 40 agencies involved in this bill--plus the \nfact that, as the distinguished Senator from Washington has said, when \nwe add a little here for this amendment, we have to take a little away \nfrom somebody else, from some other Americans--I hope Senators will \ntake a look at how their States will be affected if this amendment is \nadopted. I believe we will find that 12 States will gain in BIA funds \nwhile 38 States will lose to one degree or another. That is just the \nway we have to face up to this situation. And this is not the only time \nwe are going to have to make this kind of choice. It is going to be \nthrust upon us repeatedly in the days ahead. We might as well kind of \nget used to it.\n  So I salute my friends for doing what they think is right. Senator \nGorton and I, I am sure, would like nothing better than to be able to \naccede to this request, but we also have a responsibility toward other \nprograms, toward other Americans as well as the Native Americans, and \nwe have tried to discharge that responsibility to the best of our \nability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the time situation? \n\n[[Page S 11887]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes and \n13 seconds. And the Senator from Washington has 3 minutes, 9 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Inouye like half the time?\n  Mr. President, we get 5 minutes each tomorrow. I am hopeful in this \ncase that even though there are not so many Senators in the Chamber, \nthat between this evening and tomorrow Senators will have had a chance \nto listen. I very much appreciate the arguments of those who are \nopposed to us and without using a lot of time, let me just suggest that \nthey are both held in high esteem by this Senator.\n  But, Mr. President, it is too bad that the Indian people of the \nUnited States do not reside in cities like Seattle, WA, Albuquerque, \nNM, Milwaukee, WI and others. They really live in tiny places like \nTaos, Zia, Mescalero, San Juan, and hundreds of little places.\n  I say to Senators, if this is a case where you are going to look in \nyour own back yard and say, ``If I'm going to lose a little bit of the \nfish and wildlife activities in my State, I am not going to help the \nIndian people.'' Or I regret to say, if the Senators choose to say, \n``The Indian people are only in 12 States, therefore, if we give them \nanymore money, 38 States lose something.''\n  I know my friend did not mean that we ought to approach the Indian \nproblems of America that way. I must say, however, that I cannot create \ndemographics. All I do is represent the Indian people of my State and \nwherever they may be across the Nation. Native Americans just do not \nhappen to be in every State.\n  I submit we are not going to spend anymore time on this. From this \nlist the Fish and Wildlife Service gave you, I only wrote down one \nnote, Senator Gorton. Given that one long list of wildlife refuges that \nthey are going to close, do they do anything else? What does the rest \nof the money go for? Maybe they ought to leave the refuges open and cut \nsomething else. We get this every time we talk to the Department of \nInterior. Last time we talked about parks we had park rangers having \npress conferences, talking about how many parks were going to be \nclosed. They could not know how many parks were going to be closed \nuntil this bill passes. They do not know if any parks are going to \nclose at all. It happens there are not going to be any because of the \nway the bill was handled. Two months ago the national monument syndrome \nhad spread to every national park with Federal officials holding \nmeetings, calling people. I do not know how many hundreds of these \nparks were going to be closed according to the administration.\n  I admit, Mr. President, that when you take 46 percent out of the \ntotal Department of Interior reductions that will come out of local \ntribal programs, I cannot stand up here and tell you that it is a fish \nand wildlife refuge. I cannot even tell you that it is a fish hatchery. \nI can tell you that it is a small group of people and their local \ngovernment. If somebody says here today, ``Well, government is getting \ncut everywhere.'' I do not know about that, but I can tell you in my \nState, the Indian Pueblos, and their government's money will get cut. \nNow for those who say America's narrowing down its government, making \nit smaller. Are we making it significantly smaller in one fell swoop? I \ncannot even tell you as eloquently as my friend, Senator Gorton did, \nwhat precisely will be affected.\n  But let me tell you, the programs are the government operations of \nIndian tribes and Indian reservations across America, general \nassistance to individuals and families whose incomes are below current \nState standards, child welfare programs run by the tribes that provide \nassistance to abandoned or neglected children, programs to prevent the \nseparation of families, again run by the tribes, law enforcement run by \nthe tribes to have some law and civility in these villages where so \nmuch crime is coming and so much drunkenness, and, yes, even suicide \ngoing rampant across Indian country, fire protection for the Indian \nvillages, maintenance of 20 million miles of roads, most of which are \nnot even good enough to travel on.\n  For each one of those governments across this land that is a pretty \nhealthy cut.\n  Now, somebody might say, ``Would you cut some other Indian program \nand pay for these?'' Well, let me suggest tonight the issue is, do we \nsend this bill out of this Chamber significantly reducing the Indian \ngovernment money, the local tribal programs or do we not? That is the \nissue.\n  I submit we should not. And I submit--\n  I ask that I have one additional minute, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I submit that if the line agencies of our Government \nhave to be restrained in order to help the Indian people, who are in a \nstate of crisis, so be it. I am ready to go home and say, ``Yes. We had \nto save Indian programs. Fish and Wildlife Service, you get less \nmoney.'' We had to say to the USGS, ``Yes. You get less money,'' and \nthe others that I mentioned, the 6 agencies or so that we have to \nreduce.\n  Now, if they go to conference and want to reduce everything in this \nbudget rather than just those five or six agencies, that is up to the \nconferees. Then it is up to the Senate and the House if they want to \nvote for that later on. The issue now is very, very simple. Return $200 \nmillion to the tribal programs to do what I have just described, and \ntake it out of the line agencies of Federal Government that I have \ndescribed here tonight. I, frankly, believe it is the right thing to \ndo. What will come of it after that? We will just have to wait an see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired. The Senator from \nWashington has remaining 3 minutes, 9 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the fact remains that Indian programs are \nreduced less by this budget than almost every other program within this \nappropriations bill. That is a fact. The fact is that one-third of all \nIndian programs are not even included in this bill and do include child \ncare, violence prevention, and the like, and remained in bills yet \nundecided on this floor. The Senator from New Mexico asked but did not \nanswer the question, are the programs which are reduced in this \nappropriations bill so important that restoration should come from \nother Indian programs?\n  This Senator, at least, would defer to the authorizing committee, to \nthose who represent large groups of Indians, in a reallocation of \npriorities within Indian programs. What this Senator feels to be \ntotally unfair, however, is to devastate the other land management \nactivities of the Government of the United States, land management \nactivities which are dedicated to the benefit of all Americans, \nincluding of course, Indians, in the preservation of wildlife, the \nprovision of recreation, the restoration of our fisheries and of our \nforests.\n  These are programs that we cannot possibly abandon to anyone else. \nThey are the sole function of the Government of the United States. \nIndians, who are self-governing, and at least partly self-sufficient, \nas inadequate as they may be, do have other sources. We discussed very \nbriefly gaming activities which will be discussed more and more which \nhave taken place only in the last handful of years. And yet no \ncontributions, zero contributions is asked of the beneficiaries of \nthose activities toward these vitally important questions.\n  This is an appropriations bill dealing with extremely difficult \nquestions and the requirement of overall cuts of 11 percent, which has \nreduced Indian programs by markedly less than that amount and has \nreduced other programs already by considerably more than that amount. \nIt is neither fair, Mr. President, nor good policy, nor appropriate \nstewardship, nor a discharge of our trust for the lands we all own as \ncitizens in common to make these reductions, none of which affects any \nof the myriad of other Indian programs, simply in order to preserve the \nfull dependency of these Indian governmental activities on funding not \nof their members but of the Federal Government itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 2297 through 2301, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have five agreed-upon amendments. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that \nthese five amendments be considered en bloc. \n\n[[Page S 11888]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, when the Senate returns from recess, it will \nbegin the process of fundamentally changing our Nation's welfare \nsystem. While this is one of the most important things we should do \nthis year, I believe we must acknowledge, as Bill Bennett has said, \nthat most of our problems are cultural, and ``cultural problems demand \ncultural solutions.'' In other words, the problems that we seek to \ninfluence at the margins with governmental programs can only be \npermanently and effectively dealt with by changing our culture.\n  After trillions of dollars spent on welfare, it is obvious that \nFederal dollars alone will not solve the problems. All over this \ncountry, people need to be involved on a personal level to make the \nkinds of changes that will reverse the devastating social trends that \nhave taken hold of so much of our land. We desperately need to overhaul \nour Nation's welfare system, yes. But, change in Federal policy alone \nwill not resolve the underlying causes of this crisis. It cannot be \nsolved without individual commitment and personal responsibility. \nEveryone has to be willing to answer to his or her own behavior and \ndecisions.\n  The challenge is to help those people with no hope to a new life of \nresponsibility, productivity and happiness.\n\n\n      The Ineffective, Costly Federal Welfare Bureaucracy Must End\n\n  As we work toward effective welfare reform, I believe it would \nbenefit the Senate to first recognize publicly the failure of the \ncurrent system. We cannot expect different results if we continue to do \nthe same things. \n\n[[Page S 11889]]\n\n  It has become painfully clear that we cannot solve our welfare \nproblems by expanding the bloated and detached Federal bureaucracy or \nby increasing Federal dollars with entitlement status. Since President \nJohnson declared his ``War on Poverty,'' the Federal Government, under \nfederally designed programs, has spent more than $5 trillion on welfare \nprograms. But, during this time, the poverty rate has increased from \n14.7 to 15.3 percent.\n  The average monthly number of children receiving Aid to Families with \nDependent Children (AFDC) benefits has increased from 3 million in 1965 \nto over 9 million in 1992. That increase occurred as the total number \nof children in the United States decreased by 5.5 percent.\n  This means, at a minimum, the Great Society system has not worked; \nand, at worst, it has actually contributed to the problem by \ndiscouraging work, penalizing marriage, and destroying personal \nresponsibility and, oftentimes, self-worth.\n  Limited success in reforming welfare has occurred when States and \nlocalities have been given the opportunity ``to go their own way.'' \nUnder a State work-based initiative in Wisconsin, for example, \nindividuals have been diverted from ever getting on welfare, and under \na local initiative in Riverside, CA, individuals on welfare are staying \nin jobs permanently. In both Wisconsin and Riverside, welfare rolls \nhave been reduced. Additionally, in Wisconsin, unemployed, non-\ncustodial parents not meeting their child support obligations are \nrequired to actively look for work or work in a public or private \nsector job, or they are faced with jail time.\n  Since States are designing programs that work and since the Federal \nGovernment has clearly failed, the administration and design of most \nwelfare related programs should fall under State and local control. \nArizona's efforts at reform are a good example of why reform is needed. \nArizona applied in July of last year to implement a new State welfare \nprogram, EMPOWER. It is based on work, responsibility, and \naccountability. It took the Department of Health and Human Services \nbureaucracy a full year to approve the waiver. What State wants to \nwaste its time and resources preparing a waiver request knowing full \nwell that the Federal Government might put up roadblocks or simply not \nact on it for years?\n  That is why block grants to States make sense. By allowing States to \ndesign their own programs, decisions will be more localized, and the \ncosts of the Federal bureaucracy will be avoided. I support proposals \nto block grant AFDC, child care, and job training programs, and \nperhaps, to block grant additional programs, such as food stamps.\n  This having been said about block grants, there are two fundamental \ndriving forces behind welfare dependency that require some Federal \ncommitment: nonwork and nonmarriage.\n  While I am totally skeptical about Government's ability to legislate \ncultural solutions, I do believe that certain fundamental principles \nare worth reinforcing. In other words, as long as Federal tax funds are \nbeing used, they should be spent in a positive, not a negative way. For \nexample, it is wrong for Federal policy to penalize work and marriage. \nInstead, work and marriage should be rewarded because they are integral \nto the fabric of our society.\n  Nonwork and illegitimacy are key underlying causes of our welfare \ncrisis and, even with the effective elimination of the Federal welfare \nbureaucracy, they will remain as its legacy if we choose not to address \nthem. Responsibility is integral to a successful life--so Federal tax \nfunds should be given only to those willing to work and willing to \nraise children responsibly. People will never get out of the dependency \ncycle if Federal funds reinforce destructive behavior.\n\n\n                                  Work\n\n  Everybody knows that incentives to work are one integral component of \nany successful welfare solution.\n  Let us deal with the facts: To escape poverty and get off welfare, \nable-bodied individuals must enter and stay in the workforce. As Teddy \nRoosevelt said, ``The first requisite of a good citizen in this \nRepublic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his own \nweight.''\n  Let us look at another cold, hard fact: The JOBS program that passed \nas a part of the Family Support Act of 1988 is not moving welfare \nrecipients into work. Less than 10 percent of welfare recipients now \nparticipate in the JOBS Program. In fact, the JOBS Program does not \nrequire work, but simply participation in a job readiness program.\n  Once again: the Federal solution has been a failure. States can \nprobably do better. States should be given the flexibility to determine \nhow they will increase the number of welfare recipients engaged in \nwork--and I mean real work. A number of studies, including a study \nrecently released by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation \n(MDRC), indicate that getting a welfare recipient into work is more \nlikely than any other factor--more than training or education for \nexample--to result in the recipient leaving welfare for good.\n  And so, in my view, requiring States to adhere to tough definitions \nof work and to meet realistic, but tough, work participation rates will \nhelp States move toward what should be their primary goal: self-\nsufficiency among all their citizens.\n  S. 1120 provides a beginning toward these goals. Under S. 1120, \nwelfare recipients must enter work no later than 2 years after \nreceiving their first welfare payment. By the year 2000, 50 percent of \na State's welfare caseload, with no exemptions, will be required to \nwork. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached to add to S. 1120 \na requirement that States must lower welfare benefits on a pro rata \nbasis for individuals who fail to show up for required work. I will \ncontinue to work for a bill that will bring more individuals into the \nworkforce.\n\n\n                              Illegitimacy\n\n  Our Nation's illegitimacy rate has increased from 10.7 percent in \n1970 to nearly 30 percent in 1991. Eighty-nine percent of children \nreceiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is \npresent.\n  As the senior Senator from New York, who has worked on these issues \nfor 30 years, said this week, if we do not do something to reverse this \ntrend we may simply not make it as a society. And, as the senior \nSenator from Texas and others have said as well, to do anything less \nthan radically change the system that has created this trend would be \nsuicidal for our country. Clearly, the issue of illegitimacy is not a \npartisan issue, and it is one that demands immediate attention.\n  We must appreciate the role that the breakdown of the family, that \nfatherless families, have played in our societal and cultural decline. \nThis is not really even a debatable point. The facts support the \ndevastating reality. According to a 1995 U.S. Census Bureau report, the \none-parent family is six times more likely to live in poverty than the \ntwo-parent family. And, according to a study conducted in 1990 by June \nO'Neill--now director of the Congressional Budget Office, a young male \nis twice as likely to engage in criminal behavior if he is raised \nwithout a father.\n  Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute stated it well in an op-ed in \nthe Washington Post on Monday. He says that even the best set of \nemployment and training programs will still leave children in one-\nparent families living ``near the edge.'' Mr. Lerman goes on to explain \nthat growing up in a family with only one parent ``increases the \nchild's risk of dropping out of school, becoming an unmarried parent \nand having trouble getting and holding a job.'' As the op-ed clearly \nstates, the engagement of fathers in parenting is the most important \nfactor in helping people leave the welfare rolls and escape poverty.\n  I will, therefore, support measures to combat illegitimacy, including \nan amendment to provide incentives to States for reducing illegitimacy \nrates. I will also support initiatives to limit increases in cash \nassistance for mothers having additional children while on welfare. If \nthe rules of welfare are stated clearly to a mom from the beginning, \nand if allowances are made for noncash essentials like diapers and \nother items, then I do not believe such a welfare rule is unfair. In \nthe end, if such a rule reduces out-of-wedlock births, it may turn out \nto be more fair than most other aspects of welfare.\n\n\n                        Private Sector Solutions\n\n  Although most State solutions to welfare are more effective than \nFederal \n\n[[Page S 11890]]\nsolutions, no Government program can replace private sector charities \nand civic contributions. States can do it better than the Federal \nbureaucracy, but communities and individuals will ultimately have to \nsolve this crisis. For instance, if given $10,000 to spend on a welfare \nprograms of their choice, most Americans would choose to contribute to \nthe local homeless shelter or Salvation Army over some Government \nwelfare program because they know the private sector will be more \neffective.\n  During this welfare debate, it is my hope that we can discuss ways to \nend what John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis has \ncalled, the ``Federal Government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars.'' I \nsupport the provision of S. 1120 that allows States to contract with \nprivate charitable organizations--including religious organizations--to \nmeet the needs of recipients within their State.\n  I also believe that allowing taxpayers to claim a credit on their \nFederal tax returns for dollars or hours donated to a qualified charity \nwill give taxpayers the opportunity to decide how their welfare tax \ndollars are spent and will promote private sector involvement. I will \nsupport efforts to establish such a tax credit; I will also support \nefforts to change sections of the Tax Code that provide disincentives \nto marriage.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my friends on both sides of the aisle to \nrecognize the urgency of our task. I respect the intentions of those \nwho disagree with our proposals for more fundamental reform. But the \nbureaucratic responses to the problem have failed. It is time for \nsomething else. The status quo of the past 30 years will no longer \nsuffice. As candidate for President Clinton said, ``we must end welfare \nas we know it.''\n  The most compassionate thing we can do for those on welfare is to get \nthem off of welfare. The measure of our success will not be by how many \npeople we cover, but how few we need to cover. Our current system has \nthe effect of enslaving human beings to lives of dependency. Mr. \nPresident, let us end the bureaucratic welfare state; let us create an \nopportunity society.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11888-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, on that November evening in 1972 when I \nfirst was elected to the Senate, I made a private commitment that I \nwould never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the more than 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the enormity of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay. These \nyoung people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the U.S. \nConstitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that has \nnot first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate \nof the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Monday, August \n7, stood at $4,946,673,660,276.63 or $18,777.66 for every man, woman, \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11890-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11890-S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE STATE DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to express my great \ndisappointment that the Senate was unable last week to complete work on \nS. 908, the State Department Authorization bill. Perhaps ``unable'' is \nnot quite accurate, Mr. President; ``prevented'' is closer to the \ntruth. We were prevented from voting on the bill--in fact, prevented \neven from reaching more than a handful of the ninety or so amendments \nto it--by the obstinacy of the Democrat minority in the Senate.\n  I strongly believe that S. 908 is more than just a simple \nauthorization bill; it is a litmus test for our willingness to change, \nour willingness to heed the mandate we received last November to save \nmoney, cut bureaucracy, and make government more responsive to both the \ntaxpayer and the times. S. 908 was the first authorization measure this \nCongress to reach the floor within required budget targets. Moreover, \nthe bill proposed to reduce dramatically bureaucratic overlap and \nduplication of effort among several agencies by bringing those agencies \nand much of their personnel under one roof in the State Department. \nThis reorganization of our foreign policy apparatus, a reorganization \nsupported by five former Secretaries of State, would save over $3.66 \nbillion over four years.\n  But despite the savings, despite the streamlining, despite the \nbenefits to the exercise of our foreign policy, the forces arrayed \nagainst the bill joined to form an unholy alliance with one objective: \nstop the legislation. I think this fact was most clearly illustrated by \nthis statement from an A.I.D. internal memo brought to light while the \nbill was still in its formulative stage:\n\n       The strategy is ``delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail''--if \n     we derail, we can kill the merger. . . . Official word is we \n     don't care if there is a State authorization this year.\n\n  From the very beginning, despite repeated invitations from the \nChairman, the administration refused to even meet to discuss the bill \nor participate in the drafting of it. There was no compromise, no \nconstructive criticism, no alternatives--nothing. Instead, they \nstonewalled, obstructed, thwarted and delayed. Secretary Christopher, \nwho had earlier championed a plan extremely similar to that envisioned \nby S. 908, was muzzled by the White House and suddenly opposed the \nidea. The only active interest they evinced was to engage in a \ndistortion campaign. They claimed that folding the agencies into State \nwould mean agency programs would be run by State employees with no \nexperience in the fields, while failing to mention the fact that the \nbill also provided for the large-scale transfer of agency staff to \nensure continuity. They labelled supporters of the cost-savings \nprovisions in the bill ``isolationists,'' overlooking the fact that \nwe've asked every other department and agency to tighten its belt. They \ncontacted countless private groups that benefit directly (and \nmonetarily) from AID programs and forecasted doom and gloom in an \neffort to generate lobbying against the bill. They said the President \nhad an alternative plan far superior to the bill, but never produced \none--the first time in my memory that the White House had failed to do \nso. It became clear that, like much of what this administration says, \nit is only paying lip service to his pledges to ``reinvent \ngovernment.''\n  When it became clear that the bill was destined to leave the \ncommittee and go to the floor, the focus of the administration's \nefforts shifted to make sure that the Senators in the minority toed the \nadministration line. Two attempts to invoke cloture--not to stop debate \nbut to limit it to a manageable 30 hours--failed along strictly party \nlines. Only the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Pell, \nindicated that getting a final vote, either up or down, was more \nimportant than obstructionism. Dozens of amendments materialized, many \naimed at nothing less than delay.\n  Mr. President, I am amazed at how quickly the Democrats have \nforgotten their own words; how quick they are not to practice what they \npreach. For example, there was this statement in the last Congress from \nSenator Harkin, who voted against cloture on S. 908:\n\n       Well, it was obvious that after chewing up about 7 or 10 \n     days of the August break that the Republicans simply were \n     just going to talk it [the bill being debated] to death. They \n     were going to offer amendments, talk on and on, and drag the \n     whole process out and never reach any real, meaningful votes \n     on [the] bill . . . the Republicans say no . . . [w]e will \n     not take the keys that we hold to gridlock and unlock that \n     padlock and open the door. . . .\n       Madam President, I have served in the Congress now for 20 \n     years. I have seen a lot of fights in the House and in the \n     Senate, some pretty tough ones; I have seen some pretty tough \n     debates and pretty tough issues. . .. But in my 20 years in \n     this Congress I have never seen anything like exists today. \n     This attitude of gridlock, of stopping everything . . . that \n     we have to stop things because perhaps the only way to take \n     over is to tear it down. . . .\n       No, I have never seen anything like this in 20 years; the \n     sort of the mean spiritedness, the antagonisms, the inability \n     to give either side their proper due and to let legislation \n     move. There is nothing wrong with people to want to amend and \n     change, everyone should \n\n[[Page S 11891]]\n     have their viewpoint and they should be heard. When it gets to the \n     point where people just adamantly block everything, then \n     surely this Senate and this Congress has become something \n     that our forefathers never envisioned. . . . But this is not \n     what our forefathers envisioned. They envisioned a \n     legislative body that, yes, would debate and discuss and \n     amend, but would do something and get something through. We \n     now have a situation where the minority side will not permit \n     that to happen. 140 Congressional Record S-13262.\n\n  There was this from Senator Lautenburg, who also voted against \ncloture on S. 908:\n\n       In my view, Mr. President, the answer is simple: the \n     Republican leadership simply did not want the Congress, as an \n     institution, to demonstrate that it can do the business of \n     the people. . . . In the past, I have encountered steady \n     opposition by Republican Senators who stalled for months any \n     serious consideration of the bill and asked for extremist \n     changes that would destroy its reforms. . . . And \n     unfortunately, in the Senate where the rules and filibusters \n     give the minority the ability to paralyze, we can see very \n     clearly the handwriting on the wall if we ask for a vote on \n     [the bill]. 140 Congressional Record S-14221.\n\n  From Senator Boxer, another opponent of cloture on S. 908, we heard:\n\n       Madam President, I am very disappointed that a large \n     majority of my Republican colleagues have decided that, \n     outside of routine business, they really do not want to \n     continue the work of this Congress. They want to stall and \n     run the legislative clock down. They would rather talk on and \n     on, even all through the night if that is necessary, to kill \n     legislation that I believe is important to the American \n     people. Madam President, the filibuster has a new best \n     friend: The Republican Party. They embrace the filibuster. \n     They love the filibuster. . . .\n       [W]e Democrats underst[and] that you [have] to get things \n     done no matter which party [is] in control. We [do] not stop \n     legislation. . . .\n       We did not come here to filibuster, we came here to work. \n     We have a can-do spirit in this country . . . not a no-can-do \n     yak-yak-yak through the night, stop the progress attitude. . \n     . . We are supposed to do the work for the people; the \n     operative word is ``work.'' 140 Congressional Record S-13400.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, we heard this from Senator Biden, another \nopponent of cloture on S. 908:\n\n       I also find it fascinating to listen and hear about what \n     gridlock is. Let us talk about what gridlock is--my \n     definition of gridlock. My definition of gridlock is when you \n     have a clear majority of the elected representatives of the \n     American people who work in the U.S. Congress--Democrat and \n     Republican, House and Senate--when a clear, undisputed \n     majority want to do something and a minority repeatedly comes \n     along and says we are not going to even let you vote on \n     whether or not we are going to do that--that seems to me to \n     be gridlock, or obstruction. . . . Now, that is gridlock. I \n     am not taking issue with anybody's views on the floor. I am \n     not taking issue with their views, if they believe them as a \n     matter of principle and that is the only reason. There are a \n     lot of crazy ideas that are reflected in the American public \n     and the American psyche and the U.S. Senate. I have been the \n     father of some of those crazy ideas. So, I respect that. . . \n     . But the American people do not understand, nor should they \n     have to understand, the technicalities--such as with the \n     legal system and the complexities of the operation of the \n     fifth amendment and the fourth amendment and the second \n     amendment and the first amendment. They look at it and say, \n     ``Wait a minute now, this is right and this is wrong. Why are \n     we doing this?''\n       One of the things the American people, I think, also \n     understand and view the same way is their Government. We all \n     in this body know any Senator is within his rights to engage \n     in a filibuster, to use the parliamentary rules to his or her \n     advantage to keep a majority from prevailing--and there is an \n     underlying, solid rationale for that having been put in the \n     Senate rules. Notwithstanding that, I think the American \n     people have had to wonder a little bit: Why is it that when \n     repeatedly, time after time after time, an overwhelming \n     majority of Members of both Houses of the U.S. Congress say \n     they want to do something, our Republican friends stand up \n     and say no. The party of no.\n       Maybe the Senator is correct, that the American people do \n     not like the [bill]. I did not like it. So maybe I am with \n     the American people. But I did not think the alternative was \n     if I did not like that, we were not going to cooperate and \n     not going to deal with the . . . problem in America. I \n     thought that is what we were supposed to do. We disagree, we \n     negotiate, we debate, we compromise and we act, when there is \n     a majority that wishes to do that.\n       The truth, Madam President, is that the record is \n     inescapable on what has happened to this Congress and this \n     Senate because of filibusters, obstructionism, and gridlock. \n     And I know that some of my colleagues on the other side of \n     the aisle have raised this issue in caucuses and are nervous \n     about the potential of this strategy because that is what it \n     is--a conscious . . . strategy to benefit their party at the \n     expense of the people. It is a strategy to forsake America \n     just to impact the elections so that one political party can \n     win; not so that America can win. . . . 140 Congressional \n     Record S-14627.\n\n  Apparently my Democrat colleagues have very short and selective \nmemories. The Senator from Iowa took us to task for offering countless \nnongermane amendments in an effort to slow bills down. Perhaps he would \nlike to enquire of the senior Senator from Massachusetts why he took to \nthe floor last week to offer an amendment on the minimum wage to S. \n908--hardly a foreign policy issue. The Senator from California \ncastigated us for preferring to talk on and on, into the night if \nnecessary, to kill important legislation. Perhaps she would ask her \ncolleagues why after two days of floor consideration on S. 908 we were \nunable to produce anything more than several pages of Democrat rhetoric \nin the Congressional Record. The Senator from Delaware noted a \nconscious plan on our part to block all major legislation in order to \nbenefit our party. Well. Mr. President, I wonder if that Senator would \nnot agree that his party's stalling to death of S. 908, the Defense \nAuthorization bill, Regulatory Reform--among others--demonstrates a \nsimilarly conscious plan? The Senator from Delaware noted that in the \nentire 103rd Congress, there were 72 cloture motions filed and 41 \nrecorded cloture votes, which he characterized as ``a proud, record-\nbreaking amount of obstructionism.'' Well, in just the first 7 months \nof this Congress--7 month, Mr. President--we have had 32 cloture \nmotions and 16 recorded cloture votes. I wonder what synonym for \n``obstructionism'' the Senator from Delaware would choose to describe \nthat tragic record.\n  Mr. President, Chairman Helms has promised to bring the bill back to \nthe floor in the near future. I hope that our Democrat friends will \ntake that opportunity to prove me wrong, call an end to their \nunconstructive blockade, and get down to doing the business the \nAmerican people sent us here to do.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11890-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11891-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11891-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LUGAR, from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry:\n       Jill L.

Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation that would provide statutory authorization for a program \ncarried out by the Court of Veterans Appeals, pursuant to authority in \nappropriations acts, under which claimants before the court who would \notherwise seek to prosecute their appeal without legal representation \nreceive assistance in gaining such representation. I am pleased to be \njoined in introducing this bill by my good friend and fellow member of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Akaka.\n  Mr. President, the Court of Veterans Appeals pro se program was first \nset up in 1992 pursuant to an authorization in Public Law 102-229, the \nFiscal Year 1992 Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The \nprogram has been continued by subsequent appropriations acts, but has \nnever been otherwise authorized. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday would provide statutory authorization, thereby demonstrating the \nvalue of this program.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the initial authorization in Public Law \n102-229, the court transferred $950,000 to the Legal Services \nCorporation, which in turn made two types of grants in fiscal year \n1993.\n  The first grant, a so-called A grant, was given to a consortium-- \nmade up of the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the \nNational Veterans Legal Services Project, and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica--for the purposes of evaluating cases brought to the court by \npro se claimants and recruiting and training volunteer attorneys to \nrepresent these individuals. The consortium is overseen by an advisory \ncommittee and has three operational components--one that conducts \noutreach to recruit volunteer attorneys to represent claimants before \nthe court; one that provides an educational course for those attorneys \nwho agree to represent claimants; and one that evaluates cases and \nassigns them to the volunteer attorneys.\n  The second type of grant, the so-called B grants, were given to four \norganizations--the Disabled American Veterans, jointly to the National \nVeterans Legal Services Project and the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand Swords to Plowshares--to allow those organizations to expand \nexisting programs to provide pro bono legal representation to veterans.\n  This structure of the two types of grants continues, and the court \nwas authorized in subsequent appropriations acts to transfer $790,000 \nin each of fiscal years 1994 and 1995.\n  Mr. President, by all accounts, this program has been a significant \nsuccess. In testimony for the Committee on Veterans' Affairs' March 9, \n1995, hearing on the fiscal year 1996 budget for veterans programs, the \ncourt's chief judge, Frank Q. Nebeker, made the following points about \nthe program:\n\n       [F]ully two-thirds of eligible appellants who were pro se \n     when filing appeals in the first two years of the Program's \n     operation received some form of legal assistance. . . . \n     [D]uring these first two years . . . , while only 19% of \n     appellants were represented at the time of filing a notice of \n     appeal to the Court, 42% were represented at case termination \n     as a result of the Program's placement of cases with \n     attorneys. . . . [R]ecruitment of volunteer attorneys has \n     been highly successful. Through the end of calendar year \n     1994, 342 volunteer attorneys have been recruited and are \n     participating in the Program. . . . Nearly 300 attorneys have \n     received training in veterans law, either through the \n     Program's day-long training sessions (261 attorneys) or \n     through video training tapes (37 individuals or law firms). \n     Of the 159 volunteer attorneys who have completed cases, over \n     80% have expressed willingness to take another case, and 51 \n     appellants have already received representation by repeat pro \n     bono attorneys. In FY 1994 the Program provided nearly $4.00 \n     worth of volunteer-attorney services for every $1.00 of \n     federal money spent on the Program.\n\n  In its annual report for 1994, the program discussed the impact of \nrepresentation on a claimant's chance of success before the court, \nnoting that of the 203 decisions made by the court through September \n1994 in cases in which representation was provided through the program, \nnearly 80 percent were settled, reversed, or remanded to the Board of \nVeterans' Appeals. On the other hand, of the 272 pro se cases completed \nby the court where the eligibility requirements for the program were \nnot met and pro bono representation not provided, only 14 cases \nresulted in a remand to the Board. Clearly, the opportunity to have \nqualified legal representation is a great benefit to claimants coming \nbefore the court, and the program has been instrumental in helping \nclaimants secure such representation.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing would amend chapter 72 of \ntitle 38, United States Code, the chapter relating to the Court of \nVeterans Appeals, by adding a new section 7287 which would authorize \nthe court to provide funds to nonprofit organizations in order to allow \nsuch organizations to provide funding to appropriate entities to carry \nout a program to assist pro se claimants to secure representation. All \nof the provisions in the proposed new section are derived from the \nlanguage in Public Law 102-229 and are intended to function in the same \nway, with the court having flexibility in how any available funds are \nused to support a program. Of course, in light of how well the existing \nprogram has functioned, I would anticipate that that effort would \ncontinue as long as appropriate. However, there is nothing in the \nproposed legislation which would mandate such a result, and I \nanticipate that the court will use whatever funding is provided in \nfuture appropriations acts in the way that will ensure that the \ngreatest number of eligible claimants receive representation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the committee's \nchairman, Senator Simpson, and the other members of the committee on \nthis legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY VETERANS IN \n                   CONNECTION WITH COURT OF VETERANS APPEALS \n                   PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) Subchapter III of chapter 72 of title \n     38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 7287.

This report meets the \nrequirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough August 5, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $20.9 billion in budget authority and $2.0 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.5 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-1999. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$237.4 billion, $3.7 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 24, 1995, the President signed the \n1995 Rescissions and Emergency Supplementals for Disaster Assistance \nAct--Public Law 104-19. This legislation changed current level of \nbudget authority and outlays; the change was reflected in my report \ndated July 24, 1995.\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 1995.\n     Hon.

His remarks reflects \nthe policies of the U.S. Catholic Conference, which represents the \nNation's Roman Catholic bishops.\n  Bishop Skylstad's thoughtful remarks reflect the American bishops' \ndesires to save the family farm, promote wise stewardship of the land, \nalleviate hunger here and abroad, and sustain rural economies--goal \nthat I hope we all share. I urge each Senator to review carefully \nBishop Skylstad's observations and recommendations.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n              Testimony by Most Reverend William Skylstad\n\n       I am William Skylstad, the Roman Catholic Bishop of \n     Spokane, Washington. I serve a diocese which is mostly rural, \n     and which has farms of all sizes and shapes. Formerly, I was \n     Bishop of the Diocese of Yakima, Washington. The farming \n     community there relied heavily on migrant labor for its fruit \n     and vegetable harvests. The smaller cities in which I have \n     served have experienced many of the same problems of hunger \n     and poverty that many of our nation's large cities face. So I \n     come today as a pastor with some knowledge of the rural and \n     urban dimensions that this omnibus food and agriculture bill \n     addresses. \n\n[[Page S 11942]]\n\n       My testimony also reflects the policies of the U.S. \n     Catholic Conference, the policy agency of the U.S. Bishops. I \n     also serve as Chairman of the National Catholic Rural Life \n     Conference Board of Directors. The NCRLC is a national \n     organization founded in 1923, that serves the rural church, \n     and rural people in their communities.\n       Through our many national and international organizations \n     including Catholic Charities, the Campaign for Human \n     Development and Catholic Relief Services, we experience first \n     hand the plight of the poor and as the farm bill covers \n     domestic and international food programs as well as food \n     marketing and distribution, we are in a position to bring our \n     experience to bear on this important debate.\n       I submit these comments therefore, on behalf of the USCC, \n     with the hope that Congress will produce farm policy that \n     will be fair, equitable and resourceful. In a time of budget \n     cutting, we urge the Agriculture Committee to pursue the \n     common good and target scarce dollars to those most in need.\n       Our perspective begins with our belief in the dignity of \n     all people as they are created in God's image. For people to \n     live a dignified life, they must have an adequate and safe \n     food supply. Food, for us, is not just another commodity in \n     the grand economic scheme. We all can live without our car or \n     our computer but cannot live without food. It is essential \n     for life itself. How food is produced is also important since \n     we need not only a bountiful harvest, but a safe one as well. \n     Care for the land is as important to us as what it produces. \n     The common good first requires a safe and affordable food \n     supply.\n       These underlying principles, then, are what drives our \n     policy analysis. The basic goal of the food system is to \n     ensure an adequate supply of nutritious food to meet domestic \n     and international need in an environmentally responsible way \n     and to ensure the social health of our rural communities. To \n     meet this goal, we believe four areas of the Farm Bill need \n     particular attention: 1) Agriculture, 2) Hunger, 3) Rural \n     Development and 4) Environment.\n\n\n                              AGRICULTURE\n\n       Our bishops' Conference believes that a just farm system is \n     one that supports the widespread ownership of farm land and \n     the viability of the family farm. We urge you to be guided by \n     a principle drawn from the Bishops' pastoral letter: Economic \n     Justice for All; 1986. That:\n       ``. . . moderate-sized farms operated by families on a \n     full-time basis should be preserved and their economic \n     viability protected. Similarly, small farms and part-time \n     farming, particularly in areas close to cities, should be \n     encouraged. There is genuine social and economic value in \n     maintaining a wide distribution in the ownership of \n     productive property. The democratization of decision making \n     and control of the land resulting from wide distribution of \n     farm ownership are protection against concentration of power \n     and a consequent possible loss of responsiveness to public \n     need in this crucial sector of the economy. Moreover, when \n     those who work in an enterprise also share in its ownership, \n     their active commitment to the purpose of the endeavor and \n     their participation in it are enhanced. Ownership provides \n     incentives for diligence and is a source of an increased \n     sense that the work being done is one's own. This is \n     particularly significant in a sector as vital to human well-\n     being as agriculture.''\n       Widespread ownership of farm land is not currently being \n     promoted by U.S. agriculture policy. In our judgement, \n     current policies have resulted in a concentration of farmland \n     ownership which is detrimental to the interests of farming \n     and to the vitality of rural communities. Current public \n     policy fosters an increasingly industrialized system of \n     agriculture that requires large amounts of capital and \n     rewards large farms far more than smaller and medium-sized \n     farms. This is a matter of policy choice, not economic \n     inevitability.\n       This concentration is a result of farm policy that rewards \n     high production. As incentives to produce grow, the desire to \n     use ever-increasing amounts of chemicals and petroleum for \n     inputs, harvesting, and transportation likewise increases. \n     Dependency on such a system could have serious results if, \n     for example, our supply of petroleum was ever curtailed for \n     any period of time. Another threat of the excess \n     concentration of farmland could be manipulation of markets \n     which can be very dangerous, especially where food is \n     concerned.\n       I also believe that the low prices paid for farm \n     commodities are in fact subsidies to the large grain traders \n     and large hog and cattle feedlot operations. Deficiency \n     payments and loan rates based on output create a drive to \n     produce more and more. This favors larger farms which can \n     afford high inputs: inputs which depend on the generous use \n     of chemicals. This policy also creates a drive to buy up land \n     thus accelerating concentration. In addition, the large grain \n     traders received over $2 billion in direct export subsidies \n     in 1993-94 through the Export Enhancement Program. In short, \n     our nation's ``cheap food policy'' is a cheap grain policy \n     which benefits these large agribusiness corporations at the \n     expense of family farmers and rural communities.\n       We recognize the definition of ``family farm'' has taken on \n     many meanings. Besides a definition based on gross sales, one \n     helpful definition may be that the goal of the family farmer \n     is to create resources to support a way of life. Typically, a \n     family farmer/owner devotes a good portion of his or her time \n     to the day-to-day management and operation of the farm. The \n     goal of a corporate farm, by way of contrast, would be to \n     make a profit to support its investors. Day-to-day management \n     and operation of the farm is not necessarily by the owners.\n       How can we change policy to address the issue of support \n     for family farms and begin to move away from increasing \n     concentration of farm land? Congress needs to take a serious \n     look at targeting farm program dollars to small and moderate-\n     sized farmers and away from the large food corporations. A \n     clear first step would be to close the payment limitation \n     loopholes so that the largest farms can no longer subdivide \n     into multiple legal entities to avoid payment limitations.\n       Another way to ensure broad-based ownership of land and to \n     support family farmers would be to raise the ``non-recourse'' \n     loan rate. This is also a matter of economic justice. Farmers \n     cannot stay solvent when they are currently producing at, \n     slightly above or, in many cases, below the cost of \n     production. We must express alarm when we read that on the \n     whole, farm sector profitability averaged only 2% over the \n     past five years while the food industry profits averaged 18% \n     over that same period. Setting the loan rate higher would \n     decrease deficiency payments (which totaled $11 billion in \n     1994) and would result in more family farmers surviving to \n     spend more of their money in rural communities.\n       Even if federal farm policy were changed to give farmers a \n     fair price for their product, and to remove the disincentives \n     to sustainable agriculture, it would do no good if farmers \n     were not able to get loans to plant their crops. In March, \n     bankers urged the Senate Agriculture Committee to privatize \n     the servicing of USDA loans and replace direct lending with a \n     guaranteed loan program. In the face of increasing debt load \n     and decreasing cash flow among most farmers, bankers are \n     using guaranteed loans to promote contract livestock \n     operations and high equity loans that inhibit the \n     participation of family farmers. In addition, the \n     Consolidated Farm Services Agency currently has no credit \n     sales allocations, which means that land in inventory is not \n     being sold to priority purchasers. These developments are \n     detrimental to family farmers and rural communities. Farming \n     requires credit for the purchase of inputs and equipment. We \n     urge Congress to make credit accessible to family farmers \n     through USDA credit programs that have been proven effective \n     over time.\n       Another important concern of family farmers is the \n     increasing use of contract farming and the vertical \n     integration of some commodities. This phenomenon has been \n     seen most prevalently in the poultry industry--and \n     increasingly in the hog industry. Rarely can independent \n     poultry producers participate in this industry. Contracts \n     between farmers and integrators offer substantial protections \n     for integrators and very little for the heavily-invested \n     contract grower. These contracts are often extremely \n     unfavorable for the farmers, who have little legal recourse \n     to force the integrators to bargain contracts in good faith. \n     We urge you to support efforts that would result in good \n     faith bargaining for contract farming.\n       Also of concern to the bishops is the decreasing \n     opportunities for younger people to enter into farming. \n     Efforts such as the ``Farm Link'' program, sponsored by the \n     religious and public interest community, deserve more \n     attention and support by the federal government. \n     Additionally, current federal programs for beginning farmers, \n     especially those developed in 1990 and 1992, ought to be \n     continued and enhanced. The strategy of developing \n     partnerships between government, lenders and beginning \n     farmers is one we call on Congress to seriously consider as \n     vital to the interest of maintaining a family farm system.\n       Part of the patchwork of family farms are minority farmers. \n     Black farmers have lost land at an accelerating rate in \n     recent years. Since 1954, the number of African-American \n     owned farms has declined by over 95 percent and today their \n     average income is only 65 percent of white farm operators. \n     While many of these farms are small, they have been viable, \n     they provide a sense of identity for the farmer and \n     contribute to the economic security in the community. Special \n     public policy measures are needed in the Farm Bill to stem \n     the loss of these farms, as well as those among Hispanics and \n     Native Americans. We recommend new policy initiatives to \n     assist these farmers: increase outreach and enrollment of \n     minorities in decision making bodies such as county \n     committees; provide increased access to credit through \n     adequate funding and enforcement under the Agriculture Credit \n     Act of 1987 and the 1990 Farm Bill which provide for \n     targeting of FmHA Farm Ownership and Operating Loans and \n     sales of land in inventory to African American and other \n     minority farmers; and adequately fund outreach programs such \n     as was approved in Section 2501(a) of the 1990 Farm Bill.\n       Farm workers must receive more attention and protection in \n     farm policy. They continue to be among the poorest people in \n     our land yet they harvest so much of our table food. Opening \n     eligibility and including the work experience of farmworkers \n     for beginning and minority farmer programs would allow some \n     farmworkers to become self-sufficient. The enforcement of \n     existing labor laws and linking compliance with those laws to \n     a farmers participation in program benefits would help \n\n[[Page S 11943]]\n     ensure that farmworkers are protected. Additionally, providing \n     information to both farmers and farmworkers on alternative \n     pesticides and herbicides or on new health concerns for \n     existing chemicals is a matter of fairness and decency.\n\n\n                                 HUNGER\n\n       The system of food production is unlike any other system: \n     it produces what is essential for life. In a world where \n     there are hundreds of millions of starving and malnourished \n     people, our faith and our social teaching calls us to speak \n     on their behalf and recognize food is essential to a decent \n     and dignified human life.\n\n\n                            DOMESTIC HUNGER\n\n       In the area of domestic hunger, USCC's primary concerns are \n     in the continuation of the goals of existing food, nutrition \n     and anti-hunger programs to meet the nutrition needs of many \n     pregnant women, poor children, families and the elderly. \n     Food, nutrition and anti-hunger programs play a vital role in \n     ending poverty, especially among our children. Due to \n     declining overall incomes and the breakdown of the family, \n     the overall child poverty rate increased by 49 percent from \n     1973-1992. The largest growth, 76 percent, occurred in the \n     suburbs--the areas once considered most immune from the \n     poverty crisis. Recent reports indicate clearly that our \n     federal food and nutrition programs do make a difference \n     especially for poor children.\n       As the bishops said in ``Putting Children and Families \n     First'':\n       ``The continuing reality of hungry children in our midst is \n     a dismaying sign of failure. We see signs of this failure in \n     our food pantries, soup kitchens, parishes, and schools. New \n     investment and improvements are needed in basic nutritional \n     programs, such as food stamps, to ensure that no child goes \n     hungry in America. An urgent priority is the Women, Infant & \n     Children (WIC) program, that still does not reach all \n     expectant mothers, infants, and young children in need.'' \n     (1991)\n       The USCC strongly recommends the continuation of Food \n     Stamps, Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Program \n     (WIC), The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), the \n     school lunch program and other child nutrition and elderly \n     food programs that assist those in need. The proposed cuts \n     appear to us to go too far and the nutritional safety net \n     could be in jeopardy. Additionally, we believe it would be a \n     mistake to pit farm programs against food and nutrition \n     programs in a time of limited budget resources. Both programs \n     are necessary and need support.\n       While not categorically opposed in principle to block \n     grants, the USCC believes that block granting essential \n     entitlement programs such as Food Stamps could be detrimental \n     to uniform nutritional standards and create unnecessary \n     hardship on children, families and individuals in times of \n     economic difficulties. These programs are often the beginning \n     point for people who wish to work themselves out of poverty. \n     The USCC envisions policies that will move people from \n     perpetual hunger and poverty to a more sustained system of \n     nutritional value and self dependency.\n       Linkages between urban hunger and the development of urban \n     edge agriculture should be fostered. Such linkages should be \n     seen as a form of community development and empowerment which \n     complements and extends the traditional approaches to \n     addressing food and hunger issues. I encourage Congress to \n     direct the USDA to adopt community food security as a mission \n     of the agency and establish a community food security \n     program. Support direct farmer-to-consumer marketing efforts \n     by expanding the Farmer's Market Nutrition Program and the \n     Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program. We encourage \n     further expansions of government purchases of local \n     agricultural products. These and other provisions are part of \n     the Community Food Security Empowerment Act of 1995 which I \n     urge you to support.\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL HUNGER\n\n       While hunger in our own country remains a serious problem, \n     we cannot turn our backs on the 800 million people all over \n     the world (and over half of them children), who do not have \n     enough to eat. Such hunger is shameful in a world where most \n     believe we can produce enough food for everyone.\n       We believe that special efforts must be made to see food as \n     more than just another commodity to be traded on the \n     international market and that it not be used as a bargaining \n     chip as the United States pursues its interest in various \n     parts of the globe. In addition, we believe that food trade \n     should be conducted with global food security and equity as \n     its primary goals, not with raw competition as its driving \n     engine. Finally, patterns of overproduction and \n     overconsumption on the part of first world countries has a \n     devastating impact on the development and sustainability of \n     our third world neighbors. The question is: will US food aid \n     help poor people in food deficient nations move toward food \n     security, or will it foster an unhealthy dependence?\n       The Food for Peace Program (PL-480) needs to be re-\n     authorized and expanded. But it also needs to have a clear \n     and primary goal alleviating hunger and only secondarily the \n     pursuit of commercial or strategic interests.\n       In the 1995 Farm Bill, the United States should reinforce \n     its commitment to help hungry people through international \n     food aid programs. Over the past two years, the total level \n     of international food assistance provided by the United \n     States has decreased by nearly 50 percent. Programs to assist \n     those who suffer from chronic hunger, as well as U.S. \n     commitments to provide assistance for disaster relief, have \n     been scaled back.\n       Food assistance is truly ``Food for Peace.'' When there is \n     significant hunger and poverty, a country cannot experience \n     internal stability and economic growth. It will not develop \n     into a U.S. trading partner until some of its food security \n     problems are remedied. Food aid is not the only response, but \n     it has saved millions of lives and helped to improve the \n     quality of life for millions more. And it has provided \n     markets for U.S. agricultural goods and built the foundation \n     for future trade relations.\n       The limited funds available for food aid should be targeted \n     to those whose need is greatest and where the food can be \n     used most effectively to alleviate hunger now and contribute \n     to long-term food security. More specifically, we recommend:\n       1. With the downsizing of government agencies, relying more \n     heavily on the experience, recommendations and capabilities \n     of private partners--PVOs and cooperatives--for developing \n     and implementing title II programs.\n       2. Strengthening the Title II program requirements so that \n     the minimal amount of food tonnage required for people-to-\n     people development programs (conducted by private voluntary \n     organizations (PVOs), cooperatives and the World Food \n     Program) is maintained. These programs assist countries with \n     chronic hunger. Raiding these programs to take care of \n     emergency needs only creates additional emergency needs. A \n     new mechanism to take care of emergency situations should be \n     established.\n       3. Establishing mechanisms which assure that the U.S. can \n     continue to play a leadership role in responding to emergency \n     needs by providing food in a timely manner. Allow the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to use the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation funds to make up to 1 metric ton of commodities \n     available each year for emergency needs abroad.\n\n\n                           RURAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n       In the area of rural development, policies should be \n     enacted to strengthen economic development, expansion of \n     employment opportunities, and education in rural communities. \n     The lack of farming opportunities, few quality jobs, and poor \n     infrastructure is forcing many of our young people out of \n     rural communities and into the cities. This creates a drain \n     of talent vitally needed by our rural towns.\n       Some modest rural empowerment and enterprise zones have \n     been enacted to address funding for housing and community \n     facilities, business development, water and waste systems. \n     However, some rural residents fear that business development \n     projects through enterprise ``zones'' are not long term and \n     many rural communities are left untouched by enterprise or \n     empowerment zones. Policy needs to be developed to ensure \n     that stability to rural communities can be assured through \n     permanent business development.\n       Much needed infrastructure improvements could generate \n     economic development opportunities that would enhance the \n     overall quality of many American rural communities. Far too \n     many rural communities still lack adequate housing, water \n     access, safe roads, and public transportation which restrict \n     rural residents from enjoying amenities that other \n     communities have.\n       But more than infrastructure improvements are necessary. \n     While many farmers are economically better off than the \n     national average, 20 percent remain in poverty. Part of the \n     problem is that money is flowing out of the rural community. \n     Dependence on one or two key employers will be lessened if \n     assistance in market diversification and in creating value-\n     added ventures in the local town were to become a reality.\n       We believe the government has a continuing role in \n     providing for the credit needs of farmers and especially \n     beginning and minority farmers. Direct lending (i.e., being \n     the ``lender of last resort''), and servicing loans should be \n     part of government services to protect and promote the \n     viability of family farms. The advantages of existing loan \n     programs ought to be promoted including direct CFSA loans. \n     Additionally, we urge support for both credit sales--so more \n     beginning and minority farmers can enter farming--and \n     education and outreach programs to minority farmers.\n\n\n                              ENVIRONMENT\n\n       Our traditional concern for the environment flows from our \n     teachings about creation and stewardship. In 1991, our \n     bishops' Conference noted that:\n       ``Sustainable economic policies, that is, practices that \n     reduce current stresses on natural systems and are consistent \n     with sound environmental policy in the long term, must be put \n     into effect. At the same time, the world economy must come to \n     include hundreds of millions of poor families who live at the \n     edge of survival.'' (Renewing the Earth, 1991)\n       In this area we focus primarily on sustainable agriculture \n     but also on the support for existing environmental and \n     conservation programs of the federal government.\n       We define sustainable agriculture generally as substituting \n     renewable resources generated on the farm for nonrenewable, \n     purchased resources. Sustainable agriculture relies on \n     modern, evolving and highly adaptable management technology. \n     According to \n\n[[Page S 11944]]\n     an extensive study by the Northwest Area Foundation (an organization \n     promoting economic revitalization for eight states--including \n     my own state of Washington) entitled, A Better Row to Hoe, \n     sustainable farmers are more diversified, plant less program \n     commodities, use less fertilizer, pesticides, and energy, \n     rotate crops, recycle plant nutrients and manure, plant more \n     soil-building crops, use more cover crops, strip crops, \n     contour grass waterways and field windbreaks than do \n     conventional farmers. All of these techniques are consistent \n     with our principles of careful stewardship of finite natural \n     resources. Additionally, the new techniques of sustainable \n     agriculture will increase small town business opportunities \n     as the local community responds to the different production \n     and market needs of these farmers. We see this as a positive \n     development which corresponds to our call to value and \n     support rural and small town life.\n       While the Northwest Area Foundation study concludes that \n     there is general support for the concepts of sustainable \n     agriculture, there is a great deal of reluctance on the part \n     of many farmers to fully enter into these farming techniques \n     because of the lack of governmental support. This is \n     especially true in the areas of commodity program payments, \n     research and extension services.\n       Environmental performance should be a hallmark of public \n     farm policy. We urge the removal of penalties for converting \n     to sustainable agriculture and an end to the discrimination \n     against sustainable farmers who plant soil-conserving crops \n     and have fewer acres in subsidized crops. Greater emphasis on \n     sustainable agriculture in research and educational programs \n     will strengthen the technology base and provide both \n     beginning farmers and farmers who want to convert to \n     sustainable agriculture with better technical support.\n       We support recent conservation legislation that would \n     consolidate current conservation programs into a single \n     entity; keep the current level of funding; extend the \n     Conservation and Wetlands Reserve Programs (CRP and WRP) and \n     focusing CRP on the most environmentally sensitive lands and \n     encourage partial field enrollments; encourage conservation \n     practices by giving priority to sustainable practices rather \n     than wholesale land retirements; and encourage support for \n     sustainable livestock management practices.\n       In addition to these proposals we would also recommend: \n     Providing incentive payments to encourage whole farm \n     planning; Encouraging local participation by farmers, \n     ranchers, nonprofit organizations as well as federal, state \n     and local natural resources staff in the new State \n     Conservation Committees; Considering a grant program where a \n     portion of federal conservation funds can draw down local \n     funds for special conservation projects.\n       Finally, it is critical that Conservation Compliance, \n     Sodbuster, and Swampbuster provisions be maintained. Though \n     they have not been perfect programs, they have significantly \n     slowed the wetland destruction, soil erosion and have \n     improved water quality. These provisions are conditions of \n     enrollment in a voluntary entitlement program and should not \n     be viewed as regulatory ``takings'' of private property \n     rights, as suggested in the House-passed ``Private Property \n     Protection Act of 1995.''\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       I encourage you to continue to promote a broad-based \n     ownership of the land and the means of agricultural \n     production, to foster the family farm, support minority \n     farmers and farmworkers and uphold the place of the land as a \n     gift from God and for all generations.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11941-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11944-S11945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n FAIRFIELD UNIVERSITY COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS OF AMBASSADOR JEAN KENNEDY \n                                 SMITH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at a time when deep budget cuts have \nforced us to focus more on the private sector's role in maintaining and \nimproving society, volunteerism has become ever more important. The \ncontributions made by volunteers, whether in the President's National \nService Corps, charity groups, or religious institutions, every day \nserve to brighten the lives of people who need help.\n  That is why I was so heartened to hear of the remarks of Jean Kennedy \nSmith, my dear friend and our Ambassador to Ireland, to the graduating \nclass of Fairfield University. In her commencement address, Ambassador \nSmith lauded the graduates for their deep faith and brilliant spirit of \nvolunteerism. Indeed, she knows service to others when she sees it. \nJean Kennedy Smith not only comes from a family whose faith underlies a \ndeep commitment to community and public service, but is herself \nactively involved in both public service and in improving the lives of \nthose who are less fortunate. Her exemplary work with the ``very \nspecial arts'' organization brings the joy of the arts to people with \ndisabilities.\n  In this day and age, when most of the news about youth is gloom and \ndoom it was refreshing to know that Fairfield University has cultivated \nsuch an outstanding group of young men and women. A group of young \nadults, as Jean Kennedy Smith explained, whose faith and commitment to \nservice will not only bring personal fulfillment, but also ultimately \nadvance goals such as peace in Ireland and the world over.\n  Mr. President, I wish to share Jean Kennedy Smith's uplifting remarks \nwith my colleagues and with the American people, and ask that they be \nprinted, as published June 17, 1995, in America Press, in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n                            Faith Above All\n\n                        (By Jean Kennedy Smith)\n\n       Since this is a day of celebration, it is a time to talk of \n     those who love us and those whom we love--your parents, \n     grandparents, your brothers and sisters, your friends--all \n     those who have given so much for you and whose sacrifices \n     have brought you to this threshold of the future. Although I \n     never had the good fortune to attend a Jesuit school, I am \n     certainly familiar with the value of a Jesuit education. My \n     late husband, Steve, graduated from Georgetown, and my son \n     attended medical school there. In my family, a Jesuit \n     education has always been synonymous with excellence.\n       A noted college president once said that the reason that \n     universities are such storehouses of knowledge is that every \n     entering student brings a little knowledge in and no \n     graduating student takes knowledge out. I'm sure that is not \n     true at Fairfield. A good education is respected and \n     cherished throughout the world, particularly in the United \n     States and in Ireland. Ireland, in fact, boasts one of the \n     most educated societies in the world. The Irish youth are the \n     best educated in all of Europe.\n       But this should come as no surprise. When Europe descended \n     into the Dark Ages, Ireland earned its reputation as a land \n     of scholars and saints by preserving the traditions of \n     learning and faith. Men and women of religious orders in \n     those years committed themselves to the world of ideas and \n     knowledge, and passed on this heritage in both written and \n     oral form. Western civilization has benefitted from their \n     wisdom ever since.\n       St. Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Society of Jesus in \n     1540, also extolled the importance of education. But he \n     realized that it must be more than the mere accumulation of \n     knowledge. Ignatius understood that a true education is one \n     that is inspired by spiritual values. The motto of Fairfield \n     University, ``Through Faith Toward the Fullness of Truth,'' \n     reflects the spirit of St. Ignatius and the work of the \n     Jesuits and lay men and women who teach at Fairfield.\n       My mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, shared this same high \n     vision--that faith, above all things, brings fulfillment. She \n     often said: ``The most important element in human life is \n     faith. If God were to take away all his blessings, health, \n     physical fitness, wealth, intelligence, and leave me but one \n     gift, I would ask for faith.''\n       Our family was blessed with two wonderful parents. And \n     while we were growing up, they always impressed upon us the \n     responsibility to give something back to our country, which \n     had been so good to us. As President Kennedy said on \n     Inauguration Day in 1961, ``Ask not what your country can do \n     for you, ask what you can do for your country.'' But too \n     often in recent years, our country seems to have lost sight \n     of that ideal. We ignore it at our peril.\n       Service to others takes many forms. It can be an act of \n     kindness to a friend or neighbor, volunteering at a soup \n     kitchen or local hospital, standing up for civil rights and \n     against poverty and discrimination or working with others on \n     the countless challenges that face society. Each of these \n     acts is important--essential--to our well being. Each act \n     expresses our morality, our commitment to the enduring values \n     of peace, justice and truth. My brother Robert Kennedy told \n     by students of Capetown in South Africa in the 1960's: ``Each \n     time a man stands up for an idea, or acts to improve the lot \n     of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a \n     tiny ripple of hope. And crossing each other from a million \n     different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a \n     mighty current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of \n     oppression and resistance.''\n       I know that the spirit of volunteerism is alive and well as \n     Fairfield. You have staffed the Head Start program in \n     Bridgeport, teaching basic skills to disadvantaged children. \n     Nursing students staff a health promotion center that also \n     assists the poor. Some of you are active in Project Children, \n     which has made a tremendous impact on the children of \n     Northern Ireland, by giving them opportunities to visit the \n     United States. Other have worked in third world countries \n     like Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and Jamaica. And I am \n     particularly delighted that Fairfield will host 520 athletes \n     next month for the Special Olympics International World \n     Games. I commend you for the example you have set, and I hope \n     you will continue to find such opportunities for service \n     throughout your lives.\n       Much of my own work has been with an organization called \n     Very Special Arts, which tries to bring experience with the \n     arts to people with disabilities. It is amazing, what men and \n     women and children can achieve no matter how great their \n     difficulties. Patients who can barely communicate can learn \n     to write beautiful poetry. A deaf child can learn to dance, a \n     paraplegic to play music by using \n\n[[Page S 11945]]\n     his toes or to paint with his mouth. The joy they discover in their \n     achievements is indescribable. Every one, in a unique way, is \n     a miracle of our common humanity and our care for one \n     another.\n       In its own way, a miracle on a large scale is happening \n     today in Northern Ireland. Peace, which had eluded the people \n     for so long, has now been a faithful presence for many \n     months. The guns and bombs are silent, and Protestants and \n     Catholics alike are finding how much they can accomplish \n     together when violence no longer oppresses their community. \n     It makes me proud of my country to know that America is \n     helping this dream of peace and reconciliation to come true.\n       I arrived in Ireland as ambassador 30 years after President \n     Kennedy's famous visit in 1963. One of my first trips was to \n     County Wexford, ``where our ancestors had lived. At the \n     heritage center there, I type the name of my great-\n     grandfather into a computer. The screen read: ``Patrick \n     Joseph Kennedy, Age: 28. Literacy: None.''\n       This year, as we observe the 150th anniversary of the Great \n     Famine, when millions were forced to leave Ireland, those \n     words symbolize for me their courage, faith and \n     determination. These immigrants came to this country \n     penniless, without their families and without education, in \n     order to build a better life for themselves and their \n     children in the freedom and opportunity of this land. We are \n     a nation of immigrants. And our diversity has helped make us \n     strong. But our faith will keep us free.\n       You, the members of this graduating class, will make all \n     the difference in maintaining these high ideals in the years \n     ahead. The success of your neighborhood, your community and \n     our country will depend on you. You will be asked to take \n     chances, to take risks, to take action. The ripples of hope \n     that you send forth will make America a better country in a \n     better world.\n       As my brother Robert said, ``This world demands the \n     qualities of youth: not a time of life, but a state of mind, \n     a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, \n     predominance of courage over timidity--of the appetite for \n     adventure over the love of ease.''\n       I wish you great adventure, happiness and fulfillment in \n     all that you do--for yourselves and others.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/08/senate-section/article/S11944-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2302) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to request my colleagues' support \nfor S. \n\n[[Page S 11949]]\n227, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, sound recordings--whether records, CD's, or tapes--are \nthe only copyrighted works capable of performance that do not enjoy a \nperformance right under our copyright law, even though they enjoy such \na right in over 60 other nations. That simple fact, and the policies \nthat underlie it, is what S. 227 is all about. All other works, whether \nthey be films, plays, operas, songs, or ballets are protected by the \nperformance right which guarantees that when their works are heard or \nseen publicly, those who created and produced the work are compensated.\n  This legislation has been a long time in coming. From the very first \nmoment that Federal copyright protection was extended to sound \nrecordings in 1972, Congress has been concerned about whether this \ndiscrimination with regard to the performance right makes sense. In the \nCopyright Act of 1976, we ordered the Register of Copyrights to study \nthis problem and to report to Congress ``after consulting with \nrepresentatives of owners of copyrighted materials, representatives of \nthe broadcasting, recording, motion picture, entertainment industries, \nand arts organizations, representatives of organized labor and \nperformers of copyrighted materials.'' 17 U.S.C. Section 114(d).\n  The report of the Copyright Office strongly recommended the adoption \nof a sweeping performance right for sound recordings. Over 10 years \nlater, Congress requested a supplemental study of the issue, one that \nwould take into account the many technological and legal changes in the \nintervening years. That report, filed in October of 1991, reaffirmed \nthe view that sound recordings are illogically and unfairly \ndiscriminated against in our copyright law, with clearly identifiable \nadverse consequences for American artists individually and for our \nbalance of trade in general.\n  Responding to these studies, Senator Feinstein and I filed S. 1421 in \nthe last Congress. That bill did not seek to create a performance right \nfor all public performances of sound records, but instead addressed the \nmost immediate threat to the owners of copyright in sound recordings--\nthe ease of copying and greater fidelity that is achievable through the \ntransmission of sound recordings by means of digital technologies.\n  We were unable to achieve passage of S. 1421 in the 103d Congress, \nbut, because of the discussions and negotiations held throughout the \npast 2 years, we are able to present to this\n body a bill that accommodates the legitimate interests of everyone \ninvolved in the music licensing, distribution, and performance systems. \nThe new digital performance right created by this bill applies to \ndigital audio transmission of sound recordings which are part of an \ninteractive service, or for which a subscriber pays a fee. The bill \ndoes not apply to traditional broadcasts and most other free \ntransmissions, transmissions within business establishments, and \ntransmissions made by commercial music services to businesses, among \nothers. In drawing these lines, the Judiciary Committee, which I have \nthe honor of chairing, attempted to balance the competing interests of \nthe various copyright owners as well as users, and we think we have \ngotten it right.\n\n  S. 227 was unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee on June \n29, 1995. Indeed, I am pleased to note that, in addition to Senator \nFeinstein and myself, the bill is now cosponsored by Senator DeWine, \nSenator Simpson, Senator Lott, Senator Baucus, Senator Thurmond, and \nSenator Leahy. I believe it is ready for approval by the Senate today.\n  I should note that I am proposing today a substitute that contains a \nnumber of technical corrections to the bill as approved by the \nJudiciary Committee. The legislation is complex, and we have attempted \nto correct some inconsistent uses of defined terms and other technical \nerrors. In addition, we have adopted a number of suggestions made by \nthe Copyright Office to improve the procedures provided for in the \nlegislation for negotiating and arbitrating royalty rates and terms. I \nam submitting a description of these changes and a section-by-section \nanalysis for the Record along with this statement for the information \nof my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, today is an important day for creators of American \nmusic. Today we are correcting an anomalous inequity in our copyright \nlaw. Although American music has long been the world's most popular, we \nhave strangely not given the creators of sound recordings a right to \ncontrol and be remunerated for their works. Today we take a substantial \nstep to ending that inequity.\n  This bill is forward looking. It largely leaves in place mature \nbusinesses that have grown up under the old copyright regime. It seeks \nto ensure that creators of sound recordings will have the rights they \nhave been denied until now as the digital age dawns.\n  This bill also will help protect the creators of American music \nabroad by strengthening our international position in negotiating \nsafeguards for the makers of American music performed in other \ncountries, as it is all over the world.\n  Mr. President, it is important that the creators of America's music--\nwhether they compose the score, write the lyrics, sing the songs, or \nproduce the recordings--be fairly and equitably compensated for the \npublic performances that result. For too long they have not been.\n  I therefore ask my colleagues to support and pass S. 227, so that \nthis long overdue protection can be at last provided.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a description of the changes from \nthe committee-approved bill, and a new section-by-section analysis be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Description of Technical Corrections To the Committee-Approved Bill\n\n\n      section 114(d)(1)--exempt transmissions and retransmissions\n\n       As originally approved by the Committee, the bill generally \n     used to term ``transmission'' to refer to all transmissions, \n     and the term ``retransmission'' to refer to the subset of \n     transmissions that are further transmissions of initial \n     transmissions. Thus, for example, new section 106(6) granted \n     an exclusive right to perform a copyrighted sound recording \n     publicly ``by means of a digital audio transmission,'' and \n     did not mention retransmissions, even though it was intended \n     that the new performance right would cover all digital audio \n     transmissions, including retransmissions.\n       Use of those terms in section 114(d)(1) was not always \n     consistent with that general usage. The corrected bill uses \n     these terms consistently. To clarify the original intention \n     of the bill, the following changes were made:\n       In section 114(j), a new definition of the term \n     ``transmission'' was added to clarify that that term includes \n     retransmissions. \n     The definitions of the terms ``broadcast'' \n     transmission, ``retransmission'' and ``non- subscription'' \n     transmission were also revised to reflect this clarification.\n       In section 114(d)(1), the phrase ``or retransmission'' has \n     been deleted in several places where it is not necessary in \n     light of the new definitions.\n       Section 114(d)(1)(A) also was revised to reflect the \n     clarified definitions. Subparagraph (A) originally was \n     intended to exempt nonsubscription transmissions being \n     initially delivered to the public, such as nonsubscription \n     broadcast transmissions. With the clarification of the \n     definitions, it became necessary to specify more precisely \n     which transmissions are covered by this exemption. Thus, \n     under the corrected bill, a transmission is exempt if it is \n     either:\n       A nonsubscription transmission other than a retransmission \n     (such as a nonbroadcast nonsubscription digital audio service \n     that originates its transmissions rather than retransmitting \n     a programming feed);\n       An initial nonsubscription retransmission made for direct \n     reception by members of the public of a prior or simultaneous \n     incidental transmission that is not made for direct reception \n     by members of the public (such as an initial retransmission \n     to the public of a network feed--whether the feed itself is \n     exempt remains governed by section 114(d)(1)(C)(i)); or\n       A nonsubscription broadcast transmission. As defined in \n     section 114(j)(2), this category includes all nonsubscription \n     broadcast transmissions made by terrestrial broadcast \n     stations licensed by the FCC, whether an initial transmission \n     (such as a local newscast) or a retransmission (such as the \n     retransmission of a feed supplied by a network or \n     syndicator). This clause does not cover retransmissions by \n     entities other than broadcast stations (such as cable \n     systems) of transmissions made by broadcast stations; whether \n     such retransmissions are themselves exempt remains governed \n     by section 114(d)(1)(B) and, to some extent, section \n     114(d)(1)(C).\n       In light of the technical amendments to section \n     114(d)(1)(A), transmissions exempted \n\n[[Page S 11950]]\n     by section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) may already be exempt under section \n     114(d)(1)(A). For example, since section 114(d)(1)(A) exempts \n     all nonsubscription broadcast tarnsmissions (including \n     nonsubscription broadcast retransmissions), the \n     retransmissions by terrestrial broadcast stations that are \n     exempted by Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) are also exempt under \n     section 114(d)(1)(A)(iii). To leave no doubt about the \n     intention to exempt the retransmissions described in section \n     114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) (without regard to the 150-mile limitation \n     generally applicable under section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)), that \n     section has been left intact.\n       In addition, section 114(d)(1)(C)(iii), an incorrect \n     reference to section 522(12) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 was corrected.\n\n\n section 114(d)(3)-- licenses for transmissions by interactive services\n\n       Subparagraph (A) limits the duration of exclusive \n     performance licenses granted to interactive services, and \n     subparagraph (B)(i) provides an exception to this limitation \n     if a record company grants sufficient licenses to multiple \n     interactive services. In describing this exception, the bill \n     as originally approved referred to a percentage of the sound \n     recordings licensed by a sound recording copyright owner ``on \n     an exclusive basis.'' However, to encourage diversity of \n     licensing, the percentage should not be calculated based only \n     on the number of sound recordings licensed ``on an exclusive \n     basis.'' Thus, the\n      corrected bill deletes the phrase ``on an exclusive basis'' \n     to make clear that the percentage should be calculated \n     based on the number of sound recordings licensed by the \n     copyright owner on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis.\n       Subparagraph (D) has been revised to use the phrase \n     ``retransmission of a digital audio transmission,'' which \n     conforms to the terms defined and used throughout the bill.\n\n\n            section 114(d)(4)--rights not otherwise limited\n\n       As the bill was originally approved, subparagraph (B)(ii) \n     made clear that none of the changes made by the bill to \n     section 114 of the Copyright Act is to affect the existing \n     reproduction and distribution rights of sound recording and \n     musical work copyright owners. Of course, the changes to \n     section 114 are not intended to affect the adaptation rights \n     of sound recording and musical work copyright owners either. \n     The corrected bill adds a specific reference to section \n     106(2) of the Act to avoid any implication to the contrary.\n\n\n   section 114(f)--licenses for nonexempt subscription transmissions\n\n       The Copyright Office provided thoughtful comments on \n     various aspects of the bill as originally approved, including \n     particularly those provisions concerning the mechanics of \n     establishing statutory licensing royalty rates and terms. The \n     corrected bill includes revised language to address a number \n     of issues raised by those comments and related issues.\n       In paragraph (2):\n       New language makes clear that if an arbitration proceeding \n     is necessary to establish the initial statutory licensing \n     rates and terms, it will commence only upon the filing of a \n     petition during a 60-day period which will commence 6 months \n     after publication of notice of the initiation of the \n     voluntary negotiation proceeding.\n       Language (already used in new section 115(c)(3)(D)) is \n     added to clarify that the objectives set forth in existing \n     section 801(b)(1) of the Copyright Act are to be considered \n     by arbitration panels in setting statutory licensing rates \n     and terms.\n       A reference to ``terms'' is added to clarify that \n     arbitration panels may consider voluntarily negotiated \n     license terms in determining the terms applicable to \n     statutory licenses.\n       A sentence was deleted at the suggestion of the Copyright \n     Office because substantially the same language already \n     appears in existing section 802(c) of the Copyright Act.\n       The words ``and made available'' were added to be \n     consistent with the provisions of new section 115(c)(3)(D).\n       Paragraph (4) of the bill was rewritten to clarify when \n     voluntary negotiation or arbitration proceedings should \n     commence. Under the revised paragraph, the Librarian of \n     Congress is to publish notice of the initiation of voluntary \n     negotiation proceedings:\n       (a) within 30 days after being petitioned to publish notice \n     concerning a new type of digital audio transmission service; \n     and\n       (b) in January 2000, and every five years thereafter.\n       If voluntary negotiations do not lead to an agreement among \n     the interested parties, an arbitration may be commenced upon \n     the filing of a petition in accordance with existing section \n     803(a)(1) of the Copyright Act during a specified 60-day \n     period. That period commences:\n       (a) six months after publication of notice of the \n     initiation of a voluntary negotiation proceeding concerning a \n     new type of digital audio transmission service; and\n       (b) on July 1, 2000, and every five years thereafter.\n       Regardless of when an arbitration proceeding is commenced, \n     it is to be concluded in accordance with the existing \n     procedures in section 802 of the Copyright Act.\n       In paragraph (5)(A)(i), an erroneous reference to the \n     ``Register of Copyrights'' has been corrected.\n\n\n      section 114(i)--No Effect on Royalties for Underlying Works\n\n       The form of a reference to section 106(6) was conformed to \n     other references in the bill.\n                      section 114(j)--definitions\n\n       As explained in connection with section 114(d)(1), the \n     corrected bill includes a new definition of the term \n     ``transmission'' and several revised definitions intended to \n     clarify the original intention of the bill concerning the use \n     of those terms:\n       The revised definition of ``transmission'' clarifies the \n     intention that that term covers both all initial \n     transmissions and all retransmissions.\n       To reflect the use of the term ``broadcast'' transmission \n     in section 114(d)(1)(A)(iii), as described above, the \n     definition has been limited to transmissions by terrestrial \n     broadcast stations. Whether nonbroadcast nonsubscription \n     transmissions, for example by non-terrestrial services (such \n     as satellite services), are exempt is governed by sections \n     114(d)(1)(A) (i) and (ii).\n       The definition of ``nonsubscription'' transmission was \n     simplified in light of the other definitional changes.\n       The definition of ``retransmission'' previously set forth \n     only an example of a retransmission. As modified, the \n     provision defines the term as a further transmission of an \n     initial transmission, as well as any further retransmission \n     of the same transmission. Except as otherwise provided, a \n     transmission is a ``retransmission'' only if it is \n     simultaneous with the initial transmission.\n\n\n                           section 115(a)(1)\n\n       The phrase ``by means of a digital audio transmission'' was \n     deleted because it is redundant.\n\n\n                          section 115(c)(3)(B)\n\n       The phrase ``for the purpose of this subparagraph'' was \n     deleted because it is incorrect. The corrected provision \n     conforms with the language of new section 114(e)(1).\n\n\n                          section 115(c)(3)(C)\n\n       This subparagraph was revised to provide that once \n     statutory licensing rates and terms are established, they \n     shall remain in effect until successor rates and terms are \n     established, either by negotiation or, if necessary, \n     arbitration. In addition, a reference to ``digital \n     transmissions'' was replaced with the more precise term \n     ``digital phonorecord deliveries.''\n\n\n                          section 115(c)(3)(D)\n\n       This subparagraph has been revised in several ways to \n     clarify the mechanics of establishing compulsory licensing \n     royalty rates and terms:\n       References to subparagraph (B) have been added because \n     negotiations conducted under the procedures of subparagraph \n     (C) are covered by the provisions of subparagraph (B).\n       An arbitration proceeding is to commence only upon the \n     filing of a petition in accordance with existing section \n     803(a)(1). (Unlike arbitration under section 114, however, a \n     petition of arbitration under section 115(c)(3)(D) may be \n     filed at any time during the calendar year in which the \n     mechanical royalty rates and terms for digital phonorecord \n     deliveries are to be established.)\n       Once statutory licensing rates and terms are established, \n     they shall remain in effect until successor rates and terms \n     are established, either by negotiation or, if necessary, \n     arbitration.\n       A reference to ``digital transmissions'' was replaced with \n     the more precise term ``digital phonorecord deliveries.''\n       Arbitration panels may consider voluntarily negotiated \n     license ``terms'' as well as ``rates'' in determining \n     statutory licenses.\n       A sentence was deleted at the suggestion of the Copyright \n     Office because substantially the same language already \n     appears in existing section 802(c) of the Copyright Act.\n\n\n                          section 115(c)(3)(E)\n\n       Subparagraph (E)(i) was revised to make clear that the \n     limitation on ``controlled composition'' clauses applies not \n     only to contracts where a recording artist who is the author \n     of a musical work grants a mechanical license in the work \n     that, but also to contracts where the recording artist \n     commits another person\n      (such as the artist's music publisher) to grant a mechanical \n     license in that work.\n       Several additional minor corrections were made to this \n     subparagraph:\n       References to subparagraph (F) were added to recognize that \n     subparagraphs (C), (D) and (F) all are relevant to \n     determining compulsory licensing rates and terms.\n       The introduction to subparagraph (E)(ii) has been corrected \n     to refer only to the second sentence of subparagraph (E)(i), \n     because the exceptions contained in subparagraph (E)(ii) are \n     not relevant to the first sentence of subparagraph (E)(i).\n       In subparagraph (E)(ii), ambiguous references to ``such \n     rates'' and to ``the right to grant licenses'' have been \n     replaced with more specific language.\n\n\n                          section 115(c)(3)(F)\n\n       As the bill was originally approved, this subparagraph \n     provided that mechanical royalty rates and terms for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries were to be reexamined every ten years, \n     as provided in section 803(a)(3), except to the extent that \n     different years for doing so were determined by agreement of \n     the parties. If the parties did not agree on the shorter \n     period for determining rates, the issue would have been \n     subject to arbitration. It is preferable to provide a shorter \n     period by statute, in the event the parties do not agree, to \n     reexamine whether circumstances \n\n[[Page S 11951]]\n     warrant a change in mechanical license rates and terms. Thus, the \n     procedures specified in subparagraphs (C) and (D) shall next \n     be repeated in five years if the parties do not choose \n     another year.\n\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(H)\n\n       Several corrections were made to this subparagraph:\n       In subparagraph (H)(i), an erroneous reference to section \n     510 was deleted.\n       New language in subparagraph (H)(i)(II) makes clear that, \n     if no compulsory license is obtained, it is the musical work \n     copyright owner (or someone acting under that person's \n     authority) who must authorize the making of digital \n     phonorecord deliveries of the musical work to digital \n     phonorecord deliveries of the musical work to satisfy the \n     requirements of subparagraph (H)(i)(II).\n       In subparagraph (H)(i)(II), the word ``nondramatic'' was \n     deleted to confirm that the provisions of subparagraph (H) \n     apply to digital phonorecord deliveries of sound recordings \n     of both dramatic and nondramatic musical works.\n       In subparagraph (H)(ii), an erroneous reference to \n     subsection (c)(5) was corrected.\n\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(I)\n\n       Because section 115 generally applies only to nondramatic \n     musical works, the word ``nondramatic'' was added to this \n     subparagraph.\n\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(J)\n\n       An erroneous reference to paragraph (7) was corrected.\n\n\n                         Conforming Amendments\n\n       Additional conforming amendments have been added to the \n     bill. These clarify the relationship between section 803 of \n     the Copyright Act and the new arbitration provisions of \n     sections 114 and 115.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n       Section 1--Short Title.--This section sets forth the title \n     of the Act, the ``Digital Performance Right in Sound \n     Recordings Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2--Exclusive Rights in Copyrighted Works.--This \n     section amends section 106 of title 17 to add a new paragraph \n     (6) to provide an exclusive right to perform a copyrighted \n     sound recording publicly by means of a digital audio \n     transmission.\n       Section 3--Scope of Exclusive Rights in Sound Recordings.--\n     This section amends section 114(a) by adding a reference to \n     new section 106(6) in the list of exclusive rights granted to \n     the owner of a copyright in a sound recording.\n       This section also amends the language of section 114(b) \n     relating to the tangible medium of expression in which sound \n     recordings can be duplicated. Instead of referring only to \n     phonorecords or ``copies of motion pictures and other \n     audiovisual works,'' the new language recognizes that sound \n     recordings can be reproduced in copies of any kind. As \n     multimedia technologies begin to blur the lines between \n     different categories of works capable of being embodied in \n     copies, the Committee deemed it important to confirm that, \n     subject to the specific limitations in section 114(b), sound \n     recordings enjoy the full scope of protection afforded by the \n     reproduction right under section 106(1).\n       This section also strikes section 114(d) of title 17, an \n     obsolete provision that directed the Register of Copyrights \n     to submit a report on performance rights to Congress on \n     January 3, 1978, and replaces it with new subsections (d) \n     through (i), as described below.\n\n             Section 114(d). Limitations on Exclusive Right\n\n      Section 114(d)(1). Exempt Transmissions and Retransmissions\n\n       Section 114(d)(1) is designed to ensure that the new right \n     provided to owners of copyright in sound recordings with \n     respect to certain digital public performances of those \n     recordings will not affect nonsubscription transmissions \n     being initially delivered to the public (such as radio or \n     television broadcasts), certain retransmissions of those \n     transmissions, and certain other transmissions (including \n     retransmissions) that the Committee believes should not be \n     subject to the new right.\n       To take advantage of the Section 114(d)(1) exemptions, a \n     transmission must not be part of an ``interactive service'' \n     as defined in Section 114(j)(4). The Committee anticipates \n     that this requirement will not present any difficulty for the \n     types of services covered by the Section 114(d)(1) exemption. \n     The term ``interactive service'' is intended to cover only \n     services in which an individual can arrange for the \n     transmission of a specific sound recording to that person or \n     another, individually.\n       Under Section 114(d)(1), a transmission will be exempt from \n     the new right under Section 106(6) if it falls into at least \n     one of the following categories:\n\n     Section 114(d)(1)(A) (certain nonsubscription) transmissions)\n\n       Under this provision, any transmission to members of the \n     public that is not a part of an interactive service is exempt \n     from the new digital performance right if it is either: a \n     nonsubscription transmission other than a retransmission \n     (such as a nonbroadcast nonsubscription digital audio service \n     that originates its transmissions rather than retransmitting \n     a programming feed); an initial nonsubscription \n     retransmission made for direct reception by members of the \n     public of a prior or simultaneous incidental transmission \n     that is not made for direct reception by members of the \n     public (such as an initial retransmission to the public of a \n     network feed; whether the feed itself is exempt is governed \n     by section 114(d)(1)(C)(i)); or a nonsubscription broadcast \n     transmission. As defined  in  section  114(j)(2),  this  \n     category includes  all  nonsubscription  broadcast \n     transmissions made by terrestrial broadcast stations licensed \n     by the FCC, whether an initial transmission (such as a local \n     newscast) or a retransmission (such as the retransmission of \n     a feed supplied by a network or syndicator). This clause does \n     not cover retransmissions by entities other than broadcast \n     stations (such as cable systems) of transmissions made by \n     broadcast stations; whether such retransmissions are \n     themselves exempt is governed by section 114(d)(1)(B) and, to \n     some extent, section 114(d)(1)(C).\n       The classic example of such an exempt transmission is a \n     transmission to the general public by a free over-the-air \n     broadcast station, such as a traditional radio or television \n     station, and the Committee intends that such transmissions be \n     exempt regardless of whether they are in a digital or non-\n     digital format, in whole or in part.\n\n  Section 114(d)(1)(B) (retransmissions of nonsubscription broadcast \n                             transmissions)\n\n       In general, this provision exempts all retransmissions of \n     nonsubscription broadcast transmissions, whether the retrans-\n     missions are offered on a subscription or a nonsubscription \n     basis. Retransmissions of radio station broadcast \n     transmissions, however, are exempt only if they are not part \n     of an interactive service and fall within certain specified \n     categories, which are discussed in detail below.\n       The Committee has created the Section 114(d)(1)(B) \n     exemption because it is aware that cable systems and other \n     multichannel programming distributors often offer re-\n     transmissions of nonsubscription broadcast transmissions to \n     their customers. At present, copyright liability for these \n     retransmissions  ordinarily  is  covered  pur-suant to \n     Sections 111 and 119 of the Act. The Committee  intends,  \n     subject  to the limitations discussed below concerning \n     retransmissions  of  radio  broadcasts,  that all \n     noninteractive retransmissions of noninteractive \n     nonsubscription broadcast transmissions be exempt from the \n     new digital sound recording performance right. These \n     retransmissions will be exempt even if the cable system (or \n     other retransmission service) limits the delivery of the \n     retransmission to its customers and charges a fee to receive \n     the retransmission. In other words, retransmissions of \n     broadcast stations' signals will be exempt even if the \n     retransmissions are themselves ``subscription'' transmissions \n     under the Act. A cable system's delivery of a retransmitted \n     radio broadcast signal within 150 miles of the transmitter, \n     for example, will be exempt under Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i), \n     even if the cable system charges a monthly fee to subscribers \n     to receive the signal.\n       Retransmissions of the broadcast transmissions of radio \n     stations are exempt pursuant to Section 114(d)(1)(B) only if \n     they fall within one of the categories listed in paragraphs \n     114(d)(1)(B)(i) through (B)(iv):\n       Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i) (retransmission of radio  signals  \n     within  150  mile  radius  of transmitter).--Under this \n     provision, retransmissions of a radio station within a 150 \n     mile radius of the site of that station's transmitter are \n     exempt, whether retrans-mitted on a subscription or a \n     nonsubscription basis, provided that they are not part of an \n     interactive service.\n       This provision does not, however, exempt the willful or \n     repeated retransmission of a radio station's broadcast \n     transmission more than a 150 mile radius from the radio \n     station's transmitter. The Committee recognizes that the 150 \n     mile limit could serve as a dangerous trap for the \n     uninitiated or inattentive. To ensure against that \n     possibility, Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i) provides that a \n     retransmission beyond the\n      150 mile radius will fall outside the exemption only if the \n     retransmission is willful or repeated. The Committee \n     intends the phrase ``willful or repeated'' to be \n     understood in the same way that phrase was used in Section \n     111 of the Act, as explained in the House Report on the \n     1976 Act, H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 93 \n     (1976).\n       Pursuant to Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I), the 150-mile \n     limitation does not apply when a nosubscription broadcast \n     transmission by an FCC-licensed station is retransmitted on a \n     nonsubscription basis by an FCC-licensed terrestrial \n     broadcast station, terrestrial translator, or terrestrial \n     repeater. In other words, a radio station's broadcast \n     transmission may be retransmitted by another FCC-licensed \n     basis without regard to the 150 mile restriction.\n       The Committee notes that transmissions exempted by section \n     114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) may already be exempt under section \n     114(d)(1)(A). For example, since section 114(d)(1)(A) exempts \n     all nonsubscription broadcast transmissions (including \n     nonsubscription broadcast retransmissions), the \n     retransmissions by terrestrial broadcast stations that are \n     exempted by Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) are also exempt under \n     section 114(d)(1)(A)(iii). To leave no doubt about the \n     intention to exempt the retransmissions described in section \n     114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) (without regard to the 150-mile limitation \n     generally applicable under section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)), that \n     section has been included in the bill in this form.\n\n[[Page S 11952]]\n\n       Under Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(II), when a retransmission \n     covered by Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i)(I) is itself retransmitted \n     on a subscription basis, the 150-mile radius is measured from \n     the transmitter site of the broadcast retransmitter (whether \n     a station, translator, or repeater). This means that a cable \n     system (or other subscription retransmitter) can, without \n     incurring liability under Section 106(6), retransmit a \n     broadcast retransmission within 150 miles of the transmitter \n     site of the station, translator, or repeater that is making \n     the retransmission.\n       Section 106(6) is not intended to apply to the transmission \n     of a local radio station's programming free of charge to \n     local or long distance callers who are put ``on hold'' during \n     a telephone call with a business, nor is the bill intended to \n     change current law as it applies to such performances of \n     copyrighted musical works under section 106(4).\n       Section 114(d)(1)(B)(ii) (all-band retrans-missions of \n     radio transmissions received over the air).--This provision \n     is intended to permit retransmitters (such as cable systems) \n     to offer retransmissions to their local subscribers of all \n     radio stations that the retransmitter is able to pick up \n     using an over-the-air antenna. (These are sometimes called \n     ``all-band'' retransmissions.) There are three requirements \n     for this exemption: (1) the retransmitter (such as a cable \n     system) must obtain the radio broadcast transmission over the \n     air; (2) the broadcast transmission must not be \n     electronically processed by the retransmitter as separate and \n     discrete signals (as that term is used in 37 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 201.17(b)(4)), and (3) the transmissions must be \n     retransmitted only within the local communities served by the \n     retransmitter. Since some radio station broadcast \n     transmissions can be picked up over the air beyond 150 miles, \n     this provision is intended to ensure that the 150-mile \n     limitation in Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i) will not create \n     unintended liability for all-band retransmissions.\n       Section 114(d)(1)(B)(iii) (grandfathering).--This provision \n     exempts certain other retransmissions of radio broadcast \n     transmissions, again without regard to the 150 mile limit in \n     Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i). The requirements for this exemption \n     are as follows: (1) the radio station's transmission was \n     being retransmitted by a satellite carrier on January 1, 1995 \n     (as was, for example, Chicago radio station WFMT); (2) that \n     retransmission was being retransmitted by cable systems (as \n     defined in Section 111(f) of the Act) as a separate and \n     discrete signal; (3) the satellite carrier receives the radio \n     station's transmission in analog form; and (4) the broadcast \n     transmission being retransmitted embodies the programming of \n     no more than one radio station (i.e., the station must not \n     the multiplexed).\n       Section 114(d)(1)(B)(iv) (nonsubscription broadcast \n     retransmissions of public radio station broadcast \n     transmissions)--The Committee recognizes that noncommercial \n     educational radio stations rely on a variety of types of \n     broadcast retransmissions to deliver their programming to the \n     public. This provision establishes an exemption for such \n     retransmissions. Specifically, this provision exempts both \n     simultaneous and nonsimultaneous retransmissions of broadcast \n     transmissions originally made by federally funded \n     noncommercial educational radio stations, provided that the \n     retransmissions are carried out through nonsubscription \n     terrestrial broadcasts. To qualify, the noncommercial \n     educational radio station's broadcasts must consist of news, \n     informational, cultural, public affairs, or other \n     ``educational and cultural'' programming to the public. The \n     150-mile limitation of Section 114(d)(1)(B)(i) does not apply \n     to retransmissions that qualify for this exemption.\n       Many noncommercial educational stations also use \n     intermediate nonbroadcast transmission links to broadcast \n     their programming to the public, and those nonbroadcast \n     transmissions or retransmissions may be exempt under other \n     provisions of the bill.\n\n Section 114(d)(1)(C) (other exempt transmissions and retransmissions)\n\n       This provision exempts certain other categories of \n     transmissions, without regard to whether they are \n     subscription transmissions or nonsubscription transmissions. \n     The categories exempted under this provision are as follows:\n       Section 114(d)(1)(C)(i) (incidental transmissions).--In the \n     course of arranging for the delivery of an exempt \n     transmission, many incidental transmissions may take place. \n     For example, a radio or television station may receive a \n     satellite feed from a network or from another station that \n     provides programming to the station; a station or network may \n     receive a ``backhaul'' transmission from a sports or news \n     event at a remote location; or a station may deliver a clean \n     feed of its broadcast transmission to a cable system to \n     ensure that the cable system's retransmission will be of the \n     highest technical quality. Among other things, Section \n     114(d)(1)(C)(i) exempts transmissions of a broadcast station \n     that both broadcasts its signal to the public and, either \n     immediately or through intermediate terrestrial links, \n     transmits that signal by satellite to other broadcast \n     stations for their simultaneous or subsequent broadcast to \n     the public. The Committee intends that all such incidental \n     transmissions be exempt from the new digital performance \n     right under Section 106(6) regardless of whether they are \n     made on a subscription or a nonsubscription basis, and \n     regardless of whether some or all portions of a transmission \n     are in a digital format. Thus, section 114(d)(1)(C)(i) also \n     exempts an incidental transmission, as described above, by a \n     subscription digital transmission service to a cable system \n     to the extent that the cable system is engaging in an exempt \n     retransmission of that transmission to a business \n     establishment pursuant to section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv). The \n     Committee does not intend, however, for any subscription \n     transmission intended for reception directly by members of \n     the public to fall within the category of exempt incidental \n     transmissions. To qualify for this ``incidental'' exemption, \n     transmissions must be made for the purpose of facilitating an \n     exempt transmission. Thus, a transmission that is available \n     for general reception by the public (for example, through the \n     Internet), which is not being used to facilitate an exempt \n     transmission, would not qualify as an ``incidental'' \n     transmission under this section.\n       Section 114(d)(1)(C)(ii) (transmissions by businesses on \n     and around their premises).--Businesses often utilize \n     transmissions on or around their premises that include \n     prerecorded musical works. This activity is sometimes called \n     ``storecasting.'' The Committee is aware that there has been \n     extensive litigation over the scope of Section 110(5) of the \n     Act relating to the particular circumstances under which \n     businesses are liable to the copyright owners of musical \n     works when they utilize transmissions\n      containing such works on and around their premises. To leave \n     absolutely no doubt that the new Section 106(6) right is \n     not intended to create any comparable right in the owners \n     of copyright in sound recordings regarding ``storecasts,'' \n     Section 114(d)(1)(C)(ii) specifically provides that the \n     new right does not reach transmissions on or around \n     business premises. In particular, Section 114(d)(1)(C)(ii) \n     would permit a business to engage in transmissions \n     (including retransmissions of any transmission) on its \n     premises or the immediately surrounding vicinity without \n     incurring liability to the copyright owners of sound \n     recordings under Section 106(6). This provision is not \n     intended to change the rights of copyright owners of \n     musical works regarding transmissions under existing law.\n       Section 114(d)(1)(C)(iii) (authorized retransmissions of \n     licensed transmissions).--To simplify licensing practices, \n     section 114(d)(1)(C)(iii) provides a ``through to the \n     listener'' exemption intended to permit retransmitters, \n     including cable systems, direct broadcast satellite (``DBS'') \n     service providers and other multichannel video programming \n     distributors (``MVPDs'') (as defined in the 1934 \n     Communications Act, as amended), simultaneously to retransmit \n     to the listener noninteractive music programming provided by \n     a licensed source. To qualify for this exemption, the \n     retransmission must be simultaneous with the original \n     transmission and authorized by the original transmitter; and \n     the original transmission must be licensed by the copyright \n     owner of the sound recording. Retransmissions are deemed to \n     be ``simultaneous'' even if there is some momentary time \n     delay resulting from the technology used for transmission or \n     retransmission.\n       Thus, Section 114(d)(1)(C)(iii) exempts retransmissions \n     from liability for copyright infringement where a \n     noninteractive music programmer transmitter has obtained a \n     public performance copyright license from the copyright owner \n     of the sound recording, and the retransmitter has not \n     obtained such a license but is authorized by the licensed \n     music programmer transmitter to retransmit the sound \n     recording. Retransmissions of this type are exempt under the \n     provisions of this Act, as the sound recordings retransmitted \n     are covered by the licenses that the music programmer \n     transmitter obtains from the sound recording copyright \n     owners.\n       Section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv) (certain transmissions to business \n     establishments).--This provision exempts from liability under \n     new section 106(6) certain noninteractive transmissions made \n     to business establishments for use in the ordinary course of \n     their business, such as for background music played in \n     offices, retail stores or restaurants.\n       To qualify, the transmission must meet all of the following \n     conditions: (a) the transmission must be to a business \n     establishment; (b) the transmission must be for use by the \n     business establishment in the ordinary course of its \n     business; (c) the business establishment must not retransmit \n     the transmission outside its premises or the immediately \n     surrounding vicinity; and (d) the transmission must not \n     exceed the sound recording performance complement, as defined \n     in Section 114(j)\n       If a business establishment retransmits the transmission in \n     a manner not otherwise exempted under subparagraph (C)(ii), \n     without the authority or prior knowledge of or any inducement \n     by any entity that transmitted the service to the business \n     establishment, then only the retransmission by the business \n     establishment is not exempt pursuant to subparagraph (C)(iv). \n     Under such circumstances, the non-exempt status of such a \n     retransmission would not affect the exempt status of the \n     transmission to that business establishment.\n       If the same subscription transmission service programming \n     is being transmitted to both business establishments and non-\n     business consumers, then only the transmission of that \n     service to the business establishments would qualify for an \n     exemption pursuant to subparagraph (C)(iv). As the bill \n\n[[Page S 11953]]\n     makes clear, nothing in this exemption is intended to limit the breadth \n     of the general exemption in Section 114(d)(1)(C)(ii) for \n     transmissions by business establishments on their premises, \n     or any of the other exemptions in this Section 114(d)(1).\n       Section 106(6) is not intended to apply to the transmission \n     of a commercial background music service free of charge to \n     local or long distance callers who are put ``on hold'' during \n     a telephone call with a business, nor is the bill intended to \n     change current law as it applies to such performances of \n     copyrighted musical works under section 106(4).\n\n             Section 114(d)(2). Subscription Transmissions\n\n       Subsection (d)(2) provides that certain subscription \n     transmissions may be subject to statutory licensing if the \n     transmissions conform to the criteria set forth in that \n     section. `'Subscription transmissions'' are defined in \n     subsection (j)(8) as transmissions limited to particular \n     recipients for which consideration is required to be paid. \n     Transmitters of noninteractive subscription transmissions \n     that are not otherwise exempt under subsection (d)(1) may be \n     eligible for a statutory license under subsection (f). A \n     ``statutory license'' guarantees that every noninteractive \n     subscription transmission service will receive a license to \n     perform the sound recording by means of a digital \n     transmission, provided that the transmission service pays the \n     royalty and complies with the terms prescribed in accordance \n     with subsection (f). The rates and terms will be set by \n     industry or individual negotiation, or if necessary, by a \n     copyright arbitration royalty panel convened pursuant to \n     chapter 8 of the Copyright Act.\n       In order to qualify for a statutory license, a performance \n     of a sound recording by digital audio transmission must meet \n     five conditions, enumerated in subparagraphs (A) through (E):\n       First, as already noted, the transmission cannot be part of \n     an ``interactive service'', as defined in subsection (j)(4). \n     Interactive services, which allow listeners to receive sound \n     recordings ``on-demand'', pose the greatest threat to \n     traditional record sales, as to which sound recording \n     copyright owners currently enjoy full exclusive rights. Thus, \n     in order to provide a comparable ability to control \n     distribution of their works, copyright owners of sound \n     recordings must have the right to negotiate the terms of \n     licenses granted to interactive services.\n       Second, subparagraph (B) requires that transmissions \n     subject to the statutory license cannot exceed the sound \n     recording performance complement defined in subsection \n     (j)(7). The complement, more fully described below, contains \n     limits on the number of selections a subscription \n     transmission service can play from any one phonorecord or \n     boxed set, or by the same featured recording artist pursuant \n     to the statutory license. For purposes of this subparagraph, \n     each channel of a multichannel service is a separate \n     ``transmission.''\n       Third, subparagraph (C) states that the transmitting entity \n     may not avail itself of the statutory license if it publishes \n     an advance program schedule or makes prior announcements of \n     the titles of specific sound recordings or phonorecords to be \n     transmitted. This provision addresses the situation in which \n     an entity informs its subscribers in advance as to when \n     particular sound recordings will be performed. A \n     preannouncement that does not use the title of the upcoming \n     selection would still come within this limitation so long as \n     it sufficiently identifies the selection through other \n     information, such as the artist's name and the song's well-\n     known current chart position. The limitation is not intended, \n     however, to prevent a transmitting entity from advertising \n     the names of illustrative sound recordings or phonorecords \n     that may, at some time, be performed by that entity under the \n     statutory license.\n       Fourth, the transmitting entity cannot automatically and \n     intentionally cause the receiver's equipment to switch from \n     one channel to another. This limitation does not apply to \n     transmissions made to a business establishment. This \n     subparagraph is intended to remedy the situation in which a \n     service licensed under the statutory license might \n     intentionally attempt to evade the sound recording \n     performance complement by switching a non-business \n     subscriber's receiver from one channel to another.\n       Finally, subparagraph (E) imposes as a condition of \n     statutory licensing the obligation of a subscription entity \n     to carry within its transmitted signal certain specified \n     types of information, if that information has been encoded in \n     the sound recording under the authority of the copyright \n     owner of that sound recording. This provision does not \n     obligate the copyright owner of the sound recording to encode \n     such copyright management information in the work, nor does \n     it limit the copyright owner's ability to select the types of \n     information (e.g., artist, title) to be encoded. In addition, \n     it is not intended to require a transmitting entity to \n     generate or encode such information in its transmission if \n     the information is not encoded in the sound recording. \n     Moreover, the transmitting entity is not required to transmit \n     information that may be encoded in the sound recording other \n     than the information specified in this subparagraph and \n     ``related information'' (i.e., information that is \n     specifically related to the identification of the works being \n     performed and upon which payments are to be made by the \n     transmitting entity under this bill). Subparagraph (E) also \n     makes clear that nothing in this section affects the \n     provisions of section 1002(e).\n\n Section 114(d)(3). Licenses for transmissions by interactive services\n\n       This provision places limits on the sound recording \n     copyright owner's exclusive right to license interactive \n     copyright owner's exclusive right to license interactive \n     services. (No limitations are imposed where the sound \n     recording copyright owner licenses an interactive service on \n     a nonexclusive basis.) As described below, an ``interactive \n     service'' includes on-line or other services that offer \n     ``pay-per-listen,'' ``audio-on-demand,'' or ``celestial \n     jukebox'' features, regardless of whether there is a charge \n     to receive the service. The Committee is aware of concerns \n     that the copyright owners of sound recordings might become \n     ``gatekeepers'' and limit opportunities for public \n     performances of the musical works embodied in the sound \n     recordings. The Committee believes that the limits set forth \n     in subsection (d)(3) appropriately resolve any such concerns.\n       Paragraph (3)(A) provides that the duration of an exclusive \n     license granted to an interactive service for the public \n     performance of a sound recording by means of digital audio \n     transmission cannot exceed 12 months. In the case of a \n     copyright owner that holds fewer than 1,000 copyrights in \n     sound recordings, an exclusive license to an interactive \n     service can last up to 24 months. In either case, after the \n     license expires, that interactive service cannot receive \n     another exclusive license for the same sound recording for a \n     period of 13 months.\n       The sound recording copyright owner is not subject to these \n     limitations in certain circumstances, as enumerated in \n     paragraph (3)(B). Subparagraph (B)(i) provides that the \n     limitations do not apply where the licensor has granted \n     performance licenses to at\n      least 5 different interactive services. Each license must be \n     for a significant portion of that segment of the \n     licensor's catalog of sound recordings that has been \n     licensed to interactive services--specifically, at least \n     10% of the sound recordings that have been licensed to \n     interactive services, but in no event less than 50 sound \n     recordings. For example, a record company would not be \n     subject to the limitations in paragraph (3)(A) if it has \n     granted performance licenses for a total of 10,000 sound \n     recordings to 5 different interactive services, and each \n     service received a performance license for at least 1,000 \n     sound recordings.\n       Subparagraph (B)(ii) provides that the limits on licenses \n     to interactive services also do not apply where the \n     performance license is granted for promotional purposes. The \n     sole purpose of the license must be to promote the \n     distribution or performance of the sound recording, and the \n     license can only permit a public performance of up to 45 \n     seconds. A qualifying public performance is merely exempted \n     from the limitation on licensing found in paragraph (3)(A); \n     subparagraph (B)(ii) does not provide an exemption from \n     infringement liability for a transmission otherwise subject \n     to liability.\n       Section 114(d)(3)(C) provides that, whether or not the \n     owner of copyright in a sound recording has granted an \n     exclusive or nonexclusive license to an interactive service, \n     the service must nevertheless obtain a license from a \n     performing rights society or from the copyright owner of the \n     musical work contained in the sound recording. This provision \n     does not affect any existing limitation under sections 107-\n     113, section 116-120, or the unmended portions of sections \n     114 and 115.\n       To simplify licensing practices, a ``through to the \n     listener'' exemption is provided in paragraph (3)(D) for \n     those entities that retransmit digital audio transmissions \n     from an interactive service. These retransmissions must be of \n     transmissions by an interactive service licensed to publicly \n     perform the sound recording; the retransmission must be \n     authorized by the interactive service; the retransmission \n     must be simultaneous with the transmission; and it must be \n     limited to the customer intended by the interactive service \n     to receive the transmission.\n       The definition of ``licensor'' in subparagraph (3)(E)(i) \n     makes clear that this term includes certain affiliates of the \n     copyright owner in sound recordings that own sound recording \n     copyrights--namely, affiliates under a material degree of \n     common ownership, management or control. Thus, the number of \n     sound recording copyrights held by such affiliates of a \n     record company must be included in a calculation to determine \n     whether that company has fewer than 1,000 sound recordings \n     for the purpose of paragraph (3)(A), and to determine whether \n     the record company has licensed a sufficient number of sound \n     recordings to satisfy the\n      requirements found in paragraph (3)(B)(i) regarding the \n     inapplicability of the exclusive licensing limitations.\n\n            Section 114(d)(4). Rights not otherwise limited\n\n       Under existing principles of copyright law, the \n     transmission or other communication to the public of a \n     musical work constitutes a public performance of that musical \n     work. In addition, the digital transmission of a sound \n     recording that results in the reproduction by or for the \n     transmission recipient of a phonorecord of that sound \n     recording implicates the exclusive rights to reproduce and \n     distribute the sound recording and the musical work embodied \n     therein. New technological uses of copyrighted sound \n     recordings are arising which require an affirmation of \n     existing \n\n[[Page S 11954]]\n     copyright principles and application of those principles to the digital \n     transmission of sound recordings, to encourage the creation \n     of and protect rights in those sound recordings and the \n     musical works they contain.\n       This subsection makes clear, in paragraph (4)(A), the \n     Committee's intent that except as explicitly provided in \n     section 114, nothing in that section limits the exclusive \n     right to perform a sound recording publicly by means of a \n     digital audio transmission. Paragraph (4)(B) also makes clear \n     that section 114 does not in any way limit the exclusive \n     right to publicly perform a musical work under section \n     106(4); the exclusive right in sound recordings and musical \n     works under sections 106(1), 106(2), and 106(3); and any \n     other rights and remedies available under title 17. \n     Similarly, the bill does not affect any existing limitation \n     under sections 107-113, sections 116-120, or the unamended \n     portions of sections 114 and 115.\n       Paragraph (4)(C) ensures that where an activity implicates \n     a sound recording copyright owner's rights under both section \n     106(6) and some other clause of section 106, the limitations \n     contained in section 114 shall not be construed to limit or \n     impair in any way any other rights the copyright owner may \n     have, or any other exemptions to which users may be entitled, \n     with respect to the particular activity. For example, where a \n     digital audio transmission is a digital phonorecord delivery \n     as well as a public performance of a sound recording, the \n     fact that the public performance may be exempt from liability \n     under section 114(d)(1) or subject to statutory licensing \n     under section 114(f) does not in any way limit or impair the \n     sound recording copyright owner's rights and remedies under \n     section 106(3) against the transmitter for the distribution \n     of a phonorecord of the sound recording. As another example, \n     where an interactive digital audio transmission constitutes a \n     distribution of a phonorecord as well as a public performance \n     of a sound recording, the fact that the transmitting entity \n     has obtained a license to perform the sound recording does \n     not in any way limit or affect the entity's obligation to \n     obtain a license to distribute phonorecords of the sound \n     recording.\n      Similarly, the bill does not affect any existing limitation \n     under sections 107-113, sections 116-120, or the unamended \n     portions of sections 114 and 115.\n\n               Section 114(e). Authority for negotiations\n\n       This subsection clarifies the applicability of the \n     antitrust laws to the use of common agents in negotiations \n     and agreements relating to statutory licenses and other \n     licenses.\n       Under subsection (e)(1), copyright owners of sound \n     recordings and operators of digital services (which perform \n     sound recordings affected by section 114) may collectively \n     negotiate statutory licenses for the performance of sound \n     recordings ``notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust \n     laws.'' This exemption from the antitrust laws extends to \n     negotiations and agreements on royalty rates and license \n     terms and conditions, the proportionate division of the \n     royalties among copyright owners, and the designation of \n     common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, \n     pay, or receive royalty payments.\n       Subsection (e)(1) closely follows the language of existing \n     antitrust exemptions in copyright law relating to the \n     negotiation of statutory licenses, including 17 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 116(b)(1) (jukebox licenses) and 17 U.S.C. Sec. 118(b) \n     (noncommercial broadcasting). Like those provisions, \n     subsection (e)(1) is important to help effectuate the related \n     statutory license provision. But unlike those provisions, \n     subsection (e)(1) provides that use of a common agent must be \n     nonexclusive.\n       The requirement of nonexclusivity is intended to preserve \n     the possibility of direct licensing negotiations between \n     individual copyright owners and operators of digital \n     services, rather than merely between their common agents. For \n     example, nonexclusivity should help prevent copyright owners \n     from using a common agent to demand supracompetitive rates, \n     because such demands might be avoided by direct negotiations \n     with individual copyright owners. In such negotiations an \n     individual copyright owner would exercise independent \n     judgment on whether to contract on particular terms.\n       A more limited exemption to the antitrust laws is created \n     by subsection (e)(2), relating to licenses granted under \n     section 106(6), other than statutory licenses, such as \n     performances by interactive services or performances that \n     exceed the sound recording performance complement. Under \n     subsection (e)(2)(A), copyright owners may designate common \n     agents to ``grant licenses and receive and remit royalty \n     payments,'' while under subsection (e)(2)(B), operators of \n     digital services may designate common agents to ``obtain \n     licenses and collect and pay royalty fees,'' without \n     violating the antitrust laws. Importantly, however, \n     subsection (e)(2) does not permit\n      either copyright owners or operators to jointly establish \n     royalty rates or competitively important license terms and \n     conditions.\n       The antitrust protections provided for common agents in \n     subsection (e)(2) are important to facilitate the licensing \n     of digital sound recording performances (other than through \n     statutory licenses) by reducing transaction costs. While this \n     use of common agents might be found lawful under existing \n     law, the statutory exemption in subsection (e)(2) will ensure \n     that the formation of beneficial and procompetitive \n     arrangements to facilitate licensing of performances will not \n     be deterred by concerns over the possible application of the \n     antitrust laws. This is particularly important given that \n     other provisions in the copyright law contain antitrust \n     exemptions.\n       The exemption in subsection (e)(2) is narrowly tailored to \n     make clear that it would be permissible to use common agents, \n     such as a clearinghouse, to handle the logistics of \n     licensing, payment of royalties, and transmitting royalties \n     to copyright owners. Establishment of royalty rates and \n     material license terms and conditions do not receive any \n     antitrust protection, however, so any common agents or \n     clearinghouse must conform to the antitrust laws in these \n     areas. To comply with this limitation, the common agent or \n     clearinghouse could either relay information about rates and \n     terms to and from the copyright owners and the operators of \n     digital services, or simply put interested operators in touch \n     with the appropriate copyright owners for direct \n     negotiations.\n\n   Section 114(f). Licenses for nonexempt subscription transmissions\n\n       This provision requires the Librarian of Congress to cause \n     notice to be published of voluntary negotiation proceedings. \n     The purpose of these proceedings is to determine reasonable \n     terms and royalty rates for transmissions that qualify for \n     statutory licensing under section 114(d)(2). The subsection \n     also contains other provisions concerning such proceedings.\n       The first such voluntary negotiation proceeding is to \n     commence within 30 days after the enactment of this Act upon \n     publication by the Librarian of Congress of a notice in the \n     Federal Register. The purpose of that proceeding shall be to \n     determine reasonable terms and royalty rates for public \n     performances of sound recordings by means of nonexempt \n     subscription transmissions that qualify, under section \n     114(d)(2), for a statutory license. The statutory license \n     provided by this subsection covers only the performance of \n     sound recordings under section 106(6), and not the \n     reproduction or distribution of sound recordings under \n     sections 106(1) or 106(3).\n       The terms and rates established will cover qualified \n     transmissions made between the effective date of this Act and \n     December 31, 2000. Paragraph (1) requires that terms and \n     rates should be established separately for each different \n     type of digital audio transmission service then in operation, \n     but does not require or suggest that the terms and rates \n     established must be different.\n       The voluntary negotiation proceeding may result in license \n     agreements voluntarily negotiated among individual sound \n     recording copyright owners and individual entities that \n     perform or authorize the performance of sound recordings by \n     means of digital transmissions. It is the Committee's \n     intention that negotiations leading to any such agreements be \n     covered by section 114(e) and that any such agreements shall \n     be given effect in lieu of any determination by a copyright \n     arbitration royalty panel or decision by the Librarian of \n     Congress.\n       Beyond such individual license agreements, however, the \n     Committee hopes that the voluntary negotiation proceeding \n     will lead to an industry-wide agreement concerning royalty \n     terms and rates. If an agreement as to rates and terms is \n     reached and there is no controversy as to these matters, it \n     would make no sense to subject the interested parties to the \n     needless expense of an arbitration proceeding conducted under \n     paragraph (2). Thus, it is the Committee's intention that in \n     such a case, as under the Copyright Office's current \n     regulations concerning rate adjustment proceedings, the \n     Librarian of Congress should notify the public of the \n     proposed agreement in a notice-and-comment proceeding and, if \n     no opposing comment is received from a party with a \n     substantial interest and an intent to participate in an \n     arbitration proceeding, the Librarian of Congress should \n     adopt the rates embodied in the agreement without convening \n     an arbitration panel. See 37 C.F.R. Sec. 251.63(b); see also \n     59 Fed. Reg. 63,038 (1994).\n       Paragraph (2) provides that if a voluntary negotiation \n     proceeding as described in paragraph (1) does not lead to the \n     determination of the terms and royalty rates applicable to \n     qualified digital performances of sound recordings, those \n     terms and rates are to be determined by arbitration under \n     this paragraph. However, if an arbitration proceeding is \n     necessary to establish the initial statutory licensing rates \n     and terms, it will commence only upon the filing of a \n     petition during a 60-day period which will commence 6 months \n     after publication of notice of the initiation of the \n     voluntary negotiation proceeding. The Committee notes that \n     the paragraph specifically refers to chapter 8 of title 17, \n     which concerns copyright royalty arbitration in general. \n     Accordingly, arbitration under this subparagraph should be \n     conducted under the same type of procedures that apply in \n     other copyright royalty arbitrations.\n       The parties are expected to negotiate, or if necessary \n     arbitrate, ``terms'' as well as rates. By terms, the \n     Committee means generally such details as how payments are to \n     be made, when, and other accounting matters (such as are \n     prescribed in section 115). In addition, the Librarian is to \n     establish related terms under section 114(f)(2). Should \n     additional terms be necessary to effectively implement the \n     statutory license, the parties may negotiate such provisions \n     or the CARPs may prescribe them.\n       Terms and rates determined under paragraph (2), like terms \n     and rates determined under paragraph (1), are to be effective \n     for a five year period or until the date of the next \n\n[[Page S 11955]]\n     effective rate adjustment. In determining terms and rates under \n     paragraph (2), a copyright arbitration royalty panel is to \n     consider the objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), and \n     the arbitrators may consider rates and terms under \n     voluntarily negotiated license agreements. Paragraph (2) \n     specifically authorizes the Librarian of Congress to \n     establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive \n     reasonable notice of the use of their sound recordings under \n     this section, and under which records of such use shall be \n     kept and made available by persons performing sound \n     recordings.\n       As provided in paragraph (4), the procedures for \n     negotiation and, if necessary, arbitration set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection are to be repeated. \n     The Librarian of Congress is to publish notice of the \n     initiation of voluntary negotiation proceedings: (a) within \n     30 days after being petitioned to publish notice concerning a \n     new type of digital audio transmission service; and (b) in \n     January 2000, and every five years thereafter.\n       If voluntary negotiations do not lead to an agreement among \n     the interested parties, an arbitration may be commenced upon \n     the filing of a petition in accordance with existing section \n     803(a)(1) of the Copyright Act during a specified 60-day \n     period. That period commences: (a) six months after \n     publication of notice of the initiation of a voluntary \n     negotiation proceeding concerning a new type of digital audio \n     transmission service; and (b) on July 1, 2000, and every five \n     years thereafter.\n       Regardless of when an arbitration proceeding is commenced, \n     it is to be concluded in accordance with the existing \n     procedures in section 802 of the Copyright Act.\n       Voluntary negotiation or arbitration proceedings concerning \n     a new type of digital radio transmission service should apply \n     only with respect to the new type of service or services \n     described in the petition.\n       Paragraph (5) sets forth the requirements with which an \n     entity must comply in order to obtain a statutory license. \n     The performing entity must provide notice of the performance \n     as required by regulations prescribed by the Librarian of \n     Congress and pay the established royalty fees. If the royalty \n     fees have not been set at the time of performance, the \n     performing entity must agree to pay the royalty fee to be \n     determined under this subsection by the twentieth day of the \n     month following the month in which the rates are set. This \n     limited license to perform the sound recording until the rate \n     is set applies only to performances for which the entity \n     seeks a statutory license. The failure to pay royalty rates \n     in arrears makes the performing entity subject to full \n     liability for infringement of section 106(6) from the \n     inception of the transmissions of sound recordings by that \n     transmitter after the effective date of the Act, and may \n     disqualify the entity for a statutory license under paragraph \n     (5)(A)(i).\n\n Section 114(g). Proceeds from licensing of subscription transmissions\n\n       This subsection describes how royalties from the licensing \n     of the digital performance right in a sound recording are \n     distributed to the artists who performed on the sound \n     recording.\n       Paragraph (1) of this subsection provides that payments to \n     both featured and nonfeatured (or background) artists of \n     royalties from the licensing of the digital performance of \n     the sound recording will be determined by the applicable \n     contract with, or collective bargaining agreement pertaining \n     to, the artist, unless the performance of the sound recording \n     is pursuant to a statutory license under subsection (f).\n       Where royalties are received from statutory licensing of a \n     sound recording, then under paragraph (2), the sound \n     recording copyright owner is required to allocate a total of \n     50% of the receipts as provided by subparagraphs (A), (B), \n     and (C). Subparagraph (A) requires that 2\\1/2\\% of the \n     receipts (as described more specifically below) are to be \n     placed into an escrow account managed by an independent \n     administrator appointed jointly by record companies and the \n     American Federation of Musicians (``AFM'') (or any successor \n     entity) and distributed to nonfeatured musicians (regardless \n     of whether they are members of AFM or any successor entity) \n     who have performed on sound recordings. Similarly, \n     subparagraph (B) requires that 2\\1/2\\% of the receipts are to \n     be placed into an escrow account managed by an independent \n     administrator appointed jointly by record companies and the\n      American Federation of Television and Radio Artists \n     (``AFTRA'') (or any successor entity) and distributed to \n     nonfeatured vocalists (regardless of whether they are \n     members of AFTRA or any successor entity) who have \n     performed on sound recordings. Subparagraph (C) requires \n     that 45% of the receipts are to be paid to the featured \n     artist or artists (or the person(s) conveying rights in \n     the performance of the featured artist(s) in the sound \n     recording). Although the Copyright Office currently \n     administers several funds under the Copyright Act, the \n     Committee does not expect that the Copyright Office would \n     be asked to manage these escrow accounts.\n       ``Receipts'' means the licensing fees received by the \n     copyright owner of the sound recording. Thus, if a collecting \n     society or other organization acts on behalf of the copyright \n     owner of the sound recording in licensing and/or collecting \n     royalties, ``receipts'' shall constitute the monies the \n     copyright owner receives from the collecting agency and, \n     therefore, would exclude administrative fees either deducted \n     by or paid to the collective.\n\n                Section 114(h). Licensing to affiliates\n\n       In addition to the protections available under antitrust \n     law, subsection (h) specifically is intended to ensure \n     competitive licensing practices by a licensor that owns an \n     interest in an ``affiliated entity'' as defined in subsection \n     (j)(1). Subsection (h) makes clear that terms no less \n     favorable than those granted to the affiliated entity also \n     must be made available to other bona fide entities that offer \n     services similar to those covered by the affiliate's \n     performance license.\n       For example, a licensor that grants to an affiliated entity \n     a performance license for a fixed term with separate and \n     distant rates for cable and satellite subscription \n     transmission services would be required to offer no less \n     favorable terms and conditions to an unrelated entity \n     offering the same services. If, as another example, the \n     license to the affiliated entity is limited only as to \n     performances via cable, then an unrelated entity offering \n     only satellite services cannot claim an entitlement to \n     receive a performance license at the rate specified for cable \n     services.\n       Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a licensor \n     from establishing different rate structures, terms and \n     conditions based on material differences in the license \n     sought. But distinctions drawn among licensees should be \n     applied rationally and consistently based on the nature, \n     scope and duration of the requested license, and not based on \n     arbitrary distinctions for monopolistic, discriminatory or \n     other anticompetitive purposes. The factors identified in \n     subsection (h), i.e., different types of services, the \n     particular sound recordings licensed, the frequency of use of \n     the sound recordings, the duration of the\n      requested license and the number of subscribers served, are \n     all relevant bases upon which a copyright owner may draw \n     rational distinctions.\n       The term ``no less favorable'' indicates that the same \n     terms and conditions can be offered, but this is not to say \n     that the licensor should not offer lower rates or more \n     beneficial terms and conditions if it deems it appropriate. \n     For example, a licensor might in its business judgment offer \n     an unrelated start-up entity a more favorable rate for a \n     shorter period of time. It is intended, however, that the \n     potential licensee under such circumstances could reject the \n     more favorable short-term license and instead request the \n     terms and conditions granted to the affiliated licensed \n     entity for similar services. In that event, the licensor must \n     make a performance license available upon the same terms and \n     conditions to the potential licensee, with respect to the \n     same services proposed to be licensed, as described above.\n       The term ``bona fide entities'' is intended to make clear \n     that the potential licensee must have a genuine intention and \n     reasonable capability to provide the licensed services.\n       Paragraph (2) of this subsection makes clear that the \n     obligations set forth in paragraph (1) are inapplicable where \n     the affiliated entity is offering performances through an \n     interactive service, or is granted a performance license for \n     the sole purpose of promoting the sound recording. A public \n     performance qualifying for the promotional exemption is \n     merely exempted from the obligations of paragraph (1); \n     paragraph (2)(B) does not provide an exemption for a \n     transmission otherwise subject to liability where such a \n     performance is unauthorized or unlicensed.\n\n      Section 114(i). No effect on royalties for underlying works\n\n       The Committee intends this provision to ensure that \n     licensing fees paid under the new digital performance right \n     shall not be taken into account in any administrative, \n     judicial, or other governmental proceeding that sets or \n     adjusts rates for the royalties to be paid for the public \n     performance of musical works. The provision also makes clear \n     Congress' intent that the new digital performance right shall \n     not diminish in any respect the royalties payable to \n     copyright owners of musical works for the public performance \n     of their works.\n\n                      Section 114(j). Definitions\n\n                Section 114(j)(1)--``affiliated entity''\n\n       A digital transmission service is considered affiliated \n     with a licensor when the licensor has any direct or indirect \n     partnership or any ownership interest of more than 5 percent \n     of\n      the outstanding voting or non-voting stock in the entity \n     engaging in digital audio transmissions. An entity \n     engaging in interactive services cannot be an affiliated \n     entity under this definition, but to the extent that an \n     entity is engaging in digital transmissions that are not \n     interactive, it can qualify as an affiliated entity for \n     that purpose alone.\n\n             Section 114(j)(2)--``broadcast'' transmission\n\n       Transmissions made by terrestrial broadcast stations \n     licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission \n     come within this definition.\n\n           Section 114(j)(3)--``digital audio transmission''\n\n       This phrase means a transmission is a digital format (or \n     any other non-analog format that might currently exist or be \n     developed in the future) that embodies the transmission of a \n     sound recording. A transmission that is only partly in a \n     digital or non-analog format satisfies this definition. (See \n     section 101 definition of ``digital transmission.'') A \n     transmission of an audiovisual work does not come within this \n     definition.\n\n[[Page S 11956]]\n\n       The Committee has amended the bill as originally introduced \n     to make clear that the performance right recognized herein \n     applies only to digital transmissions of sound recordings and \n     that nothing in the bill creates any new copyright liability \n     with respect to the transmission of a motion picture or other \n     audiovisual work, whether digital or analog, whether \n     subscription or nonsubscription, and whether interactive or \n     noninteractive.\n\n               Section 114(j)(4)--``interactive service''\n\n       The phrase ``interactive service'' is defined, in part, as \n     a service that ``enables a member of the public to receive, \n     on request, a transmission of a particular sound recording . \n     . . .'' This term is intended to reach, for example, a \n     service that enables an individual to make a request (by \n     telephone, e-mail, or otherwise) to a service that will send \n     a digital transmission to that individual or another \n     individual of the specific sound recording that had been \n     requested by or on behalf of the recipient. thus, it would \n     include such services commonly referred to as ``audio-on-\n     demand,'' ``pay-per-listen'' or ``celestial jukebox'' \n     services. The term also would apply to an on-line service \n     that transmits recordings on demand, regardless of whether \n     there is a charge for the service or for any transmission. \n     But as the second sentence of the definition makes clear, the \n     term ``interactive service'' is not intended to cover \n     traditional practices engaged in by, for example, radio \n     broadcast stations, through which individuals can ask the \n     station to play a particular sound recording as part of the \n     service's general\n      programming available for reception by members of the public \n     at large.\n       If an entity offering a nonsubscription service (such as a \n     radio or television station) chooses to offer an interactive \n     service as a separate business, or only during certain hours \n     of the day, that decision does not affect the exempt status \n     of any component of the entity's business that does not offer \n     an interactive service. In other words, each transmission \n     should be judged on its own merits with regard to whether it \n     qualifies as part of an ``interactive'' service. The third \n     sentence of the definition of ``interactive service'' is \n     intended to make this clear.\n\n          Section 114(j)(5)--``nonsubscription'' transmission\n\n       This term includes any transmission that does not come \n     within the definition of ``subscription'' transmission.\n\n                 Section 114(j)(6)--``retransmission''\n\n       As the definition of ``retransmission'' makes clear, that \n     term includes any further transmission of an initial \n     transmission, as well as any further retransmission of the \n     same transmission. That is, the term ``retransmission'' is \n     intended to cover both an initial retransmission of a \n     transmission (such as by a satellite carrier) and any further \n     transmissions of that transmission (such as by a cable \n     system). Of course, the fact that a further simultaneous \n     transmission qualifies as a ``retransmission'' does not by \n     itself mean that it is exempt under any particular paragraph \n     of Section 114(d)(1). To qualify for the 114(d)(1)(C)(ii) \n     exemption, for example, a retransmission would need to be \n     made by a business establishment on its premises or the \n     immediately surrounding vicinity.\n       Except as otherwise provided, a transmission is a \n     ``retransmission'' only if it is simultaneous with the \n     initial transmission. The term ``simultaneous'' is used in \n     this definition (and throughout this bill) to refer to \n     retransmissions that are essentially simultaneous. Although \n     there may be momentary time delays resulting from the \n     technology used for retransmissions, such delays do not \n     affect the status of the retransmissions as simultaneous.\n\n     Section 114(j)(7)--``sound recording performance complement''\n\n       The ``sound recording performance complement'' defines the \n     metes and bounds of programming available to be transmitted \n     under the statutory license grant in subsection (f). The \n     definition is intended to encompass certain typical \n     programming practices such as those used on broadcast radio. \n     It does not extend to the performance of albums in their \n     entirety, or the performance over\n      a short period of time of a substantial number of different \n     selections by a particular artist or from a particular \n     phonorecord or compilation of phonorecords. Transmissions \n     that exceed the limits of the complement are not eligible \n     for a statutory license under subsection (f).\n       The definition provides that for a transmission to be \n     within the complement, it must not include, on a particular \n     channel in any rolling three-hour period, more than three \n     selections from any one phonorecord, and no more than two of \n     those selections can be transmitted consecutively. The \n     transmission also must not include, on a particular channel \n     in any rolling three-hour period, more than four selections \n     by the same featured artist or from any boxed set or \n     compilation of phonorecords, and no more than three of those \n     selections can be transmitted consecutively. Whether \n     selections are consecutive is determined by the sequence of \n     the sound recordings transmitted, regardless of whether some \n     tones or other brief interlude is transmitted between the \n     sound recordings.\n       To avoid imposing liability for programming that \n     unintentionally may exceed the complement, the complement is \n     limited to the performance of sound recordings ``from'' a \n     particular phonorecord. Many phonorecords include sound \n     recordings that also appear on other phonorecords or \n     compilations, such as the ``greatest hits'' of a particular \n     artist, decade or genre of music. Similarly, the same sound \n     recordings may appear on separate compilations under the \n     names of different featured artists. It is not the intention \n     of this legislation to impose liability where selections that \n     are performed from separate phonorecords also may be \n     incorporated on a different phonorecord or compilation, or \n     also may appear on a different phonorecord under the name of \n     another featured artist, in the absence of an intention by \n     the performing entity to knowingly circumvent the numerical \n     limits of the complement. An example of such a case is where \n     the transmitting entity plays within a three-hour period one \n     selection for each of four different phonorecord, which four \n     selections also happen to be compiled on a soundtrack album. \n     So long as the transmitting entity did not willfully intend \n     to replicate selections from the soundtrack album, its \n     transmission would be considered within the complement. \n     However, where the transmitting entity willfully plays within \n     a three-hour period five selections of a single featured \n     recording artist, regardless of whether they were played from \n     several different phonorecords, and regardless of whether the \n     transmitting entity knew that the transmission included more \n     than three songs from a single album, the transmission does \n     not come within the complement. The fact that the \n     transmitting entity did not willfully intend to violate the \n     numerical limits for a single phonorecord under paragraph (A) \n     does not excuse the willful violation of the limit of \n     paragraph (B)(i).\n       The complement is to be evaluated as of the time of ``the \n     programming of the multiple phonorecords,'' rather than at \n     the time of transmission. This avoids imposing liability for \n     programming that occurs such as a week or two in advance of \n     transmission that unintentionally exceeds the complement. An \n     example is where, between the time of the programming and \n     transmission, a phonorecord or set or compilation of \n     phonorecords is released that embodies selections previously \n     programmed by the transmitting entity from multiple \n     phonorecords.\n       Certain transmitting entities covered by this legislation \n     may provide multiple channels of service and musical formats. \n     The bill applies the complement to each particular channel \n     separately and not to all channels in the aggregate.\n       The requirement of ``different selections'' permits the \n     performance of the same selection in excess of the numerical \n     limits. This is intended to facilitate under the statutory \n     license the programming of music formats that tend to repeat \n     the same selections of music, such as ``top 40'' formats.\n       The term ``featured recording artist'' means the performing \n     group or ensemble or, if not a group or ensemble, the \n     individual performer, identified most prominently in print \n     on, or otherwise in connection with, the phonorecord actually \n     being performed. Except in the case of a sound recording \n     consisting of a compilation of sound recordings by more than \n     one performer or group or ensemble, there will ordinarily be \n     only one ``featured recording artist'' per phonorecord. A \n     vocalist or soloist performing along with a group or ensemble \n     is not a ``featured recording artist'' unless that person is \n     identified in connection with the phonorecord as the primary \n     performer. For example, the Eagles would be the ``featured \n     recording artist'' on a track from an Eagles album that does \n     not feature Don Henley by name with equal prominence; but if \n     the same sound recording were performed from ``Don Henley's \n     Greatest Hits,'' then Don Henley and not the Eagles would be \n     the ``featured recording artist.'' Where both the vocalist or \n     soloist and the group or ensemble are identified as a single \n     entity and with equal prominence (such as ``Diana Ross and \n     the Supremes''), both the individual and the group qualify as \n     the ``featured recording artist.''\n\n            Section 114(j)(8)--``subscription'' transmission\n\n       A ``subscription transmission'' is defined as a \n     transmission of a sound recording in a digital format that is \n     ``controlled and limited to particular recipients,' and for \n     which consideration is required to be paid or given ``by or \n     on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a \n     package of transmissions including the transmission.'' It \n     does not matter what the mechanism might be for the delivery \n     of the transmission; thus, a digital transmission, whether \n     delivered by cable, wire, satellite or\n      terrestrial microwave, video dialtone, the Internet or any \n     other digital transmission mechanism, could be a \n     subscription transmission if the requirements cited above \n     are satisfied. This definition obviously does not reach \n     traditional over-the-air broadcast transmissions, which \n     satisfy neither of these requirements. A typical \n     transmission that would qualify as a ``subscription \n     transmission'' under this definition is a cable system's \n     transmission of a digital audio service, which is \n     available only to the paying customers of the cable \n     system. The payments required to satisfy the \n     ``consideration'' requirement might consist, for example, \n     of an ``a la carte'' fee for a specific audio service, or \n     of a fee for an overall package of services that includes \n     the digital audio service (e.g., a cable system's tier of \n     services for a fee). The reference in the definition to \n     payments ``on behalf of'' a recipient is intended to \n     recognize that payments for a service may be made by one \n     person on \n\n[[Page S 11957]]\n     behalf of other people, such as a parent making payment for a child who \n     lives away from home and receives the subscription \n     service.\n\n                  Section 114(j)(9)--``transmission''\n\n       This definition recognizes that the term ``transmission'' \n     refers to any transmission, whether it is an initial \n     transmission or a retransmission. Thus, for example, section \n     106(6) grants an exclusive right to perform a copyrighted \n     sound recording publicly ``by means of a digital audio \n     transmission,'' and does not mention retransmissions, even \n     though it is intended that the new performance right cover \n     all digital audio transmissions, including retransmissions. \n     Similarly, except where otherwise explicitedly indicated, the \n     exemptions for certain ``transmissions'' created by section \n     114(d)(1) apply to both initial transmissions and \n     retransmissions.\n       Section 4--Mechanical Royalties in Digital Phonorecord \n     Deliveries.--This section amends section 115 of title 17 to \n     clarify how the compulsory license for making and \n     distributing phonorecords applies in the context of certain \n     types of digital transmissions identified in the bill as \n     ``digital phonorecord deliveries.''\n       Among other things, this section is intended to confirm and \n     clarify the right of musical work and sound recording \n     copyright owners to be protected against infringement when \n     phonorecords embodying their works are delivered to consumers \n     by means of transmissions rather than by means of phonorecord \n     retail sales. The intention in extending the mechanical \n     compulsory license to digital phonorecord deliveries is to \n     maintain and reaffirm the mechanical rights of songwriters \n     and music publishers as new technologies permit phonorecords \n     to be delivered by wire or over the airwaves rather than by \n     the traditional making and distribution of records, cassettes \n     and CDs. The intention is not to substitute for or duplicate \n     performance rights in musical\n      works, but rather to maintain mechanical royalty income and \n     performance rights income for writers and music \n     publishers.\n       Changes to sections 115(a)(1) and 115(c)(2) make clear that \n     the compulsory license for making and distributing \n     phonorecords is not limited to the making and distribution of \n     physical phonorecords, but that a compulsory license is also \n     available for the making of digital phonorecord deliveries. \n     The Committee intends that a compulsory license for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries may be obtained, and the required \n     mechanical royalties may be paid, either directly by a \n     digital transmission service making a digital phonorecord \n     delivery or by a record company authorizing a digital \n     phonorecord delivery. Thus, the changes to section 115 are \n     designed to minimize the burden on transmission services by \n     placing record companies in a position to license not only \n     their own rights, but also, if they choose to do so, the \n     rights of writers and music publishers to authorize digital \n     phonorecord deliveries; and by recognizing that transmission \n     services themselves may obtain a compulsory license to make \n     digital phonorecord deliveries.\n       As between a digital transmission service and a record \n     company, allocation of the responsibility for paying \n     mechanical royalties could be a subject of negotiation, but \n     copyright owners of musical works would only be entitled to \n     receive one mechanical royalty payment for each digital \n     phonorecord delivery, not multiple payments. Of course, a \n     digital transmission service would be liable for any \n     infringing digital phonorecord delivery it made in the \n     absence of a compulsory license or the authorization of the \n     musical work copyright owner. (The liability of sound \n     recording copyright owners in such a case is addressed in new \n     section115(c)(3)(I).)\n       Section 4 also redesignates subsections (c) (3), (4) and \n     (5) as subsections (c)(4), (5) and (6) and inserts new \n     subsections (c)(3) and (d), which are descried in detail \n     below.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(A)\n\n       This subparagraph specifically sets forth that a compulsory \n     license includes the right of the compulsory licensee to make \n     or authorize digital phonorecord deliveries and identifies \n     the statutory rate of each digital phonorecord delivery made \n     by or under the authority of the compulsory licensee. For all \n     digital phonorecord deliveries made or authorized under a \n     compulsory license on or before December 31, 1997, the \n     royalty rate is to be the statutory rate than in effect under \n     section 115(c)(2) for the making and distribution of a \n     physical phonorecord. For digital phonorecord deliveries made \n     authorized under a compulsory license on or after January 1, \n     1998, the statutory mechanical royalty rates for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries shall be determined in accordance with \n     subparagraphs (B) through (F); and\n      the statutory mechanical royalty rate for making and \n     distributing physical phonorecords shall be determined in \n     accordance with chapter 8.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(B)\n\n       This subparagraph clarifies that collective negotiations \n     and agreements relating to statutory licenses are not \n     prohibited by the antitrust laws. This provision is nearly \n     identical to new section 114(e)(1), and is patterned on \n     existing antitrust exemptions relating to the negotiations of \n     statutory licenses, including 17 U.S.C. Sec. 116(b)(1) \n     (jukebox licenses) and 17 U.S.C. Sec. 118(b) (noncommercial \n     broadcasting). Like those provisions, subsection (c)(3)(B) is \n     important to help effectuate the related statutory license \n     provision.\n       This subparagraph authorizes musical work copyright owners, \n     record companies, digital transmission services, and any \n     other persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license \n     collectively to negotiate and agree upon the terms and \n     statutory royalty rates under subsection 115(c)(3) \n     ``notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws.'' This \n     exemption from the antitrust laws extends to negotiations and \n     agreements on terms and rates of royalty payments, the \n     proportionate division of royalties among copyright owners, \n     the designation of common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, \n     or receive royalty payments, and the year during which the \n     royalty rates prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through (F) \n     and chapter 8 of title 17 are to next be determined.\n       The latter authorization allows the affected parties to \n     agree when rates and terms should next be determined. If they \n     do not do so voluntarily, then subparagraph (F) prescribes \n     that the rates and terms will be reconsidered at five-year \n     intervals. Given the rapid pace at which digital transmission \n     technology is developing, and changes in the marketplace, the \n     Committee recognizes that the statutory rate for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries might need to be considered in \n     different years, and that the interested parties are in the \n     best position to determine how frequently and when this \n     should be done.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(C)\n\n       This subparagraph requires the Librarian of Congress to \n     cause notice to be published of voluntary negotiation \n     proceedings to determine reasonable terms and statutory \n     royalty rates for the making of digital phonorecord \n     deliveries under a compulsory license. The subparagraph also \n     contains other provisions concerning such proceedings.\n       The Librarian is to publish notice of commencement of the \n     first such voluntary negotiation proceeding in the Federal \n     Register between June 30, 1996 and December 31, 1996. The\n      Committee expects that the Librarian will publish this \n     notice relatively early in the prescribed period. However, \n     the exact date of the notice is of limited importance \n     because subparagraph (B) authorizes negotiations that can \n     begin or end at any time, as determined by the parties. \n     The purpose of the notice is simply to allow persons with \n     a substantial interest who might not be represented by the \n     parties engaged in negotiations to be aware that \n     negotiations may be taking place that could lead to an \n     industry-wide agreement concerning mechanical royalty \n     rates.\n       The purpose of the first voluntary negotiation proceeding \n     shall be to determine reasonable terms and statutory royalty \n     rates for the making of digital phonorecord deliveries under \n     a compulsory license during the period beginning January 1, \n     1998 and ending when successor rates and terms are \n     established, either by negotiation or, if necessary, \n     arbitration.\n       The subparagraph states that if any digital phonorecord \n     delivery statutory mechanical royalty rates and terms are \n     determined as a result of a voluntary negotiation proceeding, \n     then such rates and terms shall distinguish between: (1) \n     rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries where the \n     reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is \n     ``incidental'' to the transmission which constitutes the \n     digital phonorecord delivery, and (2) rates and terms for \n     digital phonorecord deliveries in general. The Committee \n     recognizes that there are likely to be different types of \n     digital transmission systems that could result in the making \n     of a digital phonorecord delivery. In the case of some of \n     these transmission systems, delivering a phonorecord to a \n     transmission recipient could be incidental to the purpose of \n     a transmission. For example, if a transmission system was \n     designed to allow transmission recipients to hear sound \n     recordings substantially at the time of transmission, but the \n     sound recording was transmitted to a high speed burst of data \n     and stored in a computer memory for prompt playback (such \n     storage being technically the making of a phonorecord), and \n     the transmission recipient could not retain the phonorecord \n     for playback on subsequent occasions (or for any other \n     purpose), delivering the phonorecord to the transmission \n     recipient would be incidental to the transmission. If such a \n     system allowed transmission recipients to retain phonorecords \n     for playback on subsequent occasions, but transmission \n     recipients did not do so, delivering the phonorecords to the \n     transmission recipients could be incidental to the \n     transmissions. On and after January 1, 1998, statutory \n     mechanical royalty rates shall distinguish between \n     ``incidental'' digital phonorecord deliveries that take into \n     account the different purpose and effect of these \n     transmissions and digital phonorecord deliveries in general.\n       The voluntary negotiation proceeding may result in license \n     agreements voluntarily negotiated among individual musical \n     work copyright owners and individual entities that make or \n     authorize\n      digital phonorecord deliveries. It is the Committee's \n     intention that negotiations leading to any such agreements \n     be covered by section 115(c)(3)(B) and that any such \n     agreements have the effect set forth in section \n     115(c)(3)(E).\n       Beyond such individual license agreements, however, the \n     Committee anticipates that the voluntary negotiation \n     proceeding will lead to an industry-wide agreement concerning \n     mechanical royalty terms and rates and the year when terms \n     and rates next will be determined.\n       The parties are expected to negotiate, or if necessary \n     arbitrate, ``terms'' as well as rates. By ``terms,'' the \n     Committee means \n\n[[Page S 11958]]\n     such details as how payments are to be made, when, and other accounting \n     matters. While these details are for the most part already \n     prescribed in section 115, and related details are to be \n     established by the Librarian under section 115(c)(3)(D), the \n     bill allows for additional such terms to be set by the \n     parties or by CARPs in the event that the foregoing \n     provisions or regulations are not readily applicable to the \n     new digital transmission environment.\n       If an agreement as to rates and terms is reached and there \n     is no controversy as to these matters, it would make no sense \n     to subject the interested parties to the needless expense of \n     an arbitration proceeding conducted under section \n     115(c)(3)(D). Thus, it is the Committee's intention that in \n     such a case, as under the Copyright Office's current \n     regulations concerning rate adjustment proceedings, the \n     Librarian of Congress should notify the public of the \n     proposed agreement in a notice-and-comment proceeding and, if \n     no opposing comment is received from a party with a \n     substantial interest and an intent to participate in an \n     arbitration proceeding, the Librarian of Congress should \n     adopt the rates embodied in the agreement, and any agreed-to \n     year when the mechanical royalty rates for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries next will be determined, without \n     convening an arbitration panel. See 37 C.F.R. Sec. 251.63 \n     (b); see also 59 Fed. Reg. 63,038 (1994).\n       As provided in section 115(c)(3)(F), the procedures for \n     negotiation and, if necessary, arbitration set forth in this \n     subparagraph and in section 115(c)(3)(D) are to be repeated \n     every five years unless it is voluntarily determined by the \n     parties pursuant to this subparagraph and subparagraph (B) \n     that rates and terms should next be determined in a different \n     year. The Committee recognizes that it may be unusual to \n     allow the interested parties to negotiate and agree to a year \n     when the statutory mechanical royalty rates for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries next will be determined. However, the \n     Committee was concerned that rapidly changing technology \n     might justify redetermining the terms and royalty rates \n     applicable to digital phonorecord deliveries made under a \n     compulsory license on a different schedule than once every \n     five years. Thus, the\n      Committee chose to give the interested parties flexibility \n     in this area.\n       The Committee wishes to make clear that nothing in section \n     115(c)(3) is intended to affect the schedule prescribed in \n     section 803(a)(3) for determining the mechanical royalty rate \n     for the making and distribution of physical phonorecords. \n     Proceedings to establish mechanical royalty rates for the \n     making and distribution of physical phonorecords are expected \n     to be conducted in 1997 and every ten years thereafter, and \n     are not subject to contrary agreement.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(D)\n\n       If a voluntary negotiation proceeding as described in \n     section 115(c)(3)(C) does not lead to the determination of \n     the terms and statutory royalty rates applicable to digital \n     phonorecord deliveries made under a compulsory license, those \n     terms and rates are to be determined by arbitration under \n     this subparagraph. The Committee notes that the subparagraph \n     specifically refers to chapter 8 of title 17, which concerns \n     copyright royalty arbitration in general. Accordingly, \n     arbitration under this subparagraph should be conducted under \n     the same type of procedures that apply in other copyright \n     royalty arbitrations. Thus, for example, an arbitration \n     proceeding is to commence only upon the filing of a petition \n     in accordance with existing section 803(a)(1).\n       Like terms and rates determined under section 115(c)(3)(C), \n     terms and rates determined under this subparagraph are to \n     distinguish between digital phonorecord deliveries where the \n     reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental \n     to the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord \n     delivery, and digital phonorecord deliveries in general.\n       In determining terms and rates under this subparagraph, a \n     copyright arbitration royalty panel is to consider the \n     objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), and the \n     arbitrators may consider terms and rates under voluntarily \n     negotiated license agreements. However, the statutory \n     mechanical royalty payable for digital phonorecord deliveries \n     made on or before December 31, 1997 shall be given no \n     precedential effect in determining the statutory mechanical \n     royalty payable for digital phonorecord deliveries made on or \n     after January 1, 1998. The Committee specifically chooses to \n     remain neutral on the question whether the mechanical royalty \n     rates for any category of digital phonorecord delivery made \n     on or after January 1, 1998 should be the same as, lower \n     than, or higher than the mechanical royalty rate for the \n     making and distribution of physical phonorecords.\n       The subparagraph specifically authorizes the Librarian of \n     Congress to establish requirements by which copyright owners \n     may\n      receive reasonable notice of the use of their works under \n     this section, and under which records of such use shall be \n     kept and made available by persons making digital \n     phonorecord deliveries.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(E)\n\n       This subparagraph provides that in general, the provisions \n     of voluntarily negotiated agreements for the licensing of \n     nondramatic musical works shall be given effect in lieu of \n     any statutory rates and terms determined by the Librarian of \n     Congress. For example, the Committee understands that \n     individual record companies and music publishers have \n     negotiated license agreements for specific albums prescribing \n     a royalty rate less than the statutory mechanical royalty \n     rate. The Committee does not intend to prevent negotiation of \n     voluntary license agreements, for either physical \n     phonorecords or digital phonorecord deliveries, prescribing \n     royalties at less than the statutory rates, except in the \n     situation described below.\n       There is a situation in which the provisions of voluntarily \n     negotiated license agreements should not be given effect in \n     lieu of any mechanical royalty rates determined by the \n     Librarian of Congress. For some time, music publishers have \n     expressed concerns about so-called ``controlled composition'' \n     clauses in recording contracts. Generally speaking, \n     controlled composition clauses are provisions whereby a \n     recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical \n     work agrees to reduce the mechanical royalty rate payable \n     when a record company makes and distributes phonorecords \n     which include recordings of such artist's compositions. \n     Subject to the exceptions set forth in subparagraph (E)(ii), \n     the second sentence of subparagraph (E)(i) is intended to \n     make these controlled composition clauses inapplicable to \n     digital phonorecord deliveries.\n       Specifically, unless the requirements of one or both of the \n     exceptions of subparagraph (E)(ii) are satisfied, the royalty \n     rates determined through negotiation or arbitration pursuant \n     to subparagraph (C) or (D) are to be given effect in lieu of \n     any contrary rates specified in a contract pursuant to which \n     a recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical \n     work grants a mechanical license in that work to a record \n     company or commits another person (such as the artists music \n     publisher) to grant such a mechanical license in that work.\n       Subparagraph (E)(ii) specifies two types of contracts where \n     the negotiated royalty rates set forth in the contracts are \n     to be given effect notwithstanding the second sentence of \n     subparagraph (E)(i). The first of these is a ``grandfather \n     clause'' giving effect to contracts and rates agreed to in a \n     contract with a recording artist on or before June 22, 1995, \n     except to the extent they are modified after that date for \n     the purpose of reducing the royalty prescribed therein to \n     less than the\n      statutory rates or to add new compositions at less than the \n     statutory rates. Thus, if a recording contract entered \n     into on or before June 22, 1995 was modified after that \n     date to cover a larger number of musical works, the \n     royalty rates specified in the contract would apply to the \n     number of works within the scope of the contract as of \n     June 22, 1995, and the statutory rates would apply to the \n     number of works added thereafter. The Committee also notes \n     that recording artist contracts entered into on or before \n     June 22, 1995 and not modified thereafter, or modified \n     thereafter to extend the date by which an artist must \n     complete a recording, are examples of contracts to be \n     given effect notwithstanding the second sentence of \n     subparagraph (E)(i).\n       The second of the exceptions provided in subparagraph \n     (E)(ii) is intended to allow a recording artist-author who \n     chooses to act as his or her own music publisher to agree to \n     accept mechanical royalties at less than the statutory rates, \n     provided that the contract containing such lower rates is \n     entered into after the sound recording has been fixed in a \n     tangible medium of expression substantially in a form \n     intended for commercial release.\n       It should be emphasized that subparagraph (E) applies only \n     to the making of digital phonorecord deliveries and not to \n     the making and distribution of physical phonorecords. Nothing \n     in the bill is intended to interfere with the application of \n     controlled composition clauses to the making and distribution \n     of physical phonorecords or to digital phonorecord deliveries \n     where the agreements are not covered by the terms of \n     subsection (c)(3)(E).\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(F)\n\n       This subparagraph provides that the procedures specified in \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D) for negotiation or arbitration of \n     mechanical compulsory license rates and terms for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries are to be repeated ever five years, \n     unless different years for repeating such proceedings are \n     determined in accordance with subparagraphs (B) or (C). \n     Nothing in section 115(c)(3) is intended to affect the \n     schedule prescribed for determining the mechanical royalty \n     rate for the making and distribution of physical \n     phonorecords. Proceedings to establish mechanical royalty \n     rates for the making and distribution of physical \n     phonorecords are to be conducted in 1997 and every ten years \n     thereafter, and are not subject to contrary agreement.\n       The reference in subparagraph (F) to the procedures \n     specified in subparagraphs (C) and (D) is to the publication \n     of notice, initiation of voluntary negotiations, and \n     convening of CARPs if necessary. The reference is not to the \n     dates within the year as described in subparagraph (C). \n     Indeed, the Committee\n      encourages the Librarian to publish a notice of initiation \n     of voluntary negotiation proceedings as early in the year \n     as practicable, to allow the maximum amount of time for \n     voluntary negotiations, or if necessary arbitration.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(G)\n\n       This subparagraph imposes as a condition of compulsory \n     licensing the obligation that digital phonorecord deliveries \n     be accompanied by certain specified types of information, if \n     that information has been encoded in the sound recording \n     being transmitted under \n\n[[Page S 11959]]\n     the sound recording copyright owner's authority. This provision does \n     not obligate the copyright owner of the sound recording to \n     encode copyright management information in the work. In \n     addition, it is not intended to require a transmitting entity \n     to generate or encode such information in its transmission if \n     the information is not encoded in the sound recording. \n     Moreover, the transmitting entity is not required to transmit \n     information that may be encoded in the sound recording other \n     than the information specified in this subparagraph and \n     ``related information'' (o.e., information that is \n     specifically related to the identification of the works being \n     performed and upon which payments are to be made by the \n     transmitting entity under this bill). The subparagraph also \n     makes clear that nothing in this section affects the \n     provisions of section 1002(e).\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(H)\n\n       This subparagraph confirms that musical work copyright \n     owners and sound recording copyright owners both have the \n     same rights to be protected against infringement with respect \n     to digital phonorecord deliveries as they have with respect \n     to distributions of physical phonorecords of their respective \n     works. Thus, subject to the limitations contained in existing \n     law, a digital phonorecord delivery infringes the rights of \n     the sound recording copyright owner unless authorized by the \n     sound recording copyright owner (or his or her agent), and a \n     digital phonorecord delivery infringes the rights of the \n     musical work copyright owner unless covered by a compulsory \n     license or authorized by the musical work copyright owner (or \n     his or her agent). The subparagraph makes clear that any \n     cause of action under this subparagraph is in addition to \n     other remedies available under title 17.\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(I)\n\n       This subparagraph clarifies the circumstances under which a \n     sound recording copyright owner may be held liable for \n     digital phonorecord deliveries by third parties. The changes \n     to section 115 made by S. 227 are intended to allow record \n     companies to license not only their own rights, but also, if \n     they choose to do so, the rights of writers and music \n     publishers to authorize\n      digital phonorecord deliveries. If a record company grants a \n     digital transmission service a license under both the \n     record company's rights in a sound recording and the \n     musical work copyright owner's rights, the record company \n     may be liable, to an extent determined in accordance with \n     applicable law, for the applicable mechanical royalty for \n     every digital phonorecord delivery made under the record \n     company's authority. However, if a record company grants a \n     license under its rights in a sound recording only, and \n     does not grant a mechanical license under the copyright in \n     the musical work embodied in the sound recording, it is \n     the transmission service's responsibility to obtain a \n     license under the musical work copyright, and the record \n     company cannot be held liable for infringement of the \n     copyright in the musical work by the record company's \n     licensee.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(J)\n\n       This subparagraph makes clear that nothing in section 1008 \n     shall be construed to prevent the exercise of the rights and \n     remedies allowed by paragraphs (3) and (6) and chapter 5 in \n     the event of a digital phonorecord delivery. However, no \n     action alleging infringement of copyright may be brought \n     under title 17 against a manufacturer, importer or \n     distributor of a digital audio recording device, a digital \n     audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an \n     analog recording medium, or against a consumer, based on the \n     actions described in section 1008.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(K)\n\n       This subsection makes clear that section 115, as amended by \n     the bill, is not intended to annul or limit any existing or \n     future right or remedy of a sound recording copyright owner \n     or musical work copyright owner, except to the extent that a \n     musical work copyright owner's exclusive rights are limited \n     by compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by \n     section 115 as amended.\n\n                          Section 115(c)(3)(L)\n\n       This subparagraph makes clear that the changes made to \n     section 115 by the bill with regard to liability for digital \n     phonorecord deliveries do not apply to transmissions or \n     retransmissions that are exempt under section 114(d)(1). At \n     the same time, the exemptions set forth in section 114(d)(1) \n     are not intended either to enlarge or to diminish in any way \n     the rights of copyright owners under existing law with \n     respect to such transmissions or retransmissions.\n\n                             Section 115(d)\n       This subsection defines the term ``digital phonorecord \n     delivery.'' A ``digital phonorecord delivery'' is each \n     individual delivery of a phonorecord by digital transmission \n     of a sound recording which results in a specifically \n     identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission \n     recipient of a phonorecord of that sound recording. The \n     Committee notes that the phrase ``specifically identifiable \n     reproduction,'' as used in the definition, should be \n     understood to mean a reproduction specifically identifiable \n     to the transmission service. Of course, a transmission \n     recipient making a reproduction from a transmission is able \n     to identify that reproduction, but the mere fact that a \n     transmission recipient can make and identify a reproduction \n     should not in itself cause a transmission to be considered a \n     digital phonorecord delivery.\n       The final sentence of this definition provides that a \n     digital phonorecord delivery does not result from a real-\n     time, noninteractive subscription transmission of a sound \n     recording where no reproduction of the sound recording or the \n     musical work embodied therein is made from the inception of \n     the transmission through to its receipt by the transmission \n     recipient in order to make the sound recording audible. For \n     example, a transmission by a noninteractive subscription \n     transmission service that transmits in real time a continuous \n     program of music selections chosen by the transmitting \n     entity, for which a consumer pays a flat monthly fee, would \n     not be a ``digital phonorecord delivery'' so long as there \n     was no reproduction at any point in the transmission in order \n     to make the sound recording audible. Moreover, such a \n     transmission would not be a ``digital phonorecord delivery'' \n     even if subscribers, through actions taken on their own part, \n     may record all or part of the programming from that service. \n     The final sentence of the definition of ``digital phonorecord \n     delivery'' is not intended to change current law with respect \n     to rights under section 106, or the limitations on those \n     rights under sections 107-113, sections 116-120, and the \n     unamended portions of sections 114 and 115.\n       Section 5--Conforming Amendments.--This section makes \n     certain technical amendments to other sections of title 17.\n       Among other things, it adds to section 101 a definition of \n     ``digital transmission,'' which is any transmission in whole \n     or in part in a digital or other non-analog format. Although \n     the Committee is not presently aware of any non-analog \n     formats that are not digital, the Committee wants to make \n     clear that all non-analog formats now known or later \n     developed are covered by the bill. For purposes of section \n     115, a transmission of a motion picture or other audiovisual \n     work does not come within the definition of ``digital \n     transmission.''\n       Section 6--Effective Date.--This section provides that new \n     sections 114(e) and 114(f) of title 17, which concern \n     negotiation of licenses under the new performance right, take \n     effect immediately upon the date of enactment. The effective \n     date of other provisions of the Act is three months after the \n     date of enactment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 227, the \nDigital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995. I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor of this legislation introduced by Senator Hatch, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This bill will allow \nthe United States to finally join more than 60 nations in enacting this \nsame copyright protection for sound recordings.\n  The bill before us, today, essentially closes a glaring loophole in \nthe Copyright Act which had denied protection to recording artists and \nrecord companies ever since the copyright was first extended to sound \nrecordings in 1972. This legislation would create a right to public \nperformance in digital transmissions and give copyright owners the \nability to negotiate the use of their works in new technologies.\n  Every other copyrighted work--motion pictures, books, plays, computer \nsoftware and musical compositions--already has this protection. It is \ntime to bring the law up to date for sound recordings.\n  Senator Hatch and I first introduced a version of this bill in the \n103d Congress. Since that time, we have heard from literally hundreds \nof interested parties from all affected sides. We have had input from \nbroadcasters, cable companies, consumers, songwriters, music \npublishers, artists, record companies, and more. Many of those affected \nby the legislation have had suggestions on how to make it better and \nmore responsive to the marketplace.\n  I would like to commend Senator Hatch and his staff and thank them \nfor working so hard with us to assure that all of the legitimate \nconcerns with the original legislation were so thoughtfully addressed. \nSenators Biden, Leahy, and Thurmond and their staffs deserve credit as \nwell.\n  Every copyright expert who testified before the Judiciary Committee, \nincluding those from the nonpartisan U.S. Copyright Office, agreed that \nthis legislation needs to be enacted.\n  The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act helps move our \ncopyrighted industries closer to the Information Superhighway. A road \nwhere consumers will have access to new music and exciting artists \ndelivered to the consumer in technology advanced ways beyond what we \nmight have imagined when we first heard the Victrola, or even stereo \nsound. As these new technologies develop and as we enter this digital \nand computer age, the protection of America's intellectual property has \ntaken on a tremendous urgency.\n\n[[Page S 11960]]\n\n  The inequities of the current law are best illustrated by a real-\nworld example: when a digital music service, paid for with a \nsubscription fee and available via a consumer's cable TV box, play a \npiece of recorded music from a compact disc, such as ``White \nChristmas'' performed by Bing Crosby, the songwriter and music \npublisher, in this case Irving Berlin, have rights and receive payment \nfor the performance of that work. Yet while Irving Berlin is \ncompensated, Bing Crosby, the recording artist who brought the song to \nlife, and the record company which invested the moneys to record and \ndistribute the album would receive nothing.\n  We have chosen to be forward thinking with this legislation, to \nenable Congress to close a loophole which threatens to\n grow immensely in the near future. With new digital technology, a \ntransmission service, simply by acquiring a single copy of a compact \ndisc, can deliver CD-quality sound electronically to millions of homes \nand cars, without any payment to the creators of that recorded music.\n\n  The hundreds of thousands of consumers who love new music could make \nperfect copies of the one CD. Potentially millions of perfect copies of \nthis CD can be made electronically. Why would anyone go to a record \nstore in the future if they were able to receive music this way? Why \nshould the digital transmission businesses be making money by selling \nmusic when they are not paying the creators who have produced that \nmusic?\n  If this should occur without copyright protection, investment in \nrecorded music will decline, as performers and record companies produce \nrecordings which are widely distributed without compensation to them. \nThis would result in the decline of what presently constitutes one of \nAmerica's most important, productive and competitive industries.\n  America's copyright industries contributed a staggering 3.7 percent \nto the Nation's gross domestic product in 1993. That's a contribution \nof $238.6 billion, Mr. President. Between 1977 and 1993, the number of \nworkers employed by those industries doubled to 3 million, 2.55 percent \nof our work force. Over the last 5 years, employment in this sector has \ngrown at four times the rate of jobs in other sectors.\n  And, perhaps most significant of all in this context, these \nindustries together achieved foreign sales of $45.8 billion in 1993. \nAmazingly, that was the second biggest single contribution to America's \nbalance of trade in 1993 among all industries, second only to autos and \ntheir parts.\n  My home State of California has been a particular beneficiary of this \ngrowth. It is an important home to the music industry, the industry \nwhose copyright protection we are specifically addressing today. \nCalifornia's music community is home to over 100,000 jobs, including \nrecording, manufacturing, distribution and retail.\n  These are the jobs of the future, and I am pleased that this \nlegislation will assure the continued viability of these important \nbusinesses and creative endeavors.\n  More than 60 nations, including 9 members of the European Community, \nprovide their rightsholders with a performance right. $150 million is \ncollected worldwide for the public performance of sound recordings.\n  The United States is the world's leading exporter of recorded music, \nwith American artists accounting for 35 percent of all music sold \nworldwide. However, because the United States does not reciprocate in \nproviding this performance right, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \nreports that U.S. performers and record companies are denied access to \nthese substantial royalties. Rectifying this disparity will obviously \nbenefit this very important export sector of our economy.\n  Moreover, I'm told that the lack of a performance right has been a \nmajor obstacle to the efforts of our trade negotiators to achieve \nhigher levels of intellectual property protection in general. The \nSenate today can help eliminate this obstacle.\n  This legislation would provide equity, Mr. President. Equity for the \ndigital transmitters who would be assured that new music was available \nfor their services. Equity for consumers who would be assured that new \nand varied music continues to get recorded and produced. Equity for the \ncreators and producers of music who invest their talent, effort and \ndollars in sound recordings.\n  In sum, as I detailed in my Record statement of January 13 when we \nintroduced this bill, and at the hearing on this bill in March, passing \nthis legislation is the right thing to do as a matter of copyright \npolicy, it's the fair thing to do, and it is clearly in the best \neconomic interests of the Nation. I urge its adoption.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is regrettable that S. 227 fails to \naddress the present concerns of countless small businesses in North \nCarolina, including many restaurants, that offer background music for \nthe enjoyment of their customers.\n  Many restauranteurs, retailers, and radio broadcasters resent the \ncontinued heavy-handed practices by music-licensing organizations in \nimposing unreasonable copyright fees. I hope these concerns may be \naddressed soon in future legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is the problem: A restaurant has a radio or \ntelevision set playing, and a representative of one of the music \nroyalty organizations shows up threatening court action unless the \nrestauranteur pays an exorbitant licensing fee, simply for having a \nradio or television set on.\n  This double-dipping is both arrogant and unfair--the royalty \norganizations insist on collecting fees from both broadcasters and the \nsmall businesses that receive the public broadcasts.\n  Not only do these organizations double-dip, they also seek to \nintimidate small businesses into paying fees for listening to radio or \nTV stations.\n  Small businesses are entitled to fair protection against arbitrary \npricing, discriminatory enforcement, and abusive collection practices \nby music-licensing organizations.\n  This is a problem that should be addressed soon, and, Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that a relevant article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks--it being a Nation's Restaurant \nNews article by Ron Ruggless entitled, ``Operators to Lawmakers: Now \nYou're Playing Our Song; Legislators Tackle Industry's Music-Licensing \nGripe; Restauranteurs.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Nation's Restaurant News, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\nOperators to Lawmakers: Now You're Playing Our Song; Legislators Tackle \n            Industry's Music-Licensing Gripe; Restaurateurs\n\n                           (By Ron Ruggless)\n\n       Washington.--At the urging of restaurateurs and other \n     small-business owners, federal and state lawmakers are \n     pumping up the volume on the way music-licensing agents do \n     business and the fees they charge.\n       In Congress Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., has introduced \n     a bill to amend federal copyright law and exempt \n     restaurateurs from paying licensing fees for background music \n     from radios and televisions, for which they are now liable.\n       And in 10 states, from New Hampshire to Hawaii, \n     Legislatures are considering proposals that would regulate \n     the way the music-licensing agents conduct themselves in \n     collecting royalties.\n       ``Restaurant owners all over the country have been \n     infuriated by the bullying tactics of the huge music-\n     licensing agents,'' said Herman Cain, president of the \n     National Restaurant Association. ``Their outrage is \n     palpable.''\n       For years restaurateurs have been alarmed by what they \n     consider random pricing and abusive collections and threats \n     by the performing rights societies, such as Broadcast Music \n     Inc., or BMI; the American Society of Composers, Authors and \n     Publishers, or ASCAP; and the Society for European \n     Songwriters and Composers, or SESAC.\n       I can't tell you the number of times small-business owners \n     in my district have complained about the tactics used by \n     these performing rights societies to collect fees for music \n     played on radios or TVs,'' Sensenbrenner explained. ``I \n     believe artists should be compensated for their works, but I \n     don't believe these societies should be able to intimidate a \n     restaurant owner into paying fees for the incidental use of a \n     broadcast over which he is she has no control.''\n       More than 150 restaurateurs were scheduled to fly in to \n     Washington on Feb. 23 to lobby the 104th Congress on \n     Sensenbrenner's Fairness in Musical Licensing Act of 1995 \n     (H.R. 789). Similar legislation was introduced in last year's \n     Congress but was not acted upon before it adjourned.\n       The Sensenbrenner bill, which had 21 co-sponsors by mid-\n     February, also would\n      establish an arbitration system to resolve rate disputes. \n     Under current federal copyright \n\n[[Page S 11961]]\n     law, only the federal court of the Southern District of New York is \n     allowed to handle such disputes, which makes it expensive \n     for business people elsewhere in the nation. The National \n     Restaurant Association has long claimed that ASCAP, BMI, \n     and SESAC rely on the threat of costly court battles to \n     force restaurateurs to comply with their fees.\n       Meanwhile, restaurateurs were working at the local level in \n     10 states to regulate the way the music-copyright agents \n     conduct their collections of royalties.\n       Most states were patterning their legislation after New \n     Jersey's Collection Practices Reform Act, which has passed \n     the state's General Assembly and is now under consideration \n     by the Senate.\n       The New Jersey proposal would require music-licensing \n     agents to provide list of songs they represent, provide \n     comparisons of fees charged within a 25-mile radius of a \n     business, force them to identify themselves upon entering a \n     business establishment and set up a third-party arbitration \n     group to mediate contract disputes.\n       States with similar bills wending their way through the \n     legislatures include Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, Missouri, \n     New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n       In Texas the proposed legislation includes the New Jersey \n     provisions as well as a component that would require agents \n     to be licensed by the state, according to Glen Garey, general \n     counsel for the Texas Restaurant Association. ``I don't think \n     we'll be too easy to push over,'' Garey said, referring to \n     lobbying by the performing-rights societies. ``I don't buy \n     into the argument that any of this is unconstitutional or \n     conflicts with federal law.''\n       Colorado's proposed legislation in mid-February had \n     garnered the sponsorship of 20 of 65 House members and 10 of \n     35 senators, according to Pete Meersman, executive director \n     of the Colorado Restaurant Association.\n       It doesn't deal with whether or not operators owe royalties \n     to copyright owners, or whether those royalties are fair,'' \n     Meersman said. What it does deal with is how royalties are \n     collected in Colorado. It sets a standard of professional \n     conduct for agents of these Performing-rights societies.''\n       The legislation would require music-licensing agents to \n     identify themselves upon entering establishments for the \n     purposes of investigating the use of copyrighted music.\n       ``A lot of times,'' Meersman explained, ``they will come in \n     unannounced. We've had members find them in their coat rooms, \n     where their music equipment is kept. We've had them question \n     employees who don't really know anything about the equipment, \n     type of music or whether it's CDs, tapes or radio.\n       ``We'd like them to identify themselves so someone who \n     knows what they are talking about can get them the \n     information they need.''\n       Another provision would require the societies to provide \n     lists of\n      copyrighted songs they represent. ``The reason we want to \n     have lists available is that, say, you're an operator, and \n     you don't want to pay royalties or a blanket licensing fee \n     to all these groups,'' he said. ``You want to know what is \n     copyrighted or covered under your agreement. In other \n     words, you want to know what you are paying for.''\n       One other provision in the bill would require the \n     performing-rights societies to let operators know what other \n     similar establishments are paying in the same area, which was \n     defined as a 25-mile radius. ``That way you might be able to \n     determine whether you are being asked to pay fees that are \n     unreasonable compared to similar establishments,'' Meersman \n     said.\n       A number of Colorado restaurant operators have been \n     threatened if they didn't sign a music agreement, he said. \n     ``We think our members ought to be treated in a more \n     professional manner. They don't like to be threatened, \n     intimidated. It's a standard of professional conduct.''\n       Meersman said the Colorado legislation has drawn opposition \n     from lobbyists from the music-copyright companies, who, he \n     said, ``are pulling out all the stops to try to squash this \n     legislation wherever it comes up.''\n       One argument is that music-copyright legislation should be \n     handled at the federal level, but Meersman disagrees: \n     ``Issues dealing with whether or not someone has to pay a \n     fee, those are not things we can deal with at the state \n     level. But how these people treat business owners in the \n     state and how they go about collecting the fees is a state \n     issue.''\n       Katy McGregor, a legislative representative with the NRA in \n     Washington, welcomes the state initiatives. If they can get \n     some reforms at the state level, it certainly makes dealing \n     with these music-licensing groups a little more agreeable \n     until we can get some changes in copyright law at the federal \n     level,'' she said. ``What they are doing in the states is \n     crucial.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the matter of a performance right for sound \nrecordings is an issue that has been in dispute for over 20 years. I \nbelieve that Congress will finally enact a law establishing that right.\n  I believe that musicians, singers and featured performers on \nrecordings ought to be compensated like other creative artists for the \npublic performances of works that they create and that we all enjoy. I \nwant companies that export American music not to be disadvantaged \ninternationally by the lack of U.S. recognition of such a performance \nright. Most of all, I have wanted to be sure that the new law is fair \nto all parties--to performers, musicians, songwriters, music \npublishers, performing rights societies, emerging companies expanding \nnew technologies, and, in particular, consumers and the public.\n  I am glad to have been able to play a role in redesigning the bill to \nmeet these objectives. The substitute seeks to preserve existing \nrights, to encourage the development of new technologies, and to \npromote competition as the best protection for consumers. I was pleased \nto join as a cosponsor of the substitute and to urge support for S. 227 \nas amended when the Judiciary Committee considered the bill on June 29.\n  Working with Senator Thurmond, the Chairman of the Antitrust \nSubcommittee, and with the help of the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice, we have been able to strengthen the bill in \nsignificant regard.\n  At our March hearing on S. 227, I raised antitrust concerns about \ncertain provisions in the bill. In particular, I was concerned about \nsubsections (h) and (e), which were proposed to be added to section 114 \nof the Copyright Act. The language of both subsections has been revised \nand strengthened to protect against anticompetitive activity.\n  As originally drafted, the bill might have created a virtually \nunlimited antitrust exemption for major record companies to combine to \nset prices for licensing music. While I want to work to find ways to \nkeep transaction costs as low as possible for clearing rights in order \nto make music in the future more accessible to the public at lower \nprices, I do not support such an exemption to our antitrust laws.\n  On June 20, I received a letter from the Department of Justice \nresponding to a letter I had sent following our hearing. The Department \nnoted that subsection (e) of the original bill could be read to provide \nstatutory authority to record companies to form a licensing cartel. In \nlight of the concentration of the record industry in which 6 major \ncompanies account for 80 to 85 percent of the U.S. market, this could, \nin the words of the Justice Department ``cause great mischief by \nallowing the formation of a cartel immune from antitrust scrutiny.'' I \nknow that is not what the original sponsors of this legislation \nintended.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Thurmond and others to resolve \nthese problems. The Department provided technical assistance to us as \nwe worked out another approach that authorizes only a clearinghouse to \ncut down transaction costs without authorizing price fixing by \ncombinations of companies. This is an approach with which we are all \nmore comfortable. In this regard, we received a follow-up letter from \nthe Department of Justice on these provisions.\n  I commend the industry groups that took seriously our suggestion that \nthey talk through their differences and see whether they could \nrecommend a consensus solution to Congress. The cooperation and good \nfaith contributed greatly to the process. My experience has been that \nin these areas of copyright law, legislation moves best and most easily \nby consensus. I think that is what we have strived to attain and what \nwe have achieved.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of the \nJune 20 and July 21 letters from the Department of Justice on this \nmeasure.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights \n         and Competition, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your March 13, 1995, \n     letter to Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman asking for \n     views on S. 227, the ``Digital Performance Right in Sound \n     Recordings Act of 1995.'' The Administration supports the \n     establishment of a performance right in digital recordings. \n     However, based on our review of S. 227, we believe: (1) that \n     proposed subsection (e) may inadvertently authorize cartel \n     activity in the licensing of performance rights, and (2) that \n     proposed subsection (h) does not fully address the potential \n     competition issues associated with licensing to affiliated \n     entities. \n\n[[Page S 11962]]\n     Minor modifications to S. 227 would remedy these deficiencies without \n     undermining the bill's underlying goals.\n       Performance rights in sound recordings, common in Europe \n     and other regions, are not currently granted by the 1976 \n     Copyright Act or any other federal statute. Thus, under \n     current law, producers of sound recordings are not entitled \n     to license or receive royalties for the public performance \n     and broadcast of their recordings in the U.S. for example, \n     digital subscription transmission services \\1\\ currently may \n     buy a compact disc on the retail market and simply play the \n     music from it on their channels without obtaining the \n     permission of or compensating the artists or record companies \n     that produced the recording.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Senate Bill 227 would amend the Copyright Act to create a \n     performance right in digital transmissions. Under the bill, \n     right holders would have the authority to receive royalty \n     fees from, and in some cases, negotiate the terms of, the \n     performance of their sound recordings by digital delivery \n     services such as pay-per-listen and subscription transmission \n     services.\n       Generally, we believe that S. 227 would advance competition \n     by allowing producers of sound recordings control over \n     certain transmissions of their recordings by some digital \n     transmission services, this potentially allowing them to \n     limit the threat of uncompensated home copying by subscribers \n     to those services. Nevertheless, given the concentrated \n     nature of the affected industries, the danger exists that \n     this remedial legislation could be subverted to monopolistic \n     aims.\n       1. Licensing Cartel.--We are concerned that proposed \n     subsection (e), by allowing license negotiations by a common \n     agent, would authorize formation of a cartel by performance \n     rights holders. Our understanding is that a ``performance \n     right'' would, at least with respect to the major record \n     companies and their affiliates (the ``majors'') \\2\\ be held \n     by the record company, either by virtue of its producer \n     status or by contract with the artist.\\3\\\n       As part of its ongoing inquiry into licensing practices in \n     U.S. and in foreign commerce, the Department is currently \n     investigating whether certain record companies have \n     unlawfully colluded on license fees by, inter alia, forming \n     ``performance rights societies'' in Europe and elsewhere that \n     operate as the exclusive negotiating agency for all of the \n     record companies. Unlike licensing societies that act as \n     nonexclusive agents for owners and composers of copyrighted \n     compositions, the foreign performance rights societies are \n     the exclusive assignees of performance rights and arguably \n     are highly concentrated. Exploiting the combined market power \n     associated with the pooling of intellectual property rights, \n     these exclusive licensing societies typically charge a \n     percentage-of-revenue fee in return for a blanket license. \n     The European Commission has issued a Statement of Objections \n     against these practices as they relate to music video \n     licenses, and the Division is likewise seeking to determine \n     whether the activities of these foreign rights societies have \n     an adverse impact on U.S. exports of music video and digital \n     radio programming. See United States v. Time Warner\n      Inc., et at., No. Misc. 94-338 HHG (filed Nov. 3, 1994) \n     (Petition to enforce civil investigative demands).\n       Arguably, S. 227 would statutorily authorize performance \n     right holders, and record companies in particular, to form \n     the same kind of anticompetitive performance rights society \n     here in the United States. According to proposed subsection \n     (e):\n       ``Any copyright owners of sound recordings and any entities \n     performing sound recordings affected by this section may \n     negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty \n     payments for the performance of such sound recordings and the \n     proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, \n     and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, \n     or receive such royalty payments.''\n       (Emphasis added). This subsection could cause great \n     mischief by allowing the formation of a cartel immune from \n     antitrust scrutiny. Although the arbitration royalty panel \n     created by the statute would set some limit on fees charged \n     for compulsory licenses, this provision would authorize \n     collective negotiations by right holders for unregulated \n     voluntary licenses as well. Moreover, even in the compulsory \n     license context, a small programmer would almost certainly \n     pay hefty premium in order to avoid the costs of a challenge \n     before the royalty panel against a cartel whose costs and \n     legal fees are spread over a multi-billion dollar industry. \n     Ultimately, U.S. consumers would pay this premium.\n       We therefore strongly recommend that proposed subsection \n     (e) be deleted. To do so would in no way affect the salutary \n     goals of the bill. Artists could transfer rights to the \n     record companies. Record companies could unilaterally hire \n     agents. They could even form a performance right society so \n     long as it conformed to the antitrust laws. What they could \n     not do is form a federally authorized cartel to set higher-\n     than-competitive prices.\n       2. Licensing to Affiliates.--Proposed subsection (h) \n     provides that, where a right holder licenses a sound \n     recording to a digital programmer it directly or indirectly \n     controls, the right holder must license to similarly situated \n     programmers on similar terms and conditions. As written, this \n     provision is unlikely to be an effective deterrent to \n     discrimination in favor of affiliates and may have the \n     unintended effect of mandating higher-than-competitive \n     license fees.\n       In the first place, the trigger language of the bill is too \n     narrow. As far as we know, no individual right holder, \n     including the record companies, has a large enough individual \n     stake in a\n      digital programmer to have positive ``control''. Together, \n     however, several majors potentially may exercise \n     substantial collective influence. Taking the cable audio \n     services industry as an example, Sony, Warner, and EMI \n     each hold a 33% interest in SWE Cable Radio Company (SWE), \n     which in turn holds a 35% interest--enough for negative \n     control over any major decision--in Digital Cable Radio \n     Associates L.P. (DCR). Presumably, these partners could \n     favor their collectively controlled programmer at the \n     expense of Digital Music Express (DMX), the only other \n     digital radio programmer. S. 227 would not prevent \n     discrimination of this type.\n       Second, it is by no means clear that programmers such as \n     DMX would be protected by subsection (h) even if it were \n     triggered. As written, the subsection mandates ``similar \n     terms'' as those provided to the affiliated programmer. This \n     raises the possibility that right holder(s) could set a high \n     price to the affiliated programmer and then claim a statutory \n     requirement to apply the artificially high rate to the non-\n     affiliated programmer.\n       Third, to be an effective deterrent to discrimination, \n     subsection (h)(2), allowing the right holder to set different \n     terms and conditions for essentially any reason, should be \n     tightened.\n       We suggest, therefore, the following modifications to \n     proposed subsection (h) (changes in italics):\n       ``Where a copyright owner of sound recordings, indvidually \n     or collectively with other copyright owners of sound \n     recordings, owns a controlling interest in, or otherwise \n     possesses the power directly or indirectly to control or \n     block important management decisions of, an entity engaging \n     in digital transmissions covered by section 106(6) and \n     licenses to such entity the right to publicly perform a sound \n     recording by means of digital transmission, the copyright \n     owner shall make the licensed sound recording available under \n     section 106(6) on terms and conditions no less favorable to \n     all similarly-situated entities offering similar types of \n     digital transmission services, except that the copyright \n     owner may--\n       ``(1) impose reasonable requirements for creditworthiness; \n     and\n       ``(2) make reasonable adjustments to the prices, terms, and \n     conditions to take into account the types of services \n     offered, the duration of the license, the geographic region, \n     the numbers of subscribers served, and any other relevant \n     factors.''\n\n     We believe this modified language would address the concerns \n     set forth above by (1) expanding the coverage of the \n     subsection to include situations where right holders \n     collectively control a programmer or have a stake in a \n     programmer that does not rise to the level of positive \n     control; (2) restricting the ability of a right holder to \n     discriminate based on pretextual dissimilarities among \n     affiliated and non-affiliated programmers; (3) preserving the \n     ability of rights holders to take substantial differences \n     among programmers into account; and (4) ensuring that a \n     programmer is not bound by statute to accept an artificially \n     high license fee.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on S. 227. In our \n     view, the bill would be measurably improved if Congress were \n     to adopt the suggested modifications or take other steps to \n     address the concerns we have raised.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This letter responds to your June 29, \n     1995, letter to Anne K. Bingaman in which you, joined by \n     Senators Thurmand, Kyl and Brown, asked for the Department of \n     Justice's views on whether the most recent changes made to S. \n     227 adequately address the antitrust concerns raised in the \n     Department's June 20, 1995, letter to you on this subject.\n       S. 227 would amend the Copyright Act to create a \n     performance right in digital transmissions. Under the bill, \n     right holders would have the authority to receive royalty \n     fees \n\n[[Page S 11963]]\n     from, and, in some cases, negotiate the terms of the performance of \n     their sound recordings by digital delivery services such as \n     pay-per-listen and subscriptions transmission services.\n       The Administration supports the establishment of a \n     performance right for sound recordings. Generally, we believe \n     that S. 227 would advance competition by allowing producers \n     of sound recordings control over certain transmissions of \n     their recordings by some digital services, thus potentially \n     allowing them to limit the threat of uncompensated home \n     copying by subscribers of those services.\n       As set forth more fully in our earlier letter, the original \n     language of S. 227 could have been read to statutorily \n     authorize activities that might otherwise violate the \n     antitrust laws. Specifically, proposed subsection (e) \n     arguably would have authorized rights holders--typically \n     record companies--to designate ``common agents'' without \n     appropriate safeguards to ensure against cartel behavior. \n     Similarly, proposed subsection (h) could have been read to \n     require an unaffiliated programmer to\n      pay the same artificially high license as paid by an \n     affiliated programmer.\n       As we read the Chairman's Final Mark Substitute Draft of S. \n     227, the revised bill can no longer be read to exempt \n     activity that would otherwise clearly violate the antitrust \n     laws.\n       With respect to proposed subsection (e), ``Authority for \n     Negotiations,'' we were concerned that the original language \n     of the bill would have the unintended effect of making cartel \n     conduct immune from antitrust scrutiny. In the revised bill, \n     the role of the common agent has been substantially \n     curtailed, thus addressing our concern. Specifically, in the \n     context of ``voluntary negotiations'' for a statutory \n     license, the common agent is now ``non-exclusive''--meaning \n     that a programmer may not be required to negotiate through \n     the common agent. In addition, any impasse on license fees, \n     terms and conditions can be resolved by the rate panel, if \n     necessary. Where a statutory license has not been created \n     (e.g., for interactive transmissions or transmissions that \n     exceed the performance complement), the common agent's role \n     is limited to a ``clearing house'' function. In other words, \n     under those circumstances a common agent may not be the \n     instrument of collective negotiation of rates and material \n     terms. These changes address our primary concerns with the \n     original language of subsection (e).\\1\\\n     \\1\\ Proposed subsection (e)(1) contains the clause \n     ``[n]otwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws * * * \n     .'' We would prefer such language be deleted, although we \n     understand that Congress has used that language in other \n     parts of the Copyright Act dealing with statutory licenses. \n     Even with that language, we note that the substance of \n     proposed subsection (e)(1) does not appear to authorize \n     conduct facially at odds with the antitrust laws.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       With respect to proposed subsection (h), ``Licensing to \n     Affiliates,'' our primary concerns were whether the language \n     of the bill: (1) adequately defined situations in which right \n     holders might individually or collectively control an \n     affiliate, and (2) would have permitted right holders to \n     impose artificially high license fees on non-affiliates. With \n     the addition of a definition of an ``affiliated entity'' in \n     (j)(1) and the replacement of ``similar terms and \n     conditions'' in subsection (h) with ``no less favorable terms \n     and conditions,'' we believe that control of affiliates is \n     adequately defined and that our competitive concern that the \n     bill would create a likelihood of competitive disadvantage \n     for non-affiliates has been addressed.\n       We believe that S. 227, as modified, adequately addresses \n     the competition concerns of the Department of Justice.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. GORTON.
