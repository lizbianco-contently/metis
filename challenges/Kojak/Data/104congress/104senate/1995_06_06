Mr. President, it gives me a great deal of honor and \nprivilege to be here today to join some of my female Senators in paying \ntribute to Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who passed away on Memorial \nDay, after 97 years of courage, bravery, integrity, and pioneering \nspirit. I would like to join the people of Maine, the Nation, and my \ncolleagues in saying goodbye to Margaret Chase Smith, forever the \nSenator from Maine. She lived through two world wars, 17 Presidents, \nand outlived over 70 years of communism. She was given 95 honorary \ndegrees throughout her life, almost 1 degree for every year of her time \non Earth.\n  She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George \nBush at a White House ceremony in 1989.\n  She was a teacher, a telephone operator, a newspaperwoman, an office \nmanager, a secretary, a wife, a Congresswoman and, for 24 years, a U.S. \nSenator. She rose from the humblest of beginnings to the highest \ncorridors of power.\n  But she was also a leader, an inspiration, a nation's conscience, a \nvisionary, and a woman of endless firsts.\n  She was the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate. She was the \nfirst woman to be elected to both the House of Representatives and the \nU.S. Senate. She was the first woman to face another woman in a U.S. \nSenate election campaign.\n  She was the first woman to become a ranking member of a congressional \ncommittee. She was the first woman to serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee. She was the first woman to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. She was the first woman to be elected chair of the \nRepublican Conference.\n  She was the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for the \nPresidency by either major political party in 1964. She was the first \ncivilian woman to sail on a U.S. destroyer in wartime. And, not \nsurprisingly, if you knew her, she was the first woman to \n[[Page S7714]] brush Heaven's horizon and challenge the skies by \nbreaking the sound barrier in a U.S. Air Force F-100 Super Sabre \nfighter.\n  She was a woman of many firsts, a daughter of Maine, a trailblazer \nfor women, a patriot of America.\n  Today we come to remember two things: We remember a legend, and we \nremember history, the history Margaret Chase Smith of Skowhegan made \nthroughout her 32 years of outstanding public service to the people of \nMaine and the citizens of America.\n  From the very first day I met Margaret Chase Smith, I often wondered \nif she ever knowingly set out to make history in 1940 as she began her \nservice in the House of Representatives. Today, I realize Margaret \nChase Smith never charted a course to make history or pursue it. The \nfact is, history merely followed Margaret Chase Smith.\n  It was when her husband, Congressman Clyde Smith, died in 1940 that \nMargaret Chase Smith found herself thrust into political life.\n  Shortly after his death, she won a special election to fill the \nunexpired term of her late husband, and then went on to win the June \nRepublican primary and win, of course, the November general election.\n  Mrs. Smith was going to Washington, and she would be there for 32 \nsplendid years in both the House and the Senate.\n  She ran for the Senate when Senate majority leader Wallace White, of \nMaine, announced that he would retire in 1948. So she decided to run \nfor that vacant seat. After beating both Maine's incumbent Republican \nGovernor and a former Governor in the June primary, Smith went on to \nclaim victory in the general election, beginning the now famous litany \nof firsts that would act as proud landmarks and milestones in her life.\n  It is safe to assume at this point in her life most of Maine knew \nabout their newly-elected junior Senator, although she was not yet a \nhousehold name anywhere else. But America was about to find out exactly \nwho Margaret Chase Smith was. During one of the Nation's darkest hours \nof history, Margaret Chase Smith never shone more brightly as a beacon \nof reason, fairness, and courage.\n  The spring of 1950 was a dark and tragic time in American history. \nThey were days of poisonous rhetoric, rage, fear, suspicion, and hate.\n  Senator Joseph McCarthy had made sensational and unsubstantiated \ncharges that had turned him into a national celebrity and purveyor of \nblatant opportunism--charges about Communist spies and Soviet-sponsored \ntraitors throughout our Nation's governing institutions. He held the \nAmerican consciousness hostage to his hate-filled tactics, and no one \ndared to stand up to Senator Joe McCarthy. No one, that is, except \nMaine's own Senator Smith.\n  On June 1, 1950, in her first major speech on the floor of the Senate \nand as a freshman, Margaret Chase Smith spoke out loud the words that \nmuch of America had thought quietly to themselves.\n  A Republican with a strong allegiance to her party, Smith \nnevertheless retained her independent Yankee spirit and was known to be \na maverick on some issues important to her as a matter of conscience, \nrather than as a matter of politics.\n  So it was that Senator Smith began one of the most famous speeches in \nAmerican history, the ``Declaration of Conscience,'' with the words, \n``I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national \ncondition.'' I would like to quote from that. She began by saying:\n\n       I speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has \n     already been done with irresponsible words of bitterness and \n     selfish political opportunism. I speak as simply as possible \n     because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence. I \n     speak simply and briefly in the hope that my words will be \n     taken to heart.\n       I speak as a Republican. I speak as a woman. I speak as a \n     United States Senator. I speak as an American.\n\n  For the next 15 minutes, her words resonated across America and \nstruck a chord with the hearts and minds of all Americans. Senator \nMcCarthy sat directly behind her, a fitting position for him to be \nshadowed in light of her reason and integrity. She had done in 15 \nminutes what none of her 94 other colleagues had dared to do for \nmonths, and she never mentioned Senator McCarthy's name in the process.\n  I should mention that she sat in seat No. 1, where the President sits \ncurrently, when she made this most important speech.\n  In slaying a giant of demagoguery, Margaret Chase Smith stood and \ncourageously defended what she termed ``some of the basic principles of \nAmericanism,'' and I would like again to quote from her speech. Those \nprinciples, she said, were:\n\n       The right to criticize;\n       The right to hold unpopular beliefs;\n       The right to protest;\n       The right of independent thought.\n\n  She went on to say that:\n\n       The exercise of these rights should not cost one single \n     American citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood \n     nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or the \n     livelihood merely because he happens to know someone who \n     holds unpopular beliefs.\n\n  Bernard Baruch once said had a man made that speech, he would have \nbecome the next President of the United States.\n  Almost exactly 45 years to the date--June 1 of last week--after she \nspoke those brave words, her voice of reason still reaches across the \nyears and follows her spirit skyward.\n  In 1972, her public service career concluded. When she retired, she \nleft another legacy of her dedication to public service: A near-perfect \nattendance record in Congress. She held, until 1981, the all-time \nconsecutive rollcall voting record in the entire history of the U.S. \nSenate with 2,941 consecutive rollcall votes spanning 13 years. Only a \nmuch-needed hip operation in September 1968 kept her from casting her \nvote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Not known for displaying idleness as a personal quality, Margaret \nChase Smith spent the next 23 years of her life after politics \nlecturing at dozens of colleges and universities across this country, \nand worked tirelessly to establish what is now known as the Margaret \nChase Smith Library Center at her beloved home in Skowhegan, a small \ntown where she was born almost a century ago.\n  I know that I and other women in public service have a very high \nstandard to meet in her wake and some rather large shoes to fill as we \nwalk in the footsteps of Margaret Chase Smith. Fortunately for us, \nthose shoes had heels.\n  Indeed, Margaret Chase Smith showed how a woman's place can truly be \nin ``the House * * * and the Senate.'' She was an inspiration to \nmillions of young girls and women all across this country who never \nbefore thought they could aspire to any kind of public office. She \nshowed us through her talents, abilities, and energies that \nopportunities for women did exist and that the door to elected office \ncould be unlocked and opened to all women. But most importantly, what \nMargaret Chase Smith's life proved is it is not necessarily gender \nwhich makes a difference in public service, it is dedication, it is \nenergy, perseverance, competence, and the will to get the job done.\n  At last, she has reached a final resting place amongst the angels. \nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said, ``In Heaven, an angel is no one in \nparticular.'' I would have to say George Bernard Shaw never knew \nMargaret Chase Smith, because she was truly one of the ``better angels \namong us,'' to use the words of the President of the United States. But \nI am sure in Heaven, as on Earth, Margaret Chase Smith will come to be \nknown as someone quite ``in particular.''\n  It is only fitting she requested her epitaph to read: ``She served \npeople.''\n  Well, she certainly served them and she served them well. So it is \nwith a mixture of pride and humility that when I am referred to as \n``the Senator from Maine,'' I know well this is a phrase of honorable \nand distinguished past. Hearing those words will always evoke images of \nan individual who gave Maine some of its proudest moments. That phrase \nis a daily reminder of an individual who had the will and integrity to \nspeak out vigorously when silence was a safer course.\n  Margaret Chase Smith once said,\n\n       If I were to do it all over again, I would change nothing. \n     I am very proud of my public service. I have no regrets * * \n     *. No regrets, no changes--I would do it all over again.''\n\n  I know I speak on behalf of Maine and my colleagues when I say I wish \nyou could.\n  [[Page S7715]] Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Maryland who is the dean of the Democratic women in the U.S. \nSenate, who is the first Democratic woman, like Margaret Chase Smith, \nto have served both in the House and in the U.S. Senate and also the \nfirst woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from the State of \nMaryland.\n  So I am pleased Senator Mikulski could join us today in this tribute \nto Margaret Chase Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for \nrecognizing me.\n  I rise today as the dean of the Democratic women to salute a great \nand grand lady, a daughter of Maine, Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  Growing up as a young girl, there were very few role models that I or \nwomen of my generation had for women participating in politics. \nCertainly, there had been Eleanor Roosevelt who served as the First \nLady of the United States of America. But during the fifties, as a high \nschool girl, I admired two great women--Clare Boothe Luce, who was a \nCongresswoman, and also Margaret Chase Smith from Maine. And going to a \nCatholic woman's high school and college, these two women were always \nheld up as models and examples. In those days, we did not have words \nlike ``role models,'' but they used terms like ``examples,'' about how \nwomen could retain their femininity and dignity and yet participate in \nthe dynamic world of politics.\n  When I came to the U.S. Senate, I was struck by the many parallels in \nthe lives between Senator Smith and myself. I was deeply honored to \nfollow in her footsteps. Until 1992, only 17 women had served in the \nU.S. Senate. Only five of those women had been elected in their own \nright and there was one who served only 1 day, but that was not Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith. For four distinguished terms, she served in the \nU.S. Senate and was a woman of many firsts and many accomplishments.\n  The similarities in our backgrounds were brought to my attention by \nthe Senate Historian when I came here. Senator Smith was the first \nwoman elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right. I was the first \nDemocratic woman elected in my own right. She was the first woman to \nserve in both Houses. I, when I came, was the first Democratic woman to \nserve in both Houses, and now I am delighted to say I have been joined \nby Senator Snowe of Maine and Senator Boxer of California. Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith, in one of her elections, defeated another woman \nfor the job that raised eyebrows all over America in that spirited \ncombat. I defeated another woman in my general election, and I must say \nwe not only raised eyebrows but we raised a bit of a decibel level in \nthe debate.\n  Senator Smith was a member of the Appropriations Committee, and I \nhave the honor to be appointed to that committee as well. Senator Smith \nwas on the Board of Visitors at the U.S. Naval Academy and I, too, \nshare that great honor. Only when she was there during the dark days of \nthe beginning of the cold war through her term, there were no women at \nthe Naval Academy, and I think she would be delighted to see the \naccomplishments and advancements of those women.\n  She was also the first Republican woman who held, or perhaps the only \nwoman to hold, a leadership position in her party for many years. Just \nrecently, I had the opportunity of being chosen by my colleagues to be \nthe Secretary of the Democratic caucus. I bring these issues to the \nSenate's attention not because I want to draw attention to myself, but \nto the fact that the parallels here were so inspirational to me. When \none comes to the Senate, and my colleagues on the floor, the other \nwomen Senators, know how tough it is to be the first in many areas; \noften they know how tough it is to be the first and the only. When I \nturned to the history books and see Margaret Chase Smith, and when I \ncame here and joined Senator Kassebaum, I was so fortified, so \ninspired, it really gave me guiding principles to follow here in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  However, there are things that differ Senator Smith from myself--not \nonly of different parties, but Senator Smith, as a young girl, was an \noutstanding athlete. That was not my forte. And, also, she did \nsomething I believe no other woman has done in the Senate--she was a \nlieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve and served in the Reserve \nForces. Senator Snowe spoke at great length about the declaration of \nconscience. I hope that all the women of the Senate and all the men of \nthe Senate feel that same sense of responsibility to speak out where \nnecessary.\n  When I was elected, I invited her to my swearing in. She could not \ncome but sent me the most gentle and encouraging note. I believe if she \nwere here today, she would like this Senate. She would look at her own \nparty and see another daughter of Maine joining the U.S. Senate and \nwith great admiration, admire Senator Snowe's moving quickly to \nresponsibility in both fiscal matters and in foreign affairs. She would \nbe delighted to see Senator Kassebaum chairing the Committee on Labor, \nEducation, and Human Resources, showing that we can meet our fiscal \nresponsibility, look out for America's day-to-day needs, and yet meet \nthe long-range needs of our country. She would admire the fact that \nSenator Hutchison had joined the U.S. Senate and was taking up the role \nof women on the Armed Services Committee. I think she would like \nSenator Boxer's spunk; Senator Feinstein's executive ability; Senator \nMurray being the voice of a mother to the U.S. Senate, a young mother; \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun's ability in housing, banking, and also \njudicial affairs and being willing to take on the tough issues in \nmaking her own declaration of conscience. I think she would like me \nhere on the Appropriations Committee, saying, Barbara, watch out for \nthe money, watch out for the country and you will be OK.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nwonderful tribute and testimony to Senator Margaret Chase Smith. I know \nshe would enjoy the comments the Senator has made. They are fitting and \nmost appropriate for a woman who served her country and her State and \nconstituents well.\n  I now will yield to Senator Kassebaum of Kansas, who was the first \nwoman elected from Kansas. In fact, this was the second woman ever to \nbe elected in her own right to the U.S. Senate, and the first woman to \nbe elected to the Senate without first having been preceded in Congress \nby a spouse.\n  Senator Kassebaum and I had the pleasure of joining Senator Smith at \nher home back in October 1992, and I know those were special moments we \nwill always treasure and share. I am pleased that Senator Kassebaum \ncould be here today to participate in this tribute. I yield the Senator \n4 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, speaking this morning and introducing all of us and \nbeing able to pay a brief tribute to a remarkable woman and a great \nSenator.\n  I did not have the privilege of serving with Margaret Chase Smith in \nthe U.S. Senate, but I did have the privilege of knowing her. I want to \ncomment for a few moments. My colleague, Senator Snowe has recounted \nmany of the milestones in Senator Smith's career. I would like to speak \nabout the spirit of her service and what it has meant to me and to so \nmany others.\n  I thought Senator Mikulski spoke extraordinarily well about what each \nof the women who serves here today bring out, which is a culmination of \nmany of the things that Senator Smith stood for in her long career of \npublic service. She was a woman who refused to ever be bound by \nstereotypes or labels. She was not a woman Senator, she was simply a \nSenator. Her interests were wide-ranging because they were her own and \nnot a narrow agenda imposed by gender, region, or parochial concerns. \nShe was a true expert on defense matters, military preparedness, space \nexploration, and NATO.\n  She had deep and strongly held concerns about civil rights law, \neducation policy, and the rules of the Senate. She had a high regard \nfor the institutions of Government and a great respect for the \ninstitutions of Government. She denounced the red baiting of the 1950's \nand the left-wing orthodoxy of the [[Page S7716]] 1960's. She spoke \nboth gently and forthrightly, but always went from personal conviction \nand principles. She is rightly remembered as a Senator with great \nspunk, intelligence, and commitment. She sought not only to represent \nthe people of Maine, but also to fulfill her responsibilities to the \nNation as a whole.\n  In her 24 years in the U.S. Senate, she spoke always with honesty and \nclarity, seeking facts and judging each issue on its merits. Those are \nhigh standards, Mr. President, a worthy legacy to pass on to those who \nwill follow her in this Chamber.\n  I am honored to be able to pay tribute today to a great lady, a fine \nU.S. Senator and an inspiring legacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator Kassebaum for the wonderful statement she \nmade about Margaret Chase Smith. I know I have those long memories and \nrecollections of our visit with her. It was truly inspiring because of \nwhat she had accomplished in both the House and the Senate, but I think \nmore significant is the fact of when she accomplished it. Her \naccomplishments are as remarkable today as they were then in terms of \nour standards and the ability of women to participate in the public \narena. There are still many obstacles, but there is no doubt there were \nmany more in the 1940's. The fact she was able to have an extremely \nchallenging race in 1948 with an incumbent Governor and former Governor \nand still came on top. After attacking Senator Joe McCarthy in terms of \nwhat he had done to this country, he got somebody to run against her.\n  She still came out with 82 percent of the vote as a resounding \nvictory, not only for Senator Margaret Chase Smith but for this \ncountry, condemning the kind of tactics he employed.\n  Now it is my pleasure to recognize the Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison. Many women are firsts here. Senator Hutchison is the first \nwoman to be elected from the State of Texas to the U.S. Senate, but she \nis also the second woman in the history of the U.S. Senate to serve on \nthe Armed Services Committee, the other woman being, of course, Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to thank my colleague from \nMaine who followed in Margaret Chase Smith's great footsteps. I \nappreciate the fact that she has set aside this time for Members to pay \ntribute to the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right.\n  I am really proud to follow women who actually knew Margaret Chase \nSmith, because when I was growing up, I certainly never thought of \nrunning for the Senate. However, I remember people talking about \nMargaret Chase Smith, not as anything unusual, but as a fine Senator, \nrespected in her own right. ``One tough hombre,'' as we would say in \nTexas.\n  I think the fact that she served so well as an early woman Senator \nmade it much easier for those woman Members who would follow in her \nfootsteps.\n  ``Mr. President, I speak as a Republican. I speak as a woman. I speak \nas a U.S. Senator. I speak as an American.'' Mr. President, although \nany one of my speeches could have started in that way, those words \ncame, in fact, from a speech more profound than any comments I have \never made on this floor. These are the words with which Margaret Chase \nSmith started her ``Declaration of Conscience'' in 1950.\n  I rise to pay homage to a woman who embodied clarity of conscience \nand strength of character during her 24 years in this Chamber.\n  As my colleague from Maine has said, Margaret Chase Smith led seven \nother Republican Senators in their condemnation of Joseph McCarthy's \ntactics in accusing numerous Americans of Communist actions.\n  Although opposed to Communists in America and abroad, she objected to \nthe scope of Senator McCarthy's investigation when it began to harm the \nreputations of many innocent Americans.\n  A true leader, Mr. President, she did this at a time when she only \nhad 1 year of experience in the U.S. Senate. She was quick to go to the \nforefront. She led her colleagues against Senator McCarthy's \ninaccuracies when they became clear. Senator Smith's commitment to \ntruth and justice made her transcend partisan considerations, to stand \nup for what she believed was right.\n  In order to reflect her distinguished career properly, we should also \nremember Senator Smith's many other accomplishments. Throughout her \nfour terms, one of her primary interests was military readiness of our \nNation. She was the first woman to serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee. Women in the Armed Forces will always remember her as the \nmother of WAVES--the women's branch of the Navy.\n  Like many of the senators on this side of the aisle, she worked to \nprotect our technological advantage in the cold war by voting against \nthe Test Ban Treaty of 1963.\n  In an age when men dominated politics, she was a leader at bringing \nwomen into the political process. Senator Smith became the first woman \nplaced on the ballot for nomination for President by a major political \nparty. At the Republican National Convention of 1964, she received 27 \nvotes on the first ballot.\n  Margaret Chase Smith was a role model. She led the way for others to \nfollow. She left her mark. She was, in fact, an architect of the \nNation's cold war defense. She was a credit to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, as the only other woman to serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee, I hear many stories about the great Margaret Chase Smith and \nher time on that committee. I hope to live up to the high standards \nthat she set. I honor her service. I offer my condolences and those of \nall Texans to the family and friends of Margaret Chase Smith. May she \nrest in peace.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend morning \nbusiness for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her outstanding statement on behalf \nof Margaret Chase Smith. I know that Margaret Chase Smith would \ncertainly have been delighted and thrilled to hear the remarks that \nwere made here this morning and the work she has performed on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  It also reminds me, as I have heard the statements here today, that \nit certainly is true that she blazed a trail for women, because we are \nall firsts here in our own right. If she had not blazed the trail, I am \nnot sure we would be here today. We have all established our trademarks \nin the way she would be proud, and she would be proud and thrilled by \nthe statements made on her behalf.\n  It now gives me a great deal of pleasure to recognize Senator Boxer \nfrom California. For the first time in the history of California, there \nare two women Senators. Senator Boxer has the honor of being only one \nof four in the U.S. Senate to have served in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the Senator from California 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, I say to my friend from Maine. She \nand I served as good friends over on the House side. It is a privilege \nto be part of this tribute today.\n  I think it is so extraordinary that a woman like Margaret Chase Smith \ncould bring to this Senate floor Republicans and Democrats who speak of \nher with such fond memories. I think Senator Hutchison found things in \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith's record she can identify with. I \ncertainly find those, as a Democrat. This says something very special \nabout this woman, that she would be so revered on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Obviously, it is in order to send condolences to the family--the many \nnieces and nephews, and her sister, Evelyn Williams. I hope that \nthrough the sadness of their loss, they certainly can reflect with \npride, as we are, on the remarkable life of Margaret Chase Smith.\n  When you lose someone, whatever age they are, it still is a very \npainful experience. I am sure they are going through that pain. Just a \ncouple years ago, I read an interview that Margaret Chase Smith gave to \na major national newspaper. Believe me, she was sharper than many \nMembers are, at the ripe old age of 95. She lived for nearly a century. \n[[Page S7717]] \n  When we think about it, she lived through World War I, World War II, \nthe beginning and the end of the cold war. She lived through women's \nsuffrage and through civil rights. She saw her country and her world \ngrow in many amazing ways.\n  But she never just sat back. She made history herself and, in doing \nso, touched many lives, including my own.\n  I was a child of the 1950's--the time of the ``Happy Days,'' Doris \nDay movies, the Debbie Reynolds days--when pert women with \npersonalities glowed and danced their way through the perfect life and \nright into the arms of Eddie Fisher guys, who would sing to them until \ntheir dying days.\n  Politics was not even in the realm of the possible for women, except \nfor Margaret Chase Smith and just a few others.\n  My mother was an F.D.R. Democrat through and through. Yet, she used \nto point with pride to Margaret Chase Smith. ``Imagine what she must be \nlike,'' my mother would say. ``One woman among all those men. She must \nbe something!'' And she was.\n  Margaret Chase Smith arrived in Washington in 1935, the wife and \nsecretary of Representative Clyde Smith of Maine. Her career began \nsuddenly in 1940 when her husband died and she won a special election \nto take his place. She went on to serve four terms in the Senate, \nmaking her the first woman in history, as my colleague from Maine has \nnoted, to serve in both Houses of Congress. And I think, more \nsignificant than that, she was one of the most popular legislators of \nall times.\n  She earned her reputation as the conscience of the Senate in 1950, \nwhen she became the first in her party to attack Senator Joe McCarthy \nfor his politics of hate and fear and, in doing so, she definitely, in \nmy opinion, blazed trails. Because it does not matter what year it is, \nwhat century it is, the fact is there are people in politics who will \nplay the politics of hate and fear and it takes courage to stand up to \nit, and she taught us how. You can imagine the shock in the Senate when \nshe said, ``I do not like the way the Senate has been made a rendezvous \nfor vilification, for selfish political gain at the sacrifice of \nindividual reputations and national unity.''\n  When asked later about the courage she mustered to give that \ndeclaration she said, ``Oh, my! I'll say it was difficult! But someone \nhad to do it * * *. The more I thought of it, the more I thought, \nsomeone has to do this.''\n  I think that is, again, a lesson to us, because sometimes it is very \nhard to stand up and say something that is unpopular. It is tough to \nvote for something unpopular, but it is even tougher to stand up and \nsay something unpopular. She was willing to do it and I think, as such, \nis really a guiding star for both women and men in politics.\n  That was not the only time Senator Smith defied party unity. She \nvoted for F.D.R.'s New Deal and for Federal support for education, just \nto name a few. So, therefore, I point out that both Republicans and \nDemocrats can find things in her record that they can identify with.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for just 1 more minute.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield an additional minute to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  In her own words, Senator Smith served in Congress in a time when \n``people felt, as the Constitution says, that people are the \nGovernment.'' I think this is a time when all of us in this Chamber \nyearn to see that again. We are the Government. Anyone who attacks the \nGovernment, such as the kind of thing we saw in Oklahoma City, is \nessentially attacking America.\n  In 1975, the long reign of the Lady of Maine--and now we have another \nLady of Maine--ended when she was defeated in her fifth run for the \nSenate. She said, ``I hate to leave the Senate when there is no \nindication another qualified woman is coming in. If I leave and there \nis a long lapse, the next woman will have to rebuild entirely.'' In \nfact, there was a long lapse, but how proud she must have been to see \nOlympia Snowe make it and become another Lady of Maine.\n  I am certainly proud to be one of the many women--and I say there are \nmany of us now, perhaps not enough, but many--to be here today to honor \nthe life of a true pioneer, one who came before and cleared the path \nfor others to follow, one who served as a role model for all of us. Now \nyoung women can say: Yes, I can grow up and be a U.S. Senator. I can \nfind the courage to stand up and do what is right.\n  I again thank my colleague from Maine for giving me this time. \nMargaret Chase Smith, although she lived 97 years on this Earth, will \nbe missed. But I believe her presence will always be in this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend, for \n5 minutes, morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to finish, before my \ncolleague from Maine sums up this tribute, by thanking the Senator from \nMaine for doing something very thoughtful. As we go through our \nworkdays and we do not stop to think of some of the important \nmilestones that happened in the world, in the United States, in the \nSenate, the Senator from Maine has done something very special, and \nthat is to point out that there are so many women, now, in the Senate \nthat we could take 45 minutes from the business day to pay tribute to \nthe first woman who led the way for us.\n  I think, as we heard the remarks that were made, that each person is \nfollowing in some way a wonderful lead that was given to us by the \ngreat service that Margaret Chase Smith gave to our country; that is, \nto lead with dignity, with class, with continuity through four terms.\n  I think the tribute today is a wonderful thing to show the first \nwoman, in fact, made it possible for eight women to follow her and to \nhave in our own right a voice at the table on the Armed Services \nCommittee or in our respective States. I think it was wonderful for the \nSenator from Maine to make this time possible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator because I think \nit is true that in no small part it is due to Margaret Chase Smith's \npresence here that today we have eight women in the U.S. Senate and a \nrecord number in the House of Representatives. She certainly served as \nan inspiration as we began our political careers. I know the first time \nI visited with her when I decided to run for the House of \nRepresentatives, and then more recently when I did have the opportunity \nto see her last year after I announced my candidacy for the U.S. \nSenate, she told me to give it all I had, to work very hard, to leave \nno stone unturned, which is what she always did. I think we needed to \nhave role models like Margaret Chase Smith who would blaze that trail \nfor us to make that possible.\n  After all, she was born 23 years before women had the right to vote \nin this country. The fact that she was willing to follow through on an \nextensive political career, 32 years, is remarkable in and of itself.\n  So I thank Senator Kassebaum, Senator Hutchison, Senator Feinstein, \nand Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 45 years ago last Thursday, Senator Margaret \nChase Smith of Maine rose from her seat in this Chamber and delivered a \nspeech she called a ``Declaration of Conscience.''\n  Many historians believe this speech marked the beginning of the end \nof the era of McCarthyism. And it also marked the finest hour of the \nremarkable career of Senator Smith, who passed away last week at the \nage of 97.\n  I was privileged to serve alongside Senator Smith for 4 years in the \nSenate. She was as she has been described by many others. No nonsense. \nFiercely independent. And sometimes as thorny as the red rose she wore \nevery day.\n  During her 32 years of service in Washington, Senator Smith \naccomplished many firsts. She was the first woman to be elected to both \nHouses of Congress. She was the first woman elected to the Senate who \ndid not succeed her husband. She was the first woman to have her name \nplaced in nomination for President by a major political \nparty. [[Page S7718]] \n  As she made history, Senator Smith became a role model for many \nwomen. One of them was my wife, Elizabeth, who has told me of the time \nin 1960, when, as a young college graduate interning on Capitol Hill, \nshe called upon Senator Smith.\n  Not many Senators would share an hour with a total stranger seeking \nadvice, but that is just what Senator Smith did. And she advised \nElizabeth to bolster her education with a law degree--advice she \neventually followed.\n  When President Bush presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to \nSenator Smith in 1989, he said that she ``looked beyond the politics of \nthe time to see the future of America, and she made us all better for \nit.''\n  President Bush was right. Both this Chamber and America are for the \nbetter because of Margaret Chase Smith. I know the Senate joins with me \nin sending our condolences to the people of Maine.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues today in \ncommemorating Margaret Chase Smith, the Republican Senator who made \nhistory as the first woman to win election to both Houses of Congress, \nand the first woman ever to be elected to the Senate.\n  It is a privilege to be a U.S. Senator. And I am grateful to Margaret \nChase Smith for paving the way for me, and the women before me, to \nserve in this great Chamber. And more importantly, I salute her for \nbeing an inspiration, setting an example by being tough yet \ncompassionate.\n  Senator Smith's accomplishments were great. Among them, a long list \nof firsts, including being the first woman to sit on the Naval Affairs \nCommittee and to have her name advanced for the Presidency at a \nnational convention. But it is here legislative record and her long \nhistory of independence--always voting her conscience, that has left a \nlast impression on me.\n  She was a political independent, voting with her party when she saw \nfit and standing alone when she felt strongly about an issue. Indeed, \nin her first major address to the Senate on June 1, 1950, the freshman \nSenator denounced Joseph McCarthy. She accused the Wisconsin Senator of \nreducing the Senate to a ``forum of hate and character assassination.'' \nIn 1954 she voted for his censure.\n  McCarthy exacted his political payback--expelling Senator Smith from \na key committee and, in her next election, leading a vicious campaign \nagainst her. Still, it was that speech that was the beginning of the \nend or his career and which cemented her place in history.\n  In 1970, during the Vietnam war, she addressed the Senate again in a \nspeech that was later expanded into a book called ``A Declaration of \nConscience.'' In that speech, the Maine Senator warned Americans that \n``excessiveness and overreactions on both sides is a clear and present \ndanger to American democracy.'' Senator Smith knew that if we did not \nelevate the level of political discourse beyond mean-spiritedness, that \nwe risked chipping away at the democratic process itself.\n  Her standing up for what she believed earned her the moniker ``the \nconscience of the Senate.'' But she stood her ground without resorting \nto personal invective or shrill tactics. It is this sort of reasoned \ndebate and moderation--the very principles that this Chamber has always \nstood for--that should continue to guide those of us who sit here \ntoday.\n  Margaret Chase Smith was born in Skowhegan, ME. Her father was the \ntown barber and her mother was a part-time waitress. She herself earned \nonly a high-school education. She taught grade school, was a telephone \noperator and the circulation manager for a weekly newspaper where she \nmet her husband, Clyde Harold Smith. When, in 1940, her husband died of \na heart attack, she successfully ran for his seat in the House of \nRepresentatives. She served four terms in the House. Later, in the \nSenate, she served on the Appropriations, Aeronautical and Space \ncommittees and was the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. She also was the chairwoman of the Conference of Republican \nSenators. Senator Smith served under six presidents--from Franklin \nRoosevelt to Richard Nixon.\n  Although she advanced considerably in what was considered a man's \nworld, Senator Smith did not consider herself a champion of women's \nrights. Yet she wrote legislation that paved the way for women to serve \nin the military and later voted for the equal rights amendment. By her \nexample, Senator Smith pioneered the way for many women, including \nmyself, to enter the political arena.\n  Late in her career, Senator Smith said: ``I have no family, no time-\nconsuming hobbies. I have only myself and my job as United States \nSenator.''\n  It is in her job as a U.S. Senator that Margaret Chase Smith \ndistinguished herself, and that she will always be remembered and \nhonored.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank my colleagues once again for their participation \nin this tribute to a remarkable woman who led a remarkable life, and \nall the causes she espoused in her political career would serve us well \ntoday. It certainly serves as an important reminder of the standards we \nshould establish as public servants, and hopefully that will carry \nthrough the years to come.\n  With that, Mr. President, I conclude this tribute to Senator Margaret \nChase Smith.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7713-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to make a brief statement so all my \ncolleagues understand the situation. We were supposed to start this \namendment at 9:45. I have been prepared since last night. I was here on \nthe floor at 9:30 this morning and have been here straight through, but \nI do feel it crucial that the chairman of the committee be here because \nhe and I are trying to work out this amendment.\n  I think it very important that he hears my arguments. It is a very \nstraightforward amendment that deals with extending the statute of \nlimitations to give our law enforcement people more of a chance to go \nafter and arrest and convict those who would violate some very serious \nlaws that are on our books.\n  I have brought this amendment to the Senate floor because of Oklahoma \nCity, and I feel it is so important that I have sent a message through \nthe Republican leadership that I will be ready [[Page S7719]] to go the \nmoment that Senator Hatch returns to the floor. He is in a hearing. One \nof the problems around here is that we have to be in so many places at \nonce.\n  But I do think it is the right thing for this bill, for the American \npeople that the chairman of the committee be here when I offer this \namendment. I do not think it should be contentious, but it may be \ncontentious, and I want to make sure we have a fair debate. That is the \nreason for the delay.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, I explained to the \nSenate that I was awaiting the arrival of the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Utah, who is at a hearing at this time. The \nreason I was waiting for him is because he expressed some concern with \nmy amendment and at the same time he expressed an interest in working \nthe amendment out. Therefore, I thought it would save some time if he \nwere present when I went through these arguments. But he has sent a \nmessage through the leadership that he would prefer if I lay this \namendment down. So with the indulgence of the Senate, I will send the \namendment to the desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1214 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To increase the periods of limitation for violations of the \n                         National Firearms Act)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1214 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 17, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 108. INCREASED PERIODS OF LIMITATION FOR NATIONAL \n                   FIREARMS ACT VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Section 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (8) as \n     subparagraphs (A) through (H), respectively; and\n       (2) by amending the matter immediately preceding \n     subparagraph (A), as redesignated, to read as follows: ``No \n     person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any \n     criminal offense under the internal revenue laws unless the \n     indictment is found or the information instituted not later \n     than 3 years after the commission of the offense, except that \n     the period of limitation shall be--\n       ``(1) 5 years for offenses described in section 5861 \n     (relating to firearms and other devices); and\n       ``(2) 6 years--.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what I plan to do is make the case for my \namendment. I believe it is one that should receive the unanimous \nagreement of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans alike. I hope \nthat it will, and if there is still a problem when the chairman of the \nfull committee arrives, I will indulge the Senate once again to repeat \nfor him the reasons why I think this amendment is compelling.\n  Mr. President, this amendment comes as a direct result of the \nOklahoma experience. That is why my amendment is supported by the chief \nof police of Oklahoma City and 44 other chiefs of police around the \nNation.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk would extend the statute of \nlimitations for violations of the National Firearms Act from 3 years to \n5 years. In other words, it would add 2 years that law enforcement has \nto complete its case and put the villains away.\n  This change would equalize the period of limitations for the National \nFirearms Act with the vast majority of other Federal laws. I think that \nis the most important point I can make. This is really a conforming \namendment. If you look at all the gun laws in the criminal law, they \nhave a 5-year statute. This is an anomaly. We have a 3-year statute \nhere.\n  So the amendment is fair. It would give prosecutors a badly needed \ntool. What is this tool? It is more time. It is more time to build \ntheir case against violent criminals and terrorists. I want to make a \npoint here. We are not talking about a little game of cops and robbers. \nWe are talking about terrorists and violent criminals who make bombs, \nwho make sawed-off shotguns, who make silencers. That is what the \nNational Firearms Act addresses, and that is why we need this 5-year \nstatute of limitations.\n  I want to point out that this provision has been requested by the \nJustice Department. It was included in the administration's bill, and \nalthough the pending bill incorporates many of the administration's \nantiterrorism provisions, for whatever reason, this section was dropped \nout of the new bill. I think it is important to put it back in.\n  Again, I want to make it clear that this amendment is directly \nrelated to preventing terrorism generally and to the Oklahoma City case \nin particular.\n  It is likely that when the investigation into the Oklahoma City \nbombing is completed, the suspects will be charged with illegally \nmanufacturing a bomb. That crime is a violation of the National \nFirearms Act, and only the National Firearms Act.\n  We need to give law enforcement more time. There may be one person \ninvolved in the Oklahoma City tragedy, or there may be two. There may \nbe 10 or 100. It is complicated to put the case together. We need to \ngive law enforcement time.\n  The National Firearms Act, the act I am amending, governs some of the \nmost important firearms offenses on the books. The NFA makes it a crime \nto make a fully automatic machine gun. That is a crime. It makes it a \ncrime to possess a sawed-off shotgun, or to make a homemade silencer.\n  Now, surely those offenses are serious and complex enough to merit a \n5-year statute. In addition, it covers the making of a destructive \ndevice, or a bomb. So we have the fully automatic machine gun, a sawed-\noff shotgun, a homemade silencer, and an incendiary device, or a bomb.\n  Surely, law enforcement should have 5 years to complete their case, \njust as they do for all other gun laws.\n  The NFA, the National Firearms Act which I am amending, is the act \nwhich deals with homemade fertilizer bombs, Molotov cocktails. It is \nthe only statute that deals with them. It has a 3-year statute of \nlimitations instead of the 5-year. That means that any charges brought \nfor violations of the NFA must be filed within 3 years of the crime.\n  To show how important this difference is, I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this: If a terrorist builds a bomb in 1995, but Federal \nprosecutors are unable to gather enough evidence until 1999, they \ncannot file those charges. The statute of limitations begins running \nfrom the time the bomb is made. I think this is important. For the \ncrime of illegal making a bomb, the statutes of limitations runs from \nthe time the bomb is made--not the date the bomb was used.\n  Theoretically, we could have a terrorist group make a bomb, store it \nfor 2 or 3 years, use it, but by then the statute would have expired. \nSo we could not get the perpetrators. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. It is not just a technical change. It is a very substantive \nchange. It needs to be included in this bill.\n  These investigations are complicated. Yesterday, we were all moved to \nsee the families from Oklahoma City asking Members to make this bill \nthe law of the land in the name of the people who died. I want to see \nthat happen. I want to see that happen. I also want to make sure that \nthe people who perpetrated the crime are caught--each and every one of \nthem.\n  This investigation may lead in 3,000 different directions. We have \nheard there are thousands of leads. We should get every last individual \nwho participated in this vicious crime.\n  Mr. President, this is not an academic debate about periods of \nlimitation. This change is badly needed. It has been requested by those \nwho investigate and prosecute criminals.\n  I have put on Senators' desks the names of 45 police chiefs who urge \nsupport for the Boxer amendment. These police chiefs are from all over \nthe country, from Oklahoma City to the [[Page S7720]] east coast, the \nWest, the South, the North. They are unanimous in this. They need this \ntime. They need this tool.\n  It could take years to unravel complex criminal conspiracies. Law \nenforcement should not be faced with an unwise artificial deadline to \nfile charges. I want to say again, this is not an academic debate. I \nhave been told by Federal investigators that the 3-year statute of \nlimitations for the National Firearms Act has stopped actual criminal \ninvestigations. Indictments that would have been issued in actual \nexplosive cases were not issued because of the NFA's short statute of \nlimitations. Criminals could go free because the statute of limitations \nis only 3 instead of the usual 5.\n  The short statute of limitations is truly an anomaly in Federal law. \nFor example, possessing or manufacturing an assault weapon in violation \nof the ban passed last year has a 5-year statute of limitations, not a \n3-year statute of limitations. Manufacturing cop killer bullets has a \n5-year statute of limitations, not a 3-year statute. Manufacturing an \nundetectable firearm has a 5-year statute of limitations. However, in \nthe National Firearms Act, unless we pass the Boxer amendment, we have \na 3-year statute of limitations for crimes like making bombs, \nsilencers, sawed-off shotguns.\n  No one can explain to me why it makes sense to have a 5-year statute \non carrying an assault weapon or manufacturing an assault weapon and \nonly a 3-year statute for a sawed-off shotgun or a bomb. It makes no \nsense. There is no reason for it.\n  The Boxer amendment addresses the problem simply. I hope and hope \nthat we can all reach agreement on this and not have to argue about it. \nIt is common sense to match the statutes of limitations for the vast \nmajority of Federal criminal laws. We need a level playing field so \nFederal law enforcement can prosecute violent criminals more \neffectively.\n  Again, I want to stress that this change was requested by the Justice \nDepartment and the Treasury Department, and the administration supports \nthis. This is a bill where we see bipartisan support. We have Senator \nDole, Senator Daschle, and the President of the United States speaking \nin one voice that we must pass this bill.\n  Now, this is one bipartisan amendment we should be able to pass. We \nhave Federal prosecutors supporting this change. Local police chiefs \nwho want to keep guns and bombs out of the hands of violent criminal--\n45 of them in the time we could organize.\n  These law enforcement officers know that extending the statute of \nlimitations for National Firearms Act offenses will make it easier to \nput violent criminals behind bars.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter signed by the 45 police chiefs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: In the wake of the Oklahoma City \n     bombing and the recent shootings of police officers around \n     the country, we, as police chiefs who are sworn to protect \n     the public and our officers, strongly urge your support for \n     the following four amendments to the upcoming anti-terrorism \n     bill:\n       Cop-killer bullets.--This amendment, to be offered by \n     Senator Bradley, will prohibit ``cop-killer'' bullets based \n     on a performance standard rather than the physical \n     composition of the bullet, as current law requires.\n       Multiple handgun sale forms.--This amendment, to be offered \n     by Senator Kennedy, will allow local law enforcement to keep \n     a record of multiple handgun sales rather than destroy the \n     forms, as current law requires.\n       Guns for felons.--This amendment, to be offered by Senators \n     Lautenberg and Simon, will permanently close the current \n     loophole that allows some violent felons to regain their \n     right to possess firearms.\n       National firearms act.--This amendment, to be offered by \n     Senator Boxer, will increase the statute of limitations for \n     violations of the National Firearms Act from three to five \n     years.\n       These amendments are designed to close current loopholes in \n     federal law. They will provide law enforcement with \n     additional tools to apprehend violent offenders, vigorously \n     prosecute them and combat crime on our streets.\n       We strongly urge you to demonstrate your unwavering \n     commitment to the protection of law enforcement and the \n     safety of all Americans by supporting these public safety \n     measures.\n           Sincerely,\n       Chief Jerry Sanders, San Diego, CA.\n       Colonel Clarence Harmon, St. Louis, MO.\n       Chief Louis Cobarruviaz, San Jose, CA.\n       Chief Anthony D.

Mr. President, this amendment should be adopted. It is \nfair. It levels the playing field for firearms crimes. It is needed. It \nis not this Senator who says it is needed; it is the people who do the \nwork, the difficult law enforcement work, tracking down these leads, \nthese thousands of leads, have asked for this additional tool, these \nadditional 2 years.\n  Mr. President, Congress talks a lot about getting tough on crime. \nThere is not one of us I have not heard make a speech about, ``Let's \ncrack down.'' There is a difference between talking about getting tough \non crime and being tough on crime by giving law enforcement the tools \nthat they need. This does not cost us any money. They are not asking \nfor more equipment. They are not asking for bigger office space or \nanother computer system. They are asking for time to track down these \nleads.\n  We are in a new phase now, unfortunately, in our country. Who ever \ndreamed that we would have people within America who would build a \ndevice, a bomb, and kill innocent people and innocent children; turn on \nthe Government of, by, and for the people, and somehow twist it around \nas if it was not America?\n  It is complicated and it is new and it is different and it is \nfrightening, and law enforcement needs this additional time.\n  I have no other comments at this time. I have not organized a team of \nspeakers because, frankly, I think this amendment is eloquent in its \nsimplicity and very clear in its common sense. I hope we will have \nbipartisan support for the Boxer amendment, and at this time I yield \nthe floor and reserve my right to regain the floor when the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee makes it here to the floor. I understand he is \ntied up in a committee. We expect him here I think at the top of the \nhour, and I look forward to debating with him on this amendment if in \nfact he feels it is not appropriate.\n  But I hope against hope that he will in fact embrace this amendment \nand we can once again show the Nation we are united across party lines \nin our desire to go after those terrorists and give law enforcement the \ntools they need to make sure justice reigns in this great Nation of \nours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  [[Page S7721]]\n  \n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Fighting Crime Through Technology\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we proceed on this antiterrorism bill, \nI would like to discuss for a moment one provision of the bill which I \nbelieve is very noncontroversial but I think is very significant, and \nthat is the provision of the bill that concerns the increased help, the \nincreased assistance that we are going to give to local law enforcement \nin regard to giving them the tools they need to fight back, and that is \nthe area of technology. This is one of the essential tools as we fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  The bill we are discussing today strengthens the ability of local law \nenforcement officers to use high technology to combat terrorism and, \nfrankly, to combat all sorts of crime. It provides for the expenditure \nof $500 million over the next 3 years to develop and upgrade some very \nimportant information systems. These systems provide ready access to \ncriminal histories, fingerprints, DNA, and ballistic information.\n  The terrorism bill will also help local law enforcement agencies \nconnect into these data bases. A data base in Washington, DC, will not \ndo much good if the local communities, the tens of thousands of local \nlaw enforcement agencies that are spread throughout this country, \ncannot access that information. Let us make no mistake about it, this \nis a very important component of this legislation, just as it has \nalways been a very important component of our fight against crime.\n  Last Saturday's Washington Post provided a case in point. It contains \na detailed description of how the Oklahoma City bombing suspects were \ntracked down. Every step of the way, the suspects left a physical trail \nof evidence that could be fed into the FBI's computer database. The \nFBI, according to this story, has set up a very sophisticated computer \nsystem to put all kinds of information in, some relevant and some not \nrelevant--you never know until it is put in. You try to make the match \nand pull it back up and use it. But according to this story, there are \nnow at least 38 million bytes of information just in this database on \njust this one crime alone, the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  There were 12,800 pieces of evidence collected in Oklahoma City, \nalmost 13,000 pieces of evidence. The FBI computers are being used to \nanalyze all this evidence. I have already told my colleagues the story \nof how the apprehension of the key Oklahoma suspect came about. It is \ntruly a compelling story. An Oklahoma City detective found a piece of \ntattered metal at the crime scene. On this piece of metal, he found a \nvehicle identification number, or a VIN number--one little piece of \nevidence. He fed this VIN number into the National Insurance Crime \nBureau. In a matter of seconds, the bombing truck was identified.\n  Meanwhile, an Oklahoma State trooper had pulled over the fleeing \nsuspect for driving without a license plate. The trooper had no idea at \nthat time the person he pulled over was a suspect in a major crime, but \nhe called the National Crime Information Center to ask for some data on \nthe suspicious motorist, and when he tapped into the system, that left \na fingerprint into the system. In a moment, we will see the importance \nof that.\n  Later on, the FBI, based on the information they had obtained from \nthat VIN number--we will jump forward now, a lot of work, a lot of \ntracking--they were able to get the name of Timothy McVeigh.\n  Later, when the FBI fed the name Timothy McVeigh into their \ncomputers, the computer informed them, because of this fingerprint that \nhad been placed into the system, of his arrest on these unrelated \ncharges. Thanks to this technological edge, the FBI was able to find \nout an obscure arrestee was in fact America's most wanted criminal \nsuspect.\n  The McVeigh arrest demonstrates how our technological edge can work \nand how in fact it can help solve crime, how in fact it can and does \nsave lives.\n  Another story which was in last Friday's paper shows again the \nimportance of technology. On May 28, a North Carolina State trooper \narrested a motorist for speeding. Using established procedure, the \ntrooper ran the motorist's name in the North Carolina State computer \ndatabank. The trooper did not run the motorist's name in the national \ndatabase. That was apparently the procedure in the State at that time--\njust to run it in the State database, but not the national base. The \nmotorist's name did not show up in the State databank. If the trooper \nhad run the motorist's name in the national databank, he would have \ndiscovered the driver was wanted for the shooting of two Washington, \nDC, police officers and the attempted murder of his girlfriend. Eleven \nhours after he was arrested for speeding in North Carolina and \nreleased, the suspect killed an FBI agent in a shootout in the \nWashington, DC, metropolitan area.\n  My purpose in telling the story is not to put blame on anyone, not to \nbe judgmental, but again to point out how very, very important it is \nthat these databases be used and how they can in fact not only solve \ncrime but how they can save lives.\n  Mr. President, as a result of this incident, North Carolina has \ntaken, to use the phrase, the ``worthy step'' of encouraging its \ntroopers to run the names of all out-of-State suspects in the national \ncomputer. You never know. It certainly does not hurt to ask.\n  Last month I introduced a comprehensive crime bill, and one of the \nkey elements of my proposed legislation was a renewed focus on \ncrimefighting technology on making sure that the local crimefighters \nare in fact plugged into a truly all-inspiring national database. \nTechnology is already a proven tool in the fight against terrorism. One \nof the suspects in the World Trade Center bombing was tracked down--\nlisten to this--because he left a DNA sample in the saliva he left when \nhe sealed an envelope containing a letter to the New York Times. In \nthat letter he claimed responsibility on behalf of his terrorist group. \nBut unknown to him, he left indelible proof of his own identity in the \nDNA. Mr. President, we have the tools to win this fight. Let us use \nthem.\n  I want to thank Senator Dole and Senator Hatch, two individuals who \nhave worked on this bill, for the job that they have done, and for \nincluding my provision that I wrote and put in the crime bill--taking \nthat section and putting it in this antiterrorism bill because it has a \nlot to do with solving the problem of terrorism in this country and has \na lot to do with this technology in solving all crimes.\n  It would be a crime--if I could use the term--if we did not make sure \nthat every law enforcement agency in this country was able to tap into \nthis national database. It would be wrong if for a relatively small \namount of money we did not make sure that not only did we tap into the \ninformation and pull it back out but that we could get information from \nevery law enforcement agency in the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two articles which I \njust referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 3, 1995]\n\n               How Detectives Cracked Oklahoma Bomb Case\n\n                           (By Pierre Thomas)\n\n       Oklahoma City.--Three weeks ago, a 40-foot-long tractor-\n     trailer secretly left here loaded with cargo that holds clues \n     to the deadliest terrorist bombing in U.S. history.\n       Riding shotgun on the truck were armed federal agents \n     guarding more than 7,000 pounds of evidence. The truck \n     carried parts of a rental truck used to store the massive \n     bomb that blasted the federal building here April 19 and a \n     yellow Mercury Marquis, the car of prime suspect Timothy \n     James McVeigh. Final destination of the truck was a \n     laboratory at 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW in \n     Washington, the FBI's headquarters.\n       In coming days, forensics experts plan to reconstruct as \n     much of the truck as possible and dust every part of \n     McVeigh's car for fingerprints, using lasers and the latest \n     in latent fingerprint technology. They also will swab and \n     vacuum the car to capture tiny particles and chemically \n     analyze every bit of soil, hair, fiber and residue in an \n     effort to [[Page S7722]] link McVeigh and others to the \n     bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.\n       While the overall probe has been conducted in the glare of \n     publicity, much of the crucial investigative work has \n     involved behind-the-scenes forensics technology and use of \n     computers to a degree never before seen in a criminal \n     inquiry. In much the same way authorities are\n      trying to use DNA analysis in the O.J. Simpson murder trial. \n     FBI officials want to be able to provide a jury with reams \n     of precise and detailed evidence tying suspects to the \n     case. ``This case is juxtaposition of 21st century \n     technology and tried police work,'' a senior enforcement \n     official said.\n       The chase for clues began two hours after the bombing. \n     Oklahoma City detective Mike McPherson, surveying what looked \n     like a war scene, noticed a piece of tattered metal that at \n     first glance appeared to be just another mangled reminder of \n     the explosion that left 168 dead. Looking closer, he could \n     see the metal was an axle, charred and twisted at both ends, \n     suggesting it might have been at the explosion's epicenter. \n     Methodically cleaning it, he found a partial vehicle \n     identification number (VIN). Law enforcement had its first \n     big break in the case and immediately turned to computers for \n     help.\n       McPherson called the identification number to the National \n     Insurance Crime Bureau, which keeps a database that stores \n     300 million automobile VINs and other records. In seconds, \n     the computer determined the axle came from a 1993 Ford truck \n     eventually sold to Ryder Rentals of Miami. At the FBI's \n     request, Ryder found the truck had been sent to Elliott's \n     Body Shop in Junction City, Kan.\n       The night of the bombing, agents from the FBI's Salinas, \n     Kan., office contacted Elliott's and, by morning, had \n     descriptions of two suspects, John Doe No. 1 and John Doe No. \n     2. Composite drawings were developed, using computers to make \n     them appear more lifelike. The FBI also took all the \n     documents John Doe No. 1 signed to look for fingerprints that \n     might match McVeigh's.\n       ``It hit me later that the VIN number was a special number, \n     that this was a very big deal,'' McPherson said, noting the \n     computers had saved time, doing in seconds work that earlier \n     might have taken hours.\n       ``From that rental shop, we started to expand the \n     investigation out in concentric circles,'' one senior law \n     enforcement official said. ``We planned to go to every \n     restaurant, gas station, hotel between there and Oklahoma \n     City.''\n       More than 1,000 FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms agents were flown in from around the country, \n     including heads of the FBI's Phoenix, Dallas, Houston and New \n     Orleans field offices. At sites near the blast, agents \n     requested store video surveillance tapes and used computers \n     to enhance the images, hoping McVeigh or others with him \n     could have stopped at a convenience store in days preceding \n     the bombing.\n       On Thursday, April 20, FBI agents reached the Dreamland \n     Hotel in Junction City. The manager recognized the composite \n     of John Doe No. 1, a young cleanshaven man with a military \n     crewcut. The man, hotel officials said, had stayed in Room 25 \n     and had been driving a large Ryder truck. He also had \n     registered as Timothy McVeigh.\n       Around that time, a former co-worker of McVeigh's saw the \n     composite sketch on television and called the FBI, telling \n     agents McVeigh expressed anger at the federal government and \n     agitation over the federal-Branch Davidian standoff near \n     Waco, Tex., court records said.\n       A day earlier, about 90 minutes after the bombing, Oklahoma \n     state trooper Charles D. Hangar had seen a yellow Mercury \n     Marquis without a license plate driving up Interstate 35 near \n     Perry. The driver was McVeigh, who also was carrying a \n     concealed semiautomatic pistol.\n       Curious, Hangar later queried the FBI's National Crime \n     Information Center (NCIC), a national law enforcement \n     database that includes details on outstanding warrants and \n     fugitives. Hangar had no idea he had just arrested the \n     bombing's prime\n      suspect, but his data request left a fingerprint in the \n     system.\n       At 7 a.m. Friday, April 21, NCIC officials plugged \n     McVeigh's name into the database and saw information flash on \n     their computer terminals. It showed he had been arrested and \n     offered the name of the arresting law enforcement agency. \n     What they did not know was where and if McVeigh was still \n     being held.\n       Two agents--one FBI, the other ATF--were assigned to track \n     down McVeigh and began calling jails near the location of his \n     arrest. They learned McVeigh was being held at the Noble \n     County Jail and soon would be released.\n       McVeigh then became the investigation's focal point. Even \n     before bringing McVeigh into custody, agents began to dissect \n     his life history and associates. The plan was simple: find \n     out who McVeigh spent time with, and other suspects would pop \n     up, hopefully even John Doe No. 2, who had not been found. \n     The plan seemed simple but its execution was complex since \n     McVeigh, after serving in the Army, had drifted from Michigan \n     to Arizona.\n       Agents obtained a Michigan driver's license from McVeigh, \n     and a computer check of the state's motor vehicle records \n     listed a Decker, Mich., address. Authorities learned two \n     brothers, James and Terry Lynn Nichols, at some time had \n     resided there. McVeigh had been stationed in Fort Riley, \n     Kan.; had recently lived in Kingman, Ariz.; and had family in \n     Pendleton, N.Y. Terry Nichols, the second suspect arrested in \n     the case, lived in Herington, Kan.\n       As the investigation broadened, command posts were set up \n     in any area offering promising leads--Kingman, Chicago, Los \n     Angeles and Kansas. A national hotline was established to \n     take tips, and tens of thousands of calls came in. ``We were \n     chasing everything that made sense, credit records, telephone \n     records,''\n      one senior law enforcement source said.\n       A Justice Department team flew in computer terminals to \n     link into the department's Eagle system, which allows federal \n     prosecutors around the nation to communicate electronically. \n     At the same site, a Southwestern Bell Co. warehouse downtown \n     here, the FBI installed 20 to 30 computer terminals and flew \n     in a team to set up Rapid Start, a three-year-old automated \n     case filing system used in investigating the World Trade \n     Center bombing.\n       As leads came in, they were typed onto a standardized form \n     and then encoded into Rapid Start. There are now at least 38 \n     million bytes of information on the Oklahoma bombing stored \n     in the database.\n       The FBI has subpoenaed records from telephone companies \n     around the country, which establish more than 66,000 calls \n     made by McVeigh, Nichols and other associates. Those calls \n     were punched into the database, allowing investigators to \n     sort for patterns.\n       The 12,800 pieces of evidence collected in Oklahoma City, \n     including some of the rubble and shrapnel taken from the many \n     victims, now are being analyzed. Much of the work is tedious \n     as experts will try to match the chemical composition of \n     explosive residue found at the scene to that allegedly found \n     on McVeigh's clothes and in his vehicle. Similar work is \n     being done on items recovered from Terry Nichols's home.\n       But the technology has not eliminated the need for a \n     critical component in most investigations--simple luck. If \n     detective McPherson had not stumbled upon the axle quickly, \n     it could have taken months to track down McVeigh, one law \n     enforcement official noted. Computers or nothing else would \n     have mattered, he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 2, 1995]\n\n          N. C. Officer Arrested Agent's Killer Hours Earlier\n\n                    (By Brian Mooar and Bill Miller)\n\n       A North Carolina state trooper arrested Ralph McLean for \n     speeding 11 hours before the Landover man fatally shot an FBI \n     agent in Greenbelt, but the trooper failed to check his name \n     against a national database of wanted criminals, officials \n     said yesterday.\n       A check of the FBI's National Crime Information Center \n     computer would have turned up an outstanding warrant for \n     McLean, who was wanted in the shootings of two D.C. police \n     officers and in the attempted murder of his girlfriend, \n     authorities said.\n       Washington area law enforcement officials privately \n     expressed frustration over the missed opportunity to catch \n     McLean before he killed FBI agent William H. Christian Jr. \n     and then shot himself to death in a wild gun battle early \n     Monday. North Carolina state police said the trooper followed \n     the department's policy discouraging federal checks on \n     stopped motorists who do not behave in a suspicious manner.\n       But after considering what happened with McLean, North \n     Carolina on Wednesday adopted a new policy to run checks on \n     out-of-state motorists pulled over by troopers.\n       Trooper J. Harold Lee stopped McLean about 2 p.m. Sunday \n     after clocking the man's blue 1992 Oldsmobile at 82 mph in a \n     65- mph zone on northbound Interstate 95 in Johnston County \n     near the hamlet of Smithfield. McLean, who has been described \n     as having a pathological hatred toward law enforcement \n     officers, sat next to Lee in his cruiser and made small talk \n     while the 21-year veteran trooper wrote his speeding \n     citation.\n       ``He was polite [and] cooperative,'' Lee said. ``No \n     indication of anything being out of the ordinary. He was in a \n     little bit of a hurry. That's all that was indicated * * * . \n     He just wanted to know how long it would take.''\n       But as McLean followed Lee to the local magistrate's \n     office, where McLean posted a $200 bond for the speeding \n     violation, the trooper saw him make a call on a cellular \n     telephone and became suspicious.\n       Although the North Carolina Highway Patrol's procedures did \n     not require a name check on McLean, Lee ran McLean's driver's \n     license number through a state computer system and found \n     nothing. If he had entered McLean's name in the FBI computer, \n     officials said yesterday, he would have learned of a warrant \n     charging McLean with assault with intent to kill a D.C. \n     police officer in January.\n       ``There's nothing I could have done any different,'' Lee \n     said. ``It was a routine stop that we make daily on the \n     interstate, and there's no other way to do it.''\n       Capt. Raymond W. Isley, commander of the North Carolina \n     Highway Patrol's interstate division, said the department has \n     ordered national checks on all out-of-state motorists pulled \n     over by its troopers.\n       ``We reviewed this case because . . . it's a tragedy,'' \n     Isley said. Isley said his department has not routinely \n     conducted federal checks because they tie up dispatchers, and \n     ``we don't want to get implicated with unduly delaying \n     people. We generally don't do it unless there is a need to do \n     it. Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of the people are not \n     criminals. . . . [[Page S7723]] \n       ``If we get suspicious of you, we do [checks],' 'Isley \n     said. ``But in this case, the man was very polite, very \n     cordial. This was a seasoned officer, and he was looking for \n     something out of the ordinary. But [McLean] controlled \n     himself very well in his presence.''\n       Hours later, about 1 a.m. Monday, McLean crept up to an \n     unmarked cruiser in the parking lot of Greenbelt Middle \n     School and fatally shot Christian, one of 27 investigators \n     waiting to surprise him. McLean was hit by seven bullets and \n     then took his own life, the Maryland state medical examiner's \n     office said.\n       McLean was carrying the semiautomatic assault pistol used \n     to kill Prince George's County police Cpl. John J. Novabilski \n     in an April 26 shooting, and he died of a bullet from \n     Novabilski's stolen Beretta 9mm service pistol.\n       The National Crime Information Center is an FBI office that \n     maintains a database for state and local law enforcement \n     agencies that receives 1.3 million inquiries a day, the FBI \n     said. The computer tracks nearly 400,000 people wanted for \n     crimes, as well as data concerning crime-related categories. \n     Authorities can learn whether a person has significant \n     outstanding warrants or a criminal history.\n       McLean's name was listed on the computer Saturday when D.C. \n     police obtained a warrant for his arrest in the shooting of \n     city police Sgt. Eric L. Hayes.\n       Law enforcement specialists said the service was designed \n     to protect not only the public but also the nation's police \n     officers by alerting them to dangerous suspects.\n       Policies on routine federal checks vary among Washington \n     area departments. Virginia State Police do not require checks \n     on traffic violators. Maryland state troopers are urged to \n     check the driver and the car through the federal system.\n       ``We check for any warrants or wanted [alerts] for the \n     people or the vehicle,'' said Mike McKelvin, a Maryland State \n     Police spokesman.\n       Lee, who retires in 11 days, said the traffic stop was \n     indistinguishable from tens of thousands he had made until \n     Monday afternoon, when a Maryland homicide detective called \n     him after finding the speeding citation among McLean's \n     belongings.\n       Lee said he is convinced that he did everything right \n     during his 45-minute encounter with McLean--and that he was \n     lucky things didn't turn out differently after McLean opened \n     the trunk of his car and rooted through luggage to find his \n     driver's license.\n       ``I was just very fortunate the stop ended like it did for \n     myself,'' Lee said. ``Maybe the Lord was looking after me.''\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Ohio that I \napplaud his efforts. As he knows, in the crime bill that we passed we \nprovided $100 million for just these purposes. As a matter of fact, it \nhas been over a decade ago that I initiated an effort in the first \ncrime bill introduced to get the NCIC up to speed to actually make it \nwork. We received some considerable resistance then interestingly \nenough from the very left and the very right, the right because, as the \nPresiding Officer notes, the right is always concerned about anyone \nwhen anything has to do with Government having power, and the left \nbecause they are concerned about the Government having power. So it was \nstalled for a while in the so-called Biden crime bill which passed out \nof here.\n  I wanted that number to be higher out of the trust fund. The most we \ncould get any agreement on was $100 million. I do not quibble with the \nnotion that we could effectively spend more money.\n  The Senator may recall, because he was in the House at the time, that \nthe local authorities thought they could get by with the $100 million \nas long as the FBI was essentially going to be the purchasing agent for \nthem. What we do not want to have happen is a little police department \nin central Ohio or southern Delaware--they may be the very people who \npick up the McVeigh's of the world--and we do not want them to be in \nthe position where in order for them to purchase this equipment and \nsome of the more automated fingerprinting capability, the \nNCIC, the blood and saliva DNA capability, we do not want them to be \nout there since they are purchasing a very small quantity of whatever \nit is that is being purchased having to pay considerably more than the \npolice department in Columbus, or New York, or Wilmington, DE, or \nPhiladelphia has to pay. But as it turns out they have concluded that \nthey need more help.\n  Again, I look forward to working with my friend from Ohio on this \nissue as the continuation of an effort that he supported when he was in \nthe House as well. He is not new to this. He knows this area as well as \nanyone does.\n  One of the things at some point--I will not take the time now because \nthe distinguished Senator from California who has been waiting since \n9:30 to go with her amendment is ready to go now that the chairman of \nthe committee is here. We will have a long day today. Maybe the Senator \nand I, as we say, can repair to the cloakroom. I would like to talk \nabout his formula which he has built in here which is the distribution \nbased strictly on population which seems at odds with the notion that \nwe acknowledge that these little police departments, and smaller areas \nin population, also in a strange way need the help more than even the \nlarge police departments.\n  So I acknowledge at the front end the parochial interest in that \nDelaware is a small State and under the formula would be in a \ndisadvantageous position for this additional funding. I do not expect \nthe Senator to change his formula. I would like to make my case to him \nsince this is esoteric.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will yield for a moment, let me \ncongratulate the Senator from Delaware because he really has been a \nleader in this area. I had the opportunity about 2 months ago to go to \nthe FBI and look to see exactly where all of these systems were. It is \namazing the progress that they have made. In the last several crime \nbills there has been systems in there, and I know particularly that the \nSenator from Delaware has been a prime leader in this area. Frankly, \nwhat the FBI tells me is that they are moving along very, very well. \nThe background for my writing this section was frankly what the FBI \ntold me, and also what local law enforcement told me. That was, look, I \nsay we are moving along very, very well, quite frankly thanks to what \nthe Congress has done. A significant amount of money Congress has put \nin.\n  But they said, ``Senator, let us tell you the one concern we have; \nthat is, our database is only as good as the information we get. Our \nconcern is that some of these small departments--which the Senator from \nDelaware is referring to--will not have the resources. They will not \nhave the ability to tap in.''\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware in regard \nto the formula. Our idea, frankly, is to make sure that every police \nofficer in the country--some way, either through his or her own \ndepartment or through a consortium or through the departments going \ntogether--has the ability to put that information into the computer and \nto get it back out. Frankly, my only interest is making it work. So, if \nwe can come up with a formula that works better to do that, I am more \nthan happy to work with the Senator to do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, that is why I rose to speak to this to \ndivert slightly from the amendment process. I am not being so \nsolicitous. I know of the Senator's interest, knowledge, and genuine \nconcern about this. One thing that he did not mention that he has in \nthe past, but I think it is worth noting here, is this information also \nhas the ancillary benefit of saving police officers' lives. The \nPresiding Officer knows that in his State of Pennsylvania he has had a \nrough year already with loss of police officers' lives. It has not been \na good year. The start has not been a good one.\n  It is very, very, very practical information when that trooper pulls \nup behind an automobile. If he has the system and equipment in his \nautomobile and the database is real, he literally can, before he gets \nout of the car, punch in and find out if that automobile is not only \nstolen but where and when and how.\n  He also has the capability, if we give him the capability and if the \nStates step up to the ball, of using this portable, automatic \nfingerprinting operation where they can literally have a driver come up \ninto their automobile--what the average citizen would think is a \nportable fingerprinting machine--to actually have that person get out \nof the car, walk up, stick their thumb or forefinger in this machine in \nthe automobile, and instantly get a readout as to whether or not the \nlicense that they are carrying comports with their identity. \n[[Page S7724]] \n  This not only makes a lot of sense in terms of tracking and using it \nas a device to solve crimes, but it also has the immediate benefit of \nliterally saving lives of police officers. As a former prosecutor, the \nSenator from Ohio knows this. In my discussion with police--and, as you \nknow, the head of the FOP and a number of leading members of the FOP \nare from the home State of the Senator from Ohio--they know of his work \nand his interest in this area.\n  So I compliment him on his initiative and thank him for his \nwillingness to speak with me about the formula. With that, unless the \nSenator from Ohio wishes to say anything else, I see the distinguished \nSenator from California is on her feet and is ready to go with her \namendment, I think, or is she?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am absolutely ready to go with the amendment. My \nfriend, the good Senator from Ohio, has been with me here since 9:30 \nthis morning. I was ready to go at that time. I did lay down my \namendment. As my friend from Delaware knows, there is some concern on \nthe other side, although I think it is not all that widely based, that \nwe should narrow the scope of my amendment. It is not my intention to \ndo that.\n  I am ready to vote on my amendment right now. I say to my friend from \nDelaware, I would greatly appreciate his views on my amendment because \nI have expressed mine. If I can have some time at this point, I can \nsummarize in 5 minutes and then I would love to have my friend from \nDelaware react to the amendment and perhaps express his view as to \nwhether it is a commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, I \nam anxious to do that. I sincerely hope she does not amend her \namendment. I will, in time, at an appropriate time, explain why I hope \nthat is not the case. I am of the view that if Senators listen to this \ndebate or this discussion, I think it is very, very difficult to make a \ncase why the exception being sought should be granted. I will yield the \nfloor back to the Senator, have her make her case, and I am prepared \nand anxious to speak to her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. About one-half hour \nago, I laid down my amendment which would really, I think, add a lot of \ncommon sense to our gun laws, because we seem to have two sets of \nstatutes of limitations.\n  Generally, gun laws and criminal laws have a 5-year statute of \nlimitations, except for the National Firearms Act, which has a 3-year \nstatute, which means that the police have to complete their work on \nsometimes very complicated cases, in 3 years.\n  Now, what are these cases? And this is where I think Senators ought \nto listen. There are only three cases: The making of a bomb, such as \nthe bomb that was made in Oklahoma City, is only covered in the \nNational Firearms Act. So we have to go after these terrorists. This is \nthe place. Law enforcement is asking us for 5 years, not the 3 that \nthey have. That is one case.\n  The other case is the making of a sawed-off shotgun. The only place \nwhere that crime is covered is in this law, and we think there ought to \nbe a 5-year statute.\n  And the third, the making of a silencer, is covered in this \nparticular statute, which I would like to amend to 5 years.\n  So what we are suggesting is that those three areas--silencers, \nsawed-off shotguns, and bombs--ought to be covered by the same statute \nof limitations as exists in, for example, the assault weapon ban, cop-\nkiller bullets, and all criminal laws, which basically have a 5-year \nstatute.\n  I see that the distinguished majority leader is on the floor. I was \nhopeful that maybe that indicated we could move this along by simply \naccepting it because it is, in fact, an amendment that really comes to \nthis floor via law enforcement.\n  On Senators' desks I have the names of 45 police chiefs who urge \nsupport for the Boxer amendment. These police chiefs are from \nCalifornia; Oregon; Washington State; Florida; New Jersey; Arizona; \nPennsylvania; Roanoke, VA; Connecticut; Indiana; Illinois; New York; \nMassachusetts; Maryland; Arkansas; Kentucky; South Carolina; Georgia; \nMissouri; Alabama, and I do not know whether I mentioned Oklahoma City. \nThe Oklahoma City chief of police wants us to adopt the Boxer \namendment.\n  Just now, I was handed a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police. \nThe Fraternal Order of Police, Dewey Stokes, has sent us a letter that \nsays:\n\n       Senator Boxer will offer an amendment that will assist \n     prosecutions under the National Firearms Act. The NFA \n     prohibits the manufacture, sale and possession of machine \n     guns, sawed-off shotguns and bombs. The statute of \n     limitations for NFA violations, however, is only 3 years, in \n     contrast to a 5-year statute of limitation for all other gun \n     control laws and most criminal laws. The Boxer amendment will \n     increase the statute of limitations for NFA violations to 5 \n     years.\n\n  The Fraternal Order of Police firmly supports . . . this amendment. \nAnd it goes on to write:\n\n       You have supported law enforcement in the past and we hope \n     you will stand with us again by voting to approve these vital \n     propolice amendments.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the Boxer amendment is a propolice amendment \ndescribed that way by the Fraternal Order of Police and 45 police \nchiefs in this country who are saying to the U.S. Senate: ``Please pass \nthis antiterrorism bill, but give us the tools we need.''\n  And here is one tool that does not cost any money, Mr. President. \nWhat we are giving the law enforcement authorities is time, time to \nfollow the thousands of leads, time to put together the pieces of the \npuzzle. I really hope we can have bipartisan support for this amendment \nin its entirety. The police chiefs are not just supporting part of the \nBoxer amendment, they are supporting the entire Boxer amendment, and I \nhope we can come together and move on, because as I watched the \nfamilies of the victims of Oklahoma yesterday begging us to move \nforward a bill that would help bring these evildoers to justice, it \ncertainly occurred to me that it would be tragic if the statute of \nlimitations ran out.\n  One thing we have to remember, the statute starts running when the \nbomb is completed. So if a terrorist builds a bomb and stores that bomb \nfor a year or 2 before using it, we may be down to a year for the \npolice to put together all the leads.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record the names of the 45 police chiefs who have endorsed the \nBoxer amendment and the letter from the Fraternal Order of Police that \nwe just received.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate prepares to debate the anti-\n     terrorism bill, on behalf of the 270,000 police officers who \n     are members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to \n     strongly urge that you support three pro-law enforcement \n     amendments that will be offered to the bill. The three \n     amendments concern cop-killer bullets, re-arming felons, and \n     the National Firearms Act. Specifically, the Fraternal Order \n     of Police urges your support for the following:\n       Senator Bradley will offer an amendment to strengthen the \n     current cop-killer bullet law. In 1986, Congress passed and \n     President Reagan signed legislation prohibiting the \n     manufacture, importation and sale of handgun ammunition \n     capable of piercing the body armor worn by most police \n     officers. Earlier this year, the ``Black Rhino'' bullet \n     received a lot of publicity for its supposed armor-piercing \n     qualities. While the claims turned out to be exaggerated, \n     manufacture of such a bullet would have been allowed under \n     current law. Because the 1986 law prohibits bullets based on \n     their physical composition, manufacturers currently working \n     to develop ammunition like the ``Black Rhino'' would be able \n     to manufacture and market them to the public. The Bradley \n     Amendment will close this loophole by prohibiting the \n     manufacture and sale of armor-piercing ammunition based on \n     reasonable performance standards rather than composition.\n       Senators Lautenberg and Simon will offer an amendment that \n     will prevent all persons convicted of a violent felony or \n     serious drug offense from ever possessing firearms. Even \n     though federal law generally prohibits a convicted felon from \n     possessing a firearm, ATF can grant a waiver to this \n     prohibition, following an extensive background investigation. \n     Although recent appropriations acts have temporarily halted \n     the use of ATF funds to restore firearm rights to convicted \n     felons, the Lautenberg/Simon Amendment will permanently close \n     this loophole by eliminating the waiver procedure. This \n     amendment will also permanently prohibit any individual \n     convicted of a violent felony or serious drug offense from \n     possessing a [[Page S7725]] firearm, even if the state might \n     have restored other civil rights to the individual. The \n     effect of this amendment, in addition to keeping guns out of \n     the hands of felons, will be to permanently free ATF \n     personnel to take guns out of the hands of criminals, rather \n     than to put them there.\n       Senator Boxer will offer an amendment that will assist \n     prosecutions under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The NFA \n     prohibits the manufacture, sale and possession of machine \n     guns, sawed-off shotguns and bombs. The statute of \n     limitations for NFA violations, however, is only three years, \n     in contrast to a five year statute of limitation for all \n     other gun control laws and most other criminal laws. The \n     Boxer Amendment will increase the statute of limitations for \n     NFA violations to five years.\n       The Fraternal Order of Police firmly supports these three \n     amendments. You have supported law enforcement in the past \n     and we hope you will stand with us again by voting to approve \n     these vital pro-police amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Dewey R.

I thank the \nPresident and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I make an inquiry, are we making progress \nthis morning?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, oh, we are doing great, I say to the \nleader. Things are moving along swimmingly. At this rate, we will be \ndone.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand the Senator from California was available \nearlier. Others were not available. She was here. I do not think the \namendment has been offered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. It has been offered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am ready to vote on it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Hopefully, we can dispose of that and move on quickly to \nthe other amendments. It is our intention to finish this bill today. We \nwill be discussing in our conference trying to further limit the number \nof amendments on this side.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, we will make the \nsame effort in our conference.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think what we are doing is awaiting the return of Senator \nHatch right now, as I understand it.\n\n\n                             Habeas Corpus\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as part of the ongoing debate, not on the \namendment, I wanted to make a brief statement on habeas corpus because \non May 25, President Clinton wrote me urging habeas corpus reform be \nexcluded, that means excluded from the antiterrorism bill pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  The President wrote, and I quote:\n\n       While I do not believe that habeas corpus reform should be \n     addressed in the context of the counterterrorism bill, I look \n     forward to working with the Senate in the future on a bill \n     that would accomplish this objective.\n\n  The President apparently had a change of heart. Last night on the \nLarry King Show, the President reversed his position, endorsing the \ninclusion of habeas reform in the antiterrorism bill. The President \nsaid:\n\n       We need to cut the time delay on appeals dramatically, and \n     . . . it ought to be done in the context of this terrorism \n     legislation so that it would apply to any prosecutions \n     brought against anyone indicted in Oklahoma. And I think it \n     ought to be done.\n  I welcome the President's remarks. And I am delighted that he has \nfinally come around to our position that, of all the antiterrorism \ninitiatives now before the Senate, the one that bears most directly on \nthe Oklahoma City tragedy is habeas corpus reform.\n  Yesterday, the families of some of the victims of the Oklahoma City \nbombing traveled all the way to Washington to tell their elected \nrepresentatives that habeas reform is an essential ingredient of any \nserious antiterrorism plan. The families understand, as we do, that if \nwe really want justice that is ``swift, certain and severe,'' then we \nmust put an end to the endless appeals and delays that have done so \nmuch to weaken public confidence in our criminal justice system. We \nmust have habeas corpus reform now.\n  It is great news that President has switched his position and now \nsupports the inclusion of habeas reform in the antiterrorism bill. \nHopefully, the President's support will help speed up the process here \nin the Senate and enable us to pass this legislation later tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's quote on the Larry King \nShow and his letter of a couple of weeks ago--and they state different \npositions--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Excerpts From the Larry King Show\n\n       President Clinton. In death penalty cases, it normally \n     takes eight years to exhaust the appeals. It's ridiculous. \n     And if you have multiple convictions, it cold take even \n     longer. So there is a strong sense in the Congress, I think \n     among members of both parties, that we need to get down to \n     sort of one clear appeal. We need to cut the time delay on \n     the appeals dramatically, and that it ought to be done in the \n     context of this terrorism legislation so that it would apply \n     to any prosecutions brought against anyone indicted in \n     Oklahoma. And I think it ought to be done.\n       You know, we have some differences about exactly what the \n     details are and what the best and fairest way to do to apply \n     to all criminal cases, but I think it definitely ought to be \n     done.\n       For 15 years I have been trying to get Congress to clarify \n     this, and I have strongly believed it for a very long time, \n     since I was an attorney general and a governor and I'd been \n     on the receiving end of these interminable appeals.\n       Mr. King. Are there those in Congress who think you're \n     against this?\n       Vice President Gore. There are some in both parties who, in \n     good conscience, think it would cause problems for criminal \n     procedure.\n       Mr. King. Constitutional.\n       Vice President Gore. Well, they're worried about it. But \n     the president's for it. And if they want to put the right \n     version of it on this bill, fine.\n       Mr. King. Are we----\n       President Clinton. You know, there are some good and bad. \n     We don't have time to get into all the details of it. There \n     are things that I like better in some versions than others.\n       Mr. King. But you're in essence for it.\n       President Clinton. But we--I'm not only for it; we need to \n     do it. You can't justify this lengthy appeal process.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I write to renew my call for a tough, \n     effective, and comprehensive antiterrorism bill, and I urge \n     the Congress to pass it as quickly as possible. The Executive \n     and Legislative Branches share the responsibility of ensuring \n     that adequate legal tools and resources are available to \n     protect our Nation and its people against threats to their \n     safety and well-being. The tragic bombing of the Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19th, the latest \n     in a disturbing trend of terrorist attacks, makes clear the \n     need to enhance the Federal government's ability to \n     investigate, prosecute, and punish terrorist activity.\n       To that end, I have transmitted to the Congress two \n     comprehensive legislative proposals: The ``Omnibus \n     Counterterrorism Act of 1995'' and the ``Antiterrorism \n     Amendments [[Page S7726]] Act of 1995.'' In addition, the \n     Senate has under consideration your bill, S. 735, the \n     ``Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995.'' I \n     understand that a substitute to S. 735, incorporating many of \n     the features of the two Administration proposals, will be \n     offered in the near future. I also understand that the \n     substitute contains some provisions that raise significant \n     concerns. We must make every effort to ensure that this \n     measure responds forcefully to the challenge of domestic and \n     international terrorism. I look forward to working with the \n     Senate on the substitute and to supporting its enactment, \n     provided that the final product addresses major concerns of \n     the Administration in an effective, fair, and constitutional \n     manner. The bill should include the following provisions:\n       Provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for any \n     international terrorist attack that might occur in the United \n     States, as well as provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over \n     terrorists who use the United States as the place from which \n     to plan terrorist attacks overseas.\n       Provide a workable mechanism to deport alien terrorists \n     expeditiously, without risking the disclosure of national \n     security information or techniques and with adequate \n     assurance of fairness.\n       Provide an assured source of funding for the \n     Administration's digital telephony initiative.\n       Provide a means of preventing fundraising in the United \n     States that supports international terrorist activity \n     overseas.\n       Provide access to financial and credit reports in \n     antiterrorism cases, in the same manner as banking records \n     can be obtained under current law through appropriate legal \n     procedures.\n       Make available the national security letter process, which \n     is currently used for obtaining certain categories of \n     information in terrorism investigations, to obtain records \n     critical to such investigations from hotels, motels, common \n     carriers, and storage and vehicle rental facilities.\n       Approve the implementing legislation for the Plastic \n     Explosives Convention, which requires a chemical in plastic \n     explosives for identification purposes, and require the \n     inclusion of taggants--microscopic particles--in standard \n     explosive device raw materials which will permit tracing of \n     the materials post-explosion.\n       Expand the authority of law enforcement to fight terrorism \n     through electronic surveillance, by expanding the list of \n     felonies that could be used as the basis for a surveillance \n     order; applying the same legal standard in national security \n     cases that is currently used in routine criminal cases for \n     obtaining permission to track telephone traffic with ``pen \n     registers'' and ``trap and trace'' devices; and authorizing \n     ``roving'' wiretaps where it is impractical to specify the \n     number of the phone to be tapped (such as when a suspect uses \n     a series of cellular phones).\n       Criminalize the unauthorized use of chemical weapons in \n     solid and liquid form (as they are currently criminalized for \n     use in gaseous form), and permit the military to provide \n     technical assistance when chemical or biological weapons are \n     concerned, similar to previously authorized efforts involving \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Make it illegal to possess explosives knowing that they are \n     stolen; increase the penalty for anyone who transfers a \n     firearm or explosive materials, knowing that they will be \n     used to commit a crime of violence; and provide enhanced \n     penalties for terrorist attacks against all current and \n     former Federal employees, and their families, when the crime \n     is committed because of the official duties of the federal \n     employee.\n       In addition, the substitute bill contains a section on \n     habeas corpus reform. This Administration is committed to any \n     reform that would assure dramatically swifter and more \n     efficient resolution of criminal cases while at the same time \n     preserving the historic right to meaningful Federal review. \n     While I do not believe that habeas corpus should be addressed \n     in the context of the counterterrorism bill, I look forward \n     to working with the Senate in the near future on a bill that \n     would accomplish this important objective.\n       I want to reiterate this Administration's commitment to \n     fashioning a strong and effective response to terrorist \n     activity that preserves our civil liberties. In combatting \n     terrorism, we must not sacrifice the guarantees of the Bill \n     of Rights, and we will not do so. I look forward to working \n     with the Congress toward the enactment of this critical \n     legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest that we hope to finish this bill tonight. I urge \nmy colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle that there are a \nnumber of Republican amendments pending, and they are not rushing to \nthe floor to discuss those amendments with the manager and the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Hatch.\n  Now, if we are going to suggest that the Democrats ought to \ncooperate, then we will suggest that Republicans ought to cooperate, \ntoo. So I ask my colleagues on this side of the aisle, or anybody who \nmay be listening in their offices, if you have amendments, please let \nus know before noon. We would like to find out by noon on this side of \nthe aisle how many amendments we have, serious amendments, and how many \nare going to be called up. Then we can go to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware and say we have x number of amendments that will take x \namount of hours. We hope to get time agreements so we can complete \naction on the bill later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me respond to the question posed to me \nby the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. There are a couple of \nthings I have observed in the years of working with Senator Boxer, and \nthat is when she thinks she is right, there is nothing that slows her \nup. I mean nothing. Almost without exception, in my dealings with her \nand the matters we have worked on, she has a commonsense approach to \nthese things that is, quite frankly, sometimes around this place is not \nfactored in. If she had stood up today on the floor of the Senate and \nsaid, you know, my colleagues in the Senate, the statute of limitations \nfor rape is 3 years. Yet, the statute of limitations for robbery is 5 \nyears, and what I want to do is I want to increase the statute of \nlimitations for rape from 3 to 5 years, I imagine there would be a \nchorus of Members in the Senate on both side standing up and saying, \nbravo, right.\n  My goodness, why would we have a serious crime like rape be a statute \nthat was only 3 years and yet a less serious crime like assault be a 5-\nyear statute of limitations. Because I want to make it clear--and I \nknow all my colleagues and everybody on the floor here who has dealt in \nthis area or are accomplished lawyers in their own right know that--let \nus keep in mind what the rationale for the statute of limitations is. \nThe rationale is, the more serious the crime, the more we are committed \nto finding the perpetrator, and ofttimes that means we need more time.\n  A second factor that goes into this is that some crimes are more \ndifficult to solve than others because the evidence that is needed to \nsolve the crime sometimes takes a long time to track down.\n  Third, we have generally tried--in terms of title 18, the criminal \ncode in effect for the Federal Government--to standardize the amount of \ntime we give prosecutors and the Government to find perpetrators of \ncrime.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is that I do not think this has anything \nto do with gun control. It happens to be that we are talking about a \nFirearms Act that affects guns, but it really does not matter. It has \neverything to do with equity, and it has everything to do with giving \nthe victim and the Government a chance to find the person who did the \nthing that we think is a very bad thing.\n  For example, if someone is out there violating the Firearms Act with \na machine gun, then we have as a policy, as a nation, for the past \nseveral decades said that is a very bad thing. Yet, there is a 3-year \nstatute of limitations for that. Or if we go out and say we do not want \npeople using chemical weapons or making explosives that can do great \ndamage, we said in the first instance that is a bad thing to do. It is \nunhealthy for Americans, for people to be making these devices or \nputting silencers on their guns. Why do people put a silencer on a gun? \nIs it because they are target practicing in their basement and they do \nnot want to disturb the folks on the second floor? Or is it because \nthey do not want the deer to hear the bullet coming? Why do you use \nsilencers? You use a silencer to avoid detection. And so if someone is \nout there violating the Firearms Act with a silencer or machinegun or \nbuilding a bomb, it seems to me, just on the face of it, that we should \ngive the Government and the victims enough time out there as we give \nsomebody if they are assaulted. My Lord, if someone is assaulted, the \ncase stays open for 5 years. Yet, if someone violates what we all say \nis a serious problem, we are saying 3 years.\n  Now, look, I know that some of my friends on both sides of the aisle \nare a little concerned about this because I know that it says ``guns \nand firearms,'' and when you say that around here, that sets off bells \nand whistles and so on. But I respectfully suggest that this is totally \nconsistent--although I have not spoken to the national NRA, I have \n[[Page S7727]] spoken with the NRA in my State and the leadership in my \nState. I keep in contact with them. As I said yesterday, in my State, \nthe NRA are upstanding citizens. The leader in my State is a member of \nthe ACLU and the NRA and is a practicing lawyer in town. The No. 2 guy \nin my State in the NRA is a former captain in a police department in \nDover, DE. These guys are not wackos or nuts; they are serious \ncitizens.\n  Now, I have not spoken to them about this, but I have spoken to them \nand the national NRA about how we should be dealing with guns and gun \noffenses. What do they always say to us? They say, look, do not outlaw \nthe gun, increase the penalty. So Senator Gramm comes to the floor all \nthe time and makes a logical, coherent argument. He says, hey, do not \ndo away with assault weapons, but if you have anybody using one, \nviolating the law in its use, nail them. Minimum mandatory sentences, \nminimum mandatory imprisonment.\n  And so the philosophy that the NRA has adopted--and to their credit \nit is consistent--is that people kill people, guns do not kill people. \nAnd only when they take that inert instrument, that thing called a gun, \nand do something bad with it, do you engage the Government.\n  We have decided as a matter of law under the Firearms Act that it is \na bad thing to go around putting silencers on the end of revolvers, or \nrifles for that matter. We decided that it is a bad thing to tote \naround a machinegun. We decided that. I do not hear any gun \norganization saying, by the way, legalize the sale of machineguns \nagain. I do not hear anybody saying silencers are something we should \nbe using. So I am a little surprised that there is any opposition to \nthe initiative of my friend from California. The one thing she is \nprobably--I will speak only of the Democratic side, so I do not \nimplicate any of my Republican friends. She is among the four or five \nmost successful legislators. She knows how to get things done. I assume \nthat it comes from her 10 years of experience in the House. I think she \nis as surprised as I am that this may be resisted, because I cannot \nfigure out why it would be. It is consistent with what--I do not want \nto put a negative spin on it--the gun proponents say is the way we \nshould handle the issue of firearms in America. It is consistent. It \nrelates to penalties, not outlawing them. And it is totally consistent \nwith the way in which we decide under title 18 to deal with the vast \nmajority of crimes.\n  Now, look, this increases from 3 to 5 years the statute of \nlimitations for the most serious weapons offenses, specifically those \nunder the National Firearms Act. In doing so, this amendment brings the \nstatute of limitations into line with the vast majority of Federal \noffenses which have to do with guns and do not have to do with guns. \nGenerally, the statute of limitations is a period which the Government \nhas following the crime to bring an indictment under Federal law. All \nnoncapital crimes are subject to a limitation. The National Firearms \nAct covers the most dangerous weapons: machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, \nsilencers, and destructive devices which include any explosive or \nincendiary or poison gas, A, bomb, B, grenade, C, rocket having a \npropellant of more than four ounces, D, missiles having explosive or \nincendiary charges of more than one-quarter of an ounce, and E, a mine.\n  You know, these are not playthings we are talking about. These are \nserious offenses. Again, I do not know anybody, whether they are the \nNRA--and I stand to be corrected by anybody else--who says, by the way, \nyou should not outlaw sawed-off shotguns, machineguns, and rockets \nhaving a propellant and the charges, grenades, bombs, incendiary \ncharges of more than one-quarter ounce, and missiles.\n  So all the Senator is asking for is what the police are asking for. \nIt defies logic to give offenders a break by limiting the statute of \nlimitations to only 3 years. The statute of limitations in other \nFederal crimes is that, as has been pointed out by the Senator from \nCalifornia, a vast majority of those crimes already are 5 years. Let me \ngive you a few examples. Crimes with a 5-year statute of limitations \ninclude assault, 18 United States Code section 111; kidnapping, 18 \nUnited States Code section 1201; bank robbery, 18 United States Code \nsection 2113; car robbery, 18 United States Code section 2119; \nembezzlement, 18 United States Code section 641.\n  I also point out that the statute of limitations is also 5 years for \nillegally importing lottery tickets, impersonating a Federal employee, \nunlawfully shipping, transporting, receiving, possessing, selling, \ndistributing, or purchasing contraband cigarettes, counterfeiting, \nforging, or using any counterfeited or forged postal or revenue stamp \nof any foreign government, unauthorized use of the character Smokey the \nBear. It is a misdemeanor, but it is a 5-year statute of limitations. \nUnauthorized use of the character Woodsy Owl. That is a 5-year statute \nof limitations.\n  Now, look, if we are going to give the Government 5 years to track \ndown the guy who impersonates or uses Woodsy the Owl, why in the devil \nwould we not give 5 years to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \ntrack down somebody who has violated the most serious weapons offenses \nthat nobody I know of is suggesting we do away with?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I think this is such a crucial \npoint because if people were unhappy with the 5-year statute of \nlimitations, I would assume there could be an amendment to roll it back \nto 3. All we are saying is that it is an anomaly here that three or \nfour firearms laws do not match up with the vast majority. I think my \nfriend has gotten it exactly right, as usual.\n  If I might just say to my friend, I do not know whether he was aware \nof this, but there was an article in the New York Times on another \nmatter that relates to my friend's work here. And that is that under \nthe Violence Against Women Act, the first arrest was made, and this is \na man who crossed State lines to beat his wife. It is a matter of the \nwork of my friend, Senator Biden, who, for--I do not know how long--6 \nyears, fought to get the Violence Against Women Act into law. Proudly, \nI was the House author when I was there in the House and lived to see \nthe day when it became law here in the Senate.\n  The reason I bring that up is my friend is a pragmatist. He sees a \nproblem and he solves it. He sticks with it. But my friend from \nDelaware, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, is also \nsomebody who works beautifully with the other side. Senator Hatch \nworked with him on the Violence Against Women Act, and, in the end, we \nhad everybody together. When my friend, Senator Biden, stands on this \nfloor and says he does not understand why there is a problem with this \non the other side, I think that carries a lot of weight.\n  Frankly, I say to my friend, I wish we could just have a vote up or \ndown on this amendment. I think it is common sense. We have 45 police \nchiefs from 24 States who have endorsed this. We have the Fraternal \nOrder of Police.\n  It may be that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend \nfrom Utah, may wish to lay this aside. We will take a look at it. I \ncertainly hope that the remarks of the Senator from Delaware will be \nheard by both sides of the aisle, because this is a commonsense \namendment. We should not be wasting a lot of time. We should do this in \na bipartisan way.\n  Frankly, it directly relates to Oklahoma City. It directly relates. \nIf we find out that those terrorists made that bomb a year earlier, it \nwould bring the statute down to 2 years, I say to my friend. It is a \nvery serious amendment. It is directly related to Oklahoma City. I want \nto thank my friend so much. I yield back.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me conclude, Mr. President, because again, it is a \nlittle bit like when we first raised the issue of taggants. There was \ninitially--because a lot of people did not understand it--a lot of \nresistance.\n  Yesterday, we overwhelmingly passed it because we talked about it. I \nam sincerely hopeful that as the staff of Senators who were otherwise \noccupied now in committee hearings and may not be able to hear this \nthemselves will understand that this does not have to do with guns. It \nhas to do with equity.\n  A person convicted, as I indicated earlier, of impersonating a \nFederal employee can get up to a 3-year sentence, while a person \nconvicted under the National Firearms Act can receive up to 10 years in \nprison. [[Page S7728]] \n  One has to wonder why a statute of limitations is shorter for the \ngreat offense and longer for the shorter offense. It does not seem to \nmake sense.\n  Again, although I cannot and do not speak for the NRA, it seems to me \non its face this is totally consistent with the philosophy that the NRA \nhas adopted relative to gun offenses.\n  That is, when the law is violated relating to guns and/or explosives, \nthat person should be punished severely. One of the things that we all \nknow, in tracking these cases, is the police need time.\n  It is totally consistent with the way we have dealt with other crimes \nand totally consistent with the philosophy on the left and the right, \nit seems to me, to just merely standardize the statute of limitations \nfor these very serious offenses.\n  I hope, if we are prepared to vote on this, or whatever decision the \nSenator from California makes, I hope the Senator sticks to her guns \nhere. I am convinced if people understand what the Senator is \nattempting to do and depoliticize it here and just look at the facts, \nthe facts are it makes no sense not to give the police what they want, \nthe additional 2 years to be able to track and apprehend people who \nviolate only the most serious of the laws relating to firearms and \nexplosives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee \nhas been waiting to speak. I need to take just 1 minute. I think I have \nworked this out with the distinguished Senator from California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer amendment numbered 1214 be \nlaid aside until 2:15 in order for the Senate to consider other \namendments, and that no amendments dealing with the same issue as the \nBoxer amendment be in order prior to 2:15 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just say, with regard to the \nSenator's amendment, that there is a lot of concern because 40 percent \nof the people in this country are afraid of their Government.\n  If we extend a statute of limitations from 3 to 5 years, there is an \nawful lot of worry that official prosecutors will dangle and dangle the \naccused for the full 5 years until they indict them, the day before the \n5 years expires. We have seen it happen before.\n  Extending the statute of limitations is not a simple little gesture. \nIt is important. I understand the sincerity of the distinguished \nSenator from California, and there are a number of other issues, too.\n  For instance, I think it is important to answer questions. How many \ncases in the past decade have failed to be prosecuted because of the \nstatute of limitations for violation of the firearms provisions? What \nwere the reasons for the failure to prosecute the alleged NFA firearms \nviolations within the 3-year statute of limitations? How many NFA \nfirearms violators have been prosecuted in the last decade? How many \nNFA firearms charges were dropped or reduced by plea bargaining? Has \nthe BATF stated in congressional testimony, or anywhere, that the 3-\nyear statute of limitations for firearms violations has been a \nsignificant problem? Out of all the cases prosecuted for NFA firearms \nviolations in the last 5 years, what is the percentage of the \nconvictions obtained?\n  Now, I ask unanimous consent that the rest of these questions be \nprinted in the Record at this point. It may be important for the \ndistinguished Senator from California to answer some of these \nquestions, and I will give her a copy of this so she and her staff can \nlook it over.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  National Firearms Act Violations--Statute of Limitations--Proposed \n                                Increase\n\n       1. How many cases in the last decade have failed to be \n     prosecuted because of the three year statute of limitations \n     of violations of the firearms provisions NFA?\n       2. What were the reasons for the failure to prosecute the \n     alleged NFA firearm violations within the three year statute \n     of limitations?\n       3. How many NFA firearms violators have been prosecuted in \n     the last decade?\n       4. How many NFA firearms charges were dropped or were \n     reduced by a plea bargain?\n       5. Has the BATF stated in Congressional testimony, or \n     anywhere, that the three year statute of limitations for \n     firearms violations has been a significant problem for them?\n       6. Out of all the cases prosecuted for NFA firearms \n     violations in the last five years, what is the percentage of \n     convictions obtained?\n       7. In the last five years, what percentage of convicted \n     felon for NFA firearm violations are currently serving their \n     sentences in a federal penal institution?\n       8. Isn't it a fact that under Title I of the Gun Control \n     Act, which is often the subject of indictments also alleging \n     NFA offenses, there is a five year statute of limitations? \n     And isn't also a fact that the three year statute of \n     limitations is overlooked at times by counsel and others? \n     Isn't it true that is the real reason for any cases lost \n     under the NFA statute of limitations is because of human \n     error?\n       9. If a potential case is brought to the BATF or other \n     relevant federal officials attention's, why would a three \n     year statute of limitations not be sufficient time to bring \n     an indictment against the alleged violator? Shouldn't the \n     punishment for such a crime be swift and effective?\n       10. After the passage of over three years, evidence becomes \n     stale and witnesses are lost; a defendant is at a great \n     disadvantage to defend himself against charges, what, in \n     terms of fairness, would mandate an extension of that time \n     for prosecutions of NFA firearms violations for another two \n     years?\n                           Amendment No. 1228\n\n       (Purpose: To clarify the procedures for deporting aliens)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for Mr. Abraham, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1228.\n\n   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On p. 36, line 16, strike from ``to prepare a defense'' \n     through the word ``imminent'' on p. 37, line 12, and insert \n     in its place the following: ``substantially the same ability \n     to make his defense as would disclosure of the classified \n     information.\n       ``(C) The Attorney General shall cause to be delivered to \n     the alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under \n     subparagraph (B).\n       ``(D) If the written unclassified summary is not approved \n     by the court, the Department of Justice shall be afforded \n     reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiencies identified \n     by the court and submit a revised unclassified summary.\n       ``(E) If the revised unclassified summary is not approved \n     by the court, the special removal hearing shall be terminated \n     unless the court, after reviewing the classified information \n     in camera and ex parte issues findings that--\n       ``(i) the alien's continued presence in the U.S. poses as \n     reasonable likelihood of causing\n       ``(I) serious and irreparable harm to the national \n     security; or\n       ``(II) death or serious bodily injury to any person; and\n       ``(ii) provision of either the classified information or an \n     unclassified summary that meets the standard set out in (B) \n     poses a reasonable likelihood of causing\n       ``(I) serious and irreparable harm to the national \n     security; or\n       ``(II) death or serious bodily injury to any person; and\n       ``(iii) the unclassified summary prepared by the Department \n     of Justice is adequate to allow the alien to prepare a \n     defense.\n       ``(F) If the Court makes these findings, the special \n     removal hearing shall continue, and the Attorney General \n     shall cause to be delivered to the alien a copy of the \n     unclassified summary together with a statement that it meets \n     the standard set forth in paragraph (E) rather than the one \n     set forth in paragraph (C).\n       ``(G) If the Court concludes that the unclassified summary \n     does not meet the standard set forth in paragraph (E), the \n     special removal hearing shall be terminated unless the court, \n     after reviewing the classified information in camera and ex \n     parte finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that--\n       ``(i) the alien's continued presence in the United States--\n       ``(I) would cause serious and irreparable harm to the \n     national security; or\n       ``(II) would likely cause ''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside. I understand Senator Leahy is coming to the floor with an \namendment to take up immediately following, hopefully, Senator \nThompson's remarks.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Tennessee is \nwaiting, if he allows me 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I listened to my friend raise questions \nabout the [[Page S7729]] amendment. My response is that all the \nquestions he raised are totally irrelevant.\n  Whether or not 40 percent of the American people are afraid of their \nGovernment, the idea is that who they should be afraid of is anybody \nwalking around with a bomb, grenade, rocket launcher, or a silencer on \ntheir gun, or a machine gun. That is who they should be afraid of. \nWhether there have been prosecutions or not is totally unrelated to \nwhether or not the statute of limitations should be 3 or 5 years. And \nthe notion of dangling over their head the prospect of prosecution--I \nhave zero sympathy for anyone, whether they are a Mafia don, whether \nthey are a rapist, or whether they are someone walking around with a \nrocket-propelled device, I could give a darn about their concern, if \nthey violate the law. The question is did they violate it or did they \nnot? They will have a chance to prove it in court. The police should \nhave a chance to bring them to court.\n  With all due respect, I think his questions raised are irrelevant. I \nhope my friend from California will not bother to answer them, but that \nis the right of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my remarks here the distinguished Senator from Tennessee be \npermitted to deliver his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not disagree with Senator Biden. When \nyou have terrorists and bomb throwers and rocket launchers and things \nlike that--I do not have any sympathy for them either. But both he and \nI have been in court before as practicing attorneys where the Federal \nGovernment has brought unjust actions against people and dangled them \nfor the full extent of the statute of limitations. We won those cases, \nbut it was not easy and it ruined lives in the process. I have seen \nthat happen. That is what I am concerned about and that is what I think \nmany people are concerned about.\n  I am not against extending statutes of limitations when they are \njustified. Maybe in this case they are. I may very well consider voting \nfor this amendment or accepting it. But I want to make sure everybody \nunderstands it is not quite as simple as we sometimes paint it on the \nfloor, when 40 percent of the people in this country are afraid of \ntheir Government. One reason is because they have seen some unjust \nprosecutions, criminal prosecutions, that is. That is a matter of \nconcern to me and I think it is to everybody who is worried about what \npeople think in this country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1229\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress concerning officials of \n       organizations that refuse to renounce the use of violence)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for and on \nbehalf of Mr. Brown and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for Mr. Brown proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1229.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section--\n\n     ``SEC.   . TERRORISM AND THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN \n                   IRELAND.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) All parties involved in the peace process should \n     renounce the use of violence and refrain from employing \n     terrorist tactics, including punishment beatings;\n       (2) The United States should take no action that supports \n     those who use international terrorism as a means of \n     furthering their ends in the peace process in northern \n     Ireland;\n       (3) United States policy should not discourage any \n     agreement reached in northern Ireland that is ratified by a \n     democratic referendum.\n       (b) Report.--Section 620 of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 is amended by adding the following--\n\n     ``SEC. 620G. REPORT ON NORTHERN IRELAND.\n\n       The President shall provide a biannual report beginning 60 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on--\n       (1) The renunciation of violence and steps taken toward \n     disarmament by all parties in the northern Ireland peace \n     process;\n       (2) Any terrorist incidents in northern Ireland in the \n     intervening six months, their perpetrators, actions taken by \n     the United States to denounce the acts of violence, United \n     States efforts to assist in the detention and arrest of these \n     terrorists and U.S. efforts to arrest or detain any elements \n     that have provided them direct or indirect support;\n       (3) Fundraising in the United States by the Irish \n     Republican Army, Sinn Fein or any associated organization and \n     whether any of these funds have been used to support \n     international terrorist activities.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I also unanimous consent this amendment be set aside so we \ncan have another amendment called up, presumably by Senator Leahy, who \nI understand is coming to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order the Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that he yield me 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The logic of the argument of my friend from Utah would be \nto reduce the statute of limitations for embezzlement from 5 to 3 \nyears, reduce the statute of limitations for assault from 5 to 3 years, \nto reduce the statute of limitations for most crimes from 5 to 3 years. \nI would stand ready to debate him if he wishes to do that.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we all appreciate the FBI's fine job in \ninvestigating the Oklahoma City bombing and tracking down the \nperpetrators. But all the resources that we vote for the FBI, and all \nthe work that the Marshals Services performs to protect people in \nFederal buildings, are meaningless if the courts will not put \nterrorists and other criminals in jail for a long time. And those \nresources also will be wasted if the Justice Department fails to punish \nthose who are guilty.\n  The bill before us will strengthen Federal efforts against terrorism. \nHowever, the American people should know that we are acting \nthoughtfully, and are not overreacting. For instance, the bill before \nus reflects a conscious decision not to pass the administration's \nproposals to permit roving telephone wiretaps and to significantly \nincrease the role of the military in domestic law enforcement. Before \nthis administration asks for increased authority that could infringe \nthe civil liberties of innocent citizens, it should exercise its \nalready significant authority to punish terrorists.\n  President Clinton has stated that those who bomb Federal buildings \nare evil cowards. And he has said that it is wrong for terrorists to \ntry to kill those who lawfully arrest them. Yet, the record of the use \nof the current authority of the President's Justice Department to fight \nterrorism fails to match the President's rhetoric.\n  Rodney Hamrick is a terrorist. He has been convicted of threatening \nthe life of the President, manufacturing an incendiary device while in \nprison, and making bomb threats against Federal courthouses in \nWashington and in Elkins, WV. While facing prosecution for threatening \nto kill the judge who sentenced him, Hamrick built a bomb from \nmaterials available at the jail: A 9-volt battery, steel wires, and \ncigarette lighters. He wrapped the bomb in aluminum and put it in an \nenvelope between a pad and a piece of cardboard. The bomb was designed \nto detonate when the pad was removed from the envelope. If fully \neffective, the bomb would have produced a 1000-degree fireball up to 3 \nfeet in diameter.\n  Hamrick mailed the bomb to the Federal building where the U.S. \nattorney responsible for prosecuting him worked. When the U.S. attorney \nopened the envelope, the bomb fortunately did not explode. The U.S. \nattorney, recognizing the homemade bomb, fled his office. The Marshals \nService, FBI, and ATF were called and an Army bomb disposal expert was \nflow to the scene. He ordered the evacuation of the entire wing of the \nFederal building. While wearing a full-body kevlar bomb suit, he \ndismantled the bomb at a distance of 30 feet and a flight of stairs \naway. Hamrick was convicted of a number of [[Page S7730]] charges \nrelated to using a deadly or dangerous weapon and destructive device in \nperpetrating his attempted murder of a Federal official.\n  On appeal, a three-judge panel of the fourth circuit held\n   that a dysfunctional bomb was neither a ``dangerous or deadly \nweapon'' nor a ``destructive device.'' The court made this ruling \ndespite a unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision in a bank robbery case \nthat an unloaded gun is a ``dangerous or deadly weapon.'' While the \nSupreme Court had held that a gun is an article that is typically and \ncharacteristically dangerous and instills fear in the average citizen, \nthe panel rules that a dysfunctional bomb is not characteristically \ndangerous and a combination of wires and a lighter cannot instill fear. \nIt overturned Hamrick's convictions on these counts.\n\n  When the Government loses a court case, the Solicitor General \ndetermines whether to appeal the decision. Here was a case where an \nevil coward had tried to bomb a Federal building and kill an important \nFederal official who had sought to prosecute a terrorist. The facts are \nextremely similar to the way the President described the Oklahoma City \nbombing. Additionally, a controlling Supreme Court decision suggested \nthat the fourth circuit panel had decided the case incorrectly.\n  What did the Clinton Justice Department do? Nothing. As the fourth \ncircuit later wrote:\n\n       The United States, at the direction of the Solicitor \n     General, did not petition either for rehearing or rehearing \n     en banc of the panel's reversal of Hamrick's convictions and \n     sentences on these courts.\n\n  Nor did the Justice Department file a petition with the Supreme Court \nto hear the case. Instead, in an unusual move, the full fourth\n circuit decided on its own to rehear the case. The full court found \nthat the bomb was a ``dangerous or deadly weapon'' and affirmed \nHamrick's convictions.\n\n  Mr. President, a letter bomb mailed to a Federal building is a \ndangerous or deadly weapon and a destructive device. That is just \ncommon sense. But where was the administration when the decision was \nmade to accept the overturning of the criminal charges against this \nterrorist? Where was the Justice Department, and the Attorney General? \nThey need to be held accountable for a decision that shows insufficient \nregard for public safety.\n  And what message does the Justice Department's acquiescence send to \nFederal law enforcement officials on the line every day, or to Federal \nprosecutors? Before this administration starts talking tough on \nterrorism, and about how tough it will act in imposing burdens such as \ninfiltration, roving wiretaps, and searches on law-abiding citizens, it \nshould explain why it has failed to take steps to raise the heat on \nterrorists.\n  Consider how the ruling the Justice Department accepted would affect \nlaw enforcement. If the original panel decision were the law, bombs \nthat could not operate would not be dangerous or deadly weapons or \ndestructive devices. Now consider how this approach would have applied \nto the shockingly similar bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma \nCity.\n Suppose that the bomber had been arrested for speeding while driving \nthe Ryder truck on the way into Oklahoma City instead of driving the \ncar on the way out. The police would have seen tons of fertilizer and \nfuel oil in the truck. But the bomber could not have been prosecuted \nfor transporting a destructive device or possessing a deadly or \ndangerous weapon because the bomb was not yet rigged to explode.\n\n  That the Justice Department was willing to accept a ruling that would \nyield such an astounding result is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, even the defendant in the Hamrick case did not argue \nthat the bomb was not a deadly or dangerous weapon in light of the \nSupreme Court decision. The Clinton administration was willing to \naccept a judicial decision that was softer on terrorism than the \nterrorist himself. The American people are owed an explanation, an \napology, and proof that steps have been taken to ensure that the \nserious mistakes the Justice Department made in Mr. Hamrick's case will \nnot be permitted to happen again. Otherwise, the Clinton administration \nwill have a difficult time credibly fighting terrorism.\n  I support this legislation, which will strike a proper balance in \nhabeas corpus and will restore the FBI to its pre-Clinton \nadministration hiring levels. But another reason to support the bill is \nlanguage in section 626, which, in light of the argument that the \nadministration accepted in Hamrick, will clarify that a ``deadly or \ndangerous weapon'' includes ``a weapon intended to cause death or \ndanger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective or missing \ncomponent.'' This language is truly a clarification. Section 111(b) of \nthe Federal Criminal Code always covered assaults on Federal officers \nwith deadly or dangerous weapons, even if by happenstance those weapons \nmisfired, notwithstanding the Clinton administration's position in the \nHamrick case. No defendant who has committed an assault on a Federal \nofficer with a defective weapon may use this language to argue that \nsuch conduct was legal prior to the date of the passage of this bill. \nWe merely want to prevent other courts from following the fourth \ncircuit's original decision, and we want to prevent the administration \nfrom continuing to argue in future cases that a defective bomb is not a \ndeadly or dangerous weapon. I commend Senators Dole and Hatch for \nincluding this language in their substitute amendment. And I hope that \nthe bill sends a message to the administration to apply common sense to \nprosecute terrorists like Rodney Hamrick to the fullest extent of \nexisting law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has a right to offer \nan amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1238 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To provide assistance and compensation for U.S. victims of \n                terrorist acts, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, and, in a moment, I will offer my \namendment.\n  Let me just mention, Mr. President, we need to look at what happens \nwhen we go after terrorists. As a former prosecutor, I feel that if \nsomebody commits a crime, especially serious crimes like this, we ought \nto be able to have every possible way of going after that person. They \nought to be prosecuted. They ought to be brought to justice. They ought \nto pay for their crime.\n  But also as a former prosecutor, I have seen so often the person who \nis neglected is the victim. We can spend sometimes millions of dollars \ngoing after somebody who has perpetrated a crime, especially a heinous \ncrime, but nothing is done to help the victim.\n  We saw in the continuing tragedy of the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 \nover Lockerbie, Scotland, the United States Government had no authority \nto provide assistance or compensation to the victims of that heinous \ncrime. It was the same thing with the victims of the Achille Lauro \nincident. There has been no authority in the law for the Department of \nJustice to respond to these victims through our crime victims programs. \nI think it is wrong, and it can be remedied. The amendment I am about \nto offer would do that.\n  We had a report to the Congress last summer from the Office for \nVictims of Crime at the U.S. Department of Justice that identified a \nrelated problem. Both the ABA and the State Department have commented \non their concern. They said that crime victims' compensation benefits \nshould be provided to U.S. citizens who have been victimized in another \ncountry.\n  If you are a U.S. citizen and you get hit during a terrorist attack \nin another country, because you are a U.S. citizen, you ought to at \nleast have the benefit of programs that are already in place in this \ncountry. Our citizens are deserving of the same protection whether they \nare hit by terrorists in Washington, DC, or hit by terrorists in \nBeirut, Lebanon.\n  The Victims of Terrorism Act, which I am about to offer as an \namendment, \n[[Page S7731]] provides authority to respond to the consequences of \nviolent extremism abroad and also here at home.\n  We have been shielded from much of the terrorism perpetrated abroad. \nWe see buildings blown up, cars bombed, people shot, leaders \nassassinated in other parts of the world. Now we are witnessing similar \nincidents here at home. We see what happened at the World Trade Center \nin New York, we see assaults on the White House, the Oklahoma City \nsituation.\n  The Victims of Terrorism Act would add to the Victims of Crime Act \nprovisions for supplemental grants to States to provide emergency \nrelief in the wake of a violent incident that might otherwise overwhelm \na State. I look at the tremendous job the people of Oklahoma and the \nlocal and State authorities did, but they were overwhelmed. This is the \ntime when they need help from all of us as citizens. Certainly, if \nsomething this terrible happened in my own State of Vermont, the \nsympathy would be there, and I know Vermonters well enough to know all \nVermonters would rally, but there would be no way we could handle all \nthe problems.\n  I want to commend the National Organization for Victims Assistance \nand all the volunteers and others who have been so critical in \nproviding timely assistance to the Oklahoma City bombing victims. We \nshould acknowledge their heroic activities. My amendment would allow \nthem to do more.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the Victims of Terrorism Act, an \namendment I propose to the amendment proposed by Mr. Dole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1238 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 160, after line 19, insert the following:\n\n                   TITLE X--VICTIMS OF TERRORISM ACT\n\n     SEC. 1001. TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Victims of Terrorism Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND COMPENSATION \n                   TO VICTIMS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.) \n     is amended by inserting after section 1404A the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 1404B. COMPENSATION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF \n                   TERRORISM OR MASS VIOLENCE.\n\n       ``(a) Victims of Acts of Terrorism Outside the United \n     States.--The Director may make supplemental grants to States \n     to provide compensation and assistance to the residents of \n     such States who, while outside the territorial boundaries of \n     the United States, are victims of a terrorist act or mass \n     violence and are not persons eligible for compensation under \n     title VIII of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and \n     Antiterrorism Act of 1986.\n       ``(b) Victims of Domestic Terrorism.--The Director may make \n     supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim \n     compensation and assistance programs to provide emergency \n     relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, \n     training, and technical assistance, for the benefit of \n     victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring within \n     the United States and may provide funding to United States \n     Attorneys' Offices for use in coordination with State victims \n     compensation and assistance efforts in providing emergency \n     relief.''.\n     SEC. 1003. FUNDING OF COMPENSATION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS \n                   OF TERRORISM, MASS VIOLENCE, AND CRIME.\n\n       Section 1402(d)(4) of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10601(d)(4)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4)(A) If the sums available in the Fund are sufficient \n     to fully provide grants to the States pursuant to section \n     1403(a)(1), the Director may retain any portion of the Fund \n     that was deposited during a fiscal year that was in excess of \n     110 percent of the total amount deposited in the Fund during \n     the preceding fiscal year as an emergency reserve.

CRIME VICTIMS FUND AMENDMENTS.\n\n       ``(a) Unobligated Funds.--Section 1402 of the Victims of \n     Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c), by striking ``subsection'' and \n     inserting ``chapter''; and\n       (2) by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Amounts Awarded and Unspent.--Any amount awarded as \n     part of a grant under this chapter that remains unspent at \n     the end of a fiscal year in which the grant is made may be \n     expended for the purpose for which the grant is made at any \n     time during the 2 succeeding fiscal years, at the end of \n     which period, any remaining unobligated sums shall be \n     returned to the Fund.''.\n       (b) Base Amount.--Section 1404(a)(5) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     10603(a)(5)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) As used in this subsection, the term `base amount' \n     means--\n       ``(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), $500,000; and\n       ``(B) for the territories of the Northern Mariana Islands, \n     Guam, American Samoa, and Palau, $200,000.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the bomb exploded outside the Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City last month, my thoughts and prayers \nand I suspect that those of all Americans turned immediately to the \nvictims of this horrendous act. The terrorism legislation that has been \nintroduced for our consideration, however, is silent with respect to \nvictims of terrorism.\n  This amendment is intended to fill that void left in this bill and \ninclude attention to those who suffer immediately and directly from \nviolent extremism. It is my desire that this amendment, to include \nattention to victims of terrorism in the bill, will provide a series of \nchanges in our growing body of law recognizing the rights and needs of \nvictims of crime on which we can quickly reach agreement.\n  No one will deny that a comprehensive approach to terrorism demands \nattention to the victims of terrorism. That is what this amendment will \nprovide.\n  The amendment helps correct a gap in the law for residents of the \nUnited States who are victims of terrorism that occurs outside the \nborders of the United States and who are not in the military, civil \nservice or civilians in the service of the United States and, \ntherefore, not eligible for benefits in accordance with the Omnibus \nDiplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.\n  Thus, this amendment, the Victims of Terrorism Act, adds to the \nVictims of Crime Act provisions that authorize supplemental grants to \nthe States to provide compensation and assistance for residents of such \nStates who are victims of terrorism or mass violence while overseas.\n  One of the continuing tragedies of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 \nover Lockerbie, Scotland, is that the United States Government had no \nauthority to provide assistance or compensation to the victims of that \nheinous crime. Likewise, the U.S. victims of the Achille Lauro incident \ncould not be given aid. There has simply been no authority in our law \nfor the Department of Justice to respond to these victims through our \ncrime victims' programs. This is wrong and will be remedied by this \namendment.\n  In its report to Congress last summer, the Office for Victims of \nCrime at the U.S. Department of Justice identified a related problem.\n both the ABA and the State Department have commented on their concern \nand their desire that crime victims compensation benefits be provided \nto U.S. citizens victimized in other countries. This is an important \nstep in that direction.\n\n  Certainly U.S. victims of terrorism overseas are deserving of our \nsupport and assistance.\n  In addition, this Victims of Terrorism Act provides authority to \nrespond to the consequences of violent extremism here at home. We in \nthis country have been shielded from much of the terrorism perpetrated \nabroad. That sense of security has been shaken by the bombing in \nOklahoma City, the destruction at the World Trade Center in New York, \nand the assaults upon the White House.\n  The Victims of Terrorism Act adds to the Victims of Crime Act \nprovisions for supplemental grants to States to provide emergency \nrelief in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass violence that might \notherwise overwhelm the resources of a State's crime victims \ncompensation program and crime victims assistance services.\n  We all applaud the efforts of our Office for Victims of Crime in the \nwake of the Oklahoma City bombing. It helped to organize a crisis \nresponse team of specially trained professionals who were dispatched \nwithin hours to the disaster. I know that the National Organization for \nVictims Assistance was critical in providing timely assistance to \nOklahoma City victims and \n[[Page S7732]] thank and acknowledge their heroic efforts.\n  This amendment will allow them to do more. I want to thank the \ndedicated officials at the Department of Justice Office for Victims of \nCrime, John Stein of the National Organization for Victims Assistance, \nDan Eddy of the National Association of Crime Victims Compensation \nBoards, and David Beatty of the National Victim Center for their help, \ncounsel, and suggestions in connection with this amendment.\n  The amendment builds on the crime victims assistance programs of the \nStates and Federal victims assistance provided through our U.S. \nattorney's offices to furnish emergency assistance in times that demand \nit. I propose that we allow the Attorney General and the Office for \nVictims of Crime, additional flexibility in its targeting of resources \nto victims of terrorism, mass violence, and the trauma and devastation \nthat they cause.\n  The Victims of Terrorism Act's supplemental grants to provide \ncompensation and assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence \nare funded through an emergency reserve established as part of the \ncrime victims fund. I do not intend for this emergency reserve to be \nestablished at the expense of our States' ongoing compensation and \nassistance programs. Indeed, funds are not available for the reserve \nuntil the full annual compensation grants are funded and the crime \nvictims fund has received in excess of 110 percent of the amount \ndeposited in the previous year so that assistance programs will be \nadequately funded, as well.\n  The emergency reserve will also serve as a rainy day fund to \nsupplement compensation and assistance grants to the States for years \nin which deposits to the crime victims fund are inadequate. There have \nbeen deep swings in the amount of funding deposited annually and, \ntherefore, available for distribution. This emergency reserve will \nprovide the Director with the means to even out what would otherwise be \nwide variations in annual grants and allow those providing these \ncritical services some additional confidence that funding will be \navailable even following a year of poor deposits.\n  The emergency reserve's ceiling of $50 million is intended to allow \nconfidence and the vital resources needed to take action to supplement \ngrants in down years. In order to serve its intended purposes, the \nemergency reserve and, for that matter, the entire crime victims fund \nmust be accorded respect and security. This is a trust fund that is \ndedicated to critical needs.\n  I hope through the provisions of this act to provide some greater \ncertainty to our State and local victim's assistance programs so that \nthey can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax \nand wane with events. Accordingly, the amendment would allow grants to \nbe made for a 3-year cycle of programming, rather than the year of \naward plus one, which is the limit contained in current law. This \nchange reflects the recommendation of the Office for Victims of Crime \ncontained in its June 1994 report to Congress.\n  Our State and local communities and community-based nonprofits cannot \nbe kept on a string like a yoyo if they are to plan and implement \nvictims' assistance and compensation programs.\n They need to be able to program and hire and have a sense of stability \nif these measures are to achieve their fullest potential.\n\n  I know, for instance, that, in Vermont, Lori Hayes and Pat Hayes at \nthe Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services; Judy Rex and the Vermont \nNetwork Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse; Karen Bradley from \nthe Vermont Center for Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Abuse; and \nothers, provide tremendous service under difficult conditions. Such \ndedicated individuals and organizations will be greatly aided by \nincreasing their programming cycle by even 1 year. Three years has been \na standard that has worked well in other settings.\n  Unfortunately, even with the recently announced decreases in violent \ncrime, it is certain that we will have too many crime victims who need \nassistance in the years ahead. While we have made progress over the \nlast 15 years in recognizing crime victims' rights and providing much-\nneeded assistance, we still have more to do. It is in recognition of \nthese needs and the additional authorities and scope being added to the \nVictims of Crime Act by this Victims of Terrorism Act that I include a \nprovision to raise the base amount for small States from $200,000 to \n$500,000 for their assistance programs. This is funding that will be \nput to good use.\n  I am proud to have played a role in passage of the Victims and \nWitness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, the \nVictims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the victims provisions \nincluded in such measures as the Federal Courts Administration Act of \n1992 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n  My greatest hope would be that the Victims of Terrorism Act, while \nimproving our responsiveness to national tragedies, need never be \ninvoked. My concern is that we have not seen the end to terrorism or \nmass violence and that its provisions will be important in our future.\n  A number of our colleagues have great interest in crime victims \nlegislation, including Senators Hatch, Biden, Ford, DeWine, Kyl, and \nMcCain and I look forward to working with them on these important \nmatters. In connection with this amendment I want to thank, in \nparticular, Senators Hatch, Biden, and McCain for working with me on \nit.\n  We can do more to see that victims of crime, including terrorism, are \ntreated with dignity and assisted and compensated with Government help.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nsupport for this amendment from the National Organization for Victims \nAssistance, which outlines many of the its benefits.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             National Organization\n                                            for Victim Assistance,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write to express the enthusiastic \n     support of the National Organization for Victim Assistance \n     for your proposed amendment to the anti-terrorism bill now \n     before the Senate--an amendment that would establish vitally \n     needed services for the victims of terrorism through the \n     structure of the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and its Crime \n     Victims Fund.\n       Let me give you a sense of the need for such an emergency \n     service from our perspective:\n       When we tried to assist the relatives of Americans held \n     hostage in Beruit, one service we tried to give them was the \n     wherewithal to make telephone calls to friends and family--a \n     healthy coping device which virtually every hostage family \n     uses extensively, often causing them financial hardship. We \n     found a charitable businessman who volunteered to organize \n     contributions to a free phone service for a designated member \n     of each family. Sadly, the contributions dried up before the \n     hostage crisis ended.\n       We also tried to help the niece and nephew of Peter \n     Kilbourne return his body from the East Coast for burial in \n     his home state of California (the State Department being \n     authorized to transport the remains of the slain hostage only \n     to the nearest U.S. port of entry). Happily, we connected the \n     relatives to an imaginative victim advocate in Santa Clara \n     County, who persuaded the state victim compensation program \n     to underwrite the transportation and burial costs. \n     Unfortunately, few American victims of terrorism overseas \n     have such a connection to a victim advocate, and very few \n     compensation programs have the authority to assist its \n     citizens who are victimized beyond the borders of the United \n     States.\n       And as the coordinator of NOVA's Crisis Response Team that \n     arrived in Oklahoma City the same day that its Federal \n     Building was bombed, I sensed immediately that which is now \n     being slowly documented--that those who had experienced \n     significant, immediate emotional crisis numbered in the \n     scores of thousands, that those at risk of experiencing \n     persistent crisis reactions are surely in the thousands, and \n     that those at risk of debilitating post-trauma stresses \n     number at least in the hundreds. NOVA's ongoing planning work \n     with just one institution--the city school system--shows us \n     that, whatever good has been done by our\n      volunteer crisis counselors and their counterparts in \n     Oklahoma City, the need for caregiving services over the \n     next year or two far exceeds available resources, and that \n     full-time crisis counselors and post-trauma therapists \n     must be hired for the task if society is to perform the \n     same healing services for these victims as for victims of \n     other violent crimes.\n       Your proposal to meet this need is not merely timely and \n     compassionate but inspired:\n       It would rename the existing financial reserves in the \n     Crime Victims Fund by calling [[Page S7733]] them an \n     ``emergency reserve,'' which precisely describes both its \n     original purpose--to cover any shortfall in the Fund's \n     revenues in a given year--and to circumscribe the purposes \n     for which the new authorization is being created--a class of \n     emergencies for which there are no victim assistance \n     resources at present;\n       It would raise additional revenues for the Fund to help \n     cover the new expenses;\n       It would cover domestic acts of ``mass violence'' so that \n     one need not immediately ascertain the motives of a terror-\n     inducing criminal before acting to assist the affected \n     community; and\n       It would place on the Director of the Office for Victims of \n     Crime the task of devising appropriate regulations, \n     presumably in consultation with the State Department and \n     administrators of state victim assistance and compensation \n     programs, among others, so that the emergency authority can \n     be invoked quickly, frugally, and imaginatively.\n       Let me add a final thought: in our ongoing work with \n     ``Operation Heartland'' in Oklahoma City--the cooperative \n     enterprise of city, county, state, and federal agencies to \n     ease the pains of thousands of victims of the Murrah Federal \n     Office Building bombing--we have seen just how the resources \n     of your amendment would be put to use--quickly and \n     effectively. The same is true of the monumental task that \n     will someday face city, county, and federal criminal justice \n     agencies, that is, how to meet their burdens of preserving \n     the victims' rights when prosecuting a crime which, by \n     design, produced thousands of anguished and grieving victims \n     of violence.\n       For these reasons, we very much hope that your amendment \n     will enjoy bipartisan support and speedy enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John H. Stein,\n                                                  Deputy Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on the floor, who is seeking recognition. I \nwill yield to him for whatever purpose he may need.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. I wonder if we can defer further \ndebate on his amendment, so that I can file a bill and make a speech on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Bennett is coming over as well. Maybe we can do it \nright after lunch.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also have an amendment somewhat related that I was going \nto offer on behalf of Senator McCain and myself. I will withhold doing \nthat so that the Senators from Utah can offer their bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why do you not call it up and then we will set it aside.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1240 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To increase the special assessment for felonies and extend \n                       the period of obligation)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator McCain and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1240 to \n     amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS ON CONVICTED PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Increased Assessment.--Section 3013(a)(2) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``$50'' and inserting \n     ``not less than $100''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``$200'' and inserting \n     ``not less than $400''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment, which mirrors \nprovisions contained in legislation previously introduced by the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], and provisions contained in the \namendment I had filed to this bill.\n  In 1984 when we established the crime victims fund to provide Federal \nassistance to State and local victims compensation and assistance \nefforts, we funded it with fines, penalties, and assessments from those \nconvicted of Federal crime. The level of required contribution was set \nlow; 10 years have past and it is high time to adjust the assessments.\n  The amendment serves to double the assessments under the Victims of \nCrime Act against those convicted of Federal felonies. This should \nprovide critical additional resources to assist all victims of crime, \nincluding those who are victims of terrorism or mass violence.\n  I do not think that $100 is too much for those individuals convicted \nof a Federal felony to contribute to help crime victims.\n  I do not think that $500 is too much to insist that corporations \nconvicted of a Federal felony contribute to crime victims. The \namendment would raise these to be the minimum level of assessment \nagainst those convicted of such crimes and provides judges with the \ndiscretion to assess higher levels when appropriate.\n  In connection with these provisions, I acknowledge the work of our \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain]. I know that he \nhas been actively seeking to raise these special assessments for some \ntime and I am glad that we are able to join together in this effort. He \ndeserves much credit for his ongoing efforts on behalf of crime \nvictims.\n  I look forward to our continuing to cooperate in additional efforts \non behalf of victims of crime, terrorism, and mass destruction. We have \nmuch to do if we are to improve collections for the crime victims fund \nand if we are to augment the critical resources needed by our victims \ncompensation and assistance programs. This is an amendment that will \nhelp provide additional resources for meeting critical needs.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch and Mr. Bennett pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 884 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7718-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7733-S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a moment. I want to get an \nupdate on where we are on the pending legislation.\n  We hope to finish this today. I appreciate the President's efforts, \nalong with the Democrat leader and the manager on the other side, to \nreduce the number of amendments on that side of the aisle. We have been \nmaking the same effort here.\n  I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, might be in a position to indicate how many amendments \nare remaining on this side or on both sides, if he knows.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have only disposed of three amendments. We have \ndisposed of a few others by unanimous consent. But of the 32 GOP \namendments, only 1 as been accepted; 5 are pending. I expect at the \nmost, only 3 more. We are basically down to a very few on the \nRepublican side. On the Democrat side, they have only offered five \namendments. We voted on one of them. That was the taggants amendment. \nThat would leave over 60 unknown or unoffered Democrat amendments.\n  We have to, it seems to me, if we are going to finish tomorrow, we \nhave to break those down and come up with a limited list, as the \nRepublicans are doing.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding that maybe after the policy lunches \nthat we have every Tuesday that maybe there will be an announcement on \nthe other side that a number of the amendments have been dropped.\n  It seems to me, and I have not seen the list that may be remaining, a \nnumber of these amendments are not directly related to antiterrorism or \nwhat happened in Oklahoma City or anywhere else.\n  If there will be a pattern of amendments offered just for the purpose \nof making points which we believe can be made at another time--I do not \nsuggest people should not have a right to make whatever point they want \nto make--this is legislation that the President has asked for. It is \nnonpartisan. It is bipartisan. We have worked together on it. It is \npart of Senator Hatch's efforts, part of my efforts, part of the \nPresident's efforts, part of the efforts of my colleague on the other \nside. We want to pass it.\n  The President complains about delay in the Senate. Much of the delay \nis because of a number of amendments on the other side. It may be the \nonly way we can finish this bill is A, to start tabling amendments that \nare not directly related to this bill, and I will let the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Hatch make that decision. That would \n[[Page S7734]] be one way to expedite passage, to table those \namendments which can be offered at a later time, or, B, to invoke \ncloture. A cloture petition has been filed, and the cloture vote will \noccur if for some reason we do not finish the bill late this evening, \nearly in the morning. By 8:30 or 9 o'clock, we will have a cloture \nvote.\n  Hopefully, that would eliminate a lot of the nongermane amendments. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides, not just one side, both sides of the \naisle, if there are amendments that are somewhat related or Members \nwould like some political point or some other point, let Members pass \nthis legislation.\n  The other bill is up this year and those amendments can be offered. \nThis legislation is important. We would like to dispose of it today. I \nhope we can have the cooperation of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask that the Senate stand in recess according to the previous \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7733-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment is set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for himself, Mr. \n     D'Amato, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1208 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the pending substitute \n     amendment No. 1199, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for the activities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms, to augment counter-terrorism efforts--\n       (1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1996;\n       (2) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1997;\n       (3) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;\n       (4) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1999; and\n       (5) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2000.\n       (b) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for the activities of the United States Secret Service, to \n     augment White House security and expand Presidential \n     protection activities--\n       (1) $62,000,000 for fiscal year 1996;\n       (2) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1997;\n       (3) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;\n       (4) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1999; and\n       (5) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2000.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Shelby of Alabama, Senator D'Amato of New York and Senator \nMikulski of Maryland.\n  The amendment that I am offering authorizes funding of $262 million \nover 5 years for the U.S. Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms. Of this, $100 million goes to BATF and $162 \nmillion goes to the U.S. Secret Service.\n  The substitute we are considering contains an authorization of $1.779 \nbillion from the violent crime reduction trust fund for the various law \nenforcement agencies. Over 5 years, it authorizes $1.226 billion for \nthe FBI, $400 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration, and $100 \nmillion for the U.S. attorneys, $25 million for INS, and $28 million \nfor the U.S. Customs Service.\n  I trust the evaluation of how allocations occur across various law \nenforcement agencies was done in a very thoughtful and deliberative \nfashion. However, I believe the exclusion of ATF and the Secret Service \nfrom the allocation of resources inside of this antiterrorism bill will \nimpair Treasury's capacity to engage in antiterrorism efforts. Thus, I \noffer this amendment to authorize resources for both the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Secret Service.\n  Since 1970, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has been \nmandated to enforce the criminal and regulatory provisions of the \nFederal explosives law.\n  ATF has regulatory oversight of the legal explosives industry in \nexcess of 10,000 licensees and permittees. ATF personnel have unequaled \nexperience in [[Page S7735]] identifying the postblast explosive \ndevices, components, and logistics involved in investigating postblast \ncrime scenes of any size.\n  The fiscal year 1995 supplemental and rescissions conference report, \njust approved by this body, provides quarter-year funding for the \nhiring of 175 new agents, inspectors, and intelligence analysts for \nATF, as requested by the administration.\n  These positions will be used to form four new national response teams \nfor the purpose of responding within 24 hours to assist State and local \nlaw enforcement and fire service personnel in on-site investigations in \nthe event of an explosion or fire. Each team is composed of veteran \nspecial agents having postblast, fire cause and origin expertise, \nforensic chemist and explosive technology expertise. The 59 inspection \nand intelligence analyst positions will be devoted to the inspection \nand investigation of groups and/or individuals in violation of Federal \nexplosives laws.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has been much maligned \nover the years. Much of this criticism, in my view, has been \nunjustified. I am quick to point out, some of the criticism is \njustified. This is an agency, like virtually any other in Government, \nthat has not been operated in a perfect fashion. Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms does not enact the laws related to guns, but is instead sworn \nto execute the laws which originate from this body, that is the U.S. \nCongress. In my opinion, if we do not like the laws, we ought to change \nthem rather than taking, in this case, action that might make it \ndifficult for ATF to carry out the intent of the law.\n  On those occasions when mistakes may have been made in the execution \nof laws, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has undergone extensive \nindependent review by a diverse group of respected professionals. It \nhas taken its fair share of justified criticism and its fair share of \njustified praise as well.\n  Despite ATF's contributions to cases of great notoriety, ATF rarely \nreceives their due credit. The World Trade Center bombing serves as the \nmost recent example. While that investigation was a massive joint law \nenforcement effort, it was an ATF agent's determination and ingenuity \nthat resulted in the discovery of one of the most significant pieces of \nevidence in that tedious investigation, the vehicle ID number.\n  ATF's contributions to the investigations of over 1,600 arson cases \nlast year were not realized by the majority of the American people. \nAgain, ATF just did its job.\n  Turning to the Secret Service, Mr. President, the White House complex \nsymbolizes the executive branch of Government. More than 1 million \nAmerican citizens a year tour the White House, and tens of thousands of \nWhite House complex appointments are processed during that same period \nof time. With the recent closing of Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular \ntraffic, pedestrian traffic will increase above and beyond the \nthousands of people who view the White House and surrounding areas.\n  The White House carries with it both national security and symbolic \nvalue which must be protected. Publicized threats of the White House \ncomplex in the past several years have caused us to be not just \nconcerned about the safety of the President and the President's family, \nbut also concerned about the executive branch personnel that very often \noperate inside the White House, as well as other individuals operating \nand doing business at the White House.\n  The April 19 Oklahoma City tragedy served to heighten the collective \nawareness and is, in part, the catalyst to which the closing of \nPennsylvania Avenue is generally attributed. I know from personal \nexperience that what many people saw with the Oklahoma City bombing is \nthe idea that it would be relatively easy now to take a different \napproach if they had a desire to attack the White House, attack the \nPresident, or attack other personnel. Thus, the closing of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, though it is, in my judgment, an appropriate action, it is just \none step in trying to make sure we do all we can to protect this symbol \nof the United States of America and protect the people who work and do \nbusiness in it.\n  Consistent with the recommendations from a recently completed review \nof White House security, the amendment I am offering will authorize \nsecurity enhancements at the White House to help the Secret Service \nensure that the White House and the First Family are not at risk.\n  Press reports I have seen since the Oklahoma City bombing indicate \nthreats to the President have increased by 100 percent.\n  The amendment I am offering as well, Mr. President, authorizes \nfunding for the hiring of 250 additional positions for the Presidential \nprotection division, uniformed division officers, countersniper teams, \nfoot and vehicular patrols, canine officers, and intelligence and \nphysical security specialists.\n  In addition, it authorizes the purchase of technical security \nequipment and devices and will permit physical security structural \nenhancements around the White House complex.\n  The Secret Service is responsible as well for the protection of \nforeign heads of state and Presidential candidates. This October, the \nU.N. General Assembly is projected to have its largest gathering of \nheads of states, including a Papal visit. All these will require \nincreased Secret Service personnel.\n  In approximately 7 months, the Secret Service will begin the year-\nlong task of protecting Presidential candidates. How can these \nchallenges and responsibilities not be addressed in any discussion of \nterrorism?\n  The Secret Service has for over 125 years been responsible for the \nintegrity of our currency. Counterfeiting of U.S. currency has in \nrecent years shifted dramatically from domestic to foreign production \nand trends point toward the distribution of high-quality counterfeit \nU.S. currency by terrorist organizations, as well as arms traffickers \nand drug dealers.\n  Pursuing these investigations related to foreign production of \ncounterfeit U.S. currency by such groups should also be a focus in \ncounterterrorism legislation.\n  The Secret Service possesses unique forensic capabilities relating to \nhandwriting, fingerprinting, ink and paper, just to name a few. They \nhave in the past and will continue in the future to provide these \ncapabilities to assist the investigative efforts of other Federal, \nState, and local agencies. While I do not argue that the FBI holds much \nof the responsibility in combating terrorism, it seems to me the \nchallenges and responsibility of Treasury law enforcement agencies have \nbeen overlooked.\n  The bill we are considering is entitled the ``Comprehensive Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 1995,'' but I do not believe it can be comprehensive \nunless we include funding for both the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms and the Secret Service.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the manager of the bill allowing me to \noffer the amendment at this particular time. I urge the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John \nLibonati, a legislative fellow with the Appropriations Committee, be \npermitted the privilege of the floor during the remainder of the debate \non S. 735.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Kerrey. This amendment will correct what I believe \nto be an oversight in the authorization for Federal law enforcement. \nThe current antiterrorism bill, S. 735, while providing substantial \nfunding for some Federal law enforcement entities, overlooked the \nresponsibilities and jurisdictions of the U.S. Secret Service.\n  The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for the protection of the \nPresident of the United States, the Vice President of the United \nStates, and their families. The U.S. Secret Service is also responsible \nfor protecting Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates as well as \nany head of state visiting the United States. This vast cross \n[[Page S7736]] section of political entities, that fall within the \nprotective realm of the U.S. Secret Service, continues to attract the \ninterest of numerous terrorist and antigovernment organizations. Due to \nthe recent bombings of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City, the \nair intrusion of the White House, and the several shootings directed at \nthe White House, additional security measures have been instituted by \nthe Secret Service, while the funding levels have remained the same. \nOne of the most publicized and controversial security measures that was \ninstituted was the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic. \nThis, while being the most visible security enhancement was merely one \nof dozens that have been effected by the Secret Service without any \nincrease in their funding.\n  The Secret Service is in need of increased resources to cover \nexpenses in several areas: First, an increased presence of U.S. Secret \nService Uniform Division officers. These officers will reinforce the \ncurrent patrol capabilities and insure greater safety not only for the \nPresident, employees of the White House complex, and visiting \ndignitaries, but for the thousands of citizens who visit the White \nHouse and our monuments on a daily basis. The Secret Service also needs \nto increase their personnel levels within their intelligence branch as \nwell as their protective details. And finally, several of the physical \nand technological security features of the White House need to be \nupgraded to deal with the increased and organized threats emanating \nfrom these terrorist entities.\n  The U.S. Secret Service has been recognized as the preeminent law \nenforcement agency in the world for its protective expertise. This \nfunding will help insure that these capabilities are not diminished, \nand their vital mission is not impeded due to a lack of funding.\n  Mr. KERREY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee is, I guess, deciding how, when, and under what circumstances \nto respond to the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska, I just want \nto bring the Senate, and particularly the Democrats, up to date.\n  I would like every Democrat who has an amendment to come to the floor \nas soon as they can or communicate to the Cloakroom whether or not they \nintend to go forward with their amendment and if we can enter into a \ntime agreement on their amendment, if they insist on going forward.\n  I will say, and I have been discussing this with the Republican \nmanager of the bill, that we have narrowed the list of amendments even \nfurther and we have gotten time agreements on 80 percent of the \namendments on the Democratic side that are left. The longest request \nfor any time on an amendment is 2 hours. Most are in the range of 20 to \n30 minutes. So we are making significant progress.\n  There are three Senators who are ready to move on amendments that \nhave short time agreements. Senator Kennedy has agreed to a 30-minute \ntime agreement on his first amendment; Senator Bradley, who is to go \nnext if we can work that out, has agreed to, I believe it is a 20-\nminute time agreement. This is being typed up now. But this is to give \nsome people notice for planning purposes.\n  Senator Bradley has agreed to 30 minutes on his amendment \ncharacterized as relating to cop-killer bullets. Senator Kennedy has \nagreed to 20 minutes on his amendment that is characterized as relating \nto multiple gun purchases; and Senator Lautenberg has agreed to 1 hour \nequally divided on his civilian marksmanship amendment.\n  It is my hope that when we dispose of the Kerrey amendment, which I \nhope will occur very shortly; that we can agree to take up those \namendments under such time agreement--I am not asking unanimous consent \nfor that now; that is being checked in the Republican Cloakroom--and \nthen I can assure my colleagues on the Democratic side, we have \nadditional amendments we are prepared to go to with very short time \nlimits. It is still my hope and expectation that we can finish this \nbill or come perilously close to finishing this bill tonight.\n  In the meantime, while the Republican Cloakroom is determining \nwhether or not such a unanimous-consent request would be in order for \nthe next three amendments, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to speak to my amendment \nrather than have a quorum call if it is agreeable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Fine. Mr. President, I think that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nMyers and Lauren Cohen, fellows in my office, be granted the privilege \nof the floor during the pendency of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                    assisting local law enforcement\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment is designed to assist law \nenforcement officials in tracking the incidence of multiple handgun \npurchases. The stockpiling of weapons is at the heart of the terrorist \nthreat to the country, and this amendment is a needed step to help \naddress the problem.\n  Under current law, when an individual purchases more than one handgun \nin a 5-day period, the gun dealer from whom the weapons are purchased \nmust submit a multiple handgun purchase form to Federal, State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies. The requirement for this notification \nto State and local police was included in the law as part of the Brady \nbill substitute proposed by the majority leader, Senator Dole. \n  Under this provision in current law, however, State and local police \nare required to destroy the records after 20 days. As a result, the \nnotification system is largely useless to State and local authorities. \nIn 20 days, it is impossible to detect the purchasing patterns which \nmight indicate that particular individuals or groups are stockpiling \nweapons, amassing arsenals, or engaging in illegal guntrafficking.\n  My amendment eliminates the requirement that these important records \nbe destroyed. There is no reason to handicap the police by requiring \nthem to destroy information that can help prevent or solve crimes, \nespecially terrorist crimes. As under existing law, the information \nprovided to the police will remain confidential and will be used only \nfor legitimate law enforcement purposes.\n  There are obvious law enforcement needs for this information, \nespecially in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and the disclosures \nthat some militant groups have been acquiring weapons at an alarming \nrate. According to Daniel Welch, director of the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter's Klanwatch, ``[t]here has been an arms race within the white \nsupremacy movement as to who can stockpile the most weapons.'' In \naddition, some anti-Government militia groups are also racing to \nacquire weapons for the avowed purpose of engaging in combat with the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  According to the Anti-Defamation League, ``[t]hese militia members \nare not talking about change from the ballot box alone, many are \nenamored of the prospect of change through bullets, explosives, and \nheavy armaments.''\n  Recent law enforcement investigations demonstrate the extent to which \nmilitias are arming themselves:\n  A decade ago, in 1985, FBI agents discovered a compound owned by the \nCovenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, a paramilitary \nsurvivalist group operating along the Missouri/Arkansas border. The \ngroup's literature demonstrated it to be strongly anti-Semitic, and its \nleaders believed they were preparing troops for the coming war through \nparamilitary training. In the raid, agents seized hundreds of weapons, \nbombs, an antitank rocket, and quantities of cyanide apparently \nintended to poison the water supply of a city.\n  In 1993, law enforcement officials discovered at least 6 separate \nweapons arsenals and 13 separate explosives arsenals linked to militant \nextremist groups across the country.\n  In July 1994, Federal authorities found 13 guns, homemade silencers, \nexplosives, blasting caps, fuses, and hand grenades belonging to James \nRoy Mullins, the founder of an anti-Government militia group in \nVirginia. [[Page S7737]] \n  In September 1994, three members of the Michigan Militia were stopped \nby police for a routine traffic violation. Inside the car, police \ndiscovered three military assault rifles, three semi-automatic \nhandguns, a revolver, 700 rounds of armor-piercing ammunition, and \nseveral knives and bayonets. All of the firearms were loaded. And \nhandwritten notes found in the car indicated that the militia members \nwere conducting surveillance of local police departments.\n  Militia members have been shown on television marching with rifles, \nbut they have not limited their arsenals to such weapons. According to \nthe Treasury Department, anti-Government militias have acquired a wide \narray of weapons including .22 caliber, .45 caliber, and 9mm pistols, \n.357 revolvers, and a variety of military-style assault weapons.\n  There are some who say that militias are harmless. Some ask why the \nGovernment should care if some citizens want to spend their weekends \nmarching in the woods wearing camouflage fatigues as a hobby.\n  The answer is that not all militias are harmless. The events in \nOklahoma City and elsewhere has focused public attention on a small \ngroup of Americans who are convinced that the Federal Government is the \nenemy and who may be preparing to wage war against the Government. \nThese groups pose a terrifying threat to Federal agents, Federal \nworkers, and other law-abiding citizens. We cannot afford to ignore \nthat threat.\n  As a result of lax Federal gun laws, it is relatively easy for anti-\nGovernment extremist groups to stockpile arsenals of massive \ndestructive power. Many of the semiautomatic handguns and revolvers \nrecovered from these extremists are legally available at gunshops and \ngun shows. We do not have Federal licensing or registration \nrequirements in this country. It is perfectly legal for anyone except \nfelons and the mentally ill to possess hundreds or thousands of guns.\n  I believe we should have tougher, more sensible gun laws, but I do \nnot seek to accomplish that goal on this bill. This amendment does not \nprohibit the manufacture or prohibit the manufacture or possession of \nany guns. It does not ration guns, as the NRA has falsely charged. \nLegitimate sportsmen and gun collectors have absolutely no reason to \nfear this amendment.\n  It builds on the recordkeeping requirement so that local law \nenforcement agencies will not be required to destroy potentially useful \nrecords after 20 days. In light of recent events, this amendment is a \nreasonable step to permit the police to keep track of individuals or \ngroups in a community who may be stockpiling weapons or engaging in \nillicit gun-trafficking.\n  This amendment is a necessary measure in the battle against terrorism \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is supported by 47 police chiefs, \nincluding the police chief of Oklahoma City, Sam Gonzales. And I have \nother letters of support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the police chiefs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                       Senate Office Building,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and \n     the recent shootings of police officers around the country, \n     we, as police chiefs who are sworn to protect the public and \n     our officers, strongly urge your support for the following \n     four amendments to the upcoming anti-terrorism bill:\n       Cop-killer bullets.--This amendment, to be offered by \n     Senator Bradley, will prohibit ``cop-killer'' bullets based \n     on a performance standard rather than the physical \n     composition of the bullet, as current law requires.\n       Multiple handgun sale forms.--This amendment, to be offered \n     by Senator Kennedy, will allow local law enforcement to keep \n     a record of multiple handgun sales rather than destroy the \n     forms, as current law requires.\n       Guns for felons.--This amendment, to be offered by Senators \n     Lautenberg and Simon, will permanently close the current \n     loophole that allows some violent felons to regain their \n     right to possess firearms.\n       National Firearms Act.--This amendment, to be offered by \n     Senator Boxer, will increase the statute of limitations for \n     violations of the National Firearms Act from three to five \n     years.\n       These amendments are designed to close current loopholes in \n     federal law. They will provide enforcement with additional \n     tools to apprehend violent offenders, vigorously prosecute \n     them and combat crime on our streets.\n       We strongly urge you to demonstrate your unwavering \n     commitment to the protection of law enforcement and the \n     safety of all Americans by supporting these public safety \n     measures.\n           Sincerely,\n       Chief Jerry Sanders, San Diego, CA.\n       Colonel Clarence Harmon, St. Louis, MO.\n       Chief Louis Cobarruviaz, San Jose, CA.\n       Chief Anthony D.

Hurtt, Oxnard, CA.\n       Chief Norm Stamper, Seattle, WA.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is interesting that there is the \nrequirement in the legislation that, after 20 days, the records must be \ndestroyed. All this amendment does is to vitiate that particular \nprovision. It is not a requirement that they maintain them. All this \ndoes is eliminate the requirement that they must be destroyed. We have \nseen in many instances where our law enforcement people have been out-\ngunned by various gangs and other groups in many of the cities of this \ncountry, which in many instances are free-fire zones. We have seen the \nwhole pattern of multiweapon purchases. This is a very modest but \nimportant law enforcement tool needed to determine the stockpiling and \nthe caching of various weapons.\n  I will mention here an excellent letter of support from Paul Evans, \nour police commissioner in Boston.\n  It says:\n\n       I am writing to express support for your proposal to help \n     local police departments track multiple gun purchases. Like \n     many other cities in the Northeast, Boston is concerned about \n     interstate gun trafficking. For years now, an iron pipe has \n     existed on the east coast, with professional gun traffickers \n     buying large numbers of handguns, transporting them elsewhere \n     for illegal sale in States and communities with much tougher \n     gun laws.\n       In 1993, a study of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \n     Firearms found that 60 percent of the guns used in crimes in \n     Boston were purchased outside of Massachusetts.\n       The multiple handgun sale notification form can be one of \n     the most potent weapons in the fight against the illegal gun \n     trade. Two years ago, as part of the Brady bill, Congress \n     required Federally licensed gun dealers to send a copy of the \n     multiple sale form to local law enforcement officials in the \n     hope that local law enforcement officials would be armed with \n     the knowledge that could assist them in identifying illegal \n     gun traders.\n\n  We can remember from the debate on the Brady bill that there were \nthose who said what we want to do is find out whether those particular \nindividuals have committed a felony or violated the law. So let us \nshorten the time period that an individual or group has to wait, but \nlet us give the information to the local law enforcement. And within \nthat proposal is the requirement to destroy that information after 20 \ndays.\n  What we are finding out is, in local law enforcement, as well as \nState law [[Page S7738]] enforcement, as well as others who have a \nresponsibility in this area, that this requirement for the destruction \nof this information hinders their opportunity to make judgments about \nthe growth of the illegal gun trade.\n  I will continue with the Paul Evans letter.\n\n       Congress, unfortunately, requires local police to destroy \n     those forms within 20 days. Many gun traffickers, in an \n     effort to avoid suspicion, made several multiple purchases \n     over the course of several days and weeks, rather than one \n     large purchase of firearms. Can the amendment eliminate this? \n     In this case, it would allow the Boston police to develop \n     proactive policies around this information.\n\n  This is a viewpoint which is shared by the other police officials who \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is a simple concept. It is a needed provision, and \nI hope that we might have acceptance of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we brought this bill to the floor, and it \nhas taken a large effort to get it here. We have worked very hard with \nthe administration. We have worked with Senator Biden and the Justice \nDepartment, and the vast majority of this bill is agreed to. There \nseems to be one major contentious issue--and I think we can resolve \nthat by amendments one way or the other--and that happens to be the \nhabeas corpus provision, which the President called for last night. The \nPresident has called for us to pass this bill. He has called for us to \npass habeas corpus reform on this bill.\n  A while back, he did not feel he wanted it on this bill, but last \nnight he did call for it. It is the appropriate time to get it done.\n  I am disappointed to say that we are in the middle of making this a \ngun control bill. I hate to say it, but we are going to have another \nopportunity on the crime bill when it comes to the floor of debating \nthese gun issues. Why should we gum up the antiterrorism bill with a \nbunch of gun provisions?\n  When it comes to addressing our Nation's crime problems, the liberals \nin Congress and the media have proposed gun control. When the Nation \ncalls on us to get tough on criminals, the liberals drag out the \ncarcass of gun control. The fact is that when the going got tough, the \nliberals would embrace gun control over tough reform. That is nothing \nnew to us. What I find shocking here is that they would attempt to turn \nthis bipartisan, antiterrorism bill into an antigun bill, or into a \npolitical document.\n  We have worked hard to try to accommodate everybody on this bill. \nFrankly, I am amazed that some of my colleagues would use the tragic \nevents of Oklahoma City to push totally unrelated politically motivated \ngun control legislation.\n  I have worked long and hard to bring this bill to the floor, as I \nsaid. After the President's call for prompt action on meaningful \nterrorist legislation, we bypassed the normal committee process in \norder to ensure swift action. We still worked with Senator Biden, who \nhas worked well on this bill, the Department of Justice, other members \nof the Judiciary Committee, and other Members of the Congress.\n  We have incorporated almost all of President Clinton's legislative \nproposals. We have been in the front of efforts to provide assistance \nto the people of Oklahoma. I sought the counsel of the Oklahoma State \nattorney general, Drew Edmondson, who is a Democrat, who supports much \nof what we are doing here.\n  In fact, I have praised President Clinton for his leadership and the \neffectiveness of his Department of Justice in handling these issues \ninvolved in this matter.\n  In short, we endeavor to do what is right and the right thing in the \nwake of this atrocity at Oklahoma City. That is why I am so \ndisappointed that all of a sudden we are tearing down the spirit of \nbipartisanship, and even though some of the amendments sound \nreasonable, they are not in the eyes of a number of people on both \nsides of the aisle. I think it is becoming too partisan. We have worked \nhard on this. We have worked hard to try to cast a tough antiterrorist \nbill that delivers most of what the President has called for.\n  It appears that some here have spent the last several weeks again \ntrying to fiddle with the explicit rights of the Constitution. While I \nwas working to deliver the President his bill, some of the more liberal \npersuasion have been honing gun control designs they wished to wield in \ntheir ongoing onslaught against the second amendment rights of freedom, \nrights of honest, law-abiding citizens. There are two points of view on \nthe second amendment. The distinguished Senator from Delaware shares \none; I share the other.\n  My colleagues may think they have a good political issue on these gun \ncontrol issues, but I do not think they do. In the court of public \nopinion, gun control is a big loser. A new U.S. News & World Report \npoll shows 75 percent of all American voters believe that the \nConstitution guarantees them the right to own a gun. The poll found \nvoters are less willing today, even after Oklahoma City, to accept \nrestrictions on their constitutional rights in order to feel more \nsecure.\n  Rather than create schemes that are constitutionally questionable, \nthis body should concentrate on the real measures that will limit \nterrorist atrocities. These measures are outlined in this bill in great \ndetail.\n  I have to say they should not be part of an attempt to impose \nrestrictions on second amendment rights. We can agree and disagree on \nwhat those second amendment rights are. I tried to avoid this becoming \na gun fight as much as I possibly could, in the whole process, from \ncommittee to the floor and on the floor.\n  But now we have a series of amendments that are nothing more than \namendments to try to bring up the whole gun issue again on something \nthat needs to be passed now, that the President has asked we pass now, \nthat the majority leader has asked that we pass now, that the majority \nof Americans in this country would like to have passed.\n  I am concerned about it. I think both sides know that we have \nproblems on these issues. I hope that we can work on the things that we \nagree on and reserve the gunfights for the crime bill when it comes up \nand face them at that time.\n  It will come up. There will certainly be a crime bill, either before \nthe end of this year or next year. We are going to do everything we can \nto try to get that done.\n  In that regard, I want to personally express appreciation to Senator \nBiden for his efforts in trying to work with me on this issue, trying \nto get time agreements on these amendments. He is representing his side \nin a very responsible way. I personally appreciate it. I want him to \nknow that. Also, he has a great deal of knowledge in this area, and I \njust hope we can somehow or another break down the gun fights and get \nthem out of here and start working about antiterrorism and the real \nissues in antiterrorism and reserve the gun fights until the crime \nbill. Then we will all face them at that time.\n  I am prepared to do that at that time. I would like to get this bill \npassed by this evening, and even if we pass it in the Senate, we still \nhave to go to the House of Representatives. We may have to have a \nconference. We will have to bring it back. So we still have a fairly \ndetailed process to go through, regardless of what we do.\n  I would like to get away from these gun control fights and do what we \ncan on the antiterrorism bill, the way the President would like to have \nit done, and the way I think a vast majority of Senators believe it \nshould be done and has been done.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Delaware.\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it was clear to everyone when habeas \ncorpus was added to this bill--which was never intended originally to \nbe part of this bill--that a lot of issues that were contentious ought \nto be raised.\n  We would be better off if we had no amendments on this. It was clear \nit was not going to happen. Everybody knew these amendments were \ncoming. We got a unanimous-consent agreement limiting the number of \namendments before we left to go home for our home period a couple weeks \nago.\n  I, quite frankly, sought the forbearance of my Democratic colleagues. \nThere are only four amendments out of all the amendments that relate in \nany way to guns. Of those four amendments, the four sponsors of those \n[[Page S7739]] amendments have agreed to use a total of 190 minutes, an \nhour and a half.\n  I have proposed a time agreement. I certainly hope the Republicans \nwill not filibuster this bill. I hope they will not enter into the mode \nthat I have been arguing with Democrats not to enter into.\n  There are several Democrats who feel very strongly about habeas \ncorpus. I have gotten an agreement that we will limit the amount of \ntime on the five habeas corpus amendments that are out there. We have \nagreed on this side, even though several Members find the habeas corpus \nprovision in this terrorism bill so repugnant that they may not be able \nto even vote for the bill, they have agreed to a time agreement, and \nthey have agreed, in turn, therefore, not to filibuster or delay this \nbill.\n  I hope that my Republican friends will not filibuster the bill, \neither. The way to deal with this is Senator Kennedy agreed to 20 \nminutes equally divided on his amendment. He has made his statement. \nAll we have to do is agree to 10 minutes in response to the statement \nand vote.\n  We can do the same thing with regard to the Lautenberg amendment, the \nsame thing with regard to the Kohl amendment, and the same thing with \nregard to the Bradley amendment. That is a totality of the amendments \narguably related to firearms. One relates to cop killer bullets, one \nrelates to multiple gun purchases and recordkeeping, one to the \ncivilian marksmanship program, and one relates to the gun-free school \nzone which passed here almost unanimously. The Supreme Court concluded \nthat it was not constitutional. It has been altered and reintroduced. \nThat was overwhelmingly passed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the problem is we have a lot of nongermane \namendments that do not belong in this bill, and there are people on \nthis side who do not want them.\n  Frankly, we have a cloture vote tomorrow morning, and nobody will \nfilibuster it on this side. There is a feeling over here by some that \nwe have a bunch of nongermane amendments that gum up this bill, and we \nmay have to wait until cloture tomorrow on some of those amendments.\n  Maybe we can move ahead on some that are germane, like the habeas \namendments. They are germane. Habeas is a big part of this bill. We \nhave kept all the gun fight amendments away on our side because we want \nto pass the President's terrorism bill. The President of the United \nStates has called for habeas corpus in this bill. We are going to give \nit to him if we can. I believe we can.\n  Now we are getting into extraneous matters that are not even germane \nto antiterrorism, are not germane to this bill, that should not be in \nthis bill, that could be brought up on any number of following pieces \nof legislation and be germane, especially the crime bill, and the only \npurpose is to make this bill a more political exercise than it should \nbe.\n  I would like to worry a little bit more about these victims of the \nOklahoma bombing and others who are potentially victims if we do not do \nsomething about this antiterrorism legislation as quickly as we can.\n  Now, nobody wants to filibuster this bill, but by gosh, if we have to \ngo to cloture to establish that we are not going to gum this bill up \nwith a bunch of extraneous, nonbipartisan, nongermane, inappropriate \namendments for this, then I do not know if I can stop that.\n  I am willing to proceed on germane amendments. I suggest we spend the \nrest of the day working on all the germane amendments that we can, and \ngo forward.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the way that translates to me is that the \nRepublicans have concluded they are not going to allow Senators \nKennedy, Lautenberg, Kohl, or Bradley to have a vote on their \namendments.\n  I understand that. I am a big boy. I understand how that works, if \nthat is what they have decided to do. To suggest that we wait until \ncloture, by definition, cloture means these would not be in order.\n  Now, every single bill that I know of that we ever pass through this \nplace has nongermane amendments on it. I cannot think of one off the \ntop of my head that does not have nongermane amendments on it. That is \nthe practice.\n That is the practice. That is the rule. That is the way we proceed. \nAnd the theoretical reason for cloture is that people are taking too \nmuch time on this bill.\n\n  I have time agreements on all these amendments. Before the next half-\nhour is up, every Democratic amendment on any subject that is in this \nbill, we can get a time agreement on. We can settle this thing tonight. \nWe can get this done.\n  I thought the reason for cloture was worry on the part of the \nmajority leader that we would never get to a final vote on this bill. I \nam telling you I can get a time agreement on all of the Democratic \namendments. We can get to a vote on this bill tonight.\n  But what I am being told here is, we can only get to a vote on this \nbill tonight if we only vote on the things the Republicans want to vote \non. That is what this translates to.\n  I understand that. I accept that. But let us understand what we are \ntalking about here. This is not about delay. Democrats are willing to \nvote. We are willing to give time agreements. On this amendment, the \nSenator spoke for 10 minutes. Ask for 10 minutes and then vote. If they \ndo not even want to respond--vote.\n  We are ready to vote. This is not about delay. This is about the \nRepublicans wishing to dictate what they will and will not allow to be \noffered as an amendment on a bill. I understand that. That is their \nright. I do not quarrel with that right. But let us make this thing \nreal clear. That is what it is about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Was the Senator familiar with the Hatch resolution for \nSenator Brown, dealing with terrorism and the peace process in Northern \nIreland? It is a sense-of-the-Senate about the parties involved in the \npeace process in Northern Ireland and a report on Northern Ireland.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the other provisions, even in the Hatch \nsubstitute, that talk about the conditions of eligibility for States \nbeing able to receive any funding under this? There is the requirement \nthat, in terms of certain DNA analysis, testing be done by the Director \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It may be very worthwhile. But \nthat is another measure that has been included. I could go on.\n  I want to just ask the Senator if he would not agree with me that the \nissue of availability and the proliferation of military-style weapons \nthat are available to the citizens is an active threat to the security \nof the American citizens? I will be glad to either spend some time in \nreviewing that, or I will be glad to follow the urgings of our ranking \nminority member and put those in the Record in order that we can move \nthe process forward. But does not the Senator believe that the issue of \nthe vast proliferation of weapons and their accumulation by various \nmilitia groups certainly has as much to do with the issue of potential \ndanger to the American citizen's security as some of these other items \nI mentioned?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I can respond to the Senator's basic question, there \nare a number of items in this bill, amendments we have already \naccepted, amendments we have debated and voted on--some defeated, some \nnot--that are nongermane in a technical sense, like the gun amendments \nare nongermane.\n  What this is all about is they only want their nongermane amendments. \nThey want to be able to dictate to all of us what we can and cannot \noffer on this amendment. Who is to say whether or not it is any more \nrelevant to terrorism that you have a habeas corpus provision in this \nbill or whether it is more relevant to have a provision like the one \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is suggesting? That is a judgment call. \nThat is a judgment call.\n  I think we should not delay in this. Again, I made a commitment to \nthe leader, the Republican leader, that I would implore the Democrats \nto reduce their number of amendments and to enter into time agreements. \nWe have done that. We have done that. So we can get to what his \nobjective is, the telecommunications bill, tomorrow. We are able to do \nthat. [[Page S7740]] \n  We have spent, now, an hour talking about whether or not we can \nproceed. We could have already disposed of my colleague's amendment and \nthe Bradley amendment by now. They would be over, finished, either in \nthe bill or out. And I have a feeling, unless I count incorrectly--\nalthough I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts--I have a feeling \nhe would be out if they let us vote on this just because of the way the \nvotes have stacked up.\n  But this is not about moving the bill along. This is about several \nRepublican Senators wishing to filibuster indirectly this bill by not \nallowing my colleague to introduce his amendment, or the other three \namendments, for which we have time agreements if they would agree.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, is the Senator aware that \nthere are 47 police chiefs across the country who have urged the \nSenate, from their point of view, to accept this amendment that they \nbelieve is important, and also that the language, which is included, \nwas basically the majority leader's language to have preservation of \nthese records up to 20 days and then have them eliminated? The Senator \nis probably aware that it has been the judgment of law enforcement \nofficials, now, that the 20 days is too short and the longer period of \ntime would serve the security of American citizens. I wonder why we are \nnot prepared to move forward. We could accept this amendment, I would \nwelcome the opportunity to do so, and to move on to the other items.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Biden and I have been through this \nbefore. We might feel differently about things. We want to pass a bill. \nWe know how important it is. But some on the other side desperately \nwant to make this a gun fight and frankly we have done everything on \nour side to keep it out of there. Habeas is one reason why our side is \nwilling to keep it out of it, because they recognize that for the first \ntime in years in this country we can correct the habeas corpus problem \nin this country, of incessant liberal appeals--incessant frivolous \nappeals. To make a long story short, that should not be allowed.\n  I have a letter here from President Clinton. President Clinton knows \nI have been trying to accommodate him. He knows I have done everything \nI possibly can to try to accommodate him on this bill, even though he \nhas had to be dragged along on habeas corpus, he now admits he wants \nthat in this bill.\n  I hope the people on the other side, who are of the same persuasion \nand party, would support the President. But there is nothing in this \nletter, three-page letter, single-spaced, from the President, where he \nsuggests what he wants in this bill--that we are trying to solve and we \ncan meet every one of those problems, it seems to me, one way or the \nother--there is nothing in here about making this into a gun fight or \nmaking it into a fight over gun control.\n  I have to say I am very concerned about it because I want this bill \nto pass. The vast majority of it I believe is acceptable to virtually \neverybody in this body. The few things that are controversial I think a \nvast majority will support. I believe the President will support this \nbill and he will sign it into law.\n  Here we are, spinning our wheels, talking about gun control. That \ncould be brought up on the crime bill where it should be brought up. It \nshould not be used to delay this bill because these folks on the other \nside know that there are folks on this side who cannot allow the right \nto keep and bear arms to be diminished by some of these gun control \namendments, as seemingly simple as some of them seem, as complex as \nthey really are.\n  I have to say personally I would be willing to meet anything on this \nbill. But I have to live within constraints, too. I am calling on my \ncolleagues to get rid of the gun control amendments or else let us go \nto cloture and let us get rid of them that way. Because they are not \ngermane.\n  We have been on this bill 3 days. We have had five amendments that we \nhave disposed of in 3 days. Now we are in the middle of a gun control \nfight instead of passing what needs to be done, and that is the day \nafter the people from Oklahoma, who pinned this ribbon on me that I am \nwearing in honor and memoriam because of what happened there--the day \nafter they came and said pass this bill the way it is.\n  As you can see, I am worked up but I have to say I understand the \nsincerity on the part of some on the other side. I respect that. I \nunderstand the sincerity on the part of my friend from Massachusetts. I \nrespect it, especially in his case. He and I both know what suffering \nis all about.\n  I expect him to bring these amendments to the floor, but not on this \nbill. His amendment is probably less offensive to some on our side than \nsome of the others that are going to be brought here, mainly because we \ndo not want to see this bill turned into a gun control fight when we \nhave people out there in this country who are just waiting to commit \nmore terrorist acts and when we all know that we should act. We all \nknow we ought to do what we can to try to bring some peace and solace \nto those who suffered in Oklahoma City as well as others in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I write to renew my call for a tough, \n     effective, and comprehensive antiterrorism bill, and I urge \n     the Congress to pass it as quickly as possible. The Executive \n     and Legislative Branches share the responsibility of ensuring \n     that adequate legal tools and resources are available to \n     protect our Nation and its people against threats to their \n     safety and well-being. The tragic bombing of the Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19th, the latest \n     in a disturbing trend of terrorist attacks, makes clear the \n     need to enhance the Federal government's ability to \n     investigate, prosecute, and punish terrorist activity.\n       To that end, I have transmitted to the Congress two \n     comprehensive legislative proposals: The ``Omnibus \n     Counterterrorism Act of 1995'' and the ``Antiterrorism \n     Amendments Act of 1995.'' In addition, the Senate has under \n     consideration your bill, S. 735, the ``Comprehensive \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995.'' I understand that a \n     substitute to S. 735, incorporating many of the features of \n     the two Administration proposals, will be offered in the near \n     future. I also understand that the substitute contains some \n     provisions that raise significant concerns. We must make \n     every effort to ensure that this measure responds forcefully \n     to the challenge of domestic and international terrorism. I \n     look forward to working with the Senate on the substitute and \n     to supporting its enactment, provided that the final product \n     addresses major concerns of the Administration in an \n     effective, fair, and constitutional manner. The bill should \n     include the following provisions.\n       Provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for any \n     international terrorist attack that might occur in the United \n     States, as well as provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over \n     terrorists who use the United States as the place from which \n     to plan terrorist attacks overseas.\n       Provide a workable mechanism to deport alien terrorists \n     expeditiously, without risking the disclosure of national \n     security information or techniques and with adequate \n     assurance of fairness.\n       Provide an assured source of funding for the \n     Administration's digital telephony initiative.\n       Provide a means of preventing fundraising in the United \n     States that supports international terrorist activity \n     overseas.\n       Provide access to financial and credit reports in \n     antiterrorism cases, in the same manner as banking records \n     can be obtained under current law through appropriate legal \n     procedures.\n       Make available the national security letter process, which \n     is currently used for obtaining certain categories of \n     information in terrorism investigations, to obtain records \n     critical to such investigations from hotels, motels, common \n     carriers, and storage and vehicle rental facilities.\n       Approve the implementing legislation for the Plastic \n     Explosives Convention, which requires a chemical in plastic \n     explosives for identification purposes, and require the \n     inclusion of taggants--microscopic particles -- in standard \n     explosive device raw materials which will permit tracing of \n     the materials post-explosion.\n       Expand the authority of law enforcement to fight terrorism \n     through electronic surveillance, by expanding the list of \n     felonies that could be used as the basis for a surveillance \n     order; applying the same legal standard in national security \n     cases that is currently used in routine criminal cases for \n     obtaining [[Page S7741]] permission to track telephone \n     traffic with ``pen registers'' and ``trap and trace'' \n     devices; and authorizing multiple-point wiretaps where it is \n     impractical to specify the number of the phone to be tapped \n     (such as when a suspect uses a series of cellular phones).\n       Criminalize the unauthorized use of chemical weapons in \n     solid and liquid form (as they are currently criminalized for \n     use in gaseous form), and permit the miliatry to provide \n     technical assistance when chemical or biological weapons are \n     concerned, similar to previously authorized efforts involving \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Make it illegal to possess explosives knowing that they are \n     stolen; increase the penalty for anyone who transfers a \n     firearm or explosive materials, knowing that they will be \n     used to commit a crime of violence; and provide enhanced \n     penalties for terrorist attacks against all current and \n     former Federal employees, and their families, when the crime \n     is committed because of the official duties of the federal \n     employee.\n       In addition, the substitute bill contains a section on \n     habeas corpus reform. This Administration is committed to any \n     reform that would assure dramatically swifter and more \n     efficient resolution of criminal cases while at the same time \n     preserving the historic right to meaningful Federal review. \n     While I do not believe that habeas corpus should be addressed \n     in the context of the counterterrorism bill, I look forward \n     to working with the Senate in the near future on a bill that \n     would accomplish this important objective.\n       I want to reiterate this Administration's commitment to \n     fashioning a strong and reffective response to terrorist \n     activity that preserves our civil liberties. In combatting \n     terrorism, we must not sacrifice the guarantees of the Bill \n     of Rights, and we will not do so. I look forward to working \n     with the Congress toward the enactment of this critical \n     legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not want to lecture to my colleagues \non the other side. They all are sincere. They all have their own ideas. \nBut I think it is time for them to start supporting their President. \nThey ought to get behind President Clinton on this issue and, as tough \nas it is, they ought to pass this bill because we have tried to \naccommodate the President in every way. I am sure there may be some \nthings where we still are in disagreement but by and large we have put \nthings in here that I would just as soon--that I would just as soon not \nhave in here. There are some other amendments we are probably willing \nto accept that are germane, that will make a difference here. We are \nwilling to work on it on this side and get it done. But nobody is \ntrying to delay this bill except those who are trying to make it a gun \ncontrol fight.\n  I would not mind that if this was the only vehicle that they could \nmake a gun control fight over. I have to say, I would still mind it \nbecause it is important that we pass this bill. It is important that we \npass it now. It is important that we do what we can against terrorism \nin this country. But they have all kinds of future legislation from the \nJudiciary Committee if they want to use that or any other legislation \nthat they can make into a gun control fight if they want to. But they \nshould not do it on this bill. They should not do it on this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for yielding. Let me \nsay this in all due respect to the chairman, who has obviously worked \nalmost since the day of the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City to address \nthe wishes of our President and our majority leader and a great many of \nAmerica's citizens to change around some of our laws and strengthen \nthem so that innocent people, hopefully, could be protected prior to a \ncriminal element in our society doing what they did and a tragedy \nresulting.\n  I and others have watched very closely as the staff of the Judiciary \nCommittee has assembled this legislation from the principles the \nPresident laid down and from the principles the majority leader laid \ndown so that no civil liberties in this country would be trampled. I \ncan say that Senator Hatch in due caution has approached this in a way \nto assure that would not happen. He has now just put into the Record a \n10-point letter of May 25 from the President establishing the \nprinciples that the President thought were necessary in antiterrorist \nlegislation.\n  None of those principles embody the four or five amendments that at \nthe last moment are trying to be crammed into this bill. They are \nprimarily gun control amendments. They are primarily amendments that \nwould trample all over the feet of second-amendment-right citizens who \nare law abiding in every respect.\n  I thought we were after the criminal element until I saw that nasty \nword of ``politics'' slivering into the back door of this critical \npiece of legislation. And that is wrong, Mr. President. That should not \nbe allowed to happen. In fact, I and others cannot allow it to happen. \nWe support this legislation because we believe America needs it and \nwants it. And we think that many elements of it will work toward trying \nto deter, before a tragic event like Oklahoma City or the Tower \nbombings were to happen, the kind of surveillance and intelligence that \nis necessary to try to block something like that from happening. But we \nnow know the rest of the story, and it is going to be, unless we stop \nthe politics as usual.\n  So I am saying at this moment to my leader, let us honor our \nPresident in this instance and, if we cannot bring the bill down, if we \ncannot arrive at a bill that is workable, bring it down, or appeal to \nthe Democrats in this Chamber who support their President and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and in all fairness the minority \nleader of that committee, who I do not believe has authored any of \nthese amendments, to get this resolved and get on with the business of \nthe Senate, and say to the American people, ``We have addressed your \nconcerns and needs as addressed by this President and the majority \nleader of the U.S. Senate in a clean, clear criminal bill, not a bill \nthat begins to trample on the ragged edge of the civil liberties of an \nawful lot of citizens in this country.''\n  I will object to any effort to propose a unanimous consent, whether \nit is in the guise of limiting time, all in the name of comity. That is \nnot comity at all. That is called politics in the rawest form. We \ndecided after Oklahoma City that this ought not be politics as usual. \nIt would be unfair to the citizens of our country, and it would be \nunlike the nature of the Congress of the United States in light of a \ndramatic human tragedy of the kind that occurred in Oklahoma City to \nplay politics. And we walked away from that opportunity, and the \nJudiciary Committee, under Orrin Hatch's leadership, stayed away from \nit and produced a bill that was critical to our country.\n  The President did not originally agree with habeas corpus. But last \nnight he said on the Larry King Show, and I quote:\n\n       And that ought to be done in the context of this terrorist \n     legislation.\n\n  This President recognizes the importance of this legislation, and he \nis willing to bend a bit. Tragically enough, his own Senators are not.\n  So I appeal to his Democrat Senators at this time to support their \nPresident, to support a quality piece of work coming from the Judiciary \nCommittee that has avoided the very concern that many of us have had \nabout trampling on the edge, if not boldly in the center of some of the \ncivil liberties of the citizens of this country. We ought to be able to \ndo that, and we can do that, and we have done it before in times of \nnational crises, to adhere to our constitutional responsibility while \nat the same time strengthening the fiber of our society and in a way \nthat it could disallow, cause to be avoided, or stopped from happening \nthe kinds of tragedies that occurred in Oklahoma City.\n  That is what we ought to be about today. That is what this chairman \nis trying to do, and that is what the majority leader is asking the \nU.S. Senate to do. Anything less than that, I hope the majority leader \nwould say enough is enough, because he has this President and the \nAmerican people on his side at this moment, on this issue. And \nobstructionism, in nature, as is now being laid down and as proposed is \nnot good legislating.\n  So I hope we can move in that direction. I hope we can resolve this \nissue. There are a lot of issues before the Senate that deserve to be \nresolved, and this one should be handled in a timely and appropriate \nfashion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n[[Page S7742]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened to the great eloquence of \nmy friends and colleagues on the other side. I do not know whether they \nunderstand what this is really all about. All it is saying is that the \nrequirement that exists now on local law enforcement to destroy their \nrecords of multiple sales of handguns after 20 days will not be in \neffect.\n  Why is that going to be such an impediment to the consideration of \nantiterrorism legislation? That is basically the amendment. I mean, \nwhat we have found is in the original Brady bill, the requirement that \nwas introduced by the majority leader said that in order to work out \nthe compromise at that particular time, there was going to be the \nrequirement of keeping those records for multiple purchases of handguns \nfor a period of 20 days. Now we find out from law enforcement officials \nthat they cannot police efficiently the wide purchasing practices of \nmany of those that are collecting these arsenals of handguns within \nthat 20-day period. All they are saying is just lift the requirement \nthat they have to destroy it--no requirement that they have to keep it, \njust lift the requirement that they have to destroy it. We hear, \n``Well, you are playing politics on this.'' This is politics.\n  Let me just review a little bit for the Members of the Senate some of \nwhat has been happening because of the accumulation. Also, I point out \nto our friends and colleagues who were talking about Oklahoma City that \nthis provision is supported by the police chief in Oklahoma City, and \n47 other police chiefs. The Oklahoma City police chief supports this. \nWe are being told that it is irrelevant, when you have the chief of \npolice in Oklahoma City and 47 others that said they want it on there. \nIt will do something about violence in our society, and the \naccumulation of weapons by various groups that are irresponsible in our \nsociety. We are told no, no. We are not going to even let you get a \nvote on it.\n  We said we would agree to a short time limit. It is not a very \ncomplicated issue. It is either can you vitiate that requirement that \nexists in law in 20 days or not? We can understand that. People can \nunderstand that very quickly. We do not need a long time to debate \nthat. We do not need a long time to debate cop-killer bullets. We \ndebated that issue at the time. But the majority said no, no; we are \nnot going to be able to do it.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader on the floor. I will just \ntake a few moments before yielding the floor to give some idea about \nwhat Members of this body know. But certainly, our American citizens \nought to be reminded of it. I refer to an excellent article from the \nAnti-Defamation League about the growth of weapons stockpiles in the \nvarious militias that are taking place across the country. I will \ninclude selected parts of it in the Record.\n  ``Civil war could be coming, and with it the need to shoot Idaho \nlegislators,'' so said Sam Sherwood, leader of the backwoods Idaho-\nbased U.S. Militia Association of March 2, 1995, after meeting with the \nIdaho Lieutenant Governor.\n  Sherwood amplified his views in a conversation with the Associated \nPress on Friday, March 10, 1995. According to the AP:\n\n       Sherwood believes that some Idaho lawmakers may . . . come \n     to Washington, DC, and, hence . . . ``the need to shoot \n     them,'' he said. ``Go up and look legislators in the face \n     because someday you may have to blow it off,'' Sherwood said.\n\n  Then they continue along.\n\n       ``Judges have been threatened with death, as have State \n     workers and even a State legislator's 7-year-old son. County \n     workers have been instructed to dive under their desks with a \n     telephone in hand if anyone storms their offices,'' reports \n     the Missoulaian.\n       According to one researcher, militia members on the \n     Internet ``at one point said they were going to march on \n     Washington and arrest Congress at gunpoint,'' and in fact an \n     alert was issued by a militia group which called not only for \n     the arrest of Members of Congress but also their ``trial for \n     treason by citizen courts.''\n       ``Blood will be spilled in the streets of America'', said a \n     militia leader. It is inevitable.\n       According to the Arizona Republic, ``Militia groups \n     obtained the names and home addresses of all Federal officers \n     in Mississippi, prompting U.S. agencies to post a nationwide \n     alert.''\n\n  According to the same article:\n\n       A Tennessee man who anticipated an armed battle with one-\n     world government amassed an arsenal. When local police pulled \n     up, he pulled a pistol on two officers, and one shot him in \n     the head.\n\n  On July 27, this in the same article:\n\n       James Roy Mullins, founder and member of a militia group \n     called the Blue Ridge Hunt Club, was arrested and charged \n     with the possession of a short-barreled rifle with \n     unregistered silencers, and facilitating the unlawful \n     purchase of a firearm. Ultimately, three other members were \n     also charged with firearm offenses. Federal officials said \n     Mullins had formed the club to arm its members in preparation \n     for war with the Government.\n\n  What are they arming themselves with? Guns. Guns.\n  On these issues, the group formed earlier in 1994 had as many as 15 \nmembers. They are said to have met three times before Mullins' arrest. \nWhile members of the group say that their purpose is to lobby against \ngun control laws, Federal law enforcement officials tell a much \ndifferent story. An ATF official who investigated the case said \nMullins' organization has a group of confederates to be armed and \ntrained in paramilitary fashion in preparation for armed conflict with \nGovernment authorities should firearms legislation become that \nrestrictive. Evidence of such preparation is substantial. In searches \nof members' homes and storage facilities, Federal agencies found a \nstockpile of weapons--a stockpile of weapons.\n This is just to be able to have information about who is stockpiling \nweapons and what groups are actually threatening Federal officials and \nhave demonstrated, at least in the tragic incident of Oklahoma, their \nwillingness and ability to use deadly force.\n\n  In Mullins' home, agents found 13 guns, several of which had homemade \nsilencers. They found explosives, hand grenades, fuses, and blasting \ncaps.\n  Even pretrial incarceration has not stopped Mullins from threatening \nviolence. While in jail, he wrote a letter to a friend saying that he \nwanted to borrow a machine gun in order to ``take care of unfinished \nbusiness'' with prosecution witnesses.\n  The strongest indication of the group's goal was the draft of a \nportion of a newsletter found on a computer disk obtained by Federal \nagents. ``Hit-and-run tactics will be our method of fighting. We will \ndestroy targets, such as telephone relay centers, bridges, storage \ntanks, radio towers, airports. Human targets will be engaged when it is \nbeneficial to the cause to eliminate particular individuals who oppose \nus--troops, police, political figures, snitches,'' et cetera.\n  In one particular rally that they had in Lakeland, FL, in October \n1994, there was distributed in large numbers at the rally a flier \nurging that ``All gunowners should fire a warning shot as a signal to \nthe Congress'' on November 11 at 11 p.m. ``Congress has failed to \nsafeguard the Bill of Rights * * * especially the second amendment.''\n\n       A warship will fire a warning shot across a bow, a \n     rattlesnake will sound off; these warnings are never ignored. \n     It is time to warn politicians that if they do not respect \n     the Bill of Rights, they should at least fear the wrath of \n     the people. Congress is forcing the country into a civil war.\n\n  Mr. President, all this amendment does is ensures that the reporting \nconditions do not have to be destroyed after 20 days. This does not say \nthe Federal Government goes out and takes away the arms. It does not \nrestrict people's right to own them. It does not restrict those \npeople's right to purchase. It does not restrict those individual's \nrights at all to multi-gun purchases. It does not restrict it at all.\n  All it says is the requirement that after 20 days, those who are \ngoing to sell those kinds of weapons do not have to destroy the record \nof who they sell them to. That is all. They no longer are mandated to \ndestroy the bill of sale, who they sold it to.\n  The question is why? And the answer is from those 47 police chiefs. \nThey believe that the maintenance of those can be an important and \nsignificant weapon in dealing with violence, existing violence and \npotential violence of the type at which this legislation is directed.\n  I daresay that this particular provision is as relevant as any other \nprovision that is before the Senate to deal with violence in our \nsociety. As I mentioned before, as Senator Biden has pointed out, we \nare prepared to enter into a time agreement. I am not going to take the \ntime of the Senate to review other provisions that have been \n[[Page S7743]] included, accepted and supported by other Members that \nhave virtually nothing to do with the fundamental issues of violence \nand terrorism, but the Members understand that and know it and the \nRecord reflects it.\n  This is dealing with an instrument which law enforcement officials \nbelieve can be extremely important and significant in helping to \nprotect American citizens. It is a simple concept to continue those \nkinds of records so that law enforcement, both local and State \nofficials, that are investigating crimes and violence will have an \nadditional tool to make these kinds of arrests and prosecutions and to \nkeep this country a safer place.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we would at least be given the opportunity \nto have a vote on this measure. I just point out this issue is not \ngoing to go away. I also take umbrage with the fact that we have been \non this for 2\\1/2\\ days. We spent this morning debating another gun \nissue where the majority could not decide whether they wanted to vote \nfor it, against it, or accept it. And then after they had their caucus, \nthey decided that they would go ahead and accept it.\n  I take umbrage with the fact that this is a desire to delay by any of \nus. The measures which have been debated have been extremely important. \nWe are prepared to cooperate with the managers in any way to get an \nearly resolution. But this matter is of importance to law enforcement \nofficials and to the safety and security of the American people. That \nis what this measure is about--terrorism. This amendment, a modest \namendment, ought to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it had been my hope following the policy \nluncheon that we would have a major shortening of the list of \namendments on the other side of the aisle. As I understand, there has \nbeen really no effort to limit the amendments, except they picked out \nfive or six amendments which are not germane and suggested time \nagreements on the nongermane amendments. I do not know the merits of \nthis amendment. It may be a very good amendment. I do not debate the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I do not believe it was suggested in the \nPresident's bill--in any of the President's bills. Again, the President \nsent me a letter on May 25 outlining his objectives for an \nantiterrorism bill. There is nothing with reference to this amendment \nin it.\n  The President did change. We had a vote on the taggants amendment \nyesterday. We accepted another gun amendment. I think what this has \nbecome is the Democrats are bringing up all the gun amendments they \nhave been keeping in their closet.\n  Mr. President, we are not going to play that game. I made the best \neffort I could to work with the White House in an effort to pass \nantiterrorism legislation, but the Democrats just insist they do not \nwant to do that. They do not want to pass antiterrorism legislation. \nThey have already forgotten what happened in Oklahoma City. They want \nto have a big debate out here, a big political debate to try to score a \nfew political points, and that is not going to happen.\n  If we want an antiterrorism bill, we will vote for cloture tomorrow \nmorning. If we do not, that is it, we will go on to telecommunications. \nThe majority is not going to play this game for the benefit of a few \nDemocrats who want to continue to try to make political points. It is \nalmost impossible to work with this White House when you have Democrats \nin the Senate not willing to work with the White House. How do they \nexpect Republicans in the Senate to work with the White House?\n  We are not going to play these games. We were told we were going to \nget a big list of amendments that were going to be eliminated. None has \nbeen eliminated. So I am going to suggest that we have a period for the \ntransaction of morning business for the next 45 minutes, and we are \ngoing to try to determine what is going to happen. If nothing is going \nto happen, then we will just recess for the day, have a cloture vote \ntomorrow, and if the Democrats vote against cloture, that is fine. I \nwant all of them to explain to the President why they did not support \nan antiterrorism bill, a bipartisan antiterrorism bill.\n  We began this bill on Thursday. We were delayed 1 day because the \nDemocrats had 60-some votes on the budget bill. We have had filibuster \nby amendment around here all year long, bill after bill after bill. \n``Oh, do not file cloture, we will just propose 50 or 60 amendments.'' \nWe had a record 32 votes in 1 day on amendments on everything they \ncould think of.\n  So we began on Thursday, and we were on it on Friday and Monday, and \nnow it is Tuesday. Now I understand they do not want to do anything \ntomorrow. They want to wait and get all these time agreements on habeas \ncorpus. Tomorrow is Wednesday. We are just eating into the August \nrecess day by day, and if nobody cares, it does not make any difference \nto this Senator, because I assume we will probably be here in any \nevent.\n  Either we are going to get cooperation on the other side of the aisle \nor we are going to pull the bill down. I think the best thing to do is \nwait and have a cloture vote. Stop playing the game. Let us have a \ncloture vote tomorrow morning, and if Members on that side want to \nsupport their President with an antiterrorism bill, they will vote for \ncloture. If they do not want to support their President, they will vote \nagainst cloture. It is all right with this Senator, but we will have \nkept our word with the President of the United States to deliver him an \nantiterrorism bill, not a bill with a lot of amendments on it to make a \npolitical point for somebody on the other side.\n  So I have just reached the limit of my patience on this particular \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7734-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, at this moment, several thousand United \nStates troops and their equipment are headed for Europe to positions \nnear Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tomorrow the Armed Services Committee will \nhold hearings on this deployment and U.S. policy. On Thursday the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee will also conduct hearings to learn \nabout current United States policy toward Bosnia.\n  These hearings are of critical importance--not only because of the \nseriousness of sending American ground forces into harm's way, but \nbecause of the continued confusion over U.S. policy.\n  Last Wednesday, at the Air Force Academy, the President stated, and I \nquote:\n\n       I believe we should be prepared to assist NATO if it \n     decides to meet a request from the United Nations troops for \n     help in a withdrawal or a reconfiguration and a strengthening \n     of its forces.\n\n  But, a few days later, in his weekly radio address, the President\n   stated that in addition to assisting in the withdrawal of UNPROFOR, \nthe United States may send ground troops in the ``highly unlikely \nevent'' that part of the U.N. force became ``stranded and could not get \nout of a particular place in Bosnia'' and need ``emergency \nextraction.'' The President added that such an emergency operation \nwould be ``limited and temporary.''\n\n  The first question each of the committees must ask is what is U.S. \npolicy today. Is it to help strengthen and reconfigure U.N. forces, or \nis it to assist in ``emergency extraction''? Furthermore, what is the \ndifference between reconfiguring forces and emergency extraction? What \nis the relationship between emergency extraction and total U.N. \nwithdrawal? Would such an extraction be a prelude to full withdrawal? \nIn other words, what is the mission of U.S. ground forces if they are \ndeployed for contingencies other than participating in a complete \nwithdrawal of U.N. forces.\n  Then the committees will need to turn to basic operational questions:\n  What is the NATO-U.N. relationship? When does NATO command begin? How \nfar does it extend--to all air and ground forces in Bosnia?\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\n  What is the command structure and its relationship with U.N. \ncommanders?\n  What are the rules of engagement? Are they robust?\n  What are the threats to our forces? How will they be addressed?\n  What is the estimated duration of the operation? Last August during \nDOD authorization conference former U.S. Envoy Chuck Redman told \nconferees that Pentagon estimates were that a withdrawal operation \nwould take 3 months--to include equipment. If the current plan \nanticipates a longer duration, why is that the case? If the duration is \nlengthy, is this because of demands by UNPROFOR contributors to take \nall of their equipment--not just lethal equipment? And will U.S. lives \nbe risked to save equipment?\n  With respect to emergency extraction operations, how are the terms \n``limited'' and ``temporary'' defined?\n  What will the United States role be in U.N. decisions which could \nlead to such emergencies, for example if Bosnian Serbs retaliate for an \nUNPROFOR action by overrunning Gorazde?\n  In addition, the committees will need to pursue the administration's \ndecision to provide close air support to the quick reaction force. \nReportedly, Secretary Perry has agreed to make helicopter gunships part \nof potential close air support operations for the quick reaction force. \nAC-130's, unlike our F-16's, fly slow and close to the ground--\ntherefore they are more vulnerable.\n  What actions will NATO take to suppress the threats posed by surface \nto air missiles [SAM's]?\n  When will such action be taken?\n  An American pilot was shot down by a SAM and is missing. Last \nDecember, Adm. Leighton Smith, our NATO Commander in Naples wanted to \ntake out Bosnian Serb SAM sites because of the threat they posed to \npilots patrolling the no-fly zone. But, NATO did not take out those \nSAMS because the U.N. commanders said ``no.'' Had NATO acted 6 months \nago, our pilot may not have been shot down. So the question now is, are \nwe going to send more Americans into harm's way without taking measures \nto reduce the risk?\n  On the diplomatic front, there are also many questions.\n  What is the diplomatic strategy with respect to Serbian President \nMilosevic? Are we sure there is a split between Milosevic and Radovan \nKaradzic, or is Milosevic playing good cop and Karadzic bad cop? If \nthere is a split how do we explain Milosevic's role in releasing some \nof the U.N. hostages? Has Milosevic been promised anything in return \nfor his assistance in securing the release of hostages? I understand \nthis afternoon there way be another 50 or so released.\n  Are we going to agree to lift most sanctions on Serbia in return for \nrecognition of Bosnia and what does recognition mean--really closing \nthe borders and cutting off supplies and military contact with the \nBosnian Serbs?\n  If we lift sanctions on Serbia now, how do we maintain any leverage \nover Serbian actions against the Alabanians in Kosova and Serbian \nsupport for militant separatists in Croatia?\n  Mr. President, I have not listed all of the questions that need to be \nasked at the hearings this week. Furthermore, these matters need to be \nplaced in a larger context--namely, what is the objective of these \nactions: Is it to remove U.N. forces or to keep them there? Are we \nserious about withdrawal or not? If not, why not?\n  This bigger picture should be the focus of administration \nconsultations with the Congress. We should not only be informed about \nNATO planning and operations. We should be engaging in a dialog about \nwhere we are going. Are we at last going to lift the unjust and illegal \narms embargo on Bosnia?\n  I believe that the United States has interests in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. As George Will said this week in\n Newsweek in response to the charge made by some that the United States \nhas no ``dogs in this fight,'' that, and I quote,\n\n       But those in the fight are not dogs and by the embargo we \n     have helped make the fight grotesquely unfair. What would be \n     the consequences on our national self-respect--our Nation's \n     soul--of a preventable Serbian victory followed by \n     ``cleansing'' massacres? Bosnian Serbs have seized 70 percent \n     of Bosnia but they are not a mighty military force and will \n     become even less so if the Serbian Government in Belgrade can \n     be pressured into leaving Bosnia's separatist Serbs isolated \n     in combat with a Bosnian army equipped at last with tanks and \n     artillery. The Serbs fighting in Bosnia are bullies led by \n     war criminals collaborating with a dictator. If we don't have \n     an interest in this fight, what are we?\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that we need to assist our NATO allies in \nthe event of U.N. withdrawal. However, I also believe that we need to \nrecognize that U.N. efforts in Bosnia have failed--failed to stop \naggression, failed to bring peace, and failed to protect the Bosnians.\n  The New Republic in its June 19 editorial states that, and I quote,\n\n       There is another Bosnian crisis this week. Not in Bosnia, \n     of course. In Bosnia things are the same, only more so. A \n     greater Serbia is slowly and steadily emerging by means of a \n     genocidal war. No, the crisis is taking place in the capitals \n     of the Western powers, which are finding it harder and harder \n     to escape the consequences of their policy of appeasement.\n\n  The European decision to create a quick reaction force [QRF] is in \nitself an admission of failure. The QRF is intended to protect \nUNPROFOR, not the Bosnians. And the very tasks the QRF envisions being \nengaged in, such as securing the Sarajevo Airport, are tasks that were \noriginally given to UNPROFOR by the U.N. Security Council. Therefore, \nthere is a real question of whether or not sending more forces--even \nwith more equipment--will do anything more than supply the Bosnian \nSerbs with more potential hostages.\n  The bottom line is that keeping UNPROFOR on the ground indefinitely \nwill not bring us to a solution in Bosnia. Indeed it will prevent a \nsolution by reinforcing the failed status quo. As the New Republic \npoints out, and I quote,\n\n       It cannot have escaped the notice of our policymakers that \n     the U.N. is providing cover for the Serbs, except that the \n     U.N. is providing cover for our policymakers, too. It saves \n     them from the prospect of action.\n\n  Mr. President, withdrawing the U.N. force is the first step away from \nfailure and toward a solution. I support United States participation, \nto include ground troops, in a NATO operation to withdraw U.N. forces \nfrom Bosnia provided certain conditions are met.\n  Therefore, sometime over the next few days I intend to introduce a \nresolution to authorize the President to use United States ground \nforces to assist in the complete withdrawal of U.N. forces from Bosnia \nunder the following conditions:\n  First, NATO command, from start to finish, no U.N.-NATO dual-key \narrangement;\n  Second, robust rules of engagement which provide for massive response \nto any provocation or attack on U.S. forces;\n  Third, no risking U.S. lives to rescue equipment; and\n  Fourth, prior agreement on next steps, to include lifting the arms \nembargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Mr. President, we need to support our allies. But we must make sure \nthat in so doing, we are neither prolonging a failed policy or leaping \ninto a quagmire. I believe that this resolution will provide the \nPresident with essential support of the Congress and will help put us \non the right policy track.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete article by \nGeorge Will and the article in the New Republic be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  ``A Dog in That Fight''? The Secretary of State, a Sweet Man Sadly \n                          Miscast, Is Puzzled\n                          (By George F. Will)\n       When Hitler sent Ribbentrop to Moscow in August 1939 to \n     sign the nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union, he sent \n     along his personal photographer with instructions to obtain \n     close-ups of Stalin's ear lobes. Hitler wondered whether \n     Stalin had Jewish blood and wanted to see if his ear lobes \n     were ``ingrown and Jewish, or separate and Aryan.'' This \n     historical nugget (from Alan Bullock's ``Hitler and Stalin: \n     Parallel Lives'') is offered at this juncture in America's \n     debate about Bosnia, as a reminder of a quality European \n     politics has sometimes had in this century. Some American \n     policymakers need to be reminded.\n       When Serbians took hostages from U.N. personnel in Bosnia \n     and chained them to military targets as human shields, Warren \n     Christopher was puzzled: ``It's really not part of any \n     reasonable struggle that might be going on there.'' While the \n     Secretary of State, a sweet man sadly miscast, searches for \n     reasonableness amid the Balkan rubble, there are \n     ``peacekeepers'' where there is no peace to be kept and \n     ``safe zones'' where slaughter is random. UNProFor (the U.N. \n     [[Page S7745]] Protection Force) is akin to the Holy Roman \n     Empire, which was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. The \n     U.N. force isn't forceful, so it needs more protection than \n     it offers.\n       This war has been misdescribed as Europe's first civil war \n     since that in Greece in the 1940s and the most portentous \n     civil war since republicans fought fascists in Spain in the \n     1930s. Actually, this war now churning into its fourth summer \n     is a war of Serbian aggression. It has been a war of \n     aggression since 1992, when the European Community recognized \n     Bosnia as a sovereign state, and since Bosnia became a member \n     of the United Nations. Perhaps Bosnia's inconvenient \n     existence is unfortunate, and perhaps Bosnia will yet be \n     sundered by partition. But it is a state and that is why Pat \n     Moynihan, carrying Woodrow Wilson's torch for international \n     law and collective security, says of Bosnia. ``Everything is \n     at stake here, if principle is everything.'' Says Moynihan, \n     if neither NATO nor the United Nations can summon the will to \n     cope with Serbia, ``what have we gone through the 20th \n     century for?'' We went through it because we had no choice, \n     but you know what he means: A century that began, in effect, \n     at the Somme and went downhill from there to Auschwitz is \n     ending with a wired world watching rape camps used in the \n     service of ``ethnic cleansing.'' All this 80 minutes by air \n     from Rome.\n       Europe's first war between nations since 1945 illustrates \n     an astounding fact: In this century of European fighting \n     faiths--communism, fascism, socialism, pan-Germanism, pan-\n     Slavism and more--the one hardest to extinguish turns out to \n     be the variant of fascism fueling the drive for Greater \n     Serbia. Like pure fascism it asserts the primacy of the \n     primordial and the goal of perfect national unity achieved by \n     the expulsion or murder of ``unassimilables.'' This explains \n     the violent Serbian loathing of Sarajevo, where Christians \n     and Muslims have peacefully coexisted. Hitler and Mussolini \n     thought they were defending old Europe against the modern \n     menace of Bolshevism. The Serbs think this is the year 732 \n     and they are with Charles Martel saving Christian Europe by \n     stopping the Moslem advance at Tours. Or it is 1529 and they \n     are stopping Suleiman at the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman \n     Empire is long gone, but the gunners in the hills surrounding \n     Sarajevo refer to their targets--civilians dashing from \n     doorway to doorway--as Turks.\n       Serbia is a raw reassertion of pre-modernity, the idea that \n     uniform ethnicity and shared myths are essential to a \n     political community. This war, which mocks the notion that \n     Europe has become a supranational society, began in 1992, the \n     year the Maastricht Treaty was signed, supposedly to make \n     ``Europe'' a truly political as well as geographical \n     expression. The United Nations, embodiment of the modern \n     aspiration of a morality of nations, has been no match for \n     Serbia. And the U.N.'s arms embargo against both sides--high-\n     minded, scrupulous neutrality between Serbian slaughterers \n     and their victims--has been a policy of gross immorality.\n       The embargo was imposed in 1991 against the whole of \n     disintegrating Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia disappeared the \n     embargo was continued. That favored Serbia, which had ample \n     weapons from the former Yugoslav army and had a large \n     armaments industry. Now the embargo violates the U.N. \n     Charter, which acknowledges every nation's ``inherent'' right \n     of self-defense. President Bush defended the embargo with a \n     flippancy about the problem in the Bakans not being an \n     insufficiency of weapons. Today defenders of the embargo say \n     it economizes violence because lifting it would prolong the \n     fighting. This argument is especially unpleasant when used by \n     the British, who today might be obeying German traffic laws \n     if Lend-Lease had not prolonged the fighting.\n       So far the NATO nations have insufficient political will to \n     impose a solution or use force to help restore the integrity \n     of Bosnia. The Serbs are what the NATO nations are not: \n     serious. The NATO nations want to end the game, the Serbs \n     want to win it. Other people with ancient animosities and \n     modern weapons are watching. It probably is not just \n     coincidental that Russian revanchism became bold regarding \n     Chechnya as the NATO nations became, through the embargo, \n     collaborators with Serbian irredentism. If the irredentism \n     goes unopposed when the UNProFor charade ends, the \n     irredentism will become, even more than it already is, \n     genocidal.\n       Secretary of State James Baker famously said of the Balkan \n     conflict, ``We don't have a dog in that fight.'' But those in \n     the fight are not dogs and by the embargo we have helped make \n     the fight grotesquely unfair. What would be the consequences \n     on our national self-respect--our nation's soul--of a \n     preventable Serbian victory followed by ``cleansing'' \n     massacres? Bosnian Serbs have seized 70 percent of Bosnia but \n     they are not a mighty military force and will become even \n     less so if the Serbian government in Belgrade can be \n     pressured into leaving Bosnia's separatist Serbs isolated in \n     combat with a Bosnian army equipped at last with tanks and \n     artillery. The Serbs fighting in Bosnia are bullies led by \n     war criminals collaborating with a dictator. If we don't have \n     an interest in this fight, what are we?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         The Abdication, Again\n\n       This year is the fiftieth anniversary of the United \n     Nations. The celebrations will go on and on, as politicians \n     make banal speeches to command-performance audiences. It is \n     unlikely that Bosnia will appear among their banalities. For \n     it is in Bosnia that the debility of the United Nations has \n     finally been revealed.\n       There is another Bosnian crisis this week. Not in Bosnia, \n     of course. In Bosnia things are the same, only more so. A \n     Greater Serbia is slowly and steadily emerging by means of a \n     genocidal war. No, the crisis is taking place in the capitals \n     of the Western powers, which are finding it harder and harder \n     to escape the consequences of their policy of appeasement. \n     The doves, you might say, are coming home to roost. And they \n     still don't get it. When the Serbs made hostages of hundreds \n     of United Nations troops last week, a spokesman for the U.N. \n     thundered that ``the Bosnian Serb army is behaving like a \n     terrorist organization.'' But the Bosnian Serb army is a \n     terrorist organization, unless you wish to include systematic \n     rape among the terms of military engagement. And the general \n     in command of the U.N. forces in Bosnia demanded of General \n     Ratko Mladic ``that he treat the United Nations soldiers in a \n     manner becoming a professional soldier.'' But General Mladic \n     is not a professional soldier. He is a man wanted for war \n     crimes.\n       Here is what happened last week. The Serbs moved heavy \n     weapons closer to Sarajevo and fired upon it. They have done \n     so before. NATO issued warnings. It has done so before. The \n     Serbs ignored the warnings. They have done so before. NATO \n     launched a trivial attack against a Serb position. It has \n     done so before. The Serbs responded by taking U.N. troops \n     hostage. They have done so before. The only thing that \n     changed last week, in short, was that the latent became \n     manifest. De facto hostages became de jure hostages.\n       Also the iconography of the conflict was enriched. There \n     have been many indelible images of the slaughter in Bosnia; \n     last week's pictures of the scattered limbs in the Tuzla cafe \n     were only the most recent ones. What was lacking, until last \n     week, were images of the West's weakness. Now we have those \n     photographs of those U.N. soldiers chained to those poles. \n     Not exactly a picture of a helicopter lifting off the roof of \n     an American embassy, to be sure; but surely a picture of our \n     humiliation, of the forces of order flouted, of the triumph \n     of tribalism over pluralism, of the lupine post-cold war \n     world in full swing. No amount of ``pragmatic neo-\n     Wilsonianism'' (the empty locution of Anthony Lake, who \n     prefers the devising of bold foreign policy rationales to the \n     devising of bold foreign policy) will erase these images of \n     Western impotence from the memories of warlords and \n     xenophobes around the world. They have been instructed that \n     this is their time.\n       Two conclusions are being drawn from the success of the \n     Serbs. The first is that the use of force has failed. ``The \n     Bosnian Serbs have now trumped our ace,'' as former Secretary \n     of State Lawrence Eagleburger told The Washington Post. \n     Eagleburger's pronouncement is utterly self-serving; the man \n     was one of the architects of American appeasement in the Bush \n     administration. Still, the Clinton administration will not \n     exactly recoil from an analysis that refuses to entertain the \n     serious use of real force. For this reason, it is important \n     to understand that we did not play our ace in Pale last week.\n       Though the West has occasionally acted militarily against \n     the Serbs in Bosnia, the West's response has been \n     fundamentally unmilitary. No sustained air campaign against \n     the war-making ability of the Serbs in Bosnia was ever really \n     considered. (The precision of the wee assault on Pale, by the \n     way, shows what can be accomplished by air power.) Like \n     NATO's previous strikes, NATO's strike last week was more a \n     demonstration of inhibition than a demonstration of the lack \n     of it. This was not what the Serbs were fearing. It was what \n     they were counting on. This trifling retort to the Serbs' \n     violation of the Sarajevo arrangement played right into the \n     Serbs' hands: it was a military response so predictably puny \n     that it could serve only as a pretext for a Serb provocation. \n     It also reassured the Serbs that they will never experience \n     punishments proportionate to their crimes, and they \n     assassinated the Bosnian foreign minister.\n       The second conclusion is that we must act forcefully \n     against the Serbs to help . . . the United Nations. The \n     ministers of the Contact Group (including the foreign \n     minister of Russia, who must have been chuckling) announced \n     at The Hague that they intended to expand the size of the \n     U.N. mission and to fortify it with heavier weapons. They \n     said nothing about the nature of the mission itself. For all \n     with eyes to see, of course, the essential absurdity of the \n     U.N. mission was made brutally plain last week. The blue \n     helmets are ``peacekeepers'' where there is no peace in \n     ``safe areas'' that are not safe. They have not impeded the \n     war or the genocide. They have impeded only a powerful and \n     decent response.\n       Recall that the ``safe areas'' of Bosnia were supposed to \n     be made safe by the U.N. There are six such enclaves: \n     Sarajevo, Bihac, Srebenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla. The list of \n     their names is a litany of lament. The U.N. has brought them \n     little respite. When the Serbs attack, the blue helmets \n     retreat. On May 21, The New York Times described a videotape \n     that captured a Serb atrocity on a Sarajevo street: ``The \n     crack of a shot echoes in Sarajevo's valley. He [a young \n     Bosnian man] falls. He lies on his side. He is curled in an \n     almost fetal position. A United Nations soldier looks on.'' \n     In Bosnia, a U.N. soldier [[Page S7746]] always looks on. \n     Bystanders or hostages: that is what the ``peacekeepers \n     really are.\n       It cannot have escaped the notice of our policymakers that \n     the U.N. is providing cover for the Serbs, except that the \n     U.N. is providing cover for our policymakers, too. It saves \n     them from the prospect of action. That is why the plight of \n     the U.N. stirs them more than the plight of Bosnia. And \n     nobody is less stirred by the plight of Bosnia than the aloof \n     Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who put an early damper on \n     international outrage when he called this a ``rich man's \n     war.'' The Bosnians, he said, were less deserving than those \n     under siege, by hunger and by arms, in Africa. And the United \n     States followed the secretary general's recommendation. We \n     sent troops to Somalia and we sent no troops to Bosnia.\n       It is hard to think of a major crisis since the Second \n     World War in which the president of the United States has \n     wielded less moral and political authority. There are 22,470 \n     U.N. troops in Bosnia, from eighteen countries. Britain has \n     3,565 men under arms; France has 3,835; Pakistan has 2,978. \n     The United States has none, and the Clinton administration, \n     the same administration that denounces the Republicans as \n     isolationists, regularly boasts about it. In such \n     circumstances, it is impossible for the president of the \n     United States to lead. But he is not chafing. He does not \n     wish to lead. He isn't terribly interested. When his national \n     security advisers met last week in the West Wing, he stayed \n     in the East Wing. He did tell a reporter, though, that ``the \n     taking of hostages, as well as the killing of civilians, is \n     totally wrong and inappropriate and it should stop.'' And \n     also that ``I would ask him [Boris Yeltsin] to call the Serbs \n     and tell them to quit it, and tell them to behave \n     themselves.''\n       To behave themselves. And if that fails, to go to their \n     room. Does Clinton grasp that there is evil in the world? And \n     does he understand that he is not the governor of the United \n     States? It is a requirement of his job that he care about \n     matters beyond our borders, matters such as war and genocide \n     and the general collapse of America's role in the world, \n     matters that will not gain him a point in the polls. The joke \n     on Clinton is that he is almost certainly about to be hoist \n     by his own isolationism. The result of the Bosnia policy that \n     was designed to spare the United States all costs in lives \n     and dollars may be a U.N. ``extraction operation'' that will \n     require the deployment of many thousands of American troops \n     and the expense of many millions of American dollars. And \n     Bosnia will have been destroyed. Nice work.\n       It is time to conclude this sinister farce. The U.N. should \n     get out of the way. It's forces must be withdrawn, so that \n     the Serbs may no longer hide behind them, and then the \n     Bosnians must be armed, so that they can fight their own \n     fight, which is all that they are asking to do. Withdraw and \n     strike, lift and strike. Obviously this is not as simple as \n     it sounds. The withdrawal of the U.N. will mean war; and \n     unless NATO provides protection from the air, for the \n     departing U.N. troops and for the training of Bosnian troops, \n     the U.N. withdrawal will expose the Bosnians to the Serbs as \n     brusquely as it will expose the Serbs to the Bosnians, and \n     Bosnia will fall. But there already is war and Bosnia already \n     is falling. Anyway, Bill Clinton and Boutros Boutros-Ghali \n     and John Major and the rest are not keeping the U.N. in \n     Bosnia to spare it horror. They can live with its horror. \n     They are keeping the U.N. in Bosnia to spare themselves a \n     reckoning with their own failure. For it is they who ordained \n     that Bosnia become a place where it is always too late for \n     justice.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7743-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7746-S7749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE ANTITERRORISM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not get the opportunity to respond \nto the majority leader prior to the time he made his statement on \nBosnia.\n  Let me say I am disappointed that the majority leader would come to \nthe floor and make the statement that Democrats do not care about what \nhappened in Oklahoma. I hope he does not mean that. I hope he did not \nreally mean to say that, because that is wrong and in my view it is \nuncalled for.\n  We care just as deeply as anybody on the other side about what \nhappened in Oklahoma. I hope we do not have to hear a statement like \nthat again on the Senate floor. We care just as deeply about responding \nto this issue, and we will respond to it. But we also care very deeply \nabout our right to offer some fundamental amendments to this bill.\n  Let me remind everyone this bill did not go through committee. This \nbill was not the subject of hearings. We went straight to the floor, \nbrought this bill up on Friday, offered some amendments and took a \nweek's break. If we care so much about this legislation, why in the \nworld did we have to take a week off before we came back? Now we are on \nit, and this is the third day.\n  Mr. President, I have worked on our side to bring the list of \namendments down, as I said I would. We have gone from over 60 \namendments to, as I understand it, 15 or 16. We have come to a point \nwhere we can finish this entire bill--and we can stay in as long as \nnecessary to do it--in less than 12 hours. We will get all of the \namendments up. We will have votes on them and very short time \nagreements. We will finish this bill tomorrow at whatever time we want \nto. We can do it.\n  Everybody can respond. We can make our political points on both \nsides, if we have to, but we are going to complete action on this bill.\n  But let me tell you, if we do not have a right to offer amendments on \nthis bill, of if in some way we are prevented from doing so tomorrow \nand the next day, and this bill is pulled from the floor, I want to put \neverybody on notice that we will offer it to the telecommunications \nbill and every other single piece of legislation that comes on this \nfloor until we resolve it. So this is not going to go away. Our rights \nare going to be protected. I want everybody to understand that.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can work through this and I believe we \ncan. I hope that in the course of the next hour or two, we can work \nthrough this, come up with an agreement, resolve our differences on \nprocedure here, and finally come to a point where we can vote on final \npassage. We can do it. We need to work together.\n  I know patience is strained on both sides. But I believe we have to \naccommodate Senators' rights here, and a Senator has a right to offer \nan amendment on this bill, as we have attempted to do. We are down to a \nshort list, and I believe we ought to work through the amendments on \nit.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, well, we had hearings on wiretap authority, \nand we had general hearings before the FBI Director Freeh. We have had \nnumerous hearings on habeas corpus reform. We have had hearings on \nalien terrorist removal and posse comitatus. We have had a lot of \nhearings. But, again, I remind the Democratic leader that the President \nof the United States, who happens to be a Democrat, wants to get this \nbill passed. Does he want 16 amendments or 26 amendments or 36 \namendments? He wants the bill passed.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot criticize Members on \nweekends for not passing a bill, saying there are too many amendments, \nand saying he wants to cooperate and have 16 amendments. Members do not \nneed 16. They probably do not need six. They probably do not need five \namendments.\n  This happens to be your administration, your President, who is taking \ncredit for the antiterrorism bill, and the Democrats will not let it \npass because they have to have all of their amendments. They have to \nhave 16 amendments. Why do they need 16 amendments?\n  This is an antiterrorism bill, not a gun bill and not any other kind \nof bill. We ought to pass it. We ought to pass it in the next couple of \nhours. We probably will not. We probably will not pass it at all. We \nwill have a cloture vote tomorrow. If the Democrats vote against \ncloture, that is fine. Then they will have spoken. They will have made \na statement on how they feel about antiterrorism legislation.\n  If the President were on their side saying, ``Gentleman, we have to \nhave all these amendments,'' I can understand. But he is on our side. \nHe is on our side. He said he was last night on Larry King. He wants \nhabeas corpus reform. He wants what is in this bill. He wants the \nterrorism bill. ``The majority leader is right saying there are too \nmany amendments.'' We have gone back to our people and said they cannot \noffer these amendments. Offer them some other time.\n  We will be in session for a long, long time. I was told we should \nhave stayed here during the week. Do not give me that stuff. Sixty-\nseven amendments offered by the Democrats, and I was told by the \nmanager on the other side they would work all these things out over the \nrecess. In fact, I asked the question. Let Members not come back on \nMonday and say we just got back from recess, we have not made any \nheadway.\n  It is very frustrating. I know the Senate is a different place. I \nknow one Senator can delay as long as they can, and two or three \nSenators can delay for days and days.\n  This is something that the President of the United States wants very \nbadly. It is something I assume that the Democrats want badly. If they \nwant it [[Page S7747]] badly, they will stop offering amendments. These \namendments have nothing to do with terrorism. They were not in the \nPresident's bill.\n  Why not get on with it and pass the bill? We have a terrorism bill. \nWe can take care of habeas corpus and go to final passage or agree on \ntwo or three amendments on a side and get it done.\n  We have taken the taggants, that amendment that the President was \nconcerned about. We worked it out. Worked it out on both sides. We \naccepted that amendment and another amendment that we thought had \nmerit, extending the statute of limitations from 3 to 5 years. We have \ndone that. We will not continue this game. I do not care whether they \noffer it on telecommunications or not. That is a right they have.\n  The time is running out. The time is running out for this bill to be \non the floor. Make no mistake about it. If they want to do business, we \nwill do business. If not, it is fine with this Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just briefly respond to a couple \nof points.\n  First of all, the majority leader filed cloture before the first \namendment was offered. I do not know what kind of good faith effort \nthere had been to try to work on both sides to accommodate the \ninterests that Senators have with regard to amending this bill. It did \nnot appear to be much.\n  Second, as I said, there is a very limited timeframe within which all \nof these amendments could be disposed of. Let no one confuse the issue. \nWe are not trying to prolong debate on this bill. We are not trying to \nkeep it from coming to final passage. We can do that tonight. We can do \nthat before 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  All we have to do is work through the amendments. We have already \nagreed to a time limit. Indeed, we can have it both ways. We can \naccommodate all of those Senators who specifically said, ``I have a \nvery important amendment relevant to this legislation, and I will do it \nin a very short timeframe, and I want to vote for final passage.''\n  So, it is very clear. No one should be confused about it. No one is \ntrying to delay it. If it is pulled, we will have plenty more \nopportunities to vote on this legislation on whatever other bills come \nup before the Senate in the coming weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize the majority leader is very busy, \nand he has a lot of pieces of legislation he has to deal with and a lot \nof other matters relating to national responsibilities and the \nRepublican Party.\n  However, I want to point out to him, he keeps talking about 60-some \namendments. It is down to 16 amendments, No. 1. No. 2, of the 16 \namendments, there are only 4 amendments that there is a problem with \nhere. The four amendments relate to guns.\n  That is what this is about. The President wanted wiretapping \nauthority in this. We have an amendment for that. The other side does \nnot want to get tough on those terrorists and allow the Government to \nwiretap them. I understand that. It is a civil liberties issue from \ntheir perspective. I understand it. But the President wanted it.\n  The President wanted posse comitatus, but apparently some of the \nposses out West do not want posse comitatus change, so we will have a \nvote on it.\n  The President also wants it in this bill. He wanted some authority \nrelating to immigration that the other side does not want. It was in \nhis bill. They took it out. I understand. That is one of the amendments \nin here.\n  There are four amendments, five amendments, with regard to time \nagreements--the longest 90 minutes, the shortest 20--relating to habeas \ncorpus. The President says he wants habeas corpus. He did not say he \nwants the Republican habeas corpus; he says he wants habeas corpus. We \nwant to give the Senate the one the President wants, not the one the \nRepublicans want. We want to debate it.\n  So, look, the amendments we are talking about here, all of which have \ntime agreements on them, all of which, on our side, have time \nagreements on them, are amendments--but for four of them--that the \nPresident does want or wants a version of them different than the one \nin the Republican bill.\n  So I would like to ask this question: Why do we not have a cloture \nvote on those four gun amendments, because that is what this is about. \nWhy not have a cloture vote on those? And why do we not move on with \nthe rest of these? And if we get cloture on those four amendments, \nfine. No problem. They are gone. I am sure they will come back. But \nthey are gone. I do not want them on this bill. I did not want any of \nthese on this bill.\n  But we should get something straight here. This is an interesting way \nto proceed. There was a bill that was brought up, not out of \ncommittee--which I understand and I am not being critical of--and it \ngets brought up on the floor, everybody not having not had a chance to \nread it, because it is a Republican bill that was not finalized on the \nday we started to debate it, and I understand that, too.\n  Everybody put all these place holder amendments out there. There were \n60, 70, 80, 100, I do not know what the number was, a humongous number. \nSo we stayed here late 1 day, Senator Hatch and I, to get a finite list \nso no one could add more amendments. So we get a finite list and we \nlist them. And then the leader comes back before we voted on any of \nthem and he files a cloture petition.\n  Now, I realize this will be lost on the public, and I understand this \nis inside baseball. I understand this is the Senate. I hope the press \nunderstands it, though. Then the leader looks down and says, ``OK, you \nnow have shown me your list. You have agreed this is a limited list. \nNow I want to go down the list. I don't like that one, that one, that \none, that one, so I'm filing cloture. Gotcha.''\n  Look, whether there is a time agreement, we walked out of here and \ncame out of a caucus. I did what I committed to do. And the leader did \nwhat he committed to do. I came out here and I said, ``OK, here is a \ntime agreement with these four. Can we move them right away?''\n  I thought the Republican side was for it because they printed up a \nunanimous-consent agreement. All of a sudden, boom. We cannot debate \nthem. Or we cannot vote on them. We have a Kerrey amendment. The \nPresident wanted the ATF involved. Apparently, the ATF is like holding \nup a cross to Dracula to some folks around here. He stood up and gave a \ntime agreement of 30 minutes. He made his pitch on ATF, why they should \nbe included the way the President wants them included. All of a sudden, \nthere is silence on the other side, not a response, no question, just \nso we cannot vote on it.\n  What is this, legislation by fiat? Now, look, if this is about \ngetting the bill done, which I thought that is what the cloture thing \nwas about, getting it done, in the 2 hours we have wasted, we could \nhave disposed of at least four of these amendments already. We can get \nthis done.\n  But that is not what this is about. This is about making sure that \nthe Republican bill stays the way they wrote it. And they are using \nlegitimate procedural approaches under Senate rules to effectively make \nsure we cannot offer other amendments.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the four amendments that are about to be \noffered relative to guns, I am voting against. I do not think we should \ntake away the civilian marksmanship money. Why can we not even allow \nthe guy to raise it?\n  I tell Members, this is not about time, folks. Understand, this is \nnot about time. This is not about anything other than making sure that \nthe majority can dictate to the minority what they can bring up and \nunder what circumstances they can bring it up. I suspect they would be \nvery satisfied--I hope they would be satisfied--if they brought up all \nthe amendments that would not fall when cloture was invoked, vote on \nthem, and then try to make the rest of them fall.\n  I cannot think of any major bill--I am sure there is an exception to \nthis--off the top of my head, any major bill, that did not have \nnongermane amendments in a technical sense attached to it.\n I cannot think of any. It is possible. I am sure there are some, but I \ncannot think of any. And we are acting like this is some kind of \nunusual procedure.\n\n  Look, we can give a time agreement on all the 16 amendments. It can \nall be [[Page S7748]] done--could have been done by tonight. It still \ncan, if we are willing to stay in very late. We could be finished. We \ndo not even have to get to cloture to get to final passage on this \nbill. But if there is another reason not to do that, I understand it. I \nrespect the right of the Republican majority to deal with this under \nthe rules. If they want to do that, fine. But, please, do not make \nanybody make any misunderstanding. There are not 60 amendments, there \nare not 50, there are not 40, there are not 20, there are 16 and \ndwindling. Four--five of which so far we have been told bluntly they \nwill not allow us to vote on them.\n  The one--let me be precise. Four we are told we are not allowed to \nvote on. And, by the way, the longest one has a 60-minute time \nagreement on it. The others have 20-minute time agreements. And one of \nwhich I do not know what they are saying, on the Kerrey amendment about \nATF.\n  I ask my friend from Utah, are we ready to vote on the Kerrey \namendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer my colleague. I am prepared to try to \nresolve that amendment as I am all of them. When we appeared----\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are ready to vote, Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. When we appeared down at the Cabinet room we \npromised the President, on our side, at least, we would not make this--\nwe would try to get it passed. I made it very clear at that time that \nhabeas corpus reform would be in the bill and we were trying to satisfy \nhim on it.\n  I have not heard that he is against the provisions in this bill. If \nhe is for what the Senator from Delaware wants instead of the \nprovisions in this bill, I certainly will be interested in that. \nBecause I do not think he wants to limit it just to the Federal courts, \nthe appeals.\n  Let me just say this. When we were there we said we would not make \nthis a gun fight. We will do that, if we have to. We will face those \nissues on the crime bill. And we have succeeded on our side. We have a \nlot of people over here who are very dissatisfied with some of the \ncurrent laws with regard to the right to keep and bear arms that we \nhave personally gone to and said, ``Do not bring them up on this bill. \nThe President wants an expedited bill. He wants to solve this problem, \nand, by gosh, we intend to solve it.'' And our people have not. We turn \naround and here we have the gun fight started on the other side, that \nis irrelevant to this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question, just a brief \nquestion, a serious question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator be prepared to move forward if we drop \nthe four gun amendments?\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly believe we could.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And enter time agreements on all the remaining amendments?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is up to the leader but I certainly believe we could if \nwe drop the gun issue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask the leader, will he be willing to continue on the \nbill if we drop the four gun amendments and vote on the other \namendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not know if those are gun amendments or not. I have \nnot looked at the amendments. I want to stick to terrorism. I want to \nsee what the end result is, when we would finish the bill. But I \nunderscore what the Senator from Utah said. I attended the White House \nmeeting. Everybody was saying ``They are going to make this a big gun \nfight.'' We said ``No, we are not going to do that. We are not going to \noffer any of the so-called gun amendments.'' And then we have them all \noffered on the other side, or many offered on the other side.\n  We say no. We accommodate the President. He wants to get the bill \npassed. The President was at the Air Force Academy and blasted Congress \nfor not passing a bill. Mr. President, 67 amendments were filed by \nDemocrats. We only saw seven of those amendments before Monday. We did \nnot know where they were. We did not know what the other 60 were.\n  I just suggest we are going to either complete this bill or we are \ngoing to have a cloture vote in the morning. If we do not get cloture \nit is out of here. It is gone.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I add one other thing in response to my good friend \nfrom Delaware----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. HATCH. My partner in the Judiciary Committee. We do not even know \nwhat some of the other amendments are because nobody has given us any \nlanguage. But I think there might be a way of resolving this if we got \nrid of the gun fight and reserve that for the crime bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. We would like to see what the other amendments are before \nwe move ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, they were all filed by noon \ntoday.\n  Mr. HATCH. We do not know what Senator Kerry's amendment is. I am \ntalking about Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, my question was about Senator Kerrey from Nebraska. \nAre we ready to vote on that amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am trying to get that cleared on our side. The amendment \nI am concerned about is Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts. We do \nnot have any language on that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If it is not filed----\n  Mr. HATCH. You said you would get back to us on that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am told the amendment was filed at noon.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Democrats have 20 amendments. Before Monday we had \nlanguage on only seven of those amendments. We certainly do not know \nwhat the John Kerry amendment is.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me reiterate. It was filed, I am told. And, No. 2, of \nthe 35 or so amendments Republicans filed, we did not have copies of \nany of those amendments either. I mean what are we talking about here?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to know what they are and let us see if we \ncan resolve it. If we can get rid of the gun fight around here and go \nahead on habeas and some of these other problems that really pertain to \nthis bill, sure we are going to want to go ahead. I want to go ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President, if I may. I do not \nknow whether I am making unreasonable work for the Parliamentarian here \nwith this request. If I am I would be happy to be told so and I will \nwithhold.\n  Have all the amendments that are able to be attached to this bill \nprior to cloture--have they all been filed by 12:30 today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All first-degree amendments had to have been \nfiled by 12:30 today.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would ask, is there an amendment--or if they need time--\nis there a John Kerry of Massachusetts first-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kerry of Massachusetts filed an \namendment, No. 1212.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand that that is an amendment relating to \nfirearms. And that would, relating to the list of the 16 amendments, \nmake it five of them relating to firearms, including the one Senator \nJohn Kerry filed. The point being, it was filed almost 4 hours ago at \nthe desk in accordance with the rule requiring first degrees to have \nbeen filed.\n  The only point I want to make is there is not any subterfuge here \nthat no one knows what is going on. We may not know what is going on \nbecause we did not go look, but it has been filed. It is there. We \nhave, of the total of 16 amendments we are talking about, five of them \nrelating to firearms.\n  We are ready to vote. We can dispose of all these amendments \nincluding those five amendments I have just referenced. It can all be \ndone and all finished before the cloture vote tomorrow if there is good \nfaith to try to move. We are willing to enter into time agreements.\n  What I would like to suggest, since we cannot enter into a time \nagreement on those five amendments, maybe while the Republican side is \nresponding to Senator John Kerry's amendment--and a further \nparliamentary inquiry--I mean Robert Kerrey's amendment --what is the \npending business?\n  Mr. DOLE. There is not any pending business. We are in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually we are in morning business right now.\n  Mr. BIDEN. What was the pending business prior to us going into \nmorning business? [[Page S7749]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kerrey of Nebraska amendment, No. 1208.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Kerrey of Nebraska amendment 1208?\n  Mr. Kerrey exhausted his argumentation on it and is ready to vote on \nit.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are ready to take it.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are very close to taking that amendment. I just have to \nclear one or two more people, and we are working on it. Let me suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Before I do, let me suggest let us work on this, let us see if we can \nget together. There is good will on both sides here. We want to get \nthis resolved. But we just do not want the gun fight on this bill. It \nis a reasonable request. I understand the sincerity of people on the \nother side who do want it. There are people on our side who did, and we \nkept them off. We fought them and said you cannot do it. We told the \nPresident we would not do it. Now all of a sudden we are in the middle \nof a gun fight and we just do not want to do it on this bill. This bill \nis too important.\n  Frankly, I think we can battle out these other things. The questions \non habeas we will fight it out here on the floor and let the chips fall \nwhere they may. We have been willing to do that from the beginning.\n  I see the majority leader wishes to speak.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if the two managers might go off \nsomewhere and try to see if they cannot put together something. Better \nthan do it out here in the open.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You do want us to come back, do you not?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is like making sausage out here.\n  It may be we can work it out. I do not see much problem with the \nKerrey amendment. We might be able to accept that with some \nmodification. But we want to finish the bill. I promised the President \nwe would finish it before Memorial Day. I like to keep my word. That \nwas not possible. But the President did not know it was not possible \nand he said some things I did not like.\n  So I am going to finish this bill. If I do not finish the bill it \nwill not be my fault. Because we could not get cloture or we could not \nget cooperation on the other side. That is his side, not my side. We \nare ready. We are ready to do habeas corpus and have final passage \nbefore 6 o'clock. That would be an antiterrorism bill. All these other \nthings are going to be around here a long time, this year and next \nyear. We can offer all the amendments we wish. This came to us as an \nemergency. This was an emergency. We were all called to the White \nHouse. We do not do this on every bill.\n  This is very important to the President of the United States. He has \nbeen to Oklahoma City. He saw the need. He met with the Attorney \nGeneral. He met with leaders of Congress and said, ``Let's do it.'' We \ndid not say let us see how many amendments we can offer, who can \noutpoint each other, make some political points on some issue, whatever \nit might be. That is what we are about to get into here, and I do not \nthink I want to be any part of that. I want to try to keep my word to \nthe President. If we cannot, we cannot. We will do the best we can. I \nthink he will understand. If he does not understand, I will write him a \nletter. But that is the way it goes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response to the leader's suggestion that \nSenator Hatch and I go off, I am always happy to go off with Senator \nHatch. What I would like to suggest is that in the meantime we move on \nan amendment that the President wants in this bill, the wiretap \namendment, while he and I are off. We can continue to make progress. I \njust think we should debate it in case we do not even get close.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are close on that amendment, too. If the Senator and \nSenator Hatch could go off somewhere for 10 minutes they could probably \nget back pretty much with an agreement.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have been trying to get an answer to that one for the \nlast 36 hours.\n  I intend to accept that amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Good. I urge the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to check one or two more people. I am personally \ndoing the best I can. It is an amendment that really would allow \nwiretaps following the criminal. In other words, instead of having to \nfollow the phone they follow the criminal who might use multiple \nphones. I personally have no objection to that and think it is a wise \namendment. The President wants it. I support the President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think----\n  Mr. HATCH. But I have to deal with my side, too.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my experience is not as extensive as the \nleader's and slightly more extensive than the Senator from Utah's here, \nbut it seems to me we waste a whole lot of time working out whether we \ncan work things out rather than just bringing them up and voting on \nthem. By the time we get to vote on it, we are slowing things up.\n  I have another amendment we can move to, then.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield before he does? We have a bunch of \npending amendments that we have asked you to accept. The Smith \namendment, which would set a floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We cannot, but let us vote on Smith. We are ready to vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have McCain-Leahy. We have the Pressler amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. McCain-Leahy is cleared.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I urge McCain-Leahy--oh, we are still in morning \nbusiness. I am ready to move here. We have Senator Specter's amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are ready to vote on the Specter amendment. We would \nagree to a 10-minute time agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. You cannot take it? You do not want to take it or you \ncannot take it?\n  Mr. BIDEN. We cannot take it now so let us just vote on it. Look, in \n10 minutes--the whole thing is over in 25 minutes rather than spending \n45 minutes deciding whether we can take it.\n  Mr. DOLE. We would like to take a number of back-to-back votes if we \nare going to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have the Brown amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. Why can you not take any of our amendments and we are \ntaking your amendments? Because we are Republicans?\n  Mr. BIDEN. We can take Hatch. We can take the Hatch amendment, and we \nare happy to do that. We are ready to accept the Hatch amendment. We \nhave already taken the McCain amendment. That is two out of six. That \nis about what your average is.\n  Mr. DOLE. You are getting better.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Pressler amendment; three out of seven. That is better \nthan your average.\n  Mr. HATCH. How about Abraham? Can you take Abraham?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7746-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7749-S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

There \nwere not that many when they went into the meeting, but they came out \nwith 24 amendments. The time agreements just on the Democratic side \nwould take 9 hours.\n  I think I need to meet with Senator Hatch to see whether there is any \nother option, other than waiting and having the cloture vote tomorrow \nmorning.\n  So, Madam President, I move that the Senate stand in recess until the \nhour of 6:10 p.m.\n  The motion was agreed to, and at 5:36 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n6:08 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Presiding Officer [Mr. Burns].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the third in a series of \ncommentaries I am making on our Nation's condition, a series suggested \nto me by President Clinton after I announced my future retirement from \nthe Senate.\n  One of the major economic events of this year is the recent decline \nof the dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Though this \nslippage was arrested temporarily a few days ago, the long-term trend \nis clear. We know that the drop in the value of the dollar will affect \nour future, but we are not sure how. We know that we should do \nsomething about it, but we are not sure what.\n  At a White House press conference on Tuesday evening, April 18, a \nreporter asked President Clinton about the sinking dollar, and the \nPresident responded: ``In the present climate, the ability of \ngovernments to affect the strength of their currency . . . in the short \nrun may be limited.'' If that is an excuse for inaction, it is wrong. \nBut the President was right in saying:\n\n       So what you have to do is work over the long run. The \n     United States does want a strong dollar. We believe in the \n     importance of fundamentals in our economy. We believe in \n     getting the deficit down, getting jobs up and pursuing a \n     responsible course.\n\n  The Washington Post had an editorial that observed:\n\n       Anger and frustration in their voices, Japanese and German \n     officials have been calling on the United States publicly to \n     do something about the [falling] dollar * * * The United \n     States is likely to offer sympathy but little more. There's \n     nothing useful that the United States can do.\n\n  The Post is wrong.\n  A few blamed our $20 billion loan guarantee to Mexico, and while it \ncould have altered behavior slightly in an uneasy market, a $20 billion \nmultiyear loan guarantee is not something major for a nation that has a \n$6 trillion national income, if it has its economic house in order.\n  There are two basic questions: What does the fall of the dollar mean? \nWhat can we or should we do about it? I shall address both.\n  What does the fall of the dollar mean?\n  It is significant, both for our Nation and the world. Since two-\nthirds of the world's trade is carried on in dollars, the erosion of \nthe dollar can destabilize economies far from us. But the British \npublication, the Economist, is correct:\n\n       In the long run, the biggest loser from the neglect of the \n     dollar will be America itself.--April 15, 1995.\n\n  A Journal of Commerce columnist accurately noted on April 17: ``The \nweak dollar will decrease U.S. political influence abroad.'' Peter \nPassell wrote in the New York Times, on May 7: ``No indicator of the \nAmerican economic decline stands out like the fallen dollar.'' Paul \nVolcker, former chairman of the Federal\n Reserve Board, is quoted in the New York Times on May 2: ``If you \nthink American leadership is important, then erosion [of the dollar] is \na negative.'' Time magazine, in its March 20 issue, quoted financial \nanalyst Felix Rohatyn: ``We are gradually losing control of our own \ndestiny. The dollar's decline undercuts American economic leadership \nand prestige. It is perhaps the single most dangerous economic threat \nwe will face in the long term because it puts us at the mercy of other \ncountries.'' Van Ooms, economist for the Committee for Economic \nDevelopment and former chief of staff of the House Budget Committee, \nsaid on the pages of the Chicago Tribune on April 13 that Europeans \nwill take this country less seriously on foreign policy ``when it can't \nrun a credible economic policy.'' As if to underscore all of this, the \nApril 12th Wall Street Journal had a heading about the fastest growing \neconomic part of the world: ``Asia's Central Banks Unloading Dollars in \nShift Toward Yen as Trade Currency.''\n\n  Short-term, Americans will see little change. Yes, if we are \ntraveling in other nations, we will be hurt a little by the foreign \nexchange rates. Our balance of trade with other nations may be helped a \nlittle, because U.S. products can be secured for less money, though \nforeign businesses--like their American counterparts--rarely \nimmediately drop their prices, both because they want to make some \nadditional profit and because there is a reluctance to adjust prices \nuntil the currency market stabilizes. Our balance of trade is helped \nbecause U.S. businesses that buy component parts from overseas \nproducers will suddenly find them more expensive and will shift to a \nU.S. manufacturer of the same product, if one is available. But that is \nnot always the case. The VCR, for example--invented, developed and, at \none time, entirely manufactured here--now has no U.S. manufacturing \nsource.\n  Little-noticed economic consequences will gradually affect us. For \nexample, securing a patent in Japan will now be more expensive for a \nUnited States firm or individual. Factors like that have a limited, \nshort-term impact but a much greater long-range impact.\n  Long-term, the dollar decline has more serious consequences.\n  First, the increased cost of foreign goods will have a gradual \ninflationary impact on our economy. That will not only cause the \nconsumer dollar to shrink and discourage savings, it eventually will \nput pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to \ndiscourage inflationary pressures--and that will hurt our economy.\n  The financial markets will also push interest rates up. We know that \napproximately 16 percent of our deficit--or about $700 billion--is \npublicly known to be held outside the United States. But many nations \noutlaw holding bonds from another nation--the United States once did--\nand there is additional ownership that is not publicly disclosed, \nhidden usually through a third party holding the\n bonds. If the dollar continues its decline, U.S. bonds denominated in \ndollars will become less and less attractive. We will have to raise \ninterest rates to sell this huge chunk of our deficit.\n\n  Less widely known is that 14 percent of our corporate bonds are held \nby people who live beyond our borders. That money has financed a huge \nchunk of our industrial expansion and modernization. If the dollar \ncontinues to decline, we will either lose this source of capital, or \ninterest rate payments will have to be raised to make these bonds \nattractive enough to sell.\n  In addition, there are sizable foreign deposits in savings and \nchecking accounts in our banks, and foreign-held certificates of \ndeposit. Indirectly, these help to finance both our government sector--\nbecause the banks buy Treasury bonds--and the private sector, because \nthe banks are able to make loans to U.S. businesses with these \nresources. If all of this shrinks because of a fall in the dollar, the \nonly way to salvage the situation is with higher interest rates.\n  In the long term, higher interest rates discourage industrial \ninvestment and reduce productivity. Our economy is hurt, and the \nphenomenon of a lower dollar is not healthy for our Nation. From time \nto time, minor adjustments will occur and frequently are healthy. But \nthe fairly consistent pattern of the drop in our dollar against the yen \nand the mark has major long-term consequences for our citizens that are \nnot good.\n  I read an exchange that took place between two economists some years \nago when the dollar brought 262 yen. In 1968, incidentally, 1 dollar \nequaled 360 yen. Here we can see in this graph what has happened to the \ndollar versus the yen. The one discussant predicted that if our \npolicies were not altered, the dollar would eventually slide to 180 \nyen. The other economist predicted, confidently, that this would never \nhappen. A few days ago, the dollar fell to 82 yen and today the dollar \nis worth 84 yen. Recently the Washington Post published a column noting \nthe opinion of [[Page S7751]] an economist and an economic observer who \nsuggest we may have to think about issuing U.S. Treasury notes in yen \nrather than dollars to attract buyers and save on interest. The \nreasoning is simple: The financial markets want a stable currency for \ntheir investments, particularly long-term investments. The\n yen has shown itself much more stable than the dollar. To continue to \nsell in dollars will require higher interest rates. Therefore, they \nargue, we should issue our bonds in yen and pay less for interest. It \nwould be politically unsettling to many Americans to see our bonds \nbeing sold in yen, but that is where we are headed.\n\n  There are better alternatives.\n  What can we do about the fall of the dollar?\n  It is not difficult to diagnose much of the problem. But once the \nillness is diagnosed, the patient has to take the medicine, and that is \nmuch more difficult with a patient that is not accustomed to taking \ndistasteful medicine.\n  The basic problem is that the confidence in the dollar has \ndiminished. Neither cheerleading by United States officials nor \nsalvaging efforts by the central banks of Japan, Germany, and other \ncountries will do more than temporarily heal the wound. Confidence-\nbuilding measures have to be substantial. Those who now hold U.S. \ndollar-denominated financial certificates, who are uneasy, are not \ngoing to be assured by cosmetic actions.\n  Four steps can strengthen our economy and solidify the dollar.\n  First, get rid of our Government deficit. This is, by far, the most \nimportant of the four actions, and it will help the next three. It is \nno accident that the most recent slide of the dollar began the day \nafter the Senate rejected the balanced budget amendment by one vote.\n  The Federal Government has been in a deficit situation for 26 years, \nand for 25 years, the dollar has been in a slide against the yen and \nmark. It does not take an Einstein to understand there is a \nrelationship. But it is not a straight line, and other factors are also \npresent. Sometimes when the deficit was high, interest rates were high, \nincreasing the value of the dollar. It is an over-simplification to \nattribute all of the dollar decline to the deficit. But it is a major \ncause.\n  ``The Germans and the Japanese say the basic problem is America's \nbudget deficit,'' the New York Times reported on April 25. A month \nearlier, the Los Angeles Times reported Federal Reserve Board Chairman \nAlan Greenspan telling the House Budget Committee that ``last week's \nSenate defeat of the balanced budget amendment [can be blamed] for the \nsudden plunge in the value of the dollar and pointedly warned Congress \nthat the currency will remain under long-term pressure until Washington \ntackles the deficit.'' The newspaper called his comments \n``extraordinary because he so rarely gets involved in political \ndisputes over tax and budget policies.''--March 9, 1995.\n  Business Week, in its March 2 issue, commented on the dollar slide: \n``What the [international] market wants is simple: less debt or higher \ninterest rates.'' The same article noted ``that sense of unease [caused \nby] the narrow defeat in the Senate of the balanced budget amendment. \nNow, investors are worrying that talk of tax cuts will continue despite \nthe amendment's failure. `The optimism that something would be done on \nthe long-standing U.S. budget deficit problem has disappeared,' argues \nJonathan H. Francis, head of global strategy at Boston's Putnam \nInvestments.'' The story concludes: ``Unless the U.S. * * * catches on, \neven more trouble lies ahead.'' Paul McCracken, economist at the \nUniversity of Michigan and former chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors under President Nixon, had a guest column in the Wall Street \nJournal of April 13, titled: ``Falling Dollar? Blame the Deficit.'' In \nthe article, he says that the deficits have caused a decline in \nproductive capital investment and that this ``is not trivial. If gains \nin real income had continued at a pace more in line with our long \nhistory, average family income today in real terms\n would be almost 25 percent higher than our economy is now \ndelivering.'' The bipartisan Concord Coalition recently issued a study \nsuggesting that family income would be $15,000 higher today if we had \nnot had years of deficit. On April 17, Trudy Rubin wrote prophetically \nin the Journal of Commerce: ``If there were signs that Washington were \ncutting the deficit, the dollar would probably stabilize.'' Lawrence \nThimerene, chief economist for the Economic Strategy Institute, wrote \nin the New York Times on March 23 that, to stabilize the dollar, \nCongress and the President must ``demonstrate real seriousness on \ndeficit reduction.'' To the credit of President Clinton, he did that \nwith his budget of 1993. It cost him politically, but it benefited the \nNation. To the credit of our colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, chair of \nthe Budget Committee, he has proposed that we balance the budget by the \nyear 2002. While I differ strongly with his way of getting there, I \napplaud his courage in proposing this. The Senate and the House now \nhave passed different budget blueprints. During the Senate debate, \nseveral of us on the Democratic side of the aisle proposed a different \nbudget plan which would balance the budget but with significantly \ndifferent priorities. We need bipartisan efforts in the that direction.\n\n  But our task is made more difficult by the one vote we failed to get \nin the Senate for a balanced budget amendment. I hope that 1 of the 34 \nSenators who voted against it--Dale Bumpers, David Pryor, Barbara \nBoxer, Diane Feinstein, Chris Dodd, Joe Lieberman, Dan Akaka, Daniel \nInouye, Wendell Ford, Bennett Johnston, Barbara Mikulski, Paul \nSarbanes, Edward Kennedy, John Kerry, Carl Levin, Paul Wellstone, Bob \nKerrey, Harry Reid, Bill Bradley, Frank Lautenberg, Jeff Bingaman, Pat \nMoynihan, Kent Conrad, Byron Dorgan, John Glenn, Mark Hatfield, \nClaiborne Pell, Fritz Hollings, Tom Daschle, Pat Leahy, Patty Murray, \nRobert Byrd, Jay Rockefeller, and Russ Feingold--will reexamine the \nissue in light of what has happened to the dollar and in light of the \naction taken by Senator Domenici and the Budget Committee.\n  Even Budget Committee action alone toward fiscal balance has had an \nimpact. The heading on the New York Times story of Friday, May 12, was: \n``The Dollar Surges On New Plan To Cut Deficit.'' The story, written by \nPeter Truell, begins:\n\n       The dollar staged its biggest one-day rally in nearly four \n     years, rebounding against the German mark and the Japanese \n     yen on speculation that Washington might do more than in the \n     past to cut the federal budget deficit.\n\n  The difficulty with the Budget Committee acting alone, much as its \ngoal is to be applauded, is that the financial markets will remain \nsomewhat skeptical, as I am, about whether Congress will follow through \nin the remaining 6 years. Financial savings from interest that could be \napplied to things like social programs and Medicare, and should be \napplied there rather than for a tax cut, will not be fully achieved. On \nthe basis of estimates made by Data Resources and other forecasters, my \nguess is that with the same goal of balancing the budget and the firm \nwall of a constitutional amendment, there would be an additional \ninterest savings of at least 1 percent. That would mean an extra $170 \nbillion over 7 years for needed programs like education and a \nstimulated U.S. economy in areas that are interest-sensitive, such as \nhome construction, car purchases, and industrial investment.\n  Washington Post columnist James K. Glassman recently had a column \nunder the heading, ``Year of the Balanced Budget.'' While whoever wrote \nthe headline for the column may not have intended it, there is fear on \nthe part of many that the use of the singular, ``year,'' is what will \nhappen. We need ``Years--plural--of the Balanced Budget.'' Our \nexperience with legislative\n solutions, such as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, an earlier balanced budget \ntry, is that they have an impact for a year or two, but when the public \nsqueeze is felt, it is much easier politically to create additional \ndeficits than to make the tough decisions.\n\n  That's where the constitutional amendment would help.\n  But unless we confront our fiscal problems, the day will come when we \nwill look back with longing to the day when the yen was 84 to a dollar.\n  Second, our trade imbalances must be addressed. A report from the \nCongressional Research Service says that studies show 37 to 55 percent \nof our trade deficits are caused by the budget deficit. [[Page S7752]] \n  But there are other causes, varying from our neglect to aggressively \nmarket, to our weakness over the decades in trade negotiations. The \nlatter deficiency is caused in part by not having a cadre of \nprofessionals handling our negotiations, particularly when compared to \nJapan. Too often it has been long-term professionals against changing \nteams of U.S. negotiators, and I don't mean that disrespectfully to \nfine, competent people of both political parties who have been thrust \ninto these positions of responsibility.\n  The firm stance of President Clinton and Trade Ambassador Mickey \nKantor in negotiating with Japan on automobiles and car parts is sound. \nI am optimistic that the problems can be satisfactorily resolved, but \nwe should not be too eager. It is also worth noting that our firmer \nstance with Japan on trade matters has come since Japan has been a \ndeclining factor in purchase of our treasury notes. It is difficult to \nget tough with your banker.\n  The United States also must build products that can accommodate the \ncultures of other nations; we must learn to sell in their languages, \nnot ours; and tens of thousands of U.S. corporations that do not \nconsider marketing in other nations must change course.\n  We are gradually getting better, but it we can hasten the process, we \nwill reduce the trade deficit that troubles the international currency \nmarkets.\n  But any serious look at trade policy must return to fiscal policy. \nLast month, Judith H. Bello, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       The United States will continue to run trade deficits, no \n     matter what happens in trade negotiations, so long as we run \n     federal budget deficits. If Japan and every other trading \n     partner opened their markets completely, we would still run a \n     trade deficit if our savings rate remained inadequate.\n       There is little that trade negotiators can do about a trade \n     deficit. The power to reduce the U.S. deficit lies with \n     Congress and those within the administration responsible for \n     the federal budget. No matter how many markets any trade \n     representative opens, the effect on the U.S. trade deficit in \n     isolation is peripheral.\n       U.S. trade negotiators have relatively little power to \n     affect the weakness or strength of the U.S. dollar through \n     their market-opening negotiations. As long as the United \n     States remains heavily dependent on foreign capital to fuel \n     our economic growth, and fails to save more and spend less, \n     the dollar is likely to be relatively weak despite our \n     fundamental competitiveness.\n\n  Third, our savings rate must be increased. Again, the biggest \nimpediment to our savings rate is the deficit. But it is more than \nthat.\n  The United States culture is not dramatically different from that of \nCanada and other Western industrialized nations, but our savings rate \nis significantly lower. We save only 4.8 percent of our gross national \nproduct, Canada saves 9.1 percent, Germany 10.7 percent, and 19.7 \npercent in Japan. Because of the low savings rate, the United\n States is much more dependent on others buying our debt paper.\n\n  By making some changes in our Tax Code, we can reward savings rather \nthan debt. Our Tax Code, for example, rewards businesses that create \ndebt to finance growth, rather than financing growth through savings or \nequity financing. A corporation that buys another corporation by \nborrowing money can write off the interest payments even through the \ndebt may create hazards for the purchasing company. But if that same \ncorporation more prudently issues stock, the dividends are not \ndeductible. If we changed the tax laws to permit 80 percent of interest \nto be deductible and 50 percent of dividends to be deductible, the net \nresult would be a wash in Federal revenue, but many corporations would \nhave a more solid base, and our corporate debt base would decline. \nSimilarly, we should create tax incentives for individual Americans to \nsave that would not add to our Nation's debt but would add to our \nproductivity by making investment capital more available. Our people do \nnot have the incentives to save that citizens of many nations have.\n  Shifts in our culture will not be brought about quickly, but we must \nwork to bring about change.\n  Fourth, we must do more long-term thinking and face our deficiencies \nfrankly. The fiscal deficiency is an example I have already discussed. \nWe have ducked telling people the truth because it is politically more \nconvenient to duck.\n  But there are many more examples.\n  Can we expect to build the kind of a nation we should have if we \ncontinue to have 23 percent of our children living in poverty? Can we \nexpect to build a nation that can lead and compete in the future if we \ncontinue to neglect the need for quality education in all of the \nnation?\n  Financial markets look at our deficits and worry about long-term \ninflationary pressures. When our fiscal policy does not address the \ndeficits, the Federal Reserve Board is forced to look at the long-term \nimplications of inflation. That is why the quality of appointments to \nthe Federal Reserve Board are so significant. If we in Congress and the \nClinton administration addressed our long-term fiscal problems more \ndirectly, the pressure would be removed for Federal Reserve Board \naction.\n  Germany and Japan are far ahead of the United States on nondefense \nresearch--and probably even further ahead of us in applying their \nresearch to productive purposes.\n  Governmental America tends to live from election to election and, \neven worse, from poll to poll. Corporate America too often lives from \nquarterly report to quarterly report. Unless we do more long-term \nplanning and acting in both the public and private sectors, our future \nperformance as a nation will be less than outstanding.\n  Others understand this about us. We must understand this about \nourselves.\n  If we were to address these four areas with courage, not only would \nthe dollar continue to rebound, our hopes and spirit would rebound \nalso. The cynicism and negative attitudes that concern many of us are \nnot caused only by the haters and those who see only the worst in our \nGovernment and public officials. The depth of public concern that \nresults in hostility rather than activity is also caused by good, \ndecent public officials of both political parties who do not have the \ncourage to face our fundamental problems or who see an opportunity for \npartisan advantage rather than an opportunity to lift the Nation.\n  Yes, we can save the dollar.\n  We can also save the Nation.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, can I just indicate to my colleagues on both \nsides, I thank the managers of the bill. They have been spending the \nlast hour or so trying to work on some amendments. They are ready to \naccept a number of amendments. There will probably be a vote on the \namendment about to be offered by the Senator from Connecticut. We hope \nto get a short time agreement on that amendment and finish all the \namendments, except the habeas corpus amendments, tonight. So there will \nbe votes tonight. I advise and urge my colleagues, if they have to \nleave the Capitol, to take their beepers so we can notify them when the \nvotes will occur.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, I believe there is a \nSenator Robert Kerrey amendment pending; is that the pending business? \n[[Page S7753]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept that amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we are prepared \nat the same time to accept Hatch amendment No. 1233 relative to airline \ncarriers. I urge that both of these amendments be accepted. They are \nboth at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Delaware \nthat one amendment has not been called up.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1233 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n               (Purpose: To ensure air carrier security)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1233, the airline \ncarriers amendment, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1233 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 160, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 901. FOREIGN AIR TRAVEL SAFETY.\n\n       Section 44906 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 44906. Foreign air carrier security programs\n\n       ``The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     shall continue in effect the requirement of section 129.25 of \n     title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, that a foreign air \n     carrier must adopt and use a security program approved by the \n     Administrator. The Administrator shall only approve a \n     security program of a foreign air carrier under section \n     129.25, or any successor regulation, if the Administrator \n     decides the security program provides passengers of the \n     foreign air carrier a level of protection identical to the \n     level those passengers would receive under the security \n     programs of air carriers serving the same airport. The \n     Administrator shall prescribe regulations to carry out this \n     section.''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, first, let me state my support for the \namendment being offered concerning aviation security requirements to \nthe substitute to S. 735, the terrorism prevention bill, offered by \nSenator Hatch. I know that Senator Hatch has worked hard to include an \naviation safety issue in the bill, and I appreciate the chance to \nexpress my support for those efforts.\n  On December 21, 1988, Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, \nScotland, killing 270 people. This terrorist act triggered a time \nconsuming, all-out effort to find the people responsible. It also \ntriggered legislation enacted in 1990, to improve security for \ninternational and domestic air travelers.\n  Unfortunately, during negotiations over one particular provision, we \nwere unable to agree with the Department of Transportation on ensuring \nthat all international passengers traveling to and from the United \nStates would have the same types of protection. As a result, section \n105 of the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, Public Law 101-\n604, required the Administrator to develop a system of protection for \nU.S. carriers and a similar system for foreign carriers. In using the \nword ``similar,'' Congress did not intend that there would be enormous \ndisparities in security programs between U.S. and foreign airlines \nserving the United States. The security protection sought was intended \nto be as close to the same for all passengers, regardless of who \nactually provided the service. However, the administration, at the \ntime, insisted that section 105 use the word ``similar'' to give the \nFAA some discretion to address possible differences between foreign \ncarrier requirements and U.S. carrier requirements. Unfortunately, the \nregulations issued by the Department and FAA to implement section 105 \nwere not stringent enough. As a result, what we have seen is a wide \ndisparity in how foreign carriers screen passengers and how U.S. \ncarriers screen passengers.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example to show the differences. Let us \nsay that Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Lexington, KY want to go to Germany \nfor a vacation. They decide to take two different carriers. Mr. Jones \ntakes a United States carrier, and Mrs. Jones takes a German carrier. \nBoth leave from Cincinnati. Mr. Jones has to get to the airport at \nleast 2 hours in advance to go through all of the U.S. air carrier \nsecurity requirements, including security interviews, searches of \nbaggage, x-rays of baggage, and additional security questions at the \ngate. On average, these types of procedures can take any where from 90 \nto 120 minutes. Mrs. Jones, however, does not have to go through most \nif not all of those procedures. Her process time takes on average 20 to \n30 minutes. Certainly both Mr. and Mrs. Jones want the highest level of \nprotection reasonably necessary, but why should the procedures be \ndifferent? They should not, and Senator Hatch is attempting to correct \nthis imbalance.\n  Over the last several years, we have seen numerous terrorist \nincidents against foreign airlines, while the number against U.S. \nairlines has dropped. It seems the procedures may be working for our \nairlines. We now should extend those same types of protection to other \nairlines that transport U.S. citizens to and from our country. The goal \nof the legislation was to protect all of our citizens and all of those \npeople traveling to and from our country. The amendment restates and \nrestores that goal.\n  Senator Hatch has addressed the imbalance by requiring the same types \nof security screens for U.S. airlines and for foreign airlines serving \nthe United States. I support the change and appreciate his willingness \nto address the issue in a nonaviation bill.\n             Vote on Amendments Nos. 1208 and 1233, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Kerrey amendment No. \n1208 and the Hatch amendment No. 1233.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to adopting the amendments \nen bloc? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1208 and 1233) were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is prepared to proceed.\n\n\n                      Submitted Amendment No. 1244\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, I \nsay to my friend from Utah, we are prepared to accept several \nadditional amendments that are on the Republican list and the \nRepublican manager, as I understand, is close to being prepared to \naccept several amendments on the list of the Democrats.\n  Senator Levin has indicated on his amendment No. 1244 that he is \nwilling to withdraw that amendment under an assertion by the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee that he would hold hearings on the Levin-\nNunn-Inouye amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think that is a very important issue. It \nis the issue concerning lying to Congress, whether it should be only \nthose who lie under oath or those not under oath. I think it would be \nan interesting hearing. We will commit to holding a hearing for Senator \nLevin and the rest of the Senate on that issue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I do not think I have to ask unanimous \nconsent, but on behalf of Senator Levin then, I ask that his amendment \nNo. 1244 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 1244) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I was unaware of the fact that the managers \nof the bill had already introduced a statement relative to amendment \nNo. 1244, which I had submitted with Senator Nunn and Senator Inouye.\n  That amendment would provide some additional tools to Congress \ninvestigating terrorism and other activities that are of importance.\n  Under Hubbard versus United States, decades of case law was \noverturned wherein lying to Congress was illegal. This amendment would \nhave restored the law to what it was prior to Hubbard, wherein lying to \nCongress was illegal. I think we will have to restore that law so that \nwe have the investigative tools we need against terrorism. \n[[Page S7754]] \n  However, what I have agreed to do is to introduce this in the form of \na bill. The Senator from Utah has agreed that the committee would hold \nhearings into this bill and I thank him for that. I thank the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate I introduced today a bill on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Nunn, and Senator Inouye to strengthen Congress' \nability to investigate terrorism. The purpose of this legislation is to \nensure that Congress has the tools needed to investigate terroist acts \nand other matters of important public policy and obtain truthful \ntestimony.\n  The bill would accomplish four specific goals.\n  Let me discuss briefly each of the four provisions.\n  First, the bill would make it clear that false statements to Congress \nare a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. 1001. This clarification is \nneeded because a recent Supreme Court decision, Hubbard versus United \nStates, overturned decades of case law including its own precedent, \nUnited States versus Bramblett, and held that the plain wording of \nsection 1001 limits it to false statements made to the executive \nbranch. The bill would make it clear that the statute prohibits false \nstatements to the ``executive, legislative or judicial branch of the \nUnited States,'' including ``any department, agency, committee, \nsubcommittee or office thereof.'' This language is intended to restore \nthe courts' interpretation of section 1001 prior to the Hubbard \ndecision. In applying section 1001 to the judicial branch, the bill \nwould also incorporate the existing case law in a majority of circuits \nwhich, prior to Hubbard, had established a judicial function exception \nto the statute.\n  In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and other incidents in \nrecent years, Congress needs to take a close look at the causes and \nsolutions to terrorist acts. In examining witnesses, Congress needs to \nhave the most familiar of prosecutorial weapons to combat false \ntestimony, section 1001. At the same time, restoring the statute's \napplication to Congress as it existed prior to the Hubbard decision is \nnot to say that section 1001 can't be improved. I understand the Senate \nJudiciary Committee is planning hearings on this statute and may wish \nto legislate some changes. I support that process. The question is what \nhappens in the meantime--do we leave section 1001 off the books for \nsome time or do we get it back on the books now with respect to \nCongress?\n  False statements to Congress ought to be illegal, and we ought to act \nnow to get that law back on the books.\n  Getting the law back on the books is also important, by the way, for \nanother reason. Last month, every Senator filed a financial disclosure \nstatement. Until we amend section 1001, none of those financial \ndisclosure statements are subject to criminal enforcement under section \n1001. In this time of low public confidence in Congress, we shouldn't \nbe letting ourselves off the hook by failing to take this opportunity \nto apply section 1001's prohibition on false statements to ourselves, \nin the same way we apply it to the executive branch.\n  Second, the bill would make it clear that obstruction of a \ncongressional inquiry by an individual acting alone is a criminal \noffense under 18 U.S.C. 1505. This clarification is needed because a \n1991 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision, United States versus \nPoindexter, held that section 1505 ``is too vague to provide \nconstitutionally adequate notice that it prohibits lying to the \nCongress.'' The decision reasoned that, by using the term \n``corruptly,'' section 1505 may prohibit only those actions which \ninduce another person to obstruct congressional inquiry, and not those \nwhich, in themselves, obstruct Congress. In other words, the court held \nthat a person who induces another to lie to obstruct Congress violates \nsection 1505, but a person who alone obstructs Congress is outside the \nreach of the statute.\n  No other Federal circuit has taken a similar approach. In fact, other \ncircuits have interpreted ``corruptly'' to prohibit false or misleading \nstatements not only in section 1505, but in other Federal obstruction \nstatutes as well, including section 1503 prohibiting obstruction of a \nFederal grand jury. These circuits have also interpreted the Federal \nobstruction statutes to prohibit the withholding, concealing, altering, \nor destroying documents.\n  Our bill would affirm the interpretations of these other circuits. \nSpecifically, the amendment would include a definition of ``corruptly'' \nin section 1515 of title 18 which provides definitions for the entire \nchapter of Federal statutes prohibiting obstruction of Federal \ninquiries. This definition would make it clear that section 1505 is \nintended to prohibit the obstruction of a congressional investigation \nby a\n person acting alone as well as when inducing another to obstruct \nCongress, and that this prohibition includes making false or misleading \nstatements to Congress as well as withholding, concealing, altering, or \ndestroying documents requested by Congress.\n\n  This bill is not intended to expand section 1505, but to clarify the \nconduct it was always meant to prohibit. Moreover, by limiting the \ndefinition of ``corruptly'' to how it is used in section 1505, we are \nnot intending to limit how this term is interpreted in other chapter 73 \nobstruction provisions. The definition applies only to section 1505 \nbecause the Poindexter decision interprets only that section, and we \nare unaware of any similar limitation on any other Federal obstruction \nstatute.\n  Third, the bill would make it clear that any Federal employee or \nofficer, acting in an official capacity, who resists a Senate subpoena \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1365 by claiming some type of privilege must have the \nwritten approval of the Attorney General and relevant agency head in \norder to avoid enforcement. This issue arose in one past congressional \ninvestigation, for example, when a Federal employee attempted to assert \nexecutive privilege without having any authorization to do so. That's \nwhy, in 1988, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a bill authored \nby Senator Rudman and Senator Inouye, S. 2350, containing this \nclarification. That bill was never taken up by the House--now is a good \ntime to resurrect it.\n  The Senate currently has explicit statutory authority, under 28 \nU.S.C. 1365, to obtain court enforcement of subpoenas issued to private \nindividuals and State officials. This statute does not, however, \nprovide for enforcement of subpoenas to Federal employees or officers \nacting in an official capacity, in order to keep what may be political \ndisputes between the legislative and executive branches out of the \ncourtroom. The problem has been to determine when an employee is acting \nwithin his or her official capacity. Requiring written support for the \nemployee's actions from the Attorney General and agency head ensures \nthat the individual is acting in compliance with and not contrary to \nthe decisions of his or her superiors.\n  By establishing this procedural requirement, the bill does not \naddress the underlying issue of which executive branch officials have \nthe authority to assert particular types of privilege--it simply says \nthat without having at least the written authorization of the Attorney \nGeneral and agency head, no subpoenaed Federal employee, acting in his \nofficial capacity, has a legal basis for resisting enforcement of that \nsubpoena. In the case of executive privilege, for example, I and other \ncolleagues believe that only the President may assert that privilege. \nOn the other hand, it is possible that other statutory privileges may \nprovide grounds for resisting a subpoena, such as the Privacy Act, and \nmay be properly asserted without the President's personal involvement. \nThe bill to section 1365(a) does not attempt to resolve these types of \nissues. Rather it says that a Federal employee can avoid enforcement of \na Senate subpoena only by having the written authorization of the \nAttorney General and agency head to assert any privilege in opposition \nto that subpoena.\n  The fourth and final provision of the bill is also taken from the \nRudman-Inouye bill that passed the Senate. This provision would make it \nclear that Congress may compel an immunized individual to provide \ntruthful testimony in depositions as well as hearings. In the past, \nsome individual granted immunity from criminal prosecution by Congress \nhave refused to provide testimony in any setting other than a hearing \non the ground that the relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. 6005, was limited to \nappearances ``before'' a committee, while the comparable judicial \n[[Page S7755]] immunity statute applied to proceedings ``before or \nancillary to'' court or grand jury appearances. The bill would reword \nthe congressional immunity statute to parallel the language in the \njudicial immunity statute, and make it clear that Congress can grant \nimmunity and compel testimony not only in proceedings before a \ncommittee but also in depositions conducted by committee members of \nstaff. Again, this provision was approved by unanimous consent as part \nof the Rudman-Inouye bill that passed the Senate in 1988, but was never \nconsidered by the House.\n  If Congress is to investigate terrorism or any other issue important \nto the public, congressional committees must have clear authority to \npunish false statements and obstruction, enforce subpoenas and compel \ntruthful testimony. Our bill would help provide that clear authority.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''\n                           Amendment No. 1205\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe there is a Pressler amendment No. \n1205 that has been called up but set aside; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been authorized by the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Pressler, to withdraw that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment No. 1205 is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 1205) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my Democratic \ncolleagues, I believe that we will be able to accept--and we are \nclearing this now--the Brown amendment No. 1229, as amended, and the \nMcCain-Leahy amendment No. 1240 that relates to special assessments, \nand the Shelby amendment No. 1230.\n  It is my hope and expectation that the Republican manager of the bill \nmay be able to accept, with some possible modification, Senator Nunn's \namendment No. 1213 on posse comitatus, and Senator Leahy's amendment \nNo. 1247 on foreign policy.\n  But while we are trying to work that out, I suggest that maybe it is \nappropriate for the Senator from Connecticut to proceed. Mr. President, \nif I have not already, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a primary \ncosponsor to the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I spoke to this amendment at length earlier \ntoday and yesterday. I yield the floor.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1247, As Modified, to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To give the President authority to waive the prohibition on \n              assistance to countries that aid terrorists)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send to the desk on behalf of Senator \nLeahy a modification to the Leahy amendment No. 1247.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Leahy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1247, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 18, strike lines 18 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 620G.

If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1247), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are just awaiting the modification \nlanguage on Senator Brown's amendment 1229. As soon as we have that and \nhave a chance to look at it, it will be sent to the desk. We will ask \nthat it be considered and we will accept that as well.\n  We will also accept in a moment, I believe, Senator Shelby's \namendment relating to fertilizer research, amendment No. 1230.\n  Now that we have interrupted the Senator from Connecticut 12 times--\nbut we are making progress here; we are accepting important \namendments--I will at the end of the comments by my friend from \nConnecticut urge we accept additional amendments.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nthe Lieberman amendment No. 1215, pursuant to a 20-minute time \nagreement to be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me express my \nthanks and gratitude to the Senate majority leader, to the Democratic \nleader, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and to the ranking \nDemocratic member for breaking what looked to be the coming of gridlock \non an issue and a problem on which none of us want gridlock, and we \nshould not allow it to exist. I think we have now limited the number of \namendments, and we have clearly accepted some across party lines. And \nwe are quite appropriately moving toward doing something to put us \nsquarely against those who would terrorize America.\n  Mr. President, when I came to the Senate, I got interested in this \nthreat of terrorism because it seemed to me, particularly after the \ncold war ended, that we in America might surprisingly find our security \nthreatened more directly, our lives threatened more directly by \nterrorists than we had enduring the long years of the cold war by a \nheavily armed enemy. The reason is that there are extremist movements \nthroughout the world. There are, sadly, extremist movements within our \nown country who practice acts of terrorism either to carry out a \npolitical purpose or to create panic and insecurity and chaos in our \nsociety.\n  I thought we ought to begin to act and do something about that. We \nconducted hearings and we visited with experts. Mr. President, these \ninquiries into the problem of terrorism led me to this sad conclusion, \nwhich is that it is very difficult to defend against terrorists in a \nway that gives absolute security in the sense that they, by their \nnature, as we have seen in our time, will strike at undefended targets. \nIn the aftermath of the events in Oklahoma City, we might increase \nsecurity at Federal and public buildings, and one could imagine that we \ncan surround every public building in America with security guards, and \nyet the terrorist bent on destruction and chaos will tragically go down \nthe street and strike at a public building or an office building or a \nplace where people gather.\n  So it seems to me that the best defense against terrorism, \ninternational and domestic, is an offense. And the offense is to be \nprepared, to keep an eye and an ear out for those who would commit \nterrorist acts.\n  None of us wants to stop people from saying what they believe in this \ngreat democracy and writing and demonstrating what they believe. But \nwhen some group has indicated or given reason to law enforcement \nauthorities to believe that they are capable of, or are planning or \nconsidering a criminal act, I want our Government to be there. I want \nour Government to be listening. I want our Government to have \nundercover agents there so that we can [[Page S7756]] strike to stop \nthose terrorist acts, those violent acts, such as the awful assault in \nOklahoma City, before they occur.\n  Mr. President, that is the purpose of this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1215 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to revisions of existing \n                   authority for multipoint wiretaps)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 1215 to \n     Amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Insert at the appropriate place in the amendment the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . REVISION TO EXISTING AUTHORITY FOR MULTIPOINT \n                   WIRETAPS.\n\n       (a) Section 2518(11)(b)(ii) of title 18 is amended: by \n     deleting ``of a purpose, on the part of that person, to \n     thwart interception by changing facilities.'' and inserting \n     ``that the person had the intent to thwart interception or \n     that the person's actions and conduct would have the effect \n     of thwarting interception from a specified facility.''\n       (b) Section 2518(11)(b)(iii) is amended to read:\n       ``(iii) the judge finds that such showing has been \n     adequately made.''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with what in law \nenforcement circles is called a multipoint wiretap. It is a very rare \nkind of electronic surveillance that is tied to the movements of the \nsuspected criminal rather than to the particular telephone line he or \nshe is using.\n  For all other wiretaps except these rare multipoint taps, law \nenforcement officers have to convince a court that there is probable \ncause to believe that a specific phone is being used to facilitate an \nongoing crime, where a judge is persuaded that a criminal is moving \naround and using different phones or locations for the purpose, on the \npart of that person, to thwart interception, which is the wording in \nthe law today. However, the judge may authorize a multipoint wiretap. \nWith such a court order, the criminal's conversations can be listened \nto through wiretaps on those telephones that the criminal actually ends \nup using.\n  Let me point out again that what has to be shown here is that the \nperson is moving around and using different phones or locations for the \npurpose of thwarting electronic interception. Now, no interceptions may \ntake place until a specifically named individual is using the phone. So \nlaw enforcement officers must first establish, through physical \nsurveillance, through observation during the 30-day life of these \norders--they are limited to 30 days--that the targeted individual is \nactually using the phone. If someone else begins to use the phone and \nthe targeted individual is not part of that conversation, the wiretap \nmust stop--even, surprisingly, if other criminal activity is being \ndiscussed.\n  Now, because of these standards, these obstacles, these requirements, \nmultipoint wiretaps are actually quite rarely used. They have, however, \nproved, according to testimony submitted by Deputy Attorney General \nJamie Gorelick to the Judiciary Committee, highly effective tools in \nprosecuting today's highly mobile criminals who may switch phones \nfrequently for many reasons. Some may move from one cellular phone to \nanother in order to defraud the phone company. Others may switch from \nphone to phone because it is consistent with the kind of ruthless lives \nthey lead. Others may be changing phones to avoid being tapped, and \nthose are the people --particularly if they are considering carrying \nout a terrorist act of violence--that I am concerned about in \nintroducing this amendment. Changes in technology make the likelihood \nthat anyone, including criminals, of course, is going to use many \ndifferent phone lines in the course of a day.\n  Under current law, unless law enforcement can establish that \ncriminals are switching phones with the specific intent to thwart \ndetection, surveillance, a wiretap, a multipoint wiretap cannot be \nobtained from a court. That is the law. Proving specific intent in such \na situation is very difficult--even where someone may be moving so \nfrequently that a standard wiretap on a particular phone is effectively \nuseless.\n  So my amendment would allow courts to authorize multipoint wiretaps, \neither where law enforcement could persuade a judge that a criminal was \nchanging phones frequently for the purpose of avoiding interception, or \nwhere the very fact that the criminal was moving around and changing \nphones had the effect of thwarting surveillance, regardless of why he \nor she is doing it. And that would ease the difficult task of proving \nthe intention of the criminal to thwart detection. It captures \nsituations also where the target is frequently moving and changes \nphones for any reason.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not change, in any respect, \nprotections in existing law against abuse of these multipoint wiretaps. \nFor instance, no application for a multipoint wiretap may be filed by \nany Federal law enforcement officer without the approval of top Justice \nDepartment officials. They have to go right to the top for approval. \nAnd, of course, a judge cannot authorize a multipoint tap without \nfinding probable cause that a specific person is committing a crime or \ncriminal act.\n  So this is not going to invite any wanton abuse of wiretap authority. \nThe wiretap cannot begin until law enforcement has verified that the \ntarget--even after the court orders it--is using the particular phone \nand only the communications of that person can be intercepted. If other \nconversations are heard and a conversation involving a target person, \nfor instance, turns out to be personal, the tap has to be turned off. \nGiven the highly secretive nature of most terrorists, given the fact \nthat they are operating in a sophisticated way, and just as all the \nrest of us, moving around using phones, cellular phones, electronic \nsurveillance is one of our best weapons once we have reason to believe \nthat a criminal act, terrorist act, is being carried out, to find out \nwhat the intention of the perpetrator or terrorist is, and to stop that \nact before any innocent victims are hurt or, God forbid, killed.\n  The amendment that I am offering was in the President's original \nbill. I think it is modest and narrowly circumscribed, but enhances the \nability of law enforcement officers to help.\n  Mr. President, how much of the 10 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Senator has 3 minutes and 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, finally, under current law, let me say \nthat these tools are used very sparingly but effectively. I certainly \ndo not anticipate their being used very often in our battle against \nterrorism, whether the terrorists be domestically or internationally \ninspired.\n  However, I do want to be sure that when our law enforcement \nofficials--fighting and working to protect our safety--need these \ntools, that they will be ready and waiting so that swift and certain \npreventive action can be taken.\n  We owe that to our law enforcement officials. But truly more to the \npoint, we owe it to the millions and millions of Americans, innocent \npeople going about their daily lives, who deserve as best we are able \nto be protected from the hard and thoughtless hand of death that \nterrorism would wreak upon them.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement.\n  I yield so much of the remainder of my time as desired by the \ndistinguished ranking Democrat of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator \nfrom Delaware [Mr. Biden].\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  The way I look at this, this is real simple. Real simple and basic. \nThere is nothing real complicated about this. Right now, this can be \ndone. Right now, all that has to be proven is there is an intent to \nevade. All we are saying is if the effect is evasion, and the effect is \navoiding the tap on the phone that they think may be tapped, that they \nbe able to do it based on the effect, not having to prove an intent to \nthwart eavesdropping. I want to make that clear to everyone here.\n  This still requires an initial finding that this guy is probably a \nbad guy. It still requires a judge to say that there [[Page S7757]] is \nprobable cause to look at this guy. This is no great leap in anything. \nCivil libertarians should not worry, law enforcement should be \nencouraged, and the American people should feel some mild additional \nsense of security in being able to do what the Senator from Connecticut \nis suggesting that the President very badly wants, and that was deleted \nfrom the bill.\n  It is my hope that our friends on the Republican side may be able to \naccept this amendment. If there is any time left, I ask that it be \nreserved.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Lieberman's amendment, \nwhich I believe will improve the current authority for what are known \nas roving, or multipoint, wiretap orders. This provision was proposed \nby the President, but is not included in the Republican substitute.\n  Multipoint wiretaps allow law enforcement officers to obtain a \njudicial order to intercept the communications of a particular person--\nnot just for one specified phone, as with most wiretap orders, but on \nany phone that person may use.\n  A recent prosecution will help illustrate how multipoint wiretaps \nwork. In that case, involving one of the world's biggest international \ndrug traffickers, agents determined that a courier was contacting his \nbosses by using a number of randomly chosen public phones around his \nhome.\n  A multipoint wiretap was obtained and up to 25 phones were identified \nto prepare for the chance that the target would use one of them. \nAnytime he used one of those phones, the agents were able to initiate a \nwiretap. Interceptions obtained in this way led to 53 Federal \nindictments and a 19-ton cocaine seizure.\n  Under current law, the Government can get a multipoint wiretap order \nonly if it can show that the defendant is intending to thwart \nsurveillance--usually by switching from phone to phone.\n  The Senator's amendment would allow multipoint wiretaps where the \ndefendant's conduct has the effect of thwarting surveillance--\nregardless of the defendant's intent.\n  This small change is desperately needed by law enforcement--because \nwhile officers will often be able to show that the individual is \nchanging telephones frequently enough to make a standard wiretap \nimpossible, it may be difficult to prove that he is doing so with \nintent to thwart a wiretap.\n  Changes in technology have made this proof even more difficult. A \ntarget may use more than one phone for reasons other than avoiding \nsurveillance.\n  The current intent requirement virtually requires an officer to wait \nto apply for a multipoint wiretap until the officer somehow hears the \ntarget say ``I am changing phones because I don't want the cops to tap \nthis conversation.''\n  Let me give you an example of one ongoing case in which a multipoint \nwiretap order could not be obtained because of the requirement to prove \nintent to thwart surveillance.\n  In this case, the targets are using electronic scanning equipment to \ncapture cellular phone and identification numbers from unsuspecting and \ninnocent phone users.\n  The particular targets in this case are cloning a new phone number--\nallowing them to use it without authority--every 2 weeks or so and \nthereby effectively avoiding surveillance.\n  The officers are hard-pressed to prove that every time the target \nclones a new number, he did so for the purpose of thwarting \ninterception--rather than simply to avoid paying for the calls.\n  Because wiretaps are extraordinarily powerful and intrusive, the law \ncontains numerous protections against abuse.\n  The Government must, of course, prove probable cause that a specific \nperson is committing a crime--as with any wiretap application.\n  The application must be approved by a top Justice Department \nofficial--the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the \nAssociate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or an Acting \nAssistant Attorney General;\n  The judge must find that the standards for issuing a multipoint order \nhave been met;\n  The application must identify the person believed to be committing \nthe offense and whose communications are to be intercepted;\n  The Government must minimize the intrusiveness of a wiretap--by \nturning the wiretap off when the conversation is personal, for \ninstance; and\n  Any interception cannot begin until law enforcement has clearly \ndetermined that the target is using that particular phone. And once the \ntarget is off the phone, the interception must end.\n  In practice, this latter requirement means that if the agents are out \non surveillance and they see their target move to a new phone, they can \nbegin interception of the new phone. It also means that if their target \nhands the phone to his buddy, they must stop the interception \nimmediately.\n  A multipoint wiretap order does not allow the police to intercept a \nslew of different telephones in a number of places and monitor every \nconversation on those phones.\n  The amendment proposed by the administration, and offered in modified \nform by Senator Lieberman, would not change any of the basic \nprotections in the current multipoint wiretap statute.\n  The narrow, but necessary change that the Senator's amendment would \nmake is not intended to make this authority a run-of-the-mill everyday \nsurveillance technique.\n  I understand that multipoint wiretaps are used sparingly--in fact, \nthe Justice Department reports that last year only 10 multipoint \nwiretaps were conducted and that only 4 have been approved to date this \nyear.\n  The new authority provided by this amendment must be utilized \nresponsibly. And I reiterate that Senator Lieberman's amendment will \nnot change any of the protections built into the multipoint wiretap \nstatute besides broadening the intent standard to include an effects \nstandard.\n  We must provide law enforcement with the tools they need to meet the \ndemands of an ever-complex and changing criminal element. In today's \nincreasingly mobile and high-technology world, we need to provide law \nenforcement with the ability to move with the criminals. It is now \nsimply too easy for law enforcement to get left behind as the criminals \nmove from place to place and from phone to phone.\n  At the same time we must be cautious not to infringe on civil \nliberties. I believe the amendment Senator Lieberman offers today \naccomplishes both of these goals.\n  It is a narrow but necessary expansion of the multipoint wiretap \nauthority--but one that also includes protections against abuse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 10 minutes; the \nSenator from Connecticut has 1 minute and 6 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, initially I opposed the President's version \nof this amendment. It is a fundamental tenet that the right of the \npeople to be secure in their persons, house, papers, and effects \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures limit the permissibility in \nGovernment interception of electronic communications.\n  In other words, the Government cannot listen to our private telephone \nconversations whenever it feels like it.\n  Indeed, because wiretaps are so intrusive in conducting in secret and \nunder circumstances in which the subject generally has a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy, the courts and Congress have required that \nFederal law enforcement officers meet a heightened burden of necessity \nbefore using a wiretap.\n  At the same time, we have to recognize that no one has a right to \nengage in illegal activity. Criminals consistently adapt the latest \ntechnology to further the aim of completing their illegal acts without \ndetection.\n  As the criminal use of technology has evolved so, too, must we, \nenhancing the capabilities of law enforcement who, after all, must \nprotect our citizens from these types of crimes.\n  The balance between a person's right to be free from unreasonable \nsearches and his or her expectation to live free from crime is a \ndelicate one. We have to consider seriously any proposal with the \npotential to upset the balance.\n  Now, I believe that the President's language could very well have \ndone that. Briefly, the President's original proposal would have \nprovided law enforcement with an expanded authority [[Page S7758]] to \ntap phones in a narrow subset of cases in which the target would be \nsubject to a normal wiretap, but changes phones so quickly it is \ndifficult to get a separate wiretap order for each phone.\n  These are the so-called roving wiretaps. Essentially, this enables \nthe Government to follow a person around and listen to that person's \ntelephone conversation regardless of what phone the person is using.\n  I think this is problematic. So, our staff has worked with Senator \nBiden and his staff to narrow the provision considerably.\n  Now, under this provision, the Government can receive a court-ordered \nwiretap if the suspect knows he is under surveillance and intentionally \nthwarts that surveillance. That is country law.\n  The proposed amendment, which is substantially different from the \nPresident's language, permits law enforcement to get a multipoint \nwiretap only if the suspect intends to thwart surveillance, or if by \nthe course of his conduct he effectively thwarts surveillance.\n  I think this is a reasonable compromise. It is important that we give \nlaw enforcement the critical tools it needs to combat terrorism and \nprotect our free society, but because we are a free society we must be \nleery of expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement \nintemperately. We must not, even in the aftermath of tragedy such as \nOklahoma City, trade off our constitutional protections for a generic \npromise of increased security.\n  I, personally, am confident that the proposed amendment by my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut satisfies civil liberty concerns and \nmeets the needs of law enforcement at the same time.\n  I intend to vote for this amendment. I know there are others who feel \ndeeply that they do not want to vote for it. As manager of the bill on \nour side, I intend to vote for it. I would encourage others to do so, \nas well.\n  I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time and to stack the \nvote at some later time at the decision of the majority leader.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend from Utah \nfor his support of the amendment. I appreciate the terms at which the \nsupport was given, that this is a balanced amendment.\n  It gives extra authority to law enforcement to protect the rest of \nus, but does so in a way that gives proper regard to the liberties that \nwe all cherish.\n  Again, this extra wiretap authority cannot be used unless such judge \nhas concluded there is probable cause to believe that the individual \nwho will be the target of this multipoint tap is, in fact, committing a \ncriminal act.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield back the time that I have \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the balance, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on or in relation to the pending Lieberman amendment occur \nlater this evening at a time to be determined by the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1210, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 1210. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1210), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP.\n\n       Prohibition of Voter Registration as Proof of \n     Citizenship.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a \n     Federal, State, or local government agency may not use a \n     voter registration card (or other related document) that \n     evidences registration for an election for Federal office, as \n     evidence to prove United States citizenship.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on this side, we find this a good \namendment. We are prepared to accept it. I understand the other side is \nacceptable to that, as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, after consulting with Senator Ford and \nothers, we are prepared to accept the modification. We thank the \nSenator from Georgia for so modifying. We accept the amendment as sent \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Georgia, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1210), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 1230 to Amendment No. 1199 and Amendment No. 1241, En \n                                  Bloc\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept Shelby amendment \nNo. 1230, the fertilizer research study, and I understand that the \nRepublican side is willing to accept the Heflin amendment numbered 1241 \nrelated to sarin gas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of them be called up, and then at \nthe appropriate time, I am willing to accept them both en bloc.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are prepared to accept both of those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will now be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for Mr. Heflin for \n     himself, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 1230 \n     to amendment No. 1199, and for Mr. Heflin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1241, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n                           Amendment No. 1230\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``In \n     conducting any portion of the study relating to the \n     regulation and use of fertilizer as a pre-explosive material, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with and receive \n     input from non-profit fertilizer research centers and include \n     their opinions and findings in the report required under \n     subsection (c).''.\n\n                           Amendment No. 1241\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LISTING OF NERVE GASES SARIN AND VX AS A HAZARDOUS \n                   WASTE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3001(e) of the Solid Waste \n     Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6921(e)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(3) Nerve gases.--\n       ``(A) Listing.--The Administrator shall list under \n     subsection (b)(1) the nerve gases sarin and VX.\n       ``(B) Application of regulatory requirements.--Standards \n     and permit requirements under this Act and regulations issued \n     under this Act relating to the nerve gases sarin and VX shall \n     not apply to--\n       ``(i) any sarin or VX production facility of the Department \n     of Defense that is in existence on the date of enactment of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(ii) the storage of sarin or VX at any Department of \n     Defense designated chemical weapons stockpile in existence \n     prior to the date of enactment of this Act.''.\n       (b) Immediate Action.--The listing of the nerve gases sarin \n     and VX required by the amendment made by subsection (a) shall \n     be deemed to be made immediately on enactment of this Act, \n     and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     shall in fact make the listing as soon as practicable after \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) No Studies or Proceedings.--Notwithstanding any other \n     law, it shall not be necessary for the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to make any studies, engage \n     in any rulemaking or other proceedings, or meet any other \n     requirement under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6901 et seq.) or any other law in support of the directive \n     made by subsection (b).\n       (d) Criminal Penalty for Mere Possession.--Section \n     3008(d)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6928(d)(2)) is amended by inserting ``or knowingly possesses \n     the nerve gas sarin or the nerve gas VX'' after ``subtitle''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while I have strong reservations about the \namendment offered by Senators Heflin and Shelby, I have also been \ninformed that the amendment has been cleared by all other Senators--\nincluding Senators, from both sides, representing the committee of \njurisdiction, the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  For these reasons, I will not object to the amendment offered by \nSenators Heflin and Shelby and require a roll [[Page S7759]] call vote. \nBut, I would simply note my opposition for the Record.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We urge the adoption of both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1230 and 1241) were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1240\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators McCain and Leahy, I \ncall up an amendment numbered 1240 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has that amendment been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that it has not been \nagreed to.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1240) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee is working on the possibility of \naccepting or working out an agreement on the Nunn-Biden amendment on \nposse comitatus. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. There is some language difficulty. We are \ntrying to work it out. We hope that we can.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to the Senator from Michigan that I would like to \naccept his amendment No. 1228. We are attempting to find out whether \nthat can be cleared. If we can clear that amendment, it will take \nanother few minutes to determine that.\n  I suggest, with the majority leader here, that while we are clearing \nsome of these additional amendments, if there is anyone who has an \namendment that we cannot clear who is ready to go with their amendment, \nI would encourage them to move on their amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: Is the Leahy amendment No. 1238 at \nthe desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1238\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe both sides are in a position to \naccept that. Our side will accept it if the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware will.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1238) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1206, As Modified, to Amendment No. 1199\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize assistance to foreign nations to procure \n                    explosives detection equipment)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is here. He \nhas an amendment, No. 1206, relating to foreign assistance. We have \nbeen discussing this with him. We think it is a good amendment. We have \nsuggested a few minor changes relative to the amount of distribution \nunder the amendment.\n  I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania is prepared to send his \namended amendment to the desk, and we are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the referenced amendment would provide \nU.S. assistance to other countries to procure explosives detection \ndevices and other counterterrorism technology. At the request of the \nState Department, it has been broadened to include support for joint \ncounterterrorism research and development with allied countries.\n  This amendment would be very effective for counterterrorism \ninternationally by providing up to $3 million in assistance to foreign \ngovernments to work on counterterrorism technologies. Obviously, when \nyou talk about counterterrorism and explosives- detection devices at \nairports, U.S. citizens, for that matter citizens and residents all \nover the world, will be affected by the availability of the sort of \ncounterterrorism technology that will be supported under this \namendment.\n  It has very broad support. I am pleased that the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and the distinguished ranking member are \nprepared to accept it.\n  The amendment has been modified to limit the amount of support to $3 \nmillion annually because the total authorization under the program is \n$15 million. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, does the Senator need to send that \namendment to the desk?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I send the modification to the desk, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1206), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n       On page 22, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       ``(b)(1) Assistance to Foreign Countries To Procure \n     Explosives Detection Devices and Other Counterterrorism \n     Technology.--Subject to section 575(b), up to $3,000,000 in \n     any fiscal year may be made available--\n       ``(A) to procure explosives detection devices and other \n     counterterrorism technology; and\n       ``(B) for joint counterterrorism research and development \n     projects on such technology conducted with NATO and major \n     non-NATO allies under the auspices of the Technical Support \n     Working Group of the Department of State.\n       ``(2) As used in this subsection, the term `major non-NATO \n     allies' means those countries designated as major non-NATO \n     allies for purposes of section 2350a(i)(3) of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n       On page 22, line 19, strike ``(b)'' and insert ``(c)''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: Has the amendment been adopted, \nbecause we still have a problem on this side, I have been informed. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment still be considered pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The amendment is cleared. I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1206), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am one Senator who is wondering what is going on here. \nI do not know if there are going to be votes or not. We have been here \nall day. What is happening? Can I go home and have dinner with my kids? \nThat is what I wanted to know. Are we really going to stay and vote, or \nare we going to stack them?\n  Mr. DOLE. We are going to vote tonight. We worked out about a dozen \namendments. We have made a lot of progress in the last 2 or 3 hours. We \n[[Page S7760]] hope to dispose of all of the amendments, with the \nexception of the habeas corpus amendment, which we will do tomorrow \nmorning. We will vitiate the cloture vote and do habeas. We need to \ncomplete action tonight. I think it may be another hour before the \nvotes begin. If you ate fast, you might make it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I ask the distinguished majority leader, if we are \ngoing to have votes, why not stack them in the morning.\n  Mr. DOLE. We do that every day around here and we never finish \nanything. I would like to do the voting tonight on all but habeas and \nvitiate the cloture and finish habeas and start on telecommunications \nsometime tomorrow morning.\n  We have some momentum now that we do not want to lose. A lot of \npeople may not be willing to do this in the morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If this is momentum, I would hate to see this place \nreally move.\n  I just wanted to know if we could stack them in the morning.\n  Mr. DOLE. You could try to go home, but you probably would not be \nable to eat much.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We started off about 4 hours ago with 60-some amendments. \nWe are down to--not counting the habeas--about four or five. So we \nreally have been working in his absence. I wanted to assure him of \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that, and I think the \nprogress is commendable. I think the Senator from Iowa and others would \nappreciate knowing if we are going to stack votes. Do we have any \nnotion of when the votes might be stacked?\n  Mr. DOLE. We hope that by 9 o'clock we will start voting. There will \nprobably be three or four votes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But that is not locked in at this point?\n  Mr. DOLE. One vote has been ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. No time is set. It was tonight. I believe we are \ngoing to have several more votes. We are waiting for a couple Senators \nto come and offer their amendments. There are very tight time \nconstraints on each of the amendments. If they get here --quite \nfrankly, what happened is we have come over here and people have \nstarted to offer amendments and they have ended up being accepted. So \nthat seems to work as a catalyst to get them accepted, too.\n  There is one vote ordered for tonight without a time certain on it. \nThere are probably going to be two or three additional votes.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield. If the managers continue to work \nas they have, and we only had one vote left, I would put that off until \ntomorrow. But I am not certain when we are going to be able to tell \npeople that. If we have two, three, or four, I would like to complete \nthe votes tonight. That will save us a couple of hours in the morning. \nI think if the managers will continue to be flexible on these \namendments, and we will avoid a lot of votes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have expressed in the past concern \nabout the provisions of the pending legislation which authorize secret \nproceedings in certain instances. It had been my hope that we might \nhave been able to deal with the problem of suspected terrorists without \nbeing involved in secret proceedings.\n  I had been working on an amendment which would have dealt with people \nwho were in the United States illegally, who could be proceeded against \nand deported because of their illegal status without the need for the \ngovernment to rely on secret evidence.\n  I have very grave concerns about the constitutionality of any \ndeportation proceeding in which secret evidence is used and there is \nnot a right of confrontation. Technically, deportation proceedings are \ncivil in nature and therefore do not require the full scope of \nconfrontation rights which are available in criminal cases.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that deportation proceedings are civil in \nnature, the courts have held that due process does attach to a \ndeportation proceeding. It may well be when the case reaches the \nSupreme Court of the United States that this due process requirement \nwill be found to pick up the right of confrontation under the sixth \namendment.\n  Certainly, the due process clause of the 14th amendment, which is \napplied to the States, does pick up the confrontation provision of the \nsixth amendment. By analogy, it may well pick up confrontation rights \nas it is applies to deportation proceedings, as well.\n  But in reviewing the existing deportation laws, there would be a much \nbroader change necessary to deport those who are here simply illegally \nwithout getting into the question of evidence as to terrorism.\n  There is obviously a grave concern about disclosure of confidential \ninformation involving terrorism, because sources and methods could be \ncompromised. I understand the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, is \ngoing to offer an amendment which will require a summary of the \nclassified information being relied on by the government in the \ndeportation proceeding. Frankly, that does not go as far as I would \nlike to see the protections go, but that may be all that can be \naccomplished under the current bill.\n  We will subsequently be taking up the immigration laws generally and \nit may be that at that time we can craft procedures which will protect \nthe public interest of getting out of the country people who are known \nterrorists, where there is substantial evidence to that effect, even \nthough that evidence cannot be produced in a context of confrontation, \nwhich someone would be entitled to under a criminal proceeding.\n  I am also concerned about the reliance on classified evidence in \ncases involving the Secretary of the Treasury's designation of foreign \norganizations as terrorist organizations. The substitute represents a \nsubstantial improvement to the bill as introduced. Under the procedures \nin the substitute, there is de novo review by the courts of the \nSecretary's designation. That means a court will take a fresh look to \nsee if the designation by the Secretary of the Treasury of an \norganization as a terrorist organization is, in fact, well founded.\n  Under the provisions which have been added to the substitute, a \nsummary of the classified evidence presented to the judge will be \nprovided to the organization, and in such cases there will be a \nrequirement that the evidence be clear and convincing that the \norganization is, in fact, a terrorist organization. The summary will \nhave to be sufficient to allow the organization an opportunity to \ndefend.\n  I think that these provisions have gone about as far as is possible \nwith the practicalities at hand, and that they would really be risking \nvery sensitive information and sources and methods if full \nconfrontation was possible where someone is to be deported, and where \nthe witnesses would have to be produced where there is a designation by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury of an organization as being engaged in or \nsupporting terrorist activities.\n  I think, Mr. President, we really are dealing as much as we can under \nthe present legislation. A good bit of this bill will have to be tested \nin court, and I do express these concerns about the constitutionality \nof some of these provisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1203 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to resolve one of the issues \nthat I think is resolvable, on the Smith amendment.\n  What the Senator is concerned about is he wanted a floor on the \namount of damage, so that incidental damage by citizens who are engaged \nin peaceful or nonviolent demonstrations or protests would not trigger \nthe antiterrorism language of this bill.\n  I ask my colleague from Delaware if he would agree that a definition \nof ``terrorist'' in this legislation is not intended to apply to \nAmerican citizens [[Page S7761]] engaged in a nonviolent or peaceful \ndemonstration, or demonstrations or protests where incidental damage to \nproperty may occur.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Utah that \nthat is not the intention.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the real thing the Senator has been worried about \nis whether if pro-choice and right-to-life people are picketing and \nexercising their rights of free speech, and some incidental damage \noccurs--just to choose two organizations in society--that if there is \nno intention to commit terrorist actions, and if the demonstrations are \nintended to be peaceful and nonviolent, that somehow or another this \nlaw would not be triggered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, this is not intended to \ncapture incidental damage. Say someone in a peaceful protest trips over \na hedge or tromps on a flowerbed. That is not the intention here. The \nkey here is ``incidental damage'' that is not intended. That would not \nbe captured by this legislation, as I read the legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nDelaware. They have alleviated my concerns. We talked about this quite \nsome period of time, and I very much appreciate it. We have gone now to \nthe spirit and intent of what we mean by a ``terrorist,'' and I am \nsatisfied and more than delighted to withdraw the amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1203) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for \nworking on this. We are making a great deal of headway here. If we can \njust continue for a short while, we might be able to finish this phase \nof the bill within a relatively short period of time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1243 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n(Purpose: To amend the penalty provisions for the use of explosives or \n                             arson crimes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my understanding that both sides are \nwilling to clear the Levin amendment No. 1243. So, on behalf of the \nSenator from Michigan, I call up that amendment, No. 1243, at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. HATCH], for Mr. Levin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1243.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 15, strike lines 1 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(f)(1) Whoever maliciously damages or destroys, or \n     attempts to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an \n     explosive, any building, vehicle, or other personal or real \n     property in whole or in part owned or possessed by, or leased \n     to, the United States, or any department or agency thereof, \n     shall be imprisoned for not less than 5 years and not more \n     than 20 years. The court may order a fine of not more than \n     the greater of $100,000 or the cost of repairing or replacing \n     any property that is damaged or destroyed.\n       ``(2) Whoever engages in conduct prohibited by this \n     subsection, and as a result of such conduct directly or \n     proximately causes personal injury to any person, including \n     any public safety officer performing duties, shall be \n     imprisoned not less than 7 years and not more than 40 years. \n     The court may order a fine of not more than the greater of \n     $200,000 or the cost of repairing or replacing any property \n     that is damaged or destroyed.\n       ``(3) Whoever engages in conduct prohibited by this \n     subsection, and as a result of such conduct directly or \n     proximately causes the death of any person, including any \n     public safety officer performing duties, shall be imprisoned \n     for a term of years or for life, or sentenced to death. The \n     court may order a fine of not more than the greater of \n     $200,000 or the cost of repairing or replacing any property \n     that is damaged or destroyed.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. The \namendment I am offering would amend an important penalty provision in \nthis bill. Section 107 of the bill amends title 18, section 844 of the \nUnited States Code, which establishes penalties for anyone who damages \nor destroys or attempts to damage or destroy by fire or explosive any \nbuilding, vehicle or real or personal property of the U.S. Government. \nThe current law establishes a penalty of imprisonment up to 20 years or \na fine or both. And if death results, a sentence of life imprisonment \nor death can be imposed.\n  The Hatch substitute does two things. It establishes a minimum amount \nfor the fine that can be imposed and it establishes a minimum number of \nyears for a prison sentence, 5 years in a case involving only the loss \nof property and 7 years in a case involving injury to a person. It \nreturns the current penalty for cases in which death results.\n  The concern here is that the amendment seems to provide that a court \ncould impose a fine without the minimum prison sentence that the bill \nprovides. What this amendment does is make it clear that the minimum \nprison sentence, which is provided for in the bill, must be provided \nand if a fine is imposed it is not and cannot be in lieu of a prison \nsentence but must be on top of a prison sentence.\n  I think that is the way it should be when we do have minimum prison \nsentences, that we should not in the same provision allow for there to \nbe a fine in lieu thereof, but it must be in addition to such a minimum \nsentence.\n  I understand this has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1243) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have an amendment. I am working with \nSenator Specter on his version. I think we will have a Specter-Simon \namendment very shortly.\n  What it does is it changes the provision if an alien is to be \ndeported. Under the present bill, if there is classified information \nthat alien is not informed of anything. That is a clear violation of \ndue process and I think the courts would toss it out.\n  What we have suggested, and we are working on the precise language \nnow, but what we are suggesting is that the Attorney General would \nprovide an unclassified synopsis and the court would have access to the \nclassified information to make sure the unclassified synopsis is \naccurate. And then that would be given to the person who is charged \nwith being deported. That gives some reasonable access. We provide for \nreview and appeal procedures. We are still working on some details.\n  Senator Specter may want to comment on this. We may offer the \namendment tomorrow or later tonight, I am not sure, but I think we are \nvery close to an accord.\n  I might add the accord is in line with the original draft of the \nlegislation that is before us. But I think the legislation, if it is \nnot amended, frankly, the courts would toss it out as violating due \nprocess.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania may want to comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in comments a few moments ago before the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois came to the floor, I had referred \nto my concerns about deportation with secret evidence. I had referred \nat that time to an amendment which Senator Simon was considering. We \nhave since conferred and are really joining forces in the amendment \nwhich I had filed with the amendment which Senator Simon has just \nreferred to.\n  I believe this amendment goes a substantial distance in protecting \nthe rights of someone who is subject to deportation. As I had said \nearlier this evening, I have great concerns about the fairness of the \nprocedure where [[Page S7762]] there was not confrontation, that is \nwhere the evidence is alleged to be present that the person is a \nterrorist but that evidence is not presented because it would disclose \na source very injurious to the Government. So what we are trying to do \nhere is to find an accommodation.\n  If this were a criminal proceeding, there is no doubt that there \nwould be a requirement of confrontation under the U.S. Constitution. \nBut deportation proceedings are classified as civil proceedings. But \nnotwithstanding the classification of deportation proceedings as civil, \nthe courts have also said that there has to be due process even in a \ncivil proceeding. It is entirely possible when this provision is \nreviewed in court that it may be determined that due process will \nrequire confrontation just as the due process clause of the 14th \namendment is applicable. The States picks up the requirement of \nconfrontation applicable to the Federal Government in a criminal \nproceeding. But I think that the amendment which Senator Simon and I \nwill be offering will go a long way to raising the standard of \nfairness.\n  The one item which we are still wrestling with on the drafting is \nwhether there will be a requirement that the evidence be clear and \nconvincing in order to deport someone without confrontation on the \nevidence which is presented as to terrorism. But however we work out \nthat last detail, we are in the process of having the drafting \nfinalized now.\n  We are doing this because Senator Simon and I have just put these two \namendments together trying to work them out. Perhaps it might be even \nbe acceptable to the managers. But that remains to be seen. But that is \nthe sense of what we are doing at this moment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my hope is that it would be acceptable to \nthe managers. I think this is in the line of the spirit of what is \nbeing offered. It is in line with the original draft. It certainly is \nin line with the sentiments over the years that I have worked with \nSenator Biden, and I also believe Senator Hatch also would find this \nacceptable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to speak very briefly to the \npoint.\n  First of all, I would like to thank both Senators for moving such an \nimportant amendment in this hour, and at a time in which I do not think \npeople fully understand how significant this amendment is. Our \nadversarial system of justice requires that defendants be given \nevidence to be used against them so that they can prepare a defense. It \nis kind of a basic element of our entire system. At trial that is what \ncross-examination is all about, to test the reliability and the basis \nof information given by a witness. The right to see and confront the \nevidence against oneself is I think a fundamental premise of the due \nprocess clause of the Constitution. Unseen and unheard evidence simply \ncannot be defended against. How does one defend themselves? The courts \nhave recognized that fact time and again.\n  The Supreme Court has said that secrecy is not congenial to truth \nseeking. No better instrument has been devised for arriving at the \ntruth than to give a person in jeopardy every serious notice of the \ncase against him and an opportunity to meet him. That was in the Joint \nAnti-Fascist Refugee Committee versus McGrath, 1951.\n  The court also said:\n\n       Certain principles have remained relatively immutable in \n     our jurisprudence. One of these is that where the Government \n     action seriously injures an individual and the reasonableness \n     of the action depends on factfinding, the evidence used to \n     prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the \n     individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is \n     untrue.\n\n  That was in Green versus McGlory, 1959.\n  So to sum it up all, the dangers posed by secret evidence are neither \nhypothetical nor are they imagined. Shortly after World War II an \nAmerican soldier sought to bring his German bride back to the United \nStates. She was excluded at the border on the grounds that she was a \nsecurity risk. The Supreme Court concluded secret evidence could be \nused against her since persons first entering the United States do not \nhave the same right. However, the public outrage forced the Government \nto give her a hearing. And the supplier of the secret evidence turned \nout to be a jilted lover and she was admitted.\n  Secret evidence runs counter to all the principles underlying due \nprocess of law and our judicial system, and it cheapens our system by \nplacing in doubt the accuracy of its decision.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject the secret evidence and to vote to \nreturn this provision to the form in which Senators Dole and Hatch \nfirst introduced it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Specter-Simon amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, on the Democratic side \nthere are four nonhabeas corpus amendments remaining including the one \nthat is pending. So that would be three. On Senator Kennedy's amendment \nthere is an effort to try to reconcile that. Also, Senator Lieberman is \nto be voted on. Simon, immigration; Kennedy, immigration; Lieberman; \nand the others are all habeas.\n  On the Republican side, how many amendments? Senator Abraham; Senator \nBrown; Senator Kyl; Senator Smith has been resolved; and two Specter \namendments. But I understand that one of those may have been drafted \nand is the pending amendment, and the other one may not be offered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, that is my understanding. I ask my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania. But amendment No. 1237, secret proceedings, has been \nfolded into the Specter-Simon amendment.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So the only one is the terrorist organization amendment of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, No. 1239. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I had commented earlier, I am \nsatisfied now that the revision of the bill is about as far as we can \ngo in providing the addition of the de novo hearing by the court, that \nthe classifications of terrorist organizations is well-founded \nfactually, and there again that the evidence which is not subject to \nconfrontation meets a similar standard with respect to Specter-Simon.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator will not move his \nterrorist organization amendment because he is now satisfied.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I could respond to the leader, on the disposition of \nthis amendment, in all probability we are prepared to accept the \nAbraham amendment, and I would urge Senator Brown to come and offer his \namendment on Ireland now.\n  Senator Nunn has just come in the Chamber. Hopefully, he can work out \nwith the Republicans their concerns, and if not I hope we would be \nprepared to move that.\n  So as I look down the Republican list, the only nonhabeas amendments \nleft--because we have accepted most of them--are the Abraham amendment, \nwhich I believe we can accept, and the Brown amendment, which I hope \nSenator Brown will come and offer. There are no other nonhabeas \namendments on that side.\n  On the Democratic side, the Kennedy immigration deportation \nproceeding, I hope we will be able to accept, and hopefully the Nunn \nprovision will be accepted. And they are the only two nonhabeas \namendments that we have left after we vote on Specter-Simon and \nLieberman. I guess that is it. They are the only two we have--and \nBrown. If we can get Senator Brown to come and offer his amendment, it \nwill be very helpful.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to Senator Brown, wherever he may be, that \nwe would very much appreciate his coming to the floor and offering his \namendment.\n  Senator Nunn is here so maybe we can negotiate, if he is willing to \nnegotiate that amendment, or if not have a debate on that amendment.\n  I understand Senator Specter and Senator Simon will be ready \nmomentarily to offer their amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again to review the bidding, the only \namendment that Senator Specter has remaining is the one that he and \nSenator Simon just debated. The Simon amendment listed as S. 1234 also \ndrops because that has been merged. So Senator Simon has no other \namendment, other than the pending amendment, left. And that would \nleave, as I said, again only for debate Brown and possibly Nunn, Biden, \nand possibly Kennedy, but I hope we can accept the \n[[Page S7763]] Kennedy amendment. I believe we will be able to accept \nthe Abraham amendment in a moment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7752-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7763-S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIP TO GUATEMALA, COLOMBIA, HAITI\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the period of May 26-29, 1995, my \ncolleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Michael DeWine, and I \ntraveled to Guatemala, Colombia, and Haiti for a firsthand view on \nmatters of concern to the Intelligence Committee and to the Senate. The \nfollowing represents my own personal impressions of the facts learned \nand my own judgments.\n  Our first stop was Guatemala. On April 5, 1995 the Senate \nIntelligence committee held an open hearing on the role of the CIA in \ntwo human rights cases. In one case, the committee learned that a \nGuatemalan, Col. Roberto Alpirez, might be implicated in the murder of \nAmerican farmer and innkeeper Michael DeVine on June 8, 1990. During \nthe open hearing, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Bill \nStudeman acknowledged that the CIA received information in October 1991 \nthat shed light on the possible presence of Colonel Alpirez in the \ninterrogation of Mr. DeVine. Admiral Studeman also acknowledged that \nthe CIA failed to inform the intelligence committees of the House and \nthe Senate regarding this information which should have been done.\n  In the second human rights case, Ms. Jennifer Harbury, the widow of a \nGuatemalan guerrilla Commander, Efraim Bamaca, repeatedly sought to \nlearn the fate of her husband. Both Jennifer Harbury and Carole DeVine, \nthe widow of Michael DeVine, were eloquent and dynamic hearing \nwitnesses. They pleaded for our assistance to learn the facts of their \nhusband's deaths, and, in the case of Ms. Harbury, the location of his \nremains. We were also interested to learn what happened in the cases of \nNicholas Blake, Sister Diana Ortiz and Helen Mack.\n  While the committee's staff is analyzing many documents pertaining to \nthese cases, we traveled to Guatemala to learn more about these matters \nand to determine the willingness of the Guatemalan government to \nprosecute anyone legally responsible for these deaths. Our visit also \nsought to convince the Guatemalan Government that human rights are a \ntop United States Government priority.\n  Our first meeting was with Guatemala's President Ramirez deLeon \nCarpio, where we focussed on the Guatemala peace process and pressed \nhard on human rights, particularly the DeVine and Bamaca cases. \nPresident deLeon is the former human rights ombudsman in Guatemala.\n  We expressed the U.S.'s wish to assist the peace process and our \nstrong interest in resolving the DeVine and Bamaca cases. President \ndeLeon responded by noting the serious challenges his government has \nhad to face since he took power. He also stated he had confronted \nserious corruption in the Congress and the Courts by changing them \nthrough legal means. Finally he noted that he had succeeded in \nachieving a 5 percent economic growth and had to persevere in a \nconfrontation with powerful interests in the private sector to achieve \nmajor fiscal reform which he characterized as being tougher than \ndealing with the Army, the guerrillas, and corrupt politicians \ncombined.\n  When we pressed on the DeVine and Bamaca cases, President deLeon said \nthat both represented part of the general problem of impunity in \nGuatemala. He noted a difference between the cases. He characterized \nthe DeVine case as a common crime. Six soldiers and a Captain Contreras \nhad been convicted. It is widely believed that Captain Contreras was \nthe leader of the group that murdered Michael DeVine, but after his \nsentencing to 20 years in jail, he escaped, perhaps with the complicity \nof the Guatemalan Army which had him in custody.\n Therefore, to cast this as strictly a common case of crime appears \ninaccurate in that the involvement of the Guatemalan military points to \nmore than a common crime. In my view, not enough has been done to \napprehend him in spite of the fact that the government of Guatemala had \nplaced a $17,000 reward for the Captain's recapture.\n\n  President deLeon stated that he would be calling Venezuelan President \nCaldera about the possibility that the Captain is a fugitive in that \ncountry and that the FBI and Interpol have been asked to join in the \nsearch for him abroad. The President added that he expected to send a \nspecial commission to Venezuela to pursue this and thought that \nPresident Caldera would be willing to cooperate.\n  Later we met with Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez. The DeVine \nand Bamaca murders figured preeminently in our discussions. We \nunderscored several times the importance of the cases to bilateral \nrelations. General Enriquez stated investigations into both killings \nwere going forward, but he drew a distinction between Bamaca and \nDeVine.\n  General Enriquez also reported to us that he was hopeful that Captain \nContreras had been captured just prior to our meeting. The next day, \nMay 27, the newspapers were filled with front page stories of the \ncapture of Captain Contreras. But a check with our Embassy in Venezuela \ndid not shed any more light in the veracity of this reporting.\n  The capture of Captain Contreras would be a critical element in the \nresolution of this crime. It might shed light on why and whether other \nmilitary officers were involved. President deLeon noted that he had \nsuspended Colonels Catalan and Alpirez pending investigation of their \ninvolvement in a crime, a step basically unprecedented in Guatemala. We \nalso learned of the rumored existence of a tape reportedly held by \nColonel Alpirez which allegedly recorded instructions to him to cover \nup the DeVine case.\n  President deLeon asserted that he would go as far as necessary in \npursuing the DeVine case which he added would benefit the army as an \ninstitution in Guatemala.\n  In regard to Guatemalan guerrilla commander, Efraim Bamaca, President \ndeLeon made the same distinction between this case and the DeVine \nmatter as did General Enriquez. In President deLeon's view Bamaca was a \nproduct of war and to push prosecution of that case would de-stabilize \nthe army. He felt the Bamaca case should be referred to the Historical \nClarification Commission, otherwise known as the ``truth commission,'' \nestablished by agreement between the government of Guatemala and the \nURNG guerrillas to deal with the many abuses committed during the war \nonce it was over.\n  Nonetheless, we continued to press hard. We asked the President to \nmake an example of the Bamaca case as a human rights violation. It was \nimportant to the relations between the government of the United States \nand the government of Guatemala. I noted that this is a special case \nand added that if the body of Efraim Bamaca were found, it would \nrepresent a big step forward.\n  I noted how the testimony of both Jennifer Harbury and Carole DeVine \nto the Intelligence Committee on April 5th had been very moving and, \nhow Colonel Alpirez was linked to both cases. President deLeon \nacknowledged as a former human rights ombudsman he knew that there was \nno excuse for torture even in war. Many priests had also been murdered. \nHe stated he wished to strengthen the bi-lateral relations with the \nU.S. and improve Guatemala's image. However to pursue the Bamaca case \nwould threaten the peace process and the stability of the government. \nIn his words, it would put a ``sword of Damocles'' over the head of all \n2,500 Guatemalan military officers who had seen hundreds of their \ncomrades die in the 34 years of the conflict. What was needed, he \nadded, was a peace agreement and genuine reconciliation, not \nrecriminations.\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\n  We also met with human rights activists, including Ronald Ochaeta, \nDirector of the Archbishop's Human Rights Office; Helen Mack, sister of \nthe slain Myrna Mack; and Karen Fisher de Carpio, the daughter-in-law \nof the slain two-time Presidential candidate and newspaper publisher \nJorge Carpio. Jorge Carpio was a cousin of the President deLeon Carpio. \nThey requested that the United States government reveal all the \nintelligence about Guatemalan military people who may have been \ninvolved in human rights crimes. They also expressed the fear that, \nafter the Guatemalan army returns Captain Contreras to justice in \nGuatemala, that the United States Government and human rights pressure \nwill diminish; and absent that pressure, the Guatemalan Army will no \nlonger even remotely respond to human rights concerns. They termed the \nGuatemalan justice system as being dysfunctional. Within the Army, they \nfelt that there is brotherhood in which only some individual members \nare involved in a variety of illegal activities: human rights \nviolations; stealing of cars; and drug trafficking, etc. They expressed \nthe view that while most members of the army may not have been involved \nin these activities, all have taken ``a blood pact'' not to disclose \nany details on their fellow military comrades.\n  I agree with the human rights activists and monitors that only with \nthe pressure of the U.S. Government and the international community \nwill cause the Army to improve its human rights performance in the \nfuture and to shed light and sanctions on past crimes.\n  Our next stop took us to Colombia where we met with President Ernesto \nSamper, his Foreign Affairs Minister, Rodrigo Pardo, and his Defense \nMinister, Fernando Botero. We met the leaders of this country in \nCartagena. Our discussions centered on narcotics trafficking and \nterrorism. While the United States has been riveted for years over the \ntaking of hostages in the Middle East, scant attention has been paid to \nhostage taking in South America, particularly in Colombia where \npresently seven Americans are being held by the terrorist group known \nas FARC. I raised these issues with our Ambassador Myles Frechette and \nwith President Samper. The view of both of them is this hostage taking \nis different in the sense that it is financially motivated. Terrorists \nhave been taking Americans and other foreign nationals captive for \nransom purposes. In meetings with President Samper, Senator DeWine and \nI pressed for more action to prevent the taking of these hostages and \ngreater efforts to release them. In my view, not enough has been done \nin this area.\n  Of paramount importance were our discussions regarding narcotics \ntrafficking. The conditional certification of Colombia by the President \non February 28, 1995 has clearly had an impact on the government on \nColombia.\n  Prior to February 1995, there had been sporadic support by some \nquarters of the Colombian political establishment in preventing \nsignificant damage to the Colombian drug syndicates. For example, in \n1994 the government of Colombia took no legislative steps to reverse \nits 1993 criminal procedures code which made it very difficult to bring \nmid-level and senior syndicate heads to justice. As a result, following \nthe trend set in 1993, there were no arrests, incarcerations, or fines \nimposed on such traffickers. In addition, a number of frequently \nconvicted traffickers were able to benefit in significant reductions to \ntheir sentences pursuant to Colombia's woefully inadequate sentencing \nlaws.\n  In 1994, total drug seizures through interdiction efforts were above \nthose of 1993 but didn't reach the levels accomplished in 1991 as the \nU.S. Government has recommended. Performance on eradications has \nsupposedly improved; but results have not met expectations. In 1994 \nthere were no senior government officials indicted for corruption. The \nColombian Congress did not pass bills introduced by the Samper \nadministration to counter money laundering activities. There was \ninsufficient progress to detect and remove corrupt officials. There \ncontinues to be a problem with drug syndicate control of foreign soil \nsuch as San Andreas Island.\n  The conditional certification by the Administration on March 1, 1995 \nof\n Colombia's counter-narcotics effort appears to have changed Colombia's \nattitude. Since that date, Colombia has conducted over 170 operations \nagainst the Cali cartel by attempting the capture of drug king pins and \nby the efforts to disrupt their operations.\n\n  Nonetheless, it appears that only the surface has been scratched. The \nCali cartel is well financed and sophisticated. A captured warehouse \ndisclosed a great amount of electronic equipment ranging from computers \nto direction finders. In addition, the cartel is controlling the phone \ncompanies and conducting telephone taps to uncover counter-narcotics \ndirected against it.\n  The bottom line is that Colombia still is the largest supplier of \ncocaine into the United States. Much more needs to be done to counter \nthis trafficking. For one, legal cooperation between the United States \nand Colombia needs to be reinvigorated. We have been forced to shut \ndown evidence sharing because Colombia has been misusing what we have \nprovided to date; and, as a result, families of witnesses have been \nkilled.\n  We raised directly with President Samper, the need for extradition \nand reform of Colombia's legal system. While Colombian law now \nprohibits extradition, we urged President Samper to revisit this issue. \nIf extradition is not re-instated, Colombia should consider seriously \nthe proposal to allow drug traffickers to be tried in the United States \nand then serve their sentence in Colombia. This would serve to preserve \nevidence and remove the case from the inadequate Colombian code of \ncriminal law. A longer range alternative is for Colombia to transfer \nproceedings to an international criminal court which could be \nestablished.\n  President Samper acknowledged that drugs are a major problem not only \nin Colombia, but also internationally. He said that he intends to make \nevery effort to stop the Cali cartel. It is not enough to destroy the \nfields, labs and aircraft used in trafficking, but also to have \neffective interdiction and to counter money laundering.\n  When I raised the need for reinstating extradition, he noted the past \nramifications: drug traffickers countered by killing four Presidential \ncandidates and 63 magistrates in a reign of terror. In his view, \nextradition would come at a high cost. He was frank in stating he \nsupported the Constitutional amendment to stop extradition to the U.S. \nIf his judicial reform does not work in the next 2 to 3 years, he \nstated that he would consider other alternatives such as extradition. \nHe was also confident that he will dismantle the Cali cartel within 2 \nyears.\n  He also found the idea of an international criminal court worth \nconsidering.\n  On Monday, May 29, 1995 we met with Ambassador William Swing in Haiti \nalong with Maj. Gen. Joe Kinzer. General Kinzer is Commander of the \nUnited Nations mission in Haiti as well as senior commander of U.S. \nforces there.\n  To gain some perspective on Haiti, it is instructive to note the \nvolatility of this country over its last 190 years. It has had 21 \nconstitutions, 41 heads of state, 7 of whom have served more than 10 \nyears, 9 of whom have declared themselves heads of state for life, and \n29 of whom were assassinated or overthrown.\n  It has been a country of great political and economic instability, \nover-populated, possessing limited resources and having the worst \nenvironmental degradation in the hemisphere. It is the poorest nation \nin the western hemisphere.\n  Prior to the return of President Aristide, the country had 3 years of \nillegal, military de facto government, 8 years of chronic instability \nand some 30 years of Duvalier family dictatorship. Since the 1991 coup, \nthe country has\n suffered a 30 percent loss of its gross domestic product and its \ntreasury has been emptied. It has the highest birth rate in the western \nhemisphere. Between September 30, 1991 and the return of Aristide in \nOctober 1994, imposed severe sanctions and the toughest embargo ever in \nthe western hemisphere. The human rights violations by the Cedras \nregime escalated. This resulted in many Haitians attempting to escape \nthe politically oppressive climate. On July 4, 1994 over three thousand \nHaitians fled in one day.\n\n  On September 19, 1994 over 21,000 U.S. troops were deployed there \nwithout [[Page S7765]] any loss of life. Paramilitary forces of Haiti \nwere disbanded and its leaders were arrested. General Cedras departed \nin exile on October 13, 1994. President Aristide returned on October \n15, 1994.\n  General Kinzer noted that he is operating under Presidential Decision \nDirective 25, U.N. Security Council Resolution 940 and Chapter 6 of the \nU.N.'s charter which technically limits him to observing, reporting, \nand verifying. It does not give him full authority for peacekeeping. \nNonetheless, General Kinzer has set up rules of engagement which, in \nessence, give him the ability to carry out peacekeeping. General Kinzer \ndid point out the importance of intelligence support to the U.S. forces \nthere and also to the United Nations forces. While such intelligence \nwas not as critical as in Somalia, he warned that any efforts to \nrestrict the flow of intelligence of U.N. forces would not be in the \nbest interests of U.S. forces who are participating.\n  Ambassador Swing emphasized the serious challenges which lie ahead. \nFirst, there is a need to create a credible security force by February \n1996 when the mandate for U.N. forces ends. There is a need to \nstimulate badly needed economic development in the country. Third, the \nelectoral process must be fair for the parliamentary elections in June, \nand the Presidential elections in December. Finally, there needs to be \nimprovement in Haiti's justice system.\n  We met with President Aristide who pointed out the need for security \nforces in the number of about 7,000, which he expects to have ready by \nFebruary 1996. Given the rate of training timetable, it is dubious that \nthis can be achieved. President Aristide represented that the machinery \nis in place for a fair and democratic process for the forthcoming \nelections.\n  There are some rumors that President Aristide may not comply with the \nHaitian Constitution and step down when his term ends. We questioned \nhim on this. When asked if there were any circumstances under which he \nwould stay on as President, his response was ``no''. He stated that the \nConstitution requires him to leave no matter what the majority of \nHaitians might say. In response to what more he would want from the \nUnited States, he responded by saying he would be ashamed to ask for \nmore money. What is needed, in his view, is more economic development, \nmore job opportunities, and a need for a free market.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any further proceedings on the \npending legislation, I thought this might be a good time to make a \nbrief report on a trip which Senator Michael DeWine and I made on \nbehalf of the Senate Intelligence Committee to Guatemala, Colombia, and \nHaiti over a 4-day period, May 26 through May 29, with the principal \nfocus in Guatemala being to determine the civil rights abuses on the \nmurder of an American innkeeper, Mr. Michael DeVine, and a Guatemalan \nsoldier, Commander Bamaca.\n  These deaths had been the subject of an Intelligence Committee \nhearing where there were very, very substantial questions of violations \nof human rights.\n  At that Intelligence Committee hearing in April, Mrs. Carol DeVine \ntestified about the brutality with respect to her husband, Michael \nDeVine, and the perpetrators have not yet been brought to justice. Ms. \nJennifer Harbury, the wife of Commander Bamaca, testified as to the \ndifficulties in determining what had happened to her husband and even \nto finding his body.\n  On our trip, we talked about the matter with President deLeon of \nGuatemala and also with the Minister of Defense and urged that every \neffort be made by the Guatemalan Government to find out exactly what \nhad happened to the American citizen, Michael DeVine, and Commander \nBamaca.\n  President deLeon pledged the full efforts of the Guatemalan \nGovernment as to the murder of Mr. DeVine but had a difference of \nopinion with respect to Commander Bamaca, which he classified as a \nmilitary incident. We urged in the strongest possible terms President \ndeLeon proceed to vindicate human rights and make a thorough \ninvestigation as to both of their matters.\n  In Colombia, we had extensive discussion with ranking Colombian \nofficials, including President Samper, principally on the issues of \nterrorism and narcotics trade.\n  I must say, Mr. President, that there is insufficient evidence being \ntaken by the Colombian Government on the very serious problems of \nnarcotics traffic which comes to the United States. Since efforts had \nbeen undertaken with some success in the mid to late 1980's, those \nefforts have materially decreased with Colombia now refusing to have \nextradition. It is my judgment that our efforts in interdiction and the \nfunds which we are expending in that direction could much more usefully \nbe placed on the so-called demand side in the United States on \neducation and on rehabilitation. It seems that the more acreage or \nhectares of ground taken away from the growth of cocaine or drugs in \nLatin America, in Colombia, illustratively, or Ecuador or Peru, the \nmore replacement drug growth occurs in those States.\n Although we are spending a tremendous sum of money, there has been no \nsignificant lessening of the source of supply. We have to maintain a \nvery active and vigorous law enforcement program in the United States \nto combat supply. But our efforts of international interdiction have \nbeen largely unsuccessful, and I think the Government of Colombia is \ndoing much less than ought to be done.\n\n  Senator DeWine and I finished our short trip with a one-day stay in \nHaiti, where we had an opportunity to visit with President Aristide and \nvisit with General Kinzer. There a real effort has been made by the \nU.N. forces to establish order, and U.N. forces are scheduled to leave \nin February of next year. There will have to be significant \naccomplishments by the Haitian Government to have a local police force \nto handle the issue.\n  Rumors had come to our attention that there might be a question as to \nwhether President Aristide would step aside after a new President is \nelected late this year when his term is set to expire in February. \nSenator DeWine and I were very direct and blunt in asking the question \nas to whether he did intend to step down, and he was unequivocal in \nstating that he would do so. We noted that a real sign of progress in \nHaiti would be whether there would be an orderly transition of \ngovernment from one elected President to his successor. In light of \nwhat has happened in Haiti historically, that would really be a \nremarkable achievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure due process in deportation proceedings)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have now completed the drafting of the \namendment which had been discussed earlier. I now send this to the desk \non behalf of myself, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Kennedy.\n  This amendment provides that under circumstances where the Department \nof Justice is unwilling to present a witness or witnesses to establish \nthat an alien is a terrorist, that there will be an unclassified \nsummary presented, sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense.\n  It has provisions which protect the government in a number of \ndirections, and ultimately in the situation where there is a threat \nthat the alien's continued presence in the United States would likely \ncause serious or irreparable harm to the national security, or death or \nserious bodily injury to any person, and the provision of either \nclassified information or classified summary that meets a higher \nstandard would cause, again, irreparable harm or the possibility of \ndeath or serious injury, then there may be an unclassified summary \nprepared by the Justice Department sufficient to allow the alien to \nprepare a defense.\n  There is a provision here for an interlocutory appeal. It would be my \nhope this might be acceptable on both sides, or if not, that it would \nreceive an affirmative vote by the Senate. I send this amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.

Mr. President, the bill before the Senate contains a \nprocedure to permit the use of secret evidence in deportation \nproceedings for suspected terrorists. Many Members have reservations \nabout this procedure, and I believe the sponsors have made a genuine \nattempt to strike a balance between our concerns about terrorism and \nthe fundamental requirements of due process.\n  However, another section of the bill, section 303, contains no such \nbalance. It permits the use of secret evidence in any deportation case, \nwithout any due process safeguards at all. The amendment I am offering \nwould extend the same minimal due process safeguards to these \nproceedings that are available in terrorist cases, in the rare \nsituations in which classified evidence must be protected.\n  The terrorist deportation procedure in section 301 acknowledges the \nsensitive issues surrounding the use of classified evidence. It \nrequires a special designation by the Chief Justice of five Federal \njudges to keep the evidence secure and ensure due process.\n  However, section 303 allows secret evidence to be used in normal \ndeportation cases before any of scores of low-level immigration judges \nin the Justice Department, with no protection for either the classified \nevidence or the immigrant.\n  While this provision exempts permanent residents from its broad \nreach, there are others who reside in the United States under legal \nimmigration status who also deserve such protection, including the new \nspouses of American citizens. If we are to take the extraordinary step \nof permitting the use of secret evidence in general deportation \nproceedings, I believe the evidence and the immigrant should be \nafforded at least the same protections that we give to terrorists.\n  This can be done without unduly burdening the courts. The number of \ncases which rise to the level of requiring secret evidence to justify \ndeportation is extremely small.\n  The kinds of cases which could be subject to this procedure would \nhave substantial equities. The use of secret evidence should not be \ntaken lightly.\n  Under this procedure, the immigrant spouses of American citizens \ncould be deported with secret evidence. By law, these spouses are \n``conditional residents,'' not permanent residents, during their first \n2 years of marriage.\n  The same sort of equities apply to refugees. A Vietnamese refugee who \nfought on our side in Vietnam, who experienced years of re-education in \nCommunist concentration camps, and who has now lived here for many \nyears, but does not have permanent residence, would be subject to \nsecret deportation with illegally obtained evidence. His only offense \ncould be that he rescued a fellow soldier from Vietnam by allowing him \nto pose as a relative.\n  There are also 14,000 Chinese students in this country, many of whom \nwere activists in the democracy movement in China. They qualify for \npermanent residence, but they have not yet received their green cards. \nThey could be subjected to this procedure.\n  There are 85,000 individuals whom the Immigration Service has allowed \nto remain in the United States because of special circumstances \nsurrounding their cases. They may have American citizen children with \ndisabilities requiring special attention that cannot [[Page S7767]] be \noffered in their parents' home country. These families have not been \ngiven permanent residence, but the courts have declared them \n``permanent residents under color of law.''\n  Some may argue that these are unlikely victims of this procedure. But \nthere is nothing in this language that prevents immigrants and refugees \nwith substantial ties to this country from being deported using secret \nevidence. Under this procedure, they may never know why they were \ndeported.\n  A long line of judicial decisions requires the protection of \nimmigrants under the fifth amendment from due process violations in the \ndeportation process.\n  The fifth amendment states that no person shall be ``deprived of \nlife, liberty or property, without due process of law.'' The Supreme \nCourt has consistently ruled that this protection means what it says, \nit extends to all persons within the United States, not just citizens.\n  As the Supreme Court stated in the Japanese Immigrant case in 1903,\n\n       This court has never held, nor must we be understood as \n     holding, that administrative officers, when executing the \n     provisions of a statute involving the liberty of persons, may \n     disregard the fundamental principles that inhere in ``due \n     process of law'' as understood at the time of the adoption of \n     the Constitution.\n\n  In 1915, in Whitfield versus Hanges, the Court outlined the \nrequirements of a fair deportation hearing, including the right to be \nnotified of charges, to cross-examine witnesses, and to see the \nevidence and have a fair opportunity to rebut it.\n  To underscore the gravity of deportation, the Supreme Court in 1921, \nin Ng Fung Ho versus White, observed that not only does deportation \ndeprive a person of liberty, but ``[it] may result also in loss of both \nproperty and life; or of all that makes life worth living.'' Again in \n1948, in Tan versus Phelan, the Court characterized deportation as ``a \ndrastic measure'' and ``the equivalent of banishment or exile.''\n  In 1976, Mathews versus Diaz, the Court noted, ``There are literally \nmillions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States. The \nfifth amendment, as well as the 14th amendment, protects every one of \nthese persons from deprivations of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law.''\n  In Landon versus Plasencia in 1982, the Court stated that the \ninterest of an immigrant facing expulsion from the United States ``is, \nwithout question, a weighty one. She stands to lose the right to stay \nand live and work in this land of freedom. Further, she may lose the \nright to rejoin her immediate family, a right that ranks high among the \ninterests of the individual.''\n  We are all concerned about addressing terrorism and expediting \nlegitimate deportation cases.\n  The bill before us contains a procedure in section 301 which permits \nour courts to handle classified evidence to decide the deportability of \naliens suspected of terrorism.\n  At a minimum, other deportees should be given the same protections as \nterrorists when it comes to using secret evidence against them. For \nthis reason, my amendment says that the use of evidence in other \ndeportation settings must follow what is being proposed for suspected \nterrorists. This means the evidence must be handled by designated \nFederal judges. And before the deportation proceeding is allowed to \ncontinue on the basis of the secret evidence, the judges must weigh the \nthreat which the presence of the person poses against the likely \nconsequences of revealing the classified information.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                           amendment no. 1225\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment that \nestablishes a clear standard of behavior other countries must meet in \norder to be eligible to purchase military equipment from the United \nStates.\n  It amends the Arms Export Control Act by adding a section which \nstates that no defense article or defense service may be sold or \nlicensed for export to a country unless the President has certified to \nCongress that the country is cooperating fully with the United Stats, \nor taking adequate steps on its own, to help achieve U.S. antiterrorism \nobjectives.\n  This amendment does recognize that certain transactions of military \nequipment do have a direct bearing on our national security, so it \nallows the President to waive the prohibition with respect to specific \ntransactions if he determines that they are essential to the national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  The United States is the leading exporter of military equipment in \nthe world. In fiscal year 1994, the United States sold some $12.86 \nbillion worth of defense equipment and services around the world. By \nand large, these exports serve the interests of the United States by \nhelping to build up the security of our allies. Improving our allies' \nabilities to defend themselves is one of the most effective ways we can \nadvance and protect our own interests abroad.\n  It is not unreasonable to expect a certain level of cooperation from \ncountries to whom we sell military equipment. Obviously cooperation in \ndefense matters is taken into consideration, as it should be, because \nof the clear benefit it brings to United States security interests.\n  But our security these days is affected by other, less conventional \nproblems. Today, terrorism poses a major threat to U.S. security \ninterests, and to our way of life. Because of that, we must demand and \nexpect cooperation from our allies to help us achieve our antiterrorism \nobjectives. When we share our most advanced military technology with \nour allies, we should be able to expect full cooperation in these \ncrucial areas.\n  For the most part, the commitment to combat terrorism is strong among \nour allies who purchase U.S. military equipment. Many of them know \nfirst-hand the scourge of terrorism, and have been deeply affected by \nit. Indeed, the State Department's 1994 Patterns of Global Terrorism \nreport describes some 321 international terrorist attacks in 1994, in \nAfrica, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Occasionally, \nhowever, we have been disappointed by the cooperation we have received \nin our antiterrorism efforts.\n  This amendment is designed to add an additional incentive for those \nstates to cooperate with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. We need their full \ncooperation in: Apprehending, prosecuting, and extraditing suspected \nterrorists; sharing intelligence to deter terrorist attacks; pressuring \nstate sponsors of terrorism to change their behavior; curbing private \nfundraising efforts for terrorist organizations within their country; \nand, taking actions to prevent or deter terrorist attacks. Where we \nhave signed agreements and treaties, they should be fulfilled in both \nletter and spirit. Where we do not have such agreements, our allies \nshould work with us to put them in place as quickly as practicable.\n  The threat of international terrorism demands that the civilized \nnations of the world band together to defend against those who would \nuse violence for political ends. This amendment will help ensure that \nthe United States gets the cooperation it needs from our allies to \nfight this threat.\n  Mr. BIDEN. For the sake of clarification, I would ask the Senator \nfrom California if the certification requirement in her amendment means \nthat a separate certification of a country's cooperation with U.S. \nantiterrorism objectives must accompany every notification of an arms \nsale sent to Congress under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control \nAct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, the certification procedure is designed to \nrequire one certification annually for each country that purchases \ndefense articles or defense services, or has them licensed for export, \nfrom the United States in a given fiscal year. Most certifications will \nprobably be provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, but a country \nthat is not certified at that time may, if eligible, be certified at \nany time prior to the first sale or export license to it in the fiscal \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1218 and 1225) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are perilously close to finishing all \nbut the habeas amendments. The Nunn-Biden [[Page S7768]] amendment on \nposse comitatus is either going to be debated very shortly or accepted \nvery shortly.\n  That leaves, I think, after the vote on the Specter-Simon amendment, \nwe will know then on the outcome of that vote, whether or not the \nAbraham amendment is still relevant. If Specter-Simon prevails, as I \nhope it does, then the Abraham amendment would be dropped.\n  The only amendment I am aware of on the Republican side which we do \nnot have any agreement on at this point--we thought we did--was the \nBrown amendment. If Senator Brown is available, we are ready to enter \ninto a very short time agreement and debate that amendment tonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again I think we are going to know in a \nmoment whether we will need to debate the Nunn-Biden posse comitatus \namendment, but in the meantime while that is being ironed out, I ask my \nfriend from Utah whether or not Senator Brown is available to introduce \nhis amendment. I think that is the only thing we have left.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Lieberman \namendment numbered 1215.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that Senator Brown is on his way over, and I \nwill chat with him.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader that I think \nwhen we dispose of the Brown amendment and we dispose of the Nunn-Biden \namendment, that other than habeas amendments, there is nothing left.\n  It is my understanding that the leader, at an appropriate time this \nevening, if we complete action on Nunn-Biden and Brown, would move to \nvitiate the cloture vote tomorrow.\n  I would assure the Senator, as well, we would withdraw all 5 \namendments relating to firearms or ammunition. They would not be \nconsidered on this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have not discussed that with the Democrat leader. That \nwould be my intention. They would be germane, in any event. No need to \nhave a cloture vote.\n  So, if we can complete action on all except habeas corpus, we would \nlike to start fairly early in the morning on the habeas corpus \namendments.\n  So is there anybody who has amendments? I guess Senator Brown is the \nonly one on this side?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Senator Brown is the only one who has a nonhabeas \namendment on the Republican side and the only one we have left on the \nDemocratic side, as I understand it, is Nunn-Biden.\n  Mr. HATCH. You have Abraham as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator points out the Abraham amendment is still on \nthe Republican side, and I have discussed this with Senator Abraham and \nhe points out to me that if Specter-Simon passes, then his amendment is \nredundant, is no longer necessary. It is only if Specter-Simon fails \nwould we go to the Abraham amendment, in which case we could accept the \nAbraham amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. So we are waiting on Senator Brown.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And waiting on a decision by our Republican colleagues \nwhether or not they can accept the Nunn-Biden posse comitatus \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1229 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very grateful to our distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, Senator Brown. Because, as much as he likes his \namendment regarding terrorist countries, it has hit a snag where it has \nhad an objection from both sides of the aisle.\n  In the interests of moving this bill forward he has authorized me to \nwithdraw that amendment at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Brown amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1229) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me say I know he has decided not to run \nagain, and this will probably hurt his reputation, but it is a pleasure \nto work with the Senator from Colorado. He is always reasonable. I \nthank him very much.\n  As Senator Eastland once said to me, ``I will come and campaign for \nyou or against you, whichever will help the most.'' Maybe if I said \nsomething negative it would help more but I really mean it. I thank him \nfor his cooperation. This is the second time he has moved this \nlegislation along. I truly appreciate it.\n  I want to correct something I said earlier. I referred to the posse \ncomitatus amendment as the Nunn-Biden amendment. That is not accurate. \nThis is not a minor point. It is the Nunn-Thurmond-Biden amendment. \nSenator Thurmond has been a leader in this issue and I did not mean in \nany way to leave him out. It is the Nunn-Thurmond-Biden amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1213 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the Attorney General to request, and the \n Secretary of Defense to provide, Department of Defense assistance for \n the Attorney General in emergency situations involving biological or \n                 chemical weapons of mass destruction)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am going to start with the explanation of \nthe amendment which I hope we will be voting on this evening. If the \nmajority leader would like to interrupt at any point in time, I know \nthere will be other things that will be coming up, I will be glad to \nyield and I invite that.\n  I am pleased to propose on behalf of myself, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Biden, and Senator Warner, an amendment to address a \nsignificant gap in the law regarding the use of chemical and biological \nweapons of mass destruction in criminal terrorist activities.\n  The Armed Forces have special capabilities to counter nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons. They are trained and equipped to \ndetect, suppress, and contain these dangerous materials in hostile \nsituations.\n  Most of our law enforcement officials do not have anything like the \ncapability that our military does in these unique circumstances. At the \npresent time the statutory authority to use the Armed Forces in \nsituations involving the criminal use of these weapons of mass \ndestruction extends only to nuclear materials. In my opinion, chemical \nand biological attacks on the United States, terrorist attacks, are \nmuch more likely than nuclear, although all would be horrible. Section \n831 of title 18, United States Code, permits the Armed Forces to assist \nin dealing with crimes involving nuclear materials when the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of Defense jointly determine that there is an \nemergency situation requiring military assistance. There is no similar \nauthority to use the special expertise of the Armed Forces in \ncircumstances involving the use of chemical and biological weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  In the wake of the devastating bombing of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City, with its tragic loss of life and disruption of \ngovernmental functions, I think it is appropriate to reexamine Federal \ncounterterrorism capabilities, including the role of the Armed Forces. \nI would also add that the Tokyo chemical attack in the subway is the \nkind of situation that very well could happen, also, in this country.\n  For more than 100 years, military participation in civilian law \nenforcement activities has been governed by the Posse Comitatus Act. \nThe Act precludes military participation in the execution of laws \nexcept as expressly authorized by Congress. That landmark legislation \nwas the result of congressional concern about increasing use of \n[[Page S7769]] the military for law enforcement purposes in post-Civil \nWar era, particularly terms of enforcing the Reconstruction laws in the \nSouth in and suppressing labor activities in the North.\n  There are about a dozen express statutory exceptions to the Posse \nComitatus Act, which permit military participation in arrests, \nsearches, and seizures. Some of the exceptions, such as the permissible \nuse of the armed forces to protect the discoverer of guano islands, \nreflect historical anachronisms. Others, such as the authority to \nsuppress domestic disorders when civilian officials cannot do so, have \ncontinuing relevance--as shown most recently in the 1992 Los Angeles \nriots.\n  It is important to remember that the Act does not bar all military \nassistance to civilian law enforcement officials, even in the absence \nof a statutory exception. The Act has long been interpreted as not \nrestricting use of the armed forces to prevent loss of life or wanton \ndestruction of property in the event of sudden and unexpected \ncircumstances. In addition, the Act has been interpreted to apply only \nto direct participation in civilian law enforcement activities--that \nis, arrest, search, and seizure. Indirect activities, such as the loan \nof equipment, have been viewed as not within the prohibition against \nusing the armed forces to execute the law.\n  Over the years, the administrative and judicial interpretation of the \nAct, however, created a number of gray areas, including issues \ninvolving the provision of export advice during investigations and the \nuse of military equipment and facilities during ongoing law enforcement \noperations.\n  During the late 1970's and early 1980's, I became concerned that the \nlack of clarity was inhibiting useful indirect assistance, particularly \nin counterdrug operations. I initiated legislation, which was enacted \nin 1981 as chapter 18 of title 10, United States Code, to clarify the \nrules governing military support to civilian law enforcement agencies.\n  We not have, as a matter of fact, and have had since 1981 military \nships in the Caribbean--and other places for that matter where we have \nheavy drug traffic--where the military, the Navy, has the right to \nintercept vessels, but the power of arrest is reserved for Coast Guard \npersonnel that are on the Navy ships for that purpose. So we have been \nvery careful about how we approach this matter.\n  The administration has requested legislation that would permit direct \nmilitary participation in specific law enforcement activities related \nto chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, similar to the \nexception under current law that permits direct military participation \nin the enforcement of the laws concerning improper use of nuclear \nmaterials.\n  We had a hearing under the auspices of Senator Hatch and Senator \nBiden. During that hearing it came to the attention of the committee--\nand the Armed Forces Committee was also invited to participate in that \nhearing, and I was there--that, although the overall direction that the \nPresident was laying out seemed to me to make sense, I thought the \nstatute that had been submitted was not properly drawn. It used the \nwords ``technical assistance'' without defining that term properly; \nused the term ``disabling and disarming'' but precluded the power of \narrest.\n  In effect, I reached the conclusion that the military would be in a \nposition where they were basically able to disable and disarm, which \nwould include the use of force, and perhaps even the use of fatal \nforce, but not have the power of arrest, which did not make sense.\n  I think the ultimate depriving of civil liberties is when you kill \nsomeone. If you can kill them without arresting them you are not really \nprotecting someone's civil liberties. So we decided to carefully \nreconstruct that statute to try to deal with chemical and biological \nweapons, and we worked diligently to do that, and are continuing to \nwork on possible amendments in good faith with colleagues on both \nsides. Senator Hatch has participated in that. Senator Thurmond and I \nhave worked hard on it. Senator Biden has participated, and others. \nSenator Dole and others have been involved in trying to make sure we \nknow exactly what we are doing. I hope we can work it out this evening. \nBut, if not, we will certainly have to vote on the matter at some \npoint.\n  In my judgment, Mr. President, the question of whether we should \ncreate a further exception for chemical and biological weapons should \nbe addressed in light of the two enduring themes reflected in the \nhistory and practice of the Posse Comitatus Act and related statutes:\n  First, the strong and traditional reluctance of the American people \nto permit any military intrusion into civilian affairs.\n  Second, the concept that any exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act \nshould be narrowly drawn to meet specific needs that cannot be \naddressed by civilian law enforcement authorities and that pose a grave \ndanger to the American people.\n  As I previously mentioned, these issues were examined at a hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee on May 10, led by the chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nBiden. At their invitation, I participated in the hearing, and I am \ngrateful for the courtesies extended to me.\n  At the hearing, we heard from former Secretary of Defense Caspar \nWeinberger, and from current representatives of the Departments of \nJustice and Defense. During the hearing, five major themes emerged:\n  First, we should be very cautious about establishing exceptions to \nthe Posse Comitatus Act, which reflects enduring principles concerning \nhistoric separation between civilian and military functions in our \ndemocratic society.\n  Second, exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act should not be created \nfor the purpose of using the armed forces to routinely supplement \ncivilian law enforcement capabilities with respect to ongoing, \ncontinuous law enforcement problems.\n  Third, exceptions may be appropriate when law enforcement officials \ndo not possess the special capabilities of the Armed Forces in specific \ncircumstances, such as the capability to counter chemical and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction in a hostile situation.\n  Fourth, any statute which authorizes military assistance should be \nnarrowly drawn to address with specific criteria to ensure that the \nauthority will be used only when senior officials, such as the \nSecretary of Defense and the Attorney General, determine that there is \nan emergency situation which can be effectively addressed only with the \nassistance of military forces.\n  Fifth, any assistance which authorizes military assistance should not \nplace artificial constraints on the actions military officials may take \nthat might compromise their safety or the success of the operation.\n  In other words, Mr. President, as a result of that hearing, I came to \nthe conclusion that in this area we ought to set a very high threshold \nfor participation by the military and define those terms very \ncarefully. Once the military is involved and, for example, they have on \nchemical gear, they are in a very difficult situation. Law enforcement \nmay not even be able to be on the scene because of the heavy presence \nof chemical or biological agents. Once that happens, we do not want to \nput our 19, 20-, 22-, 23-, 24- or 25-year-olds out there without having \nenough authority to go ahead and do the job.\n  So we have tried to draft this authority with a very high threshold \nfor any involvement of this military and to make that authority very \nlimited, very carefully drawn. Once they are involved, then we want to \ngive the military personnel authority to protect themselves and to take \naction as required by the circumstances, the very emergency type of \ncircumstances we are describing.\n  The amendment that Senator Thurmond, Senator Biden and I are \nsponsoring has been drafted to reflect the traditional purposes of the \nPosse Comitatus Act and the limited nature of the exceptions to the \nAct.\n  Under the amendment, the Attorney General may request DoD assistance \nto enforce the prohibitions concerning biological and chemical weapons \nof mass destruction in an emergency situation.\n  The Secretary of Defense may provide assistance if there is a joint \ndetermination by the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General that \nthere is [[Page S7770]] an emergency situation, and the Secretary of \nDefense determines that the provision of such assistance will not \nadversely affect military preparedness.\n  Military assistance could be provided under the amendment only if the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Defense jointly determine that \neach of the following five conditions is present:\n  First, that the situation involves a biological or chemical weapon of \nmass destruction.\n  Second, that the situation poses a serious threat to the interests of \nthe United States.\n  Third, that civilian law enforcement expertise is not readily \navailable to counter the threat posed by the biological or chemical \nweapon of mass destruction involved.\n  Fourth, that Department of Defense special capabilities and expertise \nare needed to counter the threat posed by the biological or chemical \nweapon of mass destruction involved.\n  Fifth, that enforcement of the law would be seriously impaired if the \nDoD assistance were not provided.\n  The types of assistance that could be provided during an emergency \nsituation would involve operation of equipment to monitor, detect, \ncontain, disable, or dispose of a biological or chemical weapon of mass \ndestruction or elements of such a weapon. This includes the authority \nto search for and seize the weapons or elements of the weapons.\n  This authority must be given. I do not know of any way to avoid that \nbecause what you have to do is stop the possibility or the probability \nin some cases of massive death of American people.\n  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense would issue joint \nregulations defining the types of assistance that could be provided.\n  The regulations would also describe the actions that Department of \nDefense personnel may take in circumstances incidental to the provision \nof assistance under this section, including the collection of evidence. \nThis would not include the power of arrest except in exigent \ncircumstances or as otherwise authorized by law.\n  Now, that word ``exigent'' is one we are now considering, whether \nthere are other words that would more precisely define the kind of \ncircumstances we are talking about. The word ``exigent\" though is used \nin criminal statutes and has been used over and over again, and that \nword is well known in law enforcement circumstances.\n  Also, this provision is designed to address two important concerns. \nFirst is the general principle that types of assistance provided by the \nDepartment of Defense should consist primarily of operating equipment \ndesigned to deal with the chemical and biological agents involved and \nthat the primary responsibility for arrest should reside in all \ncircumstances with civilian officials where that is possible. As a law \nenforcement situation unfolds, however, military personnel must be able \nto deal with circumstances in which they may confront hostile \nopposition.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, there can very well be circumstances, a \nsubway, for instance, involving chemical agents, just like the \nsituation in Tokyo, or a situation similar to that where chemical \nagents are present, where law enforcement people are not even able to \ngo into the area, where the only people who can go into the area are \nthe military personnel.\n  In that situation, we do not want to put handcuffs on the military \nand say you are going into this dangerous situation but you cannot take \nsteps necessary to protect not only your lives but the lives of the \npeople who are in the area.\n  In such circumstances, the safety of the military personnel involved, \nand the safety of others, and the law enforcement mission cannot be \ncompromised by precluding the military from exercising the power they \nneed, including the use of force.\n  The amendment requires the Department of Defense to be reimbursed for \nassistance provided under this section in accordance with section 377 \nof title 10, the general statute governing reimbursement of the \nDepartment of Defense for law enforcement assistance. This means that \nif DOD does not get a training or operational benefit substantially \nequivalent to DOD training, the DOD must be reimbursed.\n  Under the amendment, the functions of the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Defense my be exercised, respectively, by the Deputy \nAttorney General and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, each of whom \nserves as the alter ego to the head of the Department concerned. These \nfunctions may be delegated to another official only if that official \nhas been designated to exercise the general powers of the head of the \nagency. This would include, for example, an Under Secretary of Defense \nwho has been designated to act for the Secretary in the absence of the \nSecretary and the Deputy.\n  Mr. President, I will not go into more detail at this time, but the \nlimitations set forth in this amendment are designed to address the \nappropriate allocation of resources and functions within the Federal \nGovernment and are designed to avoid providing a basis for excluding \nevidence or challenging an indictment.\n  Current law contains offenses involving the unlawful use of nuclear \nand biological weapons. The amendment sets forth the administration's \nproposal for a similar offense concerning the unlawful use of chemical \nweapons which is not now on the books.\n  Mr. President, this is a prudent and narrowly drafted amendment. It \nis consistent with the traditional separation of civilian and military \nfunctions and the exceptions for unusual and unique circumstances which \nrequire the special expertise of the Armed Forces to address serious \nthreats to the national interest.\n  I might add there is an amendment that is incorporated in this \namendment as it now stands, or it will stand when it is sent to the \ndesk, proposed by the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], basically saying \nthat the Government should take every step possible to get the law \nenforcement community in a position where we can in the future reduce \nthe need for using military personnel.\n  So we are not saying this is going to be here for all time. We are \nsaying we need it now, and as the months go by and the years go by \nthere would be the goal in this amendment to reduce the need to rely as \nmuch on the military as we must necessarily rely on them now in the \nchemical and biological area where they do have extensive training and \nequipment and are virtually the only ones who are able to deal with \ncertain circumstances that could be enormously dangerous to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I will be glad to yield the floor. I know the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, the cosponsor of this amendment, would like to be \nheard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee of the Senate, I was pleased to work with Senator Nunn, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, along with Senators \nHatch, Dole, Biden, and Craig to draft this amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to have military assistance \navailable to help Federal law enforcement in emergency situations that \ninvolve chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.\n  In 1982, the Congress passed and then President Reagan signed into \nlaw a bill to authorize military assistance in instances involving \nnuclear devices. I supported that legislation in 1982 and believe it is \nnow appropriate to extend that law to cover chemical and biological \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  We have been careful to limit military assistance to circumstances \nthat pose a serious threat to the interests of the United States and \nwhere civilian expertise is not readily available to provide the \nrequired assistance to counter the threat posed by the chemical and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment will provide valuable \nassistance to law enforcement to protect the American people should we \nface terrorists with chemical and biological weapons. We have been \ncareful to include safeguards to ensure that the military is not \ninvolved in routine law enforcement.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the amendment that the Senator from \n[[Page S7771]] Georgia [Senator Nunn], and I have proposed would create \na narrow exception to the Posse Comitatus Act in order to permit the \nuse of the military to assist law enforcement in emergency situations \ninvolving chemical and biological weapons.\n  Before describing the amendment in detail, let me briefly review the \norigins of the Posse Comitatus Act and the existing exceptions to it.\n  The term ``posse comitatus'' means literally the ``power of the \ncounty.''\n  Its roots trace back to English common law, where the sheriff, \nobligated to defend the county against any of the king's enemies, was \nempowered to summon every person above 15 years old for this purpose.\n  The first Congress provided similar power to Federal marshals in \n1789--authorizing the marshals to command all necessary assistance in \nthe execution of their duty.\n  Three years later, Congress explicitly authorized marshals to use the \nmilitia in assisting their posse.\n  In the first half of the nineteenth century, the practice of using \nboth the militia and regular military to assist law enforcement became \ncommonplace--\n  Although whenever military personnel were called into service as a \npart of a posse, they were subordinated to civilian authority.\n  Following the Civil War, Federal troops were often used extensively \nin the South, as well as to quell labor unrest in the North.\n  Dissatisfaction with this practice led to pressure from Congress for \nexplicit restrictions on the use of the military in law enforcement \noperations.\n  The result was the Posse Comitatus Act, enacted in 1878.\n  The Act is brief and straightforward:\n\n       Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly \n     authorized by the constitution or act of Congress, willfully \n     uses any part of the army or the air force as a Posse \n     Comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined not \n     more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or \n     both.\n\n  Over the past century, Congress has enacted numerous exceptions to \nthis general principle.\n  Many of these exceptions are for emergency circumstances, or where \nthe need for use of the military is obvious.\n  For example, the law permits use of the military: to suppress \ninsurrections; to protect foreign officials and official guests; to \nenforce the neutrality laws and customs laws; and to assist in \ninvestigations of murderers of Members of Congress or the Cabinet.\n  Congress has also provided some less compelling exceptions to the \nPosse Comitatus Act.\n  For instance, the President is empowered to use the military: to \nprotect certain Federal parks and timber on Federal lands in Florida; \nto assist States in enforcing quarantines and health laws; and to \nremove any unlawful inclosures on public lands.\n  Most relevant to our present inquiry is an exception which permits \nthe use of the military to assist law enforcement in countering the \nillegal possession or use of nuclear materials.\n  This provision, enacted in 1982, gives the military broad authority \nto assist in the enforcement of the law. The provision explicitly \nprovides that the armed forces may be used to arrest persons and \nconduct searches and seizures.\n  The military has unique expertise concerning nuclear materials, which \nin my view justifies an exception.\n  Should this Nation ever be faced with terrorists armed with nuclear \nmaterials--of whatever grade--I believe the Department of Justice and \nFBI should be able to draw on this expertise.\n  I hold a similar view of the President's request for analogous \nauthority with regard to chemical and biological weapons.\n  The military's expertise with chemical and biological weapons give it \nspecial knowledge which would be impractical and expensive to duplicate \nin civilian law enforcement.\n  The provision we have introduced is not--is not--the proposal sent to \nus by the administration.\n  Both Senator Nunn and I believed that, as drafted, the administration \nbill would have presented many practical problems.\n  Instead, we have drafted a new version which does the following:\n\n\n                      Description of the amendment\n\n       It permits the use of the military to assist law \n     enforcement to respond to emergency situations involving \n     biological or chemical weapons.\n       This assistance can only be provided if certain conditions \n     are met: (1) civilian expertise is not readily available; (2) \n     defense department assistance is needed; and\n      (3) enforcement of the law would be seriously impaired if \n     the Department of Defense assistance were not provided.\n\n  Finally, the amendment requires the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Defense to joint issue regulations concerning the types of \nassistance that may be provided.\n  The provision permits the regulations to authorize arrest or search \nand seizure only in instances for the immediate protection of human \nlife.\n  We share the concern of many of our colleagues about using the \nmilitary to enforce the law.\n  And we do not want the military to have carte blanche to arrest \nsuspects or engage in search or seizure.\n  But once called in to assist law enforcement, we do not want to \ncreate the ludicrous circumstance where a soldier called in to assist \nlaw enforcement stands immobile where his safety--or the safety of \nothers--is at risk.\n  Mr. President, the issue comes down to this: Do we want to authorize \nthe limited use of the military to combat chemical and biological \nweapons terrorism, or do we want to spend scarce resources to duplicate \nthis capability in law enforcement?\n  Mr. President, I am under the impression that our distinguished \nRepublican colleague is likely to accept this amendment. I hope that is \nthe case.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Thurmond and Senator \nNunn for their cooperation in resolving some concerns in the posse \ncomitatus amendment and the effort that they took in a most serious and \nappropriate way to cause the military to be involved in the areas of \nbiological and chemical warfare and weaponry of mass destruction when \nit might be applied against civilian populations in this country.\n  Many of us expressed some very real concern because of what has been \ndebated here tonight, the very important separation of the military and \ncivilian population which is rooted in our history and that we have \ncautiously and appropriately guarded throughout our country's existence \nwith few exceptions.\n  And so it was with that background we watched this amendment most \nclosely, and I must say that in the end I can now support it because of \nsome changes that have been made which I think we can all be very \ncomfortable with, and that is to narrow this to not allow arrests, to \nprohibit those but to allow action where there is the exception for the \nimmediate protection of human life. We think that narrows it and \nproperly defines it, clarifies it so it is not ambiguous and so that it \ncan be interpreted in the appropriate way by the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Defense in their joint responsibility in the issue of \nregulations concerning the implementation of the statute.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina for the extra \nefforts they have put into trying to resolve the problems on this posse \ncomitatus issue.\n  Everybody knows I was not very enthusiastic about changing the \nemergency powers of the President or by changing the current posse \ncomitatus law. But after having worked with these two great Senators, \nand seeing the compromises that have been worked out to try to resolve \nthe problems with this issue that have existed in the minds of a number \nof Senators on the Senate floor, I am happy to say I believe we are in \na position to accept the amendment, and if the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware is also in the same position, I think we can urge passage \nof this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would so urge, Mr. President. If I could have the \nattention of the Senator from Georgia, if he would send the amendment \nto the desk, I guess we can agree on it.\n[[Page S7772]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Delaware I have just taken the \namendment to the desk, and it reflects all those changes that we worked \nout, and I would ask that the previous amendment not be called up but \nthe one I just brought to the desk be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending Specter \namendment is set aside for consideration of the amendment of the \nSenator from Georgia. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for himself, Mr. \n     Thurmond, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1213.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 160, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC, 901.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of anti-terrorism \nlegislation. After all, one of the principal purposes of any government \nis to ensure the safety of its citizens. And the destruction of the \nOklahoma City Federal building and the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter indicate that we need to do a better job in this area.\n  But I continue to have concerns about some provisions of S. 735, just \nas I did about the President's proposal. In addition, I am concerned \nthat the bill under consideration may divide the Senate at a time when \nall public officials should be unified in the fight against violence \nand terror. So while I am inclined to support this measure, I am also \ninclined to support amendments that would improve it.\n  For many years, we have watched with growing concern as terrorist \nviolence has escalated--and reached closer to home. We can no longer \nignore the fact that post-cold-war violence knows no borders, and \nrespects no distinction between soldiers and innocents.\n  Mr. President, fundraising for international terrorism now has roots \nin America--and it has even reached the [[Page S7774]] Midwest. In \nfact, in 1993 a group of Palestinian immigrants, linked to the infamous \nAbu Nidal terrorist organization, actively raised money here for \nterrorism abroad. Surprisingly, this terrorist cell extended from St. \nLouis, MO, to Dayton, OH, to Racine, WI.\n  After their arrest, three of the men were accused of plotting to blow \nup the Israeli Embassy in Washington. They admitted to smuggling money \nand information, buying weapons, and planning terrorist activities. In \nJuly 1994 they pleaded guilty to Federal Racketeering charges.\n  Given these growing threats to American lives, both at home and \nabroad, it makes sense for Congress to create a comprehensive Federal \ncriminal statute to be used against domestic and international \nterrorists, and to choke off fundraising by terrorist organizations. \nSuch legislation is not a panacea but, by clarifying and elaborating on \nour current laws it could provide law enforcement with more effective \ntools in their fight to protect us.\n  Unfortunately, while S. 735 accomplishes some of these laudable \ngoals, it moves far beyond areas directly affecting terrorism and into \nissues--such as habeas corpus reform--that have frayed the consensus \nthat Americans expect from us when their safety is at risk. Now, let us \nbe clear: Many criminal appeals are frivolous, and the often convoluted \nhabeas process is in need of reform. However, this divisive issue \nshould be thoroughly debated on its own--not as a last minute \nattachment to a 160-page terrorism proposal.\n  Moreover, attaching habeas reform to this bill opens the door to \nother issues that should be considered elsewhere. For example, others \nseem encouraged to offer amendments relating to arms sales, perjury, \nidentification cards, and immigration. If these amendments are \nattached, this bill will become a christmas tree. And if these \nproposals are accepted, then I will consider offering my amendment to \naddress the Supreme Court's concerns regarding gun free school zones. \nAfter all, this is one bill that will certainly be signed into law \nquickly.\n  Beyond these concerns regarding habeas corpus reform, I also have \nsome substantive concerns regarding the core antiterrorism provisions \nof this bill, just as I had with the Clinton bill. Specifically, I \nbelieve that S. 735 has not adequately addressed the constitutional \nobjections that Members from both sides of the aisle have raised over \nthe preceding months. While the substitute does address some of these \nconcerns, it often creates more problems than it solves.\n  For example, the current bill entirely deletes the licensing \nprovisions of the President's fundraising proposal. While the original \nprovision was already flawed, the Republican cure is worse than the \ndisease. While we need to stop the flow of money to terrorist \norganizations, we also need to be sure that our final product allows \ngroups to raise funds for nonviolent, legitimate political purposes. An \noverly broad ban--with no safety valve--may infringe upon the first \namendment rights of donors to provide financial support to legitimate \norganizations of their choice.\n  Similarly, the alien deportation provisions of S. 735 may undermine \nthe due process rights of legal resident aliens. Specifically, these \naliens should have some right to review--and challenge--evidence that \nthe Government has marshalled against them. After all, none of us would \nwant to be caught up in a kafkaesque procedure that takes place \nentirely behind closed doors. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, ``They \nthat give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety \ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.''\n  In closing, Mr. President, we should not use this antiterrorism bill \nas a vehicle for moving a partisan agenda forward, destroying a rare \nconsensus in the process. Moreover, in fighting terrorists, we must not \nbe frightened into weakening the Constitution that we have sworn to \nuphold. Therefore, I hope we agree to several amendments to address \nthese problems, so that we may present the American people with \nlegislation that strengthens our defenses against terrorism, without \nweakening our commitment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 735, the Dole-Hatch \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 1995. I thank Senator Dole and Senator \nHatch for including in the bill my provision, which strengthens the \nprotection of Federal computers against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is a worldwide system of computers and \ncomputer networks that enables users to communicate and share \ninformation. The system is comparable to the worldwide telephone \nnetwork. According to a Time magazine article, the Internet connects \nover 4.8 million host systems, including educational institutions, \nGovernment facilities, military bases, and commercial businesses. \nMillions of private individuals are connected to the Internet through \ntheir personal computers and modems.\n  Computer criminals have quickly recognized the Internet as a haven \nfor criminal possibilities. During the 1980's, the development and \nbroad-based appeal of the personal computer sparked a period of \ndramatic technological growth. This has raised the stakes in the battle \nover control of the Internet and all computer systems.\n  Computer criminals know all the ways to exploit the Internet's easy \naccess, open nature, and global scope. From the safety of a telephone \nin a discrete location, the computer criminal can anonymously access \npersonal, business, and Government files. And because these criminals \ncan easily gain access without disclosing their identities, it is \nextremely difficult to apprehend and successfully prosecute them.\n  Prosecution of computer criminals is complicated further by \ncontinually changing technology, lack of precedence, and weak or \nnonexistent State and Federal laws. And the costs are passed on to \nservice providers, the judicial system, and most importantly--the \nvictims. Mr. President, section 527 will deter this type of crime.\n  This section requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review \nexisting sentencing guidelines as they apply to sections 1030(a)(4) and \n1030(a)(5) of title 18 of the United States Code--the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse Act. The Commission must also establish guidelines to ensure \nthat criminals convicted under these sections receive mandatory minimum \nsentences for not less than 6 months. Currently, judges are given great \ndiscretion in sentencing under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. In \nmany cases, the sentences don't match the crimes, and criminals receive \nlight sentences for serious crimes. Mandatory minimum sentences will \ndeter computer ``hacking'' crimes, and protect the infrastructure of \nFederal computer systems.\n  Everybody recognizes that it is wrong for an intruder to enter a home \nand wander around; it doesn't make sense to view a criminal who breaks \ninto a computer system differently. We have a national anti-stalking \nlaw to protect citizens on the street, but it doesn't cover stalking on \nthe communications network. We should not treat these criminals \ndifferently simply because they possess new weapons.\n  These new technologies, which so many Americans enjoy, were developed \nover many years. I understand that policy can't catch up with \ntechnology overnight, but we can start filling in the gaps created by \nthese tremendous advancements. We cannot allow complicated technology \nto paralyze us into inactivity. It is vital that we protect the \ninformation and infrastructure of this country.\n  Because computers are the nerve centers of the world's information \nand communication system, there are catastrophic possibilities. Imagine \nan international terrorist penetrating the Federal Reserve System and \nbringing to a halt every Federal financial transaction. Or worse yet, \nimagine a terrorist who gains access to the Department of Defense, and \ngains control over NORAD.\n  The best known case of computer intrusion is detailed in the book, \n``The Cuckoo's Egg.'' In March 1989, West German authorities arrested \ncomputer hackers and charged them with a series of intrusions into \nUnited States computer systems through the University of California at \nBerkeley. Eastern block intelligence agencies had sponsored the \nactivities of the hackers beginning in May 1986. The only punishment \nthe hackers were given was probation.\n  An example of the pending threat is illustrated in the Wednesday, May \n10, headline from the Hill entitled ``Hired Hackers Crack House \nComputers.'' Auditors from Price Waterhouse managed to break into House \nMembers' [[Page S7775]] computer systems. According to the article, the \nauditors' report stated that they could have changed documents, \npasswords, and other sensitive information in those systems. What is to \nstop international terrorists from gaining similar access, and \nobtaining secret information relating to our national security?\n  Mandatory minimum sentences will make the criminals think twice \nbefore illegally accessing computer files. In a September 1994 Los \nAngeles Times article about computer intrusion, Scott Charney, chief of \nthe computer crime unit for the U.S. Department of Justice, stated \n``the threat is an incresing threat,'' and ``[i]t could be a 16-year-\nold kid out for fun or it could be someone who is actively working to \nget information from the United States.''\n  He added, there is a ``growing new breed of digital outlaws who \nthreaten national security and public safety.'' For example, the Los \nAngeles Times article reported that, in Los Angeles alone, ther are at \nleast four outlaw computer hackers who, in recent years, have \ndemonstrated they can seize control of telephones and break into \nGovernment computers.\n  The article also mentioned that Government reports further reveal \nthat foreign intelligence agencies and mercenary computer hackers have \nbeen breaking into military computers. For example, a hacker is now \nawaiting trial in San Francisco on epionage charges for cracking an \nArmy computer system and gaining access to FBI files on former \nPhilippine president Ferdinand Marcos. According to the 1993 Department \nof Defense report, such a threat is very real: ``The nature of this \nchanging motivation makes computer intruders' skills high-interest \ntargets for criminal elements and hostile adversaries.''\n  Mr. President, the September 1993 Department of Defense report added \nthat, if hired by terrorists, these hackers could cripple the Nation's \ntelephone system, ``create significant public health and safety \nproblems, and cause serious economic shocks.'' The hackers could bring \nan entire city to a standstill. The report states that, as the world \nbecomes wired for computer networks, there is a greater threat the \nnetworks will be used for spying and terrorism. In a 1992 report, the \nPresident's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee \nwarned, ``known individuals in the hacker community have ties with \nadversary organizations. Hackers frequently have international ties.''\n  Mr. President, section 527 of this bill will deter terrorist activity \nand enhance our national security.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the brutal and vicious bombing of the \nFederal building in Oklahoma City continues to tear at the Nation's \nsoul. We are still mourning the loss of so many innocent lives, and \nasking ourselves how anyone could act with such savagery.\n  The toll from this terrible tragedy would have been even worse, if so \nmany rescue workers and volunteers had not acted so heroically. Their \ncourageous and tireless efforts inspired the Nation. We should all take \na minute to commend these heroes.\n  The many law enforcement officials who have worked so hard on this \ncase should also be commended. Their efficient apprehension of suspects \nand witnesses has impressed everyone. We can all be proud of their \nefforts.\n  As we continue to deal with this terrible tragedy--the deadliest \nterrorist attack on American soil--we must find ways to prevent such \nacts in the future. While no one will argue that we can end terrorism, \nwe can take steps to deter terrorists, make it more difficult for them \nto kill and injure, and ensure that they are brought swiftly to \njustice.\n  The President deserves commendation for moving forcefully in that \ndirection with a comprehensive proposal to crack down on terrorists. \nThat proposal, which he submitted to the Congress shortly after the \nOklahoma bombing, establishes new Federal offenses to ensure that \nterrorists do not escape through the gaps in current law. FBI director \nLouis Freeh explained the importance of closing these gaps in recent \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee.\n  The President's proposal also provides additional investigative tools \nfor Federal law enforcement officials. These include access to \nfinancial reports, telephone bills and other records in foreign \ncounterintelligence investigations. Because these investigations are \nnot always based on criminal offenses, it can be difficult for law \nenforcement to proceed in certain cases.\n  Overall, the President's proposal will help the Nation prevent \nterrorism and help bring terrorists to justice. The bombing in Oklahoma \nmade clear just how vulnerable we all are to terrorism, and we ought to \nmove this proposal forward in an efficient, bipartisan way.\n  To their credit, Senators Dole and Hatch have incorporated most of \nthe President's proposal into the bill we are considering today. I \ncommend them for negotiating with the democratic leadership and \nattempting to narrow differences.\n  However, there are a few important Presidential proposals that are \nnot in the Republican bill. The President sought to provide the \nAttorney General with the authority to order emergency wiretaps in \nforeign and domestic terrorism cases. When I met with Federal law \nenforcement officials last week in Connecticut, they stressed the \nimportant of this proposal. Regrettably, my Republican colleagues \nfought this amendment and it was defeated.\n  Another critical Presidential proposal fared better. Bipartisan \ncooperation resulted in a unanimous vote in favor of Senator \nFeinstein's amendment, which authorizes the Treasury Department to \npromulgate regulations requiring tracing agents in explosives. This \nauthority should help law enforcement officials track bomb builders and \nother criminals. Because this technology is relatively new, we will \nneed to monitor the effectiveness of the department's regulations.\n  There are other important differences between the Republican bill and \nthe President's proposal. One critical difference is the Republican \napproach to habeas corpus reform. This has been a contentious issue for \na number of years. No one in this body wants to see prisoners abuse the \nlegal process, and delay justice for victims, by filing meritless \nappeals. But most of my colleagues also want to ensure that those \npeople who have been unfairly convicted have some recourse.\n  We have all struggled to strike the right balance on habeas corpus \nreform, and it is not an easy task. In this time of healing, we should \nnot let a divisive political issue delay the counterterrorism measures \nthat the Nation demands. I hope that we can reach some sort of \ncompromise on this issue.\n  There are other aspects of this bill that need to be worked out. Some \nof my colleagues have raised some important concerns about the effect \nof this legislation in civil rights. Clearly, no one in this body wants \nto act hastily and undermine the Constitution. We must not sacrifice \nthe principles of freedom, fairness and privacy on the altar of fear. \nThat would give the ultimate victory to the terrorists.\n  So let us work together, resolve our differences, and rejoin the \nbattle to strengthen the Nation against terrorist attack.\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1233\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would note the pending amendment \nconcerns a matter, airline security, that is within the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. I see \nthe distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary is on the \nfloor. Would the chairman be willing to enter into a short colloquy on \nthis issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be pleased to discuss the matter with my friend.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my colleague. Although I support the proposed \namendment requiring a uniform security standard for passenger airlines, \nas chairman of the Commerce Committee I want the record to be clear on \nthe point that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nretains jurisdiction over matters concerning airline safety and \nsecurity.\n  Further, I want the record to be clear that simply by not objecting \nto this amendment on jurisdictional grounds, the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation will not be deemed to have waived its \njurisdiction over the very important issue of air carrier security \nprograms. [[Page S7776]] \n  I would ask whether the chairman agrees with my assessment of the \njurisdictional situation and whether he would be willing to stipulate \nas much for the record?\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand and appreciate that the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has always \nprovided strong leadership on air passenger safety and security issues. \nLet me make it clear that my friend from South Dakota is absolutely \ncorrect. Aviation security is within the jurisdiction of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. It is not my \nintention that this amendment will affect in any way that committee's \njurisdiction over airline security matters in the future.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from Utah for clarifying this point. \nHaving put my jurisdictional concern to rest, I join in supporting the \namendment and urge my colleagues to support it. American citizens \ntraveling on foreign carriers should have the same level of protection \nthey have when traveling on U.S. passenger carriers. Moreover, U.S. \npassenger carriers should not be put at a competitive disadvantage vis-\na-vis foreign competitors whose relaxed security standards are less \nexpensive.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the chairman. I very much appreciate his support \nfor this amendment and thank him for agreeing to proceed to its \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted 90 to 0 to \napprove an amendment I authored to the counterterrorism legislation. \nBecause of the importance of this amendment, I want to clarify its \nintent and language.\n  This amendment will make it easier for law enforcement officials to \ntrace the origins of bombs used for violent or criminal purposes. The \nlegislation specifically requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \nconduct a study within 12 months on the use of taggants in all \nexplosive materials, including black or smokeless powder. Once that \nstudy is completed, the Treasury Department must enforce the use of \ntaggants in explosive materials within 6 months, depending on the \nstudy's findings and other factors. In addition, this amendment \ninstructs the Treasury Department to also study ways of making common \nchemicals, such as fertilizer, inert and unusable as an explosive.\n  This amendment exempts putting taggants in black or smokeless gun \npowder when that powder is used for small arms ammunition, or bullets--\nan exemption that already exists under current law. In addition, black \nor smokeless powder used in antique firearms for recreational purposes \nis also exempted from this amendment. The amendment does allow for the \nuse of taggants in black or smokeless powder produced for sale in large \nquantities or for other uses.\n  I want to clarify that this amendment extends the existing exemption \nunder current law. Under sections 845 (a)(4) and (5) of Title 18, \nUnited States Code, small arms ammunitiona and antique weapons used for \nrecreational purposes are exempt from all explosive regulations, except \nfor a few specific circumstances. This amendment simply reiterates \ncurrent law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding, after visiting with \nthe managers, that the only amendments left are habeas corpus \namendments.\n  I want to thank the managers on both sides of the aisle for their \nhard work and cooperation for the last 6 hours, and also the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, for his cooperation.\n  So we are down now to the habeas corpus amendments. We disposed of \nvirtually everything, 80, 90 amendments. We are down to about six, five \non the Democratic side and one on the Republican side.\n  I think we have agreed that we come in at 9:30, have 15 minutes of \nmorning business, and at 9:45 we are on the bill. And Senator Biden \nwill bring up the habeas corpus Federal prisoners, No. 1217, with 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Then there would be a vote at 10:15 which would accommodate two \nSenators who are going to the Base Closure Commission, and one Senator \nwho has someone in the hospital. Then we would try to reach time \nagreements on the remaining amendments, and if possible stack all of \nthose votes so we can complete action probably sometime like 1 o'clock. \nWe would have votes on those, plus final passage, unless there is a \nmotion to reconsider a vote, or something like that.\n  I think that is satisfactory. I wish to check with Senators.\n  So we will proceed on that basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7763-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I would ask unanimous consent that when the Senate convenes \ntomorrow, it convene at the hour of 9:30 a.m., with 15 minutes of \nmorning business, 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux; that at 9:45 we return to the consideration of S. 735, and that \nthe amendment No. 1217, habeas corpus Federal prisons, be in order, 30 \nminutes equally, controlled by the managers on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And then we will try to work out the order and times on the \nfollowing amendments. I think we will pretty much stick to the times we \nhave pointed out here.\n  I would also ask, since we have completed action on every amendment \nthat has been affected by cloture, that the cloture motion filed \nyesterday be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I indicated earlier, there is no reason for a cloture \nvote because we have taken care of all the amendments that might have \nbeen affected by invoking cloture with the exception of five so-called \ngun or gun-related amendments which have been or will be withdrawn.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, each of the \nauthors of the gun amendments has agreed to withdraw their amendments, \nand I am authorized to do that and I would do that at this moment if \nthat is appropriate.\n  There are five amendments: Bradley, Lautenberg, Kohl, Levin, and \nKerry of Massachusetts. Each had amendments. And there was a Boxer \namendment which we never intended on bringing up on guns, and a second \nLautenberg amendment. We were not going to do those anyway.\n  To put it another way, Mr. President, we commit there will be no gun \namendments offered from the Democratic side. The only amendments that \nwould be in order are the habeas corpus amendments that have been \nreferenced by the leader already.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. That would be Biden No. 1224, Biden No. 1216, Biden \nNo. 1217, Levin No. 1245, Gaham of Florida No. 1242, Kyl No. 1211, and \nthen there is the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. And that would not be a gun amendment.\n  Mr. President, that is correct. They would be the only amendments \nthat would be in order. So there is no intention to raise any gun \nissue.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1228 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan has been very cooperative and has permitted us to withdraw his \namendment. I believe both the distinguished Senator from Delaware and I \nare very grateful that he has been so considerate of all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment 1228 is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. DOLE. I assume under the previous agreement that only second-\ndegree amendments would be in order after a failed motion to table.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, let me thank the managers and the Democratic leader, \nSenator Biden and Senator Hatch, Senator Daschle, and also thank the \nPresident and Pat Griffin at the White House, who has been helpful \nthroughout the day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7776-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7777-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7777-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 54\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required under section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act \nof 1978 (Public Law 95-242; 22 U.S.C. 3281(a)), I am transmitting a \nreport on the activities of United States Government departments and \nagencies relating to the prevention of nuclear proliferation.

A bill to amend the Federal Credit Union Act to enhance the \nsafety and soundness of federally insured credit unions, to protect the \nNational Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the credit union reform and enhancement act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have always strongly supported credit \nunions. But I am disturbed by the increasingly risky activities of some \nof our Nation's largest credit unions. Speculative investments by these \nlarge credit unions have already caused millions of dollars of losses--\nlosses that have been passed on to smaller credit unions.\n  Congress, the National Credit Union Administration [NCUA] and credit \nunions must work together to preserve the safety and soundness of the \ncredit union industry--an industry primarily consisting of small, \nhealthy credit unions that avoid such speculative investments.\n  Therefore, with my distinguished ranking minority member--Senator \nSarbanes--I am introducing today the Credit Union Reform and \nEnhancement Act. This bill would strengthen the credit union movement \nby protecting smaller credit unions and the taxpayer-backed National \nCredit Union Share Insurance Fund (``Share Insurance Fund'') from \nlosses caused by high risk activities.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why I have been--and remain--one of the \nstrongest supporters and defenders of the credit union movement.\n  Credit unions have a special character. Unlike banks and thrifts, \ncredit unions are cooperative not-for-profit associations in which \nmembers, who are the owners, a common bond, deposit funds, and obtain \ncredit.\n  Credit unions also have a unique mission. Credit unions were created \nin the early 20th century specifically to provide credit to people of \nsmaller means and to promote thrift among their members and the early \ncredit union philosophy was closely connected with moral and \nhumanitarian goals.\n  Today, many credit unions remain committed to these lofty goals. For \nexample, the Residents Community Development Credit Union in \nBinghamton, NY provides vital financial services to the residents of \nthree low-income housing communities. In Manhattan, the Lower East Side \nPeople's Federal Credit Union offers savings accounts and safety \ndeposit boxes to the homeless, in addition to providing more \ntraditional financial services to more than 2,000 lower income \nresidents.\n  Finally, credit unions generally have avoided high risk activities. \nAs a result, the financial health of most credit unions is very good. \nCapital at the Nation's 12,000 federally insured credit unions is at a \nrecord high of 10.4 percent, and the Share Insurance Fund has reached a \n1.30 equity level--the maximum possible under the Federal Credit Union \nAct.\n  Mr. President, because of my commitment to the credit union movement, \nI am very disturbed by the increasingly risky activities of a few large \ncredit unions. High risk investments recently caused the largest \nfailure by a credit union in American history--the $1.5 billion failure \nof Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union [Cap Corp].\n  Cap Corp invested almost 70 percent of its total assets--over $1 \nbillion--in highly interest rate sensitive derivatives, called \ncollateralized mortgage obligations [OMOs]. As interest rates rose \nduring 1994, the market value of these CMO's dropped steeply. When Cap \nCorp was finally taken over by the NCUA, the market value of its \ninvestments had dropped by over $100 million.\n  The failure of Cap Corp is particularly disturbing because it was a \ncorporate credit union--a special type of credit union that serves \nother credit unions, not individuals. Federally insured credit unions \ninvest a significant portion of their assets in large corporate credit \nunions--over $24 billion as of December 31, 1994. The failure of a \ncorporate credit union can result in the loss of these funds and the \ndomino-like failure of many smaller credit unions. Due to Cap Corp's \nfailure, for example, over 250 credit unions will lose almost $25 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, corporate credit unions were created to provide \nliquidity and sound investment advice to smaller credit unions. \nHowever, some corporate credit unions are increasingly investing \ntaxpayer-backed credit union funds in high risk securities, and the \npotential losses are mounting. At the Senate Banking Committee's \nhearings on the Cap Corp failure, for example, we learned that:\n  Corporate credit unions reported unrealized investment losses in 1994 \ntotaling about $600 million.\n  While some of those unrealized losses were quite small, others \namounted to between 30 and 40 percent of total capital. One corporate \ncredit union had unrealized losses that were 77 percent of its total \ncapital.\n  Like Cap Corp, some other corporate credit unions have invested \nheavily in CMO's that have declined in market value. As of December 31, \n1994, 23 corporate credit unions reported aggregate CMO investments \nwith a book value of over $8 billion. That is equal to about 24 percent \nof total corporate assets and 333 percent of total corporate capital.\n  Some of these corporate credit unions have much higher than average \nconcentrations of CMO's. For example, three corporate credit unions \nheld more than 40 percent of their assets in CMO's and four others held \nbetween 20 and 32 percent of their assets in CMO's.\n  It is also clear from testimony at the Banking Committee's hearings \nthat the NCUA's supervision and regulation of corporate credit unions \nis seriously deficient. The NCUA should have recognized sooner that a \nproblem existed at Cap Corp and should have taken prompt corrective \naction. However, the NCUA reviewed Cap Corp's records in September \n1994--just 4 months prior to its failure--and did not discover any \nserious problems. Shockingly, after that review, Cap Corp's rating \nremained a ``1''--the highest rating possible for credit unions.\n  Mr. President, these developments are very disturbing to Members of \nCongress, particularly given our recent experience with the savings and \nloan industry and Orange County. These developments endanger the health \nof the credit union industry and the taxpayer-backed Share Insurance \nFund. These developments jeopardize the privileged status given to \ncredit unions.\n  To address the concerns raised by these developments, Senator \nSarbanes and I are introducing the Credit Union Reform and Enhancement \nAct [CURE]. This bill would grant the NCUA limited powers to protect \nsmaller credit unions, the Share Insurance Fund and, ultimately, our \nNation's taxpayers from the increasingly risky investment practices of \na few large credit unions.\n  First, CURE would limit the ability of federally insured, State-\nchartered credit unions to engage in certain high-risk activities that \nare not permitted under Federal law. One important lesson of the \nsavings and loan debacle was that federally insured, State-chartered \ninstitutions can, with broad and risky powers granted by State \nlegislatures and regulators, present enormous risks to a Federal \ninsurance fund.\n  Forty-three States currently grant credit unions broader and \npotentially riskier powers than those granted to federally chartered \ncredit unions. For example, California allows credit unions to invest \nin Mexican bonds, and Alabama has liberal requirements on credit union \ninvestments in real estate, with no set limits on such investments or \npurchases of real estate for rental income.\n  CURE would grant the NCUA the authority to limit such powers unless \nit believes they pose no significant risk to the Share Insurance Fund \nor unless the power was authorized pursuant to the laws of the \nchartering State and being utilized by at least one credit union on May \n1, 1995. CURE would put in place a tripwire against future high-risk \nactivities. It would allow the NCUA to prevent losses from such \nactivities--instead of reacting to those losses. [[Page S7779]] \n  Second, CURE would prohibit federally insured credit unions from \ninvesting in nonfederally insured credit unions. Under current law, \nfederally insured credit unions can, and do, invest in nonfederally \ninsured credit unions that are not under the full authority of the \nNCUA.\n  Five of the forty-five corporate credit unions--some of the largest \ncredit unions in the Nation--are outside the full supervisory and \nregulatory authority of the NCUA because they are not federally \nchartered or insured. A federally insured credit union can escape full \nFederal regulation by investing in one of these nonfederally insured \ncredit unions.\n  CURE would bring all investments in corporate credit unions under the \njurisdiction of the NCUA and, thus, would reduce the potential for \ninappropriately risky investing that may put the Share Insurance Fund \nat risk.\n  Third, CURE would grant the NCUA the authority to close a federally \ninsured, State-chartered credit union that is insolvent or bankrupt, \nafter prior consultation with the State regulator. This bill would help \nprotect the Share Insurance Fund, which would ultimately be responsible \nfor any losses resulting from such a liquidation.\n  Under current law, the NCUA must wait until the State regulator \ncloses the credit union and appoints the NCUA as liquidating agent--an \noften time consuming process. But the need for regulators to act \nquickly to seize control of failed financial institutions is well \ndocumented. During the savings and loan crisis, for example, \ninstitutions attempted to avoid insolvency and bankruptcy by making \nincreasingly risky investments as losses from previous high-risk \ninvestments mounted.\n  Fourth, CURE would increase the NCUA's ability to institute a timely \nconservatorship. Currently, the NCUA can be forced to wait 30 days \nbefore placing a federally insured, State-chartered credit union into \nconservator- ship, if the State regulator does not approve of the \nconservatorship. This bill would eliminate the 30-day waiting period \nand simply require the NCUA to carry out prior consultation with the \nstate regulator.\n  Because the health of a credit union can deteriorate rapidly, the \nNCUA must have the power to act quickly to limit losses to the Share \nInsurance Fund. Even brief delays in the implementation of Cap Corp's \nconservator- ship, for example, could\n have resulted in millions of dollars of additional losses. This bill \nwould help to limit such losses.\n\n  Finally, CURE would update the terminology concerning corporate \ncredit unions in the Federal Credit Union Act. It would remove outdated \nreferences to central credit unions, which once performed functions \nsimilar to corporate credit unions. CURE would also require the NCUA to \nestablish limits on loans to a single borrower and to set minimum \ncapital requirements. Since the NCUA has already set such standards by \nregulations, CURE would simply prevent the NCUA from eliminating those \nstandards. Moreover, this legislation does not specify what these \nstandards should be, so the NCUA would be free to adjust its current \nstandards.\n  In sum, CURE would grant the NCUA limited powers to protect smaller \ncredit unions and the Share Insurance Fund from losses caused by high \nrisk activities. The powers granted to the NCUA are not extraordinary. \nIndeed, they are much more limited than the powers already granted to \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] over federally \ninsured, State-chartered banks and thrifts. The FDIC, for example, can \nclose federally insured, State-chartered thrifts and banks even prior \nto insolvency or bankruptcy--when their capital is less than 2 percent.\n  Nevertheless, some will argue that this legislation gives too much \nauthority to the NCUA at the expense of the States. It is important to \nremember, however, that State-chartered credit unions are only subject \nto this legislation if they voluntarily choose--or are required by \ntheir State legislatures--to have Federal insurance. If the States want \nbroader powers for credit unions, they can establish their own \ninsurance funds and allow State taxpayers to pay for State credit union \nexcesses.\n  Most recognize that this legislation is a step in the right \ndirection. The NCUA and the Government Accounting Office [GAO] strongly \nsupport this legislation, as does the Credit Union National Association \n[CUNA] and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions [NAFCU].\n  Like Senator Sarbanes and I, they recognize that this legislation \nwould strengthen the credit union movement. It would protect credit \nunions, the Share Insurance Fund and, ultimately, our Nation's \ntaxpayers from the high risk activities of a few large credit unions.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill and the letters of support from the NCUA, the GAO, CUNA, and NAFCU \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

You have my full support for its speedy enactment.\n       I also want to express my sincere thanks for your \n     leadership in support of NCUA's efforts to improve and \n     strengthen both our supervision efforts and our regulation of \n     corporate credit unions. Your backing has been crucial to the \n     progress we are making toward insuring a healthy and safe \n     future for both corporate and natural person credit unions.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Norman E. D'Amours,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               U.S. General Accounting Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to your request for \n     our views on proposed legislation entitled the ``Credit Union \n     Reform and Enhancement Act.'' Overall, we believe that the \n     bill would enhance the safety and soundness of federally \n     insured credit unions and further the protection of the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Share Insurance \n     Fund). Our specific comments follow.\n       Section 2 of the bill would confine federally insured \n     credit unions' investments in corporate credit unions to \n     those that are federally insured. This provision would bring \n     all investments in corporate credit unions under the \n     jurisdiction of the National Credit Union Administration \n     (NCUA) and, thus, could reduce the potential for \n     inappropriately risky investing that may put the Share \n     Insurance Fund at risk. In our 1991 report, Credit Unions: \n     Reforms for Ensuring Future Soundness (GAO/GGD-91-85. July \n     10, 1991), we made a similar recommendation, and we continue \n     to support it.\n       Section 3 limits the powers of state-chartered credit \n     unions, particularly in the area of so-called \n     ``nonconforming'' investments, to those allowable to \n     federally chartered credit unions. The concern is that \n     certain investments, e.g. foreign bonds, could carry undue \n     risk. This provision would grant NCUA the authority to limit \n     investment activities unless it believes they pose no \n     significant risk to the Share Insurance Fund or unless the \n     power was authorized pursuant to the laws of the chartering \n     state and being utilized by at least one credit union. In our \n     1991 report, we recommended that NCUA should be authorized \n     and required to compel a state credit union to follow federal \n     regulations in any area in which powers go beyond those \n     permitted federal credit unions and are considered to \n     constitute a safety and soundness risk.\n       Section 4 updates terminology concerning corporate credit \n     unions in the Federal Credit Union Act by removing outdated \n     references to ``central credit unions'', which once performed \n     functions similar to those of corporate credit unions. The \n     section also requires NCUA to establish limits on loans to a \n     single obligor and to set minimum capital requirements. Our \n     1991 report made similar recommendations and we believe they \n     remain valid.\n       Section 5 grants NCUA authority to place a federally \n     insured, state-chartered credit union into liquidation after \n     consulting with the state regulator. Currently, NCUA must \n     wait until the state regulator closes the credit union and \n     appoints NCUA as the liquidating agent. This measure would \n     help protect the Share Insurance Fund, because the Fund would \n     ultimately be responsible for any losses resulting from such \n     a liquidation. We believe such powers are appropriate given \n     NCUA's responsibilities.\n       Section 6 increases NCUA's ability to institute a timely \n     conservatorship. It does this by eliminating the requirement \n     for NCUA to wait 30 days before placing a state-chartered \n     credit union into conservatorship in the event that the state \n     regulator does not approve of the conservatorship. This \n     requirement would be modified so that NCUA would need only to \n     carry out ``prior consultation'' with the state authority. \n     Because financial institutions' financial health can \n     deteriorate rapidly in some circumstances, NCUA needs to have \n     the power to act expeditiously to limit losses to the Share \n     Insurance Fund. This enhanced authority contributes to that \n     objective and we support the provision.\n       Mr. Chairman, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on \n     your proposed legislation. In the event you or your staff \n     have further questions, please contact me at 202-512-8678.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                            James L. Bothwell,\n\n                                  Director, Financial Institutions\n     and Markets Issues.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      Credit Union\n\n\n                                   National Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato: On behalf of the Credit Union \n     National Association (CUNA), I am writing to inform you that \n     CUNA supports your proposed legislation, the Credit Union \n     Reform and Enhancement Act. We would like to thank you and \n     your staff for addressing many of the concerns that we had \n     with the earlier draft.\n       We appreciate your efforts to improve the bill and hope \n     there will be an additional opportunity to further refine its \n     provisions after it is introduced. In the end, we are \n     confident that any credit union legislation reported by the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will allow \n     credit unions to retain legitimate business activities that \n     do not threaten their safety and soundness.\n       I also thought you may be interested to know that we met \n     recently with representatives of the National Credit Union \n     Administration and the National Association of Federal Credit \n     Unions and jointly agreed upon several possible regulatory \n     relief amendments to the Federal Credit Union Act. Per our \n     discussion with you last week, we look forward to working \n     together on these amendments or others to relieve credit \n     unions of some of the unnecessary regulatory burden which \n     inhibits their ability to fully serve their members.\n       Thank you again for your support of the credit union \n     movement. We look forward to working together in the coming \n     weeks on these issues and in the years to come on many more.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Charles O.

Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: Thank you very much for taking the \n     time to sit down and discuss with us your thoughts on a \n     variety of issues of interest to credit unions. As you know, \n     the National Association of Federal Credit Unions recognizes \n     your long-standing commitment to credit unions and the \n     principles upon which credit unions were founded.\n       We have had an opportunity to review in detail a draft of \n     your proposed ``Credit Union Reform and Enhancement Act''. \n     Based upon our analysis, it is quite clear that your bill is \n     intended to enhance the safety and soundness of federally-\n     insured credit unions and to protect the National Credit \n     Union Share Insurance Fund. After consultation with the board \n     of directors of the National Association of Federal Credit \n     Unions, I am pleased to lend NAFCU's unqualified support to \n     your measure. Our Association would be pleased to stand \n     shoulder-to-shoulder with you in support of this sound and \n     rational proposal.\n       As you know, there are other areas which NAFCU believes \n     merit congressional review and reform--particularly in regard \n     to the regulatory burden to which our nation's member-owned \n     credit unions are subject. We look forward to working with \n     you and your staff to address these serious issues in the \n     weeks and months ahead as well. If I or my staff may be of \n     assistance to you or the Committee in any way please do not \n     hesitate to contact Bill Donovan, Vice President for \n     Government Affairs, at 703-522-4770, ext. 203.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kenneth L. Robinson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator \nD'Amato in cosponsoring the Credit Union Reform and Enhancement Act.\n  Earlier this year Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union of Lanham, \nMD failed, the largest credit union failure in U.S. history. Cap Corp, \nas it was known, had invested nearly 70 percent of its $1.5 billion in \nassets in a form of derivative instrument called fixed-rate \ncollateralized mortgage obligations, CMO's. These highly interest rate \nsensitive instruments experienced significant losses in value as \ninterest rates rose in 1994. The losses became so severe that the \nNational Credit Union Administration [NCUA] took over Cap Corp's \noperation by placing it into conservatorship on January 31, and \nultimately placed it into liquidation.\n  On April 13, NCUA announced that the remaining assets, liabilities, \nand field of membership of Cap Corp had \n[[Page S7781]] been acquired by Mid-Atlantic Corporate Federal Credit \nUnion of Harrisburg, PA. Before its acquisition, Cap Corp had \nexperienced investment losses of $61 million, all of which were \nabsorbed by Cap Corp's capital. As a result, the National Credit Union \nShare Insurance Fund itself did not incur losses as a result of Cap \nCorp's failure.\n  The failure of Cap Corp raised serious questions about the adequacy \nof the regulation of corporate credit unions. A corporate credit union \nis a specialized form of credit union which accepts deposits only from \nother credit unions rather than individuals. There are currently 44 \ncorporate credit unions. Corporate credit unions were created in the \n1970's principally to serve as a source of liquidity for their member \ncredit unions during periods when deposits were low. Over the years, \nhowever, they also evolved into sources of investment and payment \nservices for their member credit unions.\n  Concern about the corporate credit union system had led the Chairman \nof the National Credit Union Administration, Norman D'Amours, to \nappoint early last year a corporate credit union study committee made \nup of five independent financial experts to conduct a thorough review \nof the regulation of corporate credit unions. That report, which was \nreleased on July 26, 1994, provided a careful and critical evaluation \nof the investment behavior and risk-taking of the corporate credit \nunion system. Among the findings of the report were: Corporate credit \nunions are assuming more risk in their investment practices and in \ntheir portfolios than in the past.\n  Corporate credit unions are becoming more complex and will continue \nto become increasingly complex in the future.\n  Primary capital levels in the corporate credit unions are, on \naverage, inadequate given the investment activities of corporate credit \nunions.\n  Credit analysis procedures in the corporate credit unions have not \nkept pace with the increased volume of funds flowing into the system.\n  Corporate credit unions use derivative instruments to hedge interest \nrate risk and create synthetic securities for other corporates and \nnatural person credit unions.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] in an extensive 1991 report on \nthe credit union industry, had raised particular concerns about the \nstatus of corporate credit unions. The 1991 report stated: Changes are \nneeded to augment NCUA's currently incomplete regulatory and \nsupervisory authority over all corporates and provide for more \ncarefully defined asset and liability powers and higher capital \nrequirements.\n  Prompted by the failure of Cap Corp, the Senate Banking Committee \nheld hearings on February 28 and March 8 on the regulation of corporate \ncredit unions. In testimony presented to the committee, both NCUA \nChairman D'Amours and Comptroller General Charles Bowsher confirmed the \nfindings of the reports on corporate credit unions previously sponsored \nby their agencies.\n  Chairman D'Amours announced at the hearings that NCUA was in the \nprocess of developing a new set of regulations that would raise capital \nrequirements, tighten investment authority, and raise management \nstandards for corporate credit unions. The stated objective was to \nreturn corporate credit unions to their original mission of serving as \nliquidity centers and safe havens for their members' funds. NCUA had \npreviously established a new Office of Corporate Credit Unions, hired \nadditional corporate examiner staff, and expanded training for \ncorporate examiners.\n  NCUA issued the new regulations on April 13 and they were published \nin the Federal Register on April 26. The 60-day comment period ends on \nJune 26 and NCUA hopes to issue the final regulations by the end of \nJuly.\n  Although the new regulations address many of the problems relating to \ncorporate credit unions identified by NCUA and GAO, there are a small \nnumber of matters that require legislative action. The bill introduced \nby Senator D'Amato and myself would make those changes, some of which \nwould apply to natural person credit unions as well as corporate credit \nunions. Both NCUA and GAO have endorsed the bill.\n  First, the bill would permit federally insured credit unions to make \ndeposits only in other federally insured credit unions. The effect of \nthis provision would be to require the five corporate credit unions \nwhich currently are not federally insured to obtain Federal insurance. \nThe purpose of the provision is to ensure that deposits of federally \ninsured credit unions are not put at risk by placing them in non-\nfederally insured credit unions. This change was recommended by the \nGAO's 1991 report on credit unions.\n  Second, the bill would prohibit a State-chartered, federally insured \ncredit union from exercising asset powers of a type or in an amount not \npermissible for a federally chartered credit union unless the NCUA \ndetermines that the exercise of the asset power would pose no \nsignificant risk to the credit union insurance fund. The bill provides \nthat if a State chartered, federally insured credit union was utilizing \nan asset power pursuant to State law prior to May 1, 1995, it may \ncontinue utilizing that power.\n  This authority is comparable to the authority the FDIC has to \nconstrain the asset powers of State chartered, federally insured \nthrifts and banks. In fact, it is less restrictive than the constraint \nplaced on State chartered banks and thrifts, which imposes a flat \nprohibition on State chartered banks and thrifts. This provision would \nbe prospective in purpose, to prevent future problems from developing \nin credit unions. The GAO recommended this change in its 1991 report on \nthe credit union industry.\n  Third, the bill would authorize NCUA to serve as liquidating agent or \nconservator of State chartered, federally insured credit unions after \nprior consultation with the appropriate State credit union supervisory \nauthority.\n  Under current law, the NCUA has the authority to place a State \nchartered, federally insured credit union into conservatorship, but \nmust obtain written approval from the State supervisor. If State \napproval is not obtained in 30 days, NCUA may proceed to place the \ncredit union into conservatorship only by unanimous vote of the NCUA \nboard. Conservatorship means NCUA takes over the management of the \ncredit union. NCUA currently has no authority to liquidate a State \nchartered, federally insured credit union.\n  This provision of the bill would give the NCUA conservatorship and \nliquidation authority comparable to the authority the FDIC has over \nState and federally chartered banks and thrifts. The FDIC has only an \nobligation to consult with the State supervisor before placing a State \nchartered bank or thrift into conservatorship or liquidation. The \npurpose of this provision is to ensure that NCUA can act in an \nexpeditious manner if a federally insured, State chartered credit union \ngets into difficulty. Delay in acting decisively in such cases can \nresult in larger losses to the deposit insurance fund.\n  The bill would also make two other changes of a technical nature to \nthe Federal Credit Union Act. It makes explicit NCUA's authority to \nprovide limits on loans and investments by a corporate credit union to \na single obligor, and to provide minimum capital standards for \ncorporate credit unions. The bill would provide NCUA such statutory \nauthority.\n  In addition, the bill would amend the Federal Credit Union Act to \nreplace the term ``central credit union'' with the term ``corporate \ncredit union.'' The purpose of this change is to avoid any confusion \nbetween the 44 corporate credit unions and the single U.S. Central \nCredit Union.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a carefully crafted piece of \nlegislation that will bring greater safety and soundness to our credit \nunion system, and I am therefore pleased to be an original cosponsor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 884. A bill to designate certain public lands in the State of Utah \nas wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                THE PUBLIC LANDS MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Bennett, I \nrise today to introduce the Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995. \nThis bill would designate approximately 1.8 million acres of land \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] in [[Page S7782]] Utah \nas wilderness and release another approximately 1.4 million acres of \nland as wilderness study areas [WSA] for nonwilderness multiple uses. \nWith this bill, the requirements of the BLM under the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 to study and recommend to Congress \nthose lands worthy of wilderness designation, as defined by the \nWilderness Act of 1964, are met so far as it concerns the agency in our \nState of Utah. Identical legislation is being introduced in the House \ntoday by Representatives Jim Hansen and Enid Waldholtz. Utah Gov. Mike \nLeavitt is supportive of this measure.\n  Some may find it surprising that I am recommending more wilderness \nlands in Utah. The fact of the matter is that I am not antienvironment. \nLike any grandparent, I want to preserve nature's legacy in Utah for my \n15 grandchildren to experience, learn from, and glory in. I believe, \nalong with the English poet John Milton, that ``Beauty is Nature's \ncoin; must not be hoarded, but must be current. And the good thereof \nconsists in mutual and partaken bliss.''\n  I plan to fight for this new wilderness in Utah. I will also fight \nfor balance. Nature itself is balanced; ecosystems work in wonderous \nways to perpetuate life. Man is also a part of nature's grand scheme.\n  We have also had balance in our development of this legislation. This \nbill is the culmination of five intensive months of time and effort \ncontributed by each member of the Utah congressional delegation, by \nGovernor Leavitt, and by the local officials in those counties where \nthese proposed wilderness areas are located. At the same time, \ndifferent groups representing concerns on all sides of this issue--\nenvironmentalists, ranchers, conservationists, oil and gas developers, \nand others--have provided comments and input that have been helpful in \nfashioning this legislation.\n  Of course, this bill does not address all of the needs, the desires, \nor the concerns of all of these interests, or even of the entire Utah \ncongressional delegation. But, in an attempt to\n resolve this contentious issue once and for all and to bring finality \nto a matter that has plagued Utahns and the management of our public \nlands for nearly two decades, we have attempted to write a bill that \nbalances these divergent interests.\n\n  In 1978, the Utah State BLM Office began an exhaustive process to \ndevelop a Utah BLM wilderness proposal. This was no small task since \nmore than 22 million acres of Utah land managed by the BLM were \navailable for the study. In total, BLM employees scrutinized over 40 \npercent of Utah's total land mass to assess each acre's eligibility for \nwilderness classification. After this lengthy and tedious process, BLM \nidentified an inventory of 3.25 million acres that met every \nclassification requirement with no conflicts or de minimus conflicts. \nSince that determination, these acres have been managed as wilderness \nto preserve their natural character until Congress could formally \ndesignate them. In other words, nonwilderness multiple use activities \nhave been prohibited to occur on these acres.\n  In 1991, BLM, after clearing all environmental and regulatory \nhurdles, submitted a report to Congress recommending a final \ndesignation total of 1,975,210 acres in 66 specific WSA's. Neither the \nHouse nor Senate acted on this report. This is frustrating to many of \nus who believe that, in this case, the work accomplished by BLM's \nprofessional land managers on this matter, is being unjustifiably \nignored.\n  The Clinton administration has exacerbated the situation by adopting \na policy that directs those lands designated as wilderness in a bill \npending before Congress to be managed in the same manner as an \nofficially designated WSA. For several years now, a bill has been \nintroduced in the other body designating approximately 5.7 million \nacres of BLM land in Utah as wilderness. Therefore, the BLM now manages \n5.7 million acres of land in Utah as if it is already wilderness. This \nis 2.45 million more acres than were originally studied by the BLM and \nassessed for wilderness values, and 3.73 million more acres that BLM \nactually recommended for wilderness designation in its report to \nCongress.\n  With this history in mind, my colleagues, especially those from \npublic lands States, can understand why after 17 years and more than \n$10 million in taxpayer funds, 2,700 work months of employee time, and \na countless number of scoping meetings, public hearings, on-site \nvisits, and other related meetings, we are\n eager to bring closure to this matter. The bill we are introducing \ntoday is the next step toward that goal.\n\n  Last January, the Utah congressional delegation and Utah Governor \nLeavitt outlined a process to develop this bill. Each of the 14 \ncounties where the BLM WSA's are located were asked to conduct a public \nreview within their respective county and to submit a county \nrecommendation to the delegation by April 1. Each county utilized its \nown process to arrive at a county-wide recommendation. Counties \nexamined the BLM's proposed inventory along with various other \nproposals put forward over the years by Representative Hansen, \nRepresentative Bill Orton, the Utah Wilderness Association, and the \nUtah Wilderness Coalition. The amounts in these proposals ranged \nbetween 1.4 million acres to 5.7 million acres.\n  I might add that one ground rule for this process was that a proposal \nfor zero additional acreage was not acceptable to the delegation and \nthat the delegation intended to propose a bill in June.\n  During the April recess, the delegation and the Governor held five \nregional meetings throughout Utah to receive public comment on the \ncounty recommendations, which totaled nearly 1 million acres, and the \nother proposals. In addition, written comments have been received and \nreviewed since April 1.\n  In total, more than 40 public meetings, including the regional \nmeetings, have been conducted at various levels since January. More \nthan 500 individuals have provided public testimony since the first of \nthe year, and over 22,000 written comments in one form or another have \nbeen received by the Governor and the delegation on this issue. I \nsincerely appreciate all those who have taken the time to share their \nopinions regarding BLM wilderness in Utah.\n  Let me briefly explain the contents of the proposal we are \nintroducing today.\n  As I mentioned, the bill designates 1.8 million acres of Utah's BLM \nland as wilderness contained in 50 specific areas. These areas include \nwhat I consider to be the Crown Jewels of Utah's public lands--those \nareas so rich in beauty and grandeur that there can be no question that \nthey meet the wilderness criteria.\n  Let's face it--not every acre of BLM land is deserving of protection \nas wilderness. But, our bill captures those areas in wilderness that \nare well known to Utahns and most Americans, and that are fast becoming \nrecognized by millions of international visitors every year. \nPhotographs of these areas are found in most nature books; and they \nform the background for many commercial activities, such as TV \ncommercials, still photographs, and movies.\n  They are the Grand Gulch area of San Juan County; Desolation Canyon, \nthrough which the Green River runs; and, the Little Grand Canyon, the \nBlack Box, and Sid's and Mexican Mountains of the San Rafael Swell. \nThey include the Escalante Canyons of Garfield County, once proposed to \nbe a national park; Westwater Canyon, through which the mighty Colorado \nRiver flows; and the canyon area of the Dirty Devil River.\n  Numerous ecosystems are represented in this bill to be designated as \nwilderness. These areas include the high mountain ranges of the Deep \nCreek and Henry Mountains; river canyons through which the San Rafael \nRiver, the Dirty Devil River, the Escalante River, and the East Fork of \nthe Virgin River flow; the desert regions of western Utah that \nencompasses Notch Peak, Fish Springs, and the Ceder Mountains; Utah's \nred rock region of Red Mountain, Canaan Mountain, and Crack Canyon; and \ncontiguous areas that constitute several large and dramatic blocks of \nwilderness, such as Kane County's Fifty-Mile Mountain, the Escalante \nCanyon region, and the Desolation Canyon/Book Cliffs complex, which in \nitself would total more than 300,000 acres. [[Page S7783]] \n  These names may not be recognizable to my colleagues, but they are \ntruly the golden nuggets of Utah's public lands that are deserving of \nbeing called wilderness. I certainly encourage my colleagues to visit \nUtah and feast on these magnificent panoramas.\n  But, we have also tried to accomplish a balance in our legislation. \nAs Milton said, ``Nature's coin must not be hoarded.''\n  We do not recommend, for example, wilderness designation for those \nUtah lands that are high in resource development potential, and these \nare many. We are not interested in locking out these lands that someday \nmay provide the resources our State and this Nation will need to \nmaintain our economic stability. These\n resources include deposits of oil and gas, coal, uranium, all kinds of \nprecious metals, and other natural elements found in abundance within \nUtah's boundaries. While the specific boundaries of our proposed \nwilderness areas may be modified through the legislative process, we \nhave attempted to craft boundaries that avoid any conflicts associated \nwith existing rights and intrusions.\n\n  While our bill will designate certain lands as wilderness, it also \ncontains language necessary to protect Utah's interests from the \nramifications of this designation. This is not an attempt to lessen the \nvalidity of wilderness in anyway, or to erase with one hand what we are \nwriting with the other. The proposed language is simply a recognition \nthat wilderness designation can, and most likely will, affect valid \nexisting rights or the historic uses of an area, and which, if allowed \nto occur unrestrained, would have a devastating impact on the economies \nof many rural Utah communities.\n  Obviously, this is not our intent, which is why we have included \nlanguage that protects existing water rights with no express or implied \nFederal reserved water right; allows grazing to continue in wilderness \nareas without any diminution; prohibits the reclassification of an \nairshed due to wilderness designation; and protects the practice of \nnative Americans to gather wood for personal use and to collect plants \nor herbs for religious or medicinal purposes within a designated \nwilderness areas. We have included other language that is appropriate \nand necessary to address the unique situations existing throughout our \nState associated with this effort to create more wilderness.\n  In addition, we have included language that releases all of BLM's \nlands, with a few minor exceptions listed in the bill, from any further \nstudy or management for wilderness character or values, and returns \nthem to the full range of nonwilderness multiple uses in accordance \nwith already approved management plans. Adoption of this language is \ncritical to passage of this bill. To me, it is the key to resolving \nthis issue. Without this provision, this bill would be very difficult \nfor me to support. Let us be clear about one point: if those acres now \nbeing managed as wilderness are not returned to multiple use, it is not \nthe wilderness concept that would shunned, it is the concept of \nrepresentative and participatory democracy.\n  Finally, the bill contains language to effectuate an\n   exchange between the State of Utah and the Secretary of the Interior \nof approximately 140,000 State school and institutional trust lands \nthat would be captured, in whole or in part, by the areas designated as \nwilderness. These lands and their inherent economic value can only be \nutilized to provide revenues to Utah's public education system, and the \nonly method of ensuring that our school children benefit from each acre \nof these trust lands is to trade them to the Secretary for available \nFederal lands located in Utah.\n\n  In 1993, Congress adopted, and President Clinton signed into law, my \nlegislation providing for an exchange of similar lands located within \nUtah's forests, national parks, and Defense and native American \nreservations. The process outlined in that bill has proven to be rather \ncumbersome and frustrating, especially to Utah officials. We are \ntherefore attempting to learn from this prior experience by authorizing \na more sensible, reasonable, and quicker process for the exchange of \nschool inholdings in this legislation. Again, the inclusion of a \nprocess for the direct, fair, and prompt exchange of captured school \ntrust lands is pivotal to many of us in Utah.\n  Mr. President, I realize this bill would not be satisfactory to \neveryone in Utah or to those watching what we are doing from outside \nour State. Our bill contains an acreage figure that is 80 percent \ngreater than the recommendation submitted by the affected counties, and \n70 percent less than the proposal supported by one wilderness advocacy \ngroup. Maybe with such a wide expanse between these proposals, the \nacreage in our bill can be looked upon as a compromise proposal that \nmerits consideration.\n  I am aware that some advocate a total of 5.7 million BLM acres as \nwilderness because they believe this generation should preserve and \nprotect at least 10 percent of Utah's approximately 55 million acres \nfor those generations to come. This message has been stated many times \nin recent months, especially during our five regional meetings last \nApril.\n  An ad published in the Salt Lake Tribune on May 29 stated that \n``protecting 10 percent [of Utah's land] won't cost a single job in \nsouthern Utah,'' and that ``90 percent of the land will be left for \nhouses, roads, farming, mining, logging, tourist facilities, and the \nhost of activities already there and yet to come.''\n  If the proponents of this position are serious about preserving 10 \npercent of Utah's land mass from the laundry list of activities \nmentioned in the ad, then they should support our bill and rally behind \nit. Utah already has approximately 800,000 acres of wilderness managed \nby the U.S. Forest Service, which is ironically almost 10 percent of \nthe total forest lands in Utah, and approximately 2 million acres of \nland in the form of national parks, monuments, and recreation areas \nthat are restrictively managed by the National Park Service. The large \nmajority of the activities listed in the ad are already prohibited for \nthese lands. These two figures, added to the amount of acreage to be \ndesignated in our bill--1.8 million, or roughly 8.2 percent of the BLM \nland in Utah--would mean that approximately 4.6 million acres of land \nin Utah, or 8.36 percent of Utah's total land mass, will be preserved, \nprotected, and managed by one Federal land agency or another from any \nfuture intrusions or conflicts.\n  We have heard the voices of those advocating this position who truly \nwant to pay back, or tithe, to God for the beauty He has created in \nUtah's rural country by setting one-tenth of Utah's land. That is why \nour bill would add BLM's Crown Jewels in Utah to the Crown Jewels \nalready designated by the Forest Service and the National Park Service. \nI do not accept the argument that this gesture must be made entirely \nwith only BLM land when there is so much splendor and natural peace \ncontained in Utah's other 33 million acres.\n  Mr. President, during the Memorial Day recess I visited several of \nthe sites to be designated as wilderness in our bill. It was a \nmagnificent journey through Utah's backcountry, and the trip helped me \nappreciate even more the beauty of our great State. I also came to a \nbetter understanding of the areas listed in our bill and why I can \naffirmatively state today that they are worthy and deserving of \nwilderness designation.\n  At the same time, I came to a clearer understanding of the conflicts \nthat will arise once this designation becomes final, and why we need to \ntake reasonable steps to remediate, if not completely avoid, these \npotential conflicts. Our bill is an attempt to take these justifiable, \nyet reasonable, steps.\n  I recognize that some modifications in our bill may occur during the \nupcoming legislative review of this bill. I also recognize that changes \nare inevitable if this bill is to pass the Senate, pass the House, and \neventually be singed by the President. But, I need to clearly and \nemphatically state that despite my strong desire to create this new \nwilderness and to close this issue in Utah, I am not willing to accept \nany concession that is not in the best interests, both short- and long-\nterm, for my State. This bill represents a consensus package of ideas \nand proposals arrived at through a painstaking process. These ideas \nshould be built upon during the legislative process.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this bill carefully, and I look \nforward to [[Page S7784]] working with them toward passage of this bill \nby the Senate this year.\n  I also want to pay tribute to my colleague from Utah, Senator \nBennett.\n  Since he has come to the Senate he has worked long and hard on these \ntypes of pieces of legislation. He served on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. He did a terrific job and is doing a good job \nworking with his former colleagues on that committee, at this point, on \nthis bill. He understands these issues. He has worked hard on them. He \nhas done a terrific job. I have a lot of admiration and respect for the \nhard efforts he has put forth.\n  I also want to compliment my dear colleagues in the House, \nCongresspeople Jim Hansen and Enid Waldholtz.\n  Jim is chairman of one of the crucial committees over there in this \narea. Much of the weight of this falls on his shoulders in the House. \nEnid Waldholtz, our freshman Member of Congress, is standing right \nthere beside him trying to do the best she can to help Utah to \ndesignate the appropriate wilderness areas. We appreciate the work they \nhave done, and give them a lot of the credit for what has been done.\n  I would also like to say in closing that Congressman Orton has \nexpressed a desire to work with the Senate. I hope that he will. We are \ndisappointed he has not come on the bill at this time.\n  I think it does make it easier if every Member of our congressional \ndelegation agrees, but a majority of our State legislature, our \nGovernor, and all Republican Members of the delegation do agree.\n  Congressman Orton, to his credit, has said that he believes that it \nis pretty likely that he will support this in the end. He wants to \npresent at least an alternative point of view as well through a bill \nthat he will file for the purpose of debate. I respect that. I do hope \nthat sometime in the future he can get on this bill and help to pass it \nthrough both Houses of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill of \nSenator Bennett and myself be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership shown on the \nwilderness issue by my senior colleague, Senator Hatch. He carries \ntremendous responsibility in this body by virtue of his elevation to \nthe chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, and there are some \npolitical opponents who would have suggested that by virtue of that \nresponsibility he might be less attentive to Utah issues than he might \notherwise be.\n  I assure the people of the State and the people of the Nation that \nthat is not true. He is very attentive to Utah issues and he has \ndemonstrated that in his leadership in this matter. All Members are \ngrateful to him and to our Governor, Michael O. Leavitt, for the work \nthey have done on this issue.\n  Senator Hatch has outlined the details of this proposal. I would like \nto make a few additional points for those that may not understand some \nof the factors relating to the Utah wilderness question.\n  Some groups have said that the Utah wilderness issue is the premier \nenvironmental issue of this Congress, and they are prepared to fight to \nthe last possible breath in order to set aside 10 percent of the State \nin BLM wilderness. They say we must do at least 10 percent for our \nchildren. Those who are unfamiliar with the State of Utah might be \nimpressed by this argument, because after all, 10 percent seems like a \nrelatively small amount to set aside for future generations for some \nkind of preservation.\n  I have a map here, Mr. President, that I think will put this argument \nin its proper perspective. If we look at the portion in the map that is \nin green, it amounts to approximately 8 million acres. This is land in \nthe National Forest Service. That which is in dark green has already \nbeen designated as wilderness in Forest Service land, but 8 million \nacres have been set aside for future generations. There will be no \nMcDonald's hamburger stands. There will be no strip malls. There will \nbe no Marriott hotels built in these 8 million acres.\n  During the hearings, we were threatened with all of those things. If \nwe do not set this aside as wilderness we will have McDonald's \nhamburger stands and strip malls all over the State. Here are 8 million \nacres that will not get that.\n  In addition, we see this dark purple area in various places on the \nmap. Those are national parks and recreation areas with set-asides for \nfish and wildlife preservation, comprising over 2 million acres. So \nwhen we add those to that in green we get a 10 million acre set-aside.\n  Now, if we add the additional 1.8 million that Senator Hatch's and my \nbill calls for in BLM wilderness, that is shown here in the green area, \nthe total comes to approximately 12 million acres.\n  That, Mr. President, is not 10 percent of the State, it is 20 percent \nof the State set aside for the future generations, making sure that \nthere will be on these 12 million acres no economic development other \nthan that which is already permitted in the Wilderness Act, which is to \nsay, grazing, minerals, and other multiple uses of the public licenses.\n  The additional land that is shown in yellow, Mr. President, is BLM \nland. Once again, the BLM will not allow the building of a strip mall \nor a McDonald's hamburger stand or a hotel on these 22 million acres.\n  The amount of acreage left to private hands, when we take the \nmilitary reservations--that is what this is--and the Indian \nreservations--that is what this is--the amount left to private hands in \nthe State of Utah is shown in white.\n  In the demagoguery around this issue, some people have said can we \nnot set aside 10 percent of the land? Is not 90 percent enough for the \ndevelopers? I show this chart, and just say that which is in white is \nwhat is available to developers. Frankly, it is located upon the \ncorridors of highways that are already in place.\n  What we have proposed, Senator Hatch and I, is perfectly proper, \nlegitimate, wilderness use. However, it will not freeze out the \nmultiple use that could take place in this BLM land.\n  People say that wilderness calls for multiple use. Wilderness calls \nfor grazing if it is already established. Wilderness calls for mineral \nexploration if the leases have already been signed.\n  I close with this example of what has happened to that truth. That \nis, it is true the wilderness bill calls for this multiple use on \nwilderness land if it has already been established. We have a prime \nexample of what the 1964 Wilderness Act had in mind down in southern \nUtah on the Kaiparowits Plateau. On the Kaiparowits there are close to \n300,000 acres that would be considered part of a wilderness activity, \nand we have set aside a good portion of that in our bill.\n  In that acreage, there is an existing mineral lease, a coal lease. It \nis owned by a company called Andalex, named after the two children of \nthe owner of the company, Andrew and Alexander. The company is named \nAndalex. The Andalex coal leases have existed for years.\n  Under the Wilderness Act, a careful reading of it, they can continue \nto exist, and Andalex can extract coal from that area. Those people who \nare insisting on heavier acreage have said over their dead bodies will \nthey allow Andalex to rape the wilderness for the sake of the coal. \nThat is the kind of rhetoric that has surrounded this debate.\n  Mr. President, over the last week, during the recess, I went to the \nAndalex coal facility. What did I find? Out of the roughly 300,000 \nacres of the Kaiparowits, the Andalex coal mine would require 40 acres. \nNot 40,000--40. Four-zero, with no zeros after.\n  The 40 acres, by happy coincidence, happen to be at the bottom of a \ncircular canyon, so if you are not standing on the edge of the canyon \nlooking down, you cannot see it from anywhere in this entire area.\n  If the Wilderness Act of 1964 says anything, it says that the Andalex \nproposal should go forward. Yet the people who are saying that Senator \nHatch and I are not taking care of future generations are turning \naround and putting the Wilderness Act on its head by saying we will not \npermit a coal operation on 40 acres because somehow it would destroy \nthe wilderness experience the surrounding 300,000 acres.\n  Mr. President, I focus on that because it demonstrates the degree to \nwhich we have gotten away from reality in this debate. I hope the \nCongress in its wisdom will come back to reality and intelligence on \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \n        Robb):\n  S. 885. A bill to establish United States commemorative coin \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  u.s. commemorative coin act of 1995\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Commemorative \nCoin Act of 1995. This bill authorizes the striking of six coins in the \nnext 2 years. The subjects to be commemorated are: the 200th year of \ngold coinage, the 50th anniversary of the United Nations and the \nPresidency of Harry Truman, the 150th anniversary of the Smithsonian, \nthe Franklin Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, DC, the 125th \nanniversary of Yellowstone National Park, and the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial, also in Washington.\n  This past November, the congressionally established Citizens \nCommemorative Coin Advisory Committee published in its first annual \nreport to Congress, which recommended a 5-year plan of coin programs. \nThe committee concluded that the serious decline in commemorative coin \nsales necessitated a reduction in the number and amount of coins to be \nminted. Otherwise, the success of each individual coin program is \nthreatened and the Mint runs the risk of losing money on them.\n  This bill includes the coins recommended by the advisory committee \nand no others. It has the committee's full endorsement. It is a \nsensible package of commemoratives for deserving occasions and topics, \nlimited in scope so that the numismatic market can absorb them all.\n  As a Smithsonian regent I am delighted to offer a coin for the \nInstitution. As a New Yorker I am equally pleased to offer one for the \nUnited Nations and one for President Roosevelt. Yellowstone, the Law \nEnforcement Memorial, and gold coinage will also make popular and \nworthy coins.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of the radar bomb \nscoring site, Forsyth, MT; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                RADAR BOMB SCORING SITE LAND CONVEYANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill which \ndirects the Secretary of the Air Force to convey to the city of \nForsyth, MT, the radar bomb scoring site operated by USAF Detachment 18 \nat Forsyth. The purpose of the legislation is to allow the land, \nhousing units, and facilities supporting detachment 18 to be turned \ninto housing units for the elderly.\n  The Air Force has decided to close its facility at Forsyth. Because \nof the base's small size, the closure is not part of the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission process. The city of Forsyth is \neager to acquire the facility as soon as possible to help alleviate an \nelderly housing shortage.\n  This bill contains special procedures for turning the facility over \nto the city of Forsyth because we believe it offers the best solution. \nIf the normal process is followed, continued maintenance and upkeep of \nthe facility could be a serious burden. Inattentive maintenance could \nresult in serious deterioration of the facility by the time the normal \nproperty disposal process finally ends. Obviously, this would not \nbenefit the U.S. Government or the elderly who will live there. The \ncity of Forsyth is prepared to accept the responsibility for the \ndetachment 18 facility and rapidly transform it into much needed \nhousing for the elderly.\n  I urge my colleagues to incorporate this language into the fiscal \nyear 1996 Defense authorization bill without delay. And I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     cost of such survey shall be borne by the City.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     determines appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7778-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7786-S7787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Vermont [Mr. \nJeffords] was added as a cosponsor of S.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Kentucky educator who has dedicated her life to serving the \nCatholic Church. Sister Ruth Gehres is retiring as president of Brescia \nCollege on September 15, 1995.\n  Sister Gehres is in her 10th year as president of the 4-year Catholic \nliberal arts college. She first came to Brescia College in 1967 as a \nteacher, a job that kept her extremely busy. She taught English, \njournalism, literature, linguistics, and elementary German to the \nhundreds of students enrolled at the campus. In 1986, her hard work and \ndedication paid off, she was named president of Brescia College, the \nthird in the school's history.\n  Sister Gehres has seen many changes at Brescia College over the \nyears. During her tenure, she was responsible for the new campus \ncenter, the acquisition of the former Western Kentucky Gas headquarters \nfor the Lechner Graduate Center, the creation of a master's degree in \nmanagement program, and a partnership with Mercy Hosptial to create a \nwellness center.\n  The Evansville, IN, native is a graduate of Mount St. Joseph Academy \nand Brescia College. She has a doctorate from St. Louis University. She \nalso spent several years teaching elementary school in Nebraska and in \nHodgenville and Owensboro, KY.\n  While Brescia College will miss Sister Gehres after her departure, \nthe Catholic Church will remain a big part of her life. She plans to \ntake a sabbatical to prepare for a new ministry. While she is unsure \nwhat field she will pursue, Sister Gehres recently told Owensboro's \nMessenger Enquirer she plans to seek a field that ``engages my gifts \nand serves the church which also allows time for reflection and--I \nwould hope--writing.''\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to Sister Ruth Gehres. I commend her for her outstanding \nservice to Brescia college. She has played a major role in making the \nCatholic college the quality institution that it is today. Her hard \nwork, expertise, and kindness will certainly be missed by students, \nfaculty, and fellow administrators.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7799-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          JUSTIN TYLER CARROLL--NATIONAL SPELLING BEE CHAMPION\n\n Mr. BUMPERS.

Justin successfully made it through the closing rounds \nand received his championship cup after spelling ``xanthosis,'' which \nmeans a yellow discoloration of the skin.\n  Not only is Justin the winner of the National Spelling Bee, but he is \nthe holder of several other outstanding awards as well. He is the \nrecipient of the All-American Scholar Award, National Science Merit \nAward, National Leadership Merit Award, and National Mathematics Merit \nAward.\n  At the young age of 14, this straight A student has already earned \nmany prestigious titles that promise a bright future indeed.\n  Being the winner of the National Spelling Bee is a tremendous \nachievement. I commend Justin's numerous accomplishments and praise his \nhard work. It is gratifying to those of us who were taught the \nimportance of spelling to see that younger generations also take it \nseriously.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7799-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7799-S7800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLES H. LAND\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of my Senate colleagues the retirement of Charles Land, \npublisher of the Tuscaloosa News. After 40 years of service to the \nNews, the city of Tuscaloosa, and the State of Alabama, Charlie has \ndecided to turn over the job of publishing the Tuscaloosa News, and \nhopes to spend more time working in the community, golfing, fishing, \nand writing. I would like to take just a few moments, Mr. President, to \nrecognize the outstanding professional and community leadership Charlie \nhas provided over the years.\n  A native of Memphis, TN, Charlie Land grew up in Tuscaloosa, attended \nTuscaloosa public schools and the University of Alabama, and served his \ncountry for 3 years in the U.S. Army. Charlie's newspaper career began \nin high school, where he covered sports for the school paper--an \nexperience that helped prepare him for his first position at the \nTuscaloosa News as a sportswriter. In 1966, he was named Alabama \nSportswriter of the Year, and his success led to a series of promotions \nat the News.\n  In 1978, Charlie was named publisher of the Tuscaloosa News, and \nsince then he has been a leader in the newspaper industry not only in \nAlabama, but throughout the southeast. He has served as president of \nthe Alabama Press Association, a board member of the Southern Newspaper \nPublishers Association, president and board member of the Alabama Press \nAssociation Journalism Foundation and has won several State writing \nawards from the Associated Press and the Alabama Press Association.\n  In addition to this professional success, Charlie Land has been an \noutstanding civil leader, dedicating his time and energy to many worthy \ncauses. He is currently the chairman of the President's Cabinet at the \nUniversity of Alabama as well as a member of the National Steering \nCommittee and chairman of the Journalism Department division for the \nUniversity of Alabama Capital Campaign. In the past, Mr. Land has \nserved as board member of Crimestoppers, president of the United Way of \nTuscaloosa County, president of the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of \nCommerce, and a board member of the Society of Fine Arts.\n  Mr. President, Charlie Land's dedication to his community and his \nprofessional abilities are apparent, and I could mention the many, many \nawards and honors he has received in recognition of his work. But, as \nmuch as Charlie is a business and community leader, he is also a friend \nand advisor to many organizations and individuals in Tuscaloosa and the \nState of Alabama.\n  Recently, the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama organized a tribute \nin honor of Charlie Land. The people who have worked with him over the \nyears praised him for having done so much for Tuscaloosa. ``When \nCharlie is your friend, you need few others,'' one attendee said. \nOthers commented on his extraordinary insight and great skills as a \nlistener and advisor. \n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\n  Charlie Land's insight, dedication, attitude, and abilities have made \nhim an invaluable member not only of the Tuscaloosa News, but also of \nthe greater Tuscaloosa community. His retirement may mark the end of a \nremarkable newspaper career, but the contributions he has made to the \nnewspaper industry, the arts, and Tuscaloosa area business and \ndevelopment will be his legacy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Charlie Land for many years of \ndedication and work on behalf of the people of Tuscaloosa and the State \nof Alabama. I know that the leadership and advice he provided the \nTuscaloosa News will be missed, but I am confident that he will \ncontinue his involvement in community and civic activities. I thank him \nfor his work, and wish him the best in his retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/06/senate-section/article/S7799-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.

(If the ``employee'' is a firm [such as a law \n          firm or public relations firm], partners and salaried staff \n          members of such firm may join in filing a Report as an\n          ``employee''.)\n\n     (ii) ``Employer''._To file as an ``employer'', write ``None'' in \n          answer to Item ``B''.\n\n   (b) Separate Reports. An agent or employee should not attempt to \n       combine his Report with the employer's Report:\n\n     (i) Employers subject to the Act must file separate Reports and \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their agents or employees.\n\n    (ii) Employees subject to the Act must file separate Reports and  \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their employers.\n\n\nA.

An employee is\nto file, each quarter, as many Reports as he has employers, except \nthat: (a) If a particular undertaking is jointly financed by a group of \nemployers, the group is to be considered as one employer, but all \nmembers of the group are to be named, and the contribution of each \nmember is to be specified; (b) if the work is done in the interest of \none person but payment therefor is made by another, a single \nReport_naming both persons as ``employers''_is to be filed each\nquarter.\n\nB. EMPLOYER_State name, address, and nature of business. If there is no \nemployer, write ``None.''\n\n=======================================================================\n\n    NOTE on ITEM ``C''._(a) The expression ``in connection with \nlegislative interests,'' as used in this Report, means ``in connection \nwith attempting, directly or indirectly, to influence the passage or \ndefeat of legislation.'' ``The term `legislation' means bills, \nresolutions, amendments, nominations, and other matters pending or \nproposed in either House of Congress, and includes any other matter \nwhich may be the subject of action by either House''--Sec. 302(e).\n    (b) Before undertaking any activities in connection with \nlegislative interests, organizations and individuals subject to the \nLobbying Act are required to file a ``Preliminary'' Report \n(Registration).\n    (c) After beginning such activities, they must file a ``Quarterly'' \nReport at the end of each calendar quarter in which they have either \nreceived or expended anything of value in connection with legislative \ninterests.\nC. LEGISLATIVE INTERESTS, AND PUBLICATIONS in connection therewith:\n    1. State approximately how long legislative interests are to\ncontinue. If receipts and expenditures in connection with legislative \n ___  interests have terminated, place an ``X'' in the box at the left,  \n|___| so that this Office will no longer expect to receive Reports.\n    2. State the general legislative interests of the person filing and \nset forth the specific legislative interests by reciting: (a) Short \ntitles of statutes and bills; (b) House and Senate numbers of bills, \nwhere known; (c) citations of statutes, where known; (d) whether for or \nagainst such statutes and bills.\n    3. In the case of those publications which the person filing has \ncaused to be issued or distributed in connection with legislative \ninterests, set forth: (a) description, (b) quantity distributed, (c) \ndate of distribution, (d) name of printer or publisher (if publications \nwere paid for by person filing) or name of donor (if publications were \nreceived as a gift).\n\n(Answer items 1, 2, and 3 in the space below. Attach additional pages  \n  if more space is needed.)\n\n4. If this is a ``Preliminary'' Report (Registration) rather than a \n``Quarterly'' Report, state below what the nature and amount of \nanticipated expenses will be; and, if for an agent or employee, state \nalso what the daily, monthly, or annual rate of compensation is to be. \nIf this is a ``Quarterly'' Report, disregard this item ``C4'' and fill \nout items ``D'' and ``E'' on the back of this page. Do not attempt to \ncombine a ``Preliminary'' Report (Registration) with a ``Quarterly \nReport.''.\n\n=======================================================================\n\n                       STATEMENT OF VERIFICATION\n\n                         [Omitted in printing]\n\n                               PAGE 1\n\n[[Page HL 110]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Page HL 111]]\n\n        NOTE on ITEM ``D.''--(a) IN GENERAL. The term ``contribution'' \nincludes anything of value. When an organization or individual uses \nprinted or duplicated matter in a campaign attempting to influence \nlegislation, money received by such organization or individual--for \nsuch printed or duplicated matter--is a ``contribution.'' ``The term \n`contribution' includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit \nof money, or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or \nagreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make a \ncontribution''--Sec. 302(a) of the Lobbying Act.\n\n        (b) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN EMPLOYER.--(i) In general. Item \n``D'' is designed for the reporting of all receipts from which \nexpenditures are made, or will be made, in connection with legislative \ninterests.\n\n        (ii) Receipts of Business Firms and Individuals.--A business \nfirm (or individual) which is subject to the Lobbying Act by reason of \nexpenditures which it makes in attempting to influence legislation--but \nwhich has no funds to expend except those which are available in the \nordinary course of operating a business not connected in any way with \nthe influencing of legislation--will have no receipts to report, even \nthough it does have expenditures to report.\n\n        (iii) Receipts of Multi-purpose Organizations.--Some \norganizations do not receive any funds which are to be expended solely \nfor the purpose of attempting to influence legislation. Such \norganizations make such expenditures out of a general fund raised by \ndues, assessments, or other contributions. The percentage of the \ngeneral fund which is used for such expenditures indicates the \npercentage of dues, assessments, or other contributions which may be \nconsidered to have been paid for that purpose. Therefore, in reporting \nreceipts, such organizations may specify what that percentage is, and \nreport their dues, assessments, and other contributions on that basis. \nHowever, each contributor of $500 or more is to be listed, regardless \nof whether the contribution was made solely for legislative purposes.\n\n        (c) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE.--(i) In \ngeneral. In the case of many employees, all receipts will come under \nItems ``D 5'' (received for services) and ``D 12'' (expense money and \nreimbursements). In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, \nit will be presumed that your employer is to reimburse you for all \nexpenditures which you make in connection with legislative interests.\n\n        (ii) Employer as Contributor of $500 or More.--When your \ncontribution from your employer (in the form of salary, fee, etc.) \namounts to $500 or more, it is not necessary to report such \ncontribution under ``D 13'' and ``D 14,'' since the amount has already \nbeen reported under ``D 5,'' and the name of the ``employer'' has been \ngiven under Item ``B'' on page 1 of this report.\n\nD.

(If the ``employee'' is a firm [such as a law \n          firm or public relations firm], partners and salaried staff \n          members of such firm may join in filing a Report as an\n          ``employee''.)\n\n     (ii) ``Employer''._To file as an ``employer'', write ``None'' in \n          answer to Item ``B''.\n\n   (b) Separate Reports. An agent or employee should not attempt to \n       combine his Report with the employer's Report:\n\n     (i) Employers subject to the Act must file separate Reports and \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their agents or employees.\n\n    (ii) Employees subject to the Act must file separate Reports and  \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their employers.\n\n\nA.

An employee is\nto file, each quarter, as many Reports as he has employers, except \nthat: (a) If a particular undertaking is jointly financed by a group of \nemployers, the group is to be considered as one employer, but all \nmembers of the group are to be named, and the contribution of each \nmember is to be specified; (b) if the work is done in the interest of \none person but payment therefor is made by another, a single \nReport_naming both persons as ``employers''_is to be filed each\nquarter.\n\nB.

If there is no \nemployer, write ``None.''\n\n=======================================================================\n\n    NOTE on ITEM ``C''._(a) The expression ``in connection with \nlegislative interests,'' as used in this Report, means ``in connection \nwith attempting, directly or indirectly, to influence the passage or \ndefeat of legislation.'' ``The term `legislation' means bills, \nresolutions, amendments, nominations, and other matters pending or \nproposed in either House of Congress, and includes any other matter \nwhich may be the subject of action by either House''--Sec. 302(e).\n    (b) Before undertaking any activities in connection with \nlegislative interests, organizations and individuals subject to the \nLobbying Act are required to file a ``Preliminary'' Report \n(Registration).\n    (c) After beginning such activities, they must file a ``Quarterly'' \nReport at the end of each calendar quarter in which they have either \nreceived or expended anything of value in connection with legislative \ninterests.\nC. LEGISLATIVE INTERESTS, AND PUBLICATIONS in connection therewith:\n    1. State approximately how long legislative interests are to\ncontinue. If receipts and expenditures in connection with legislative \n ___  interests have terminated, place an ``X'' in the box at the left,  \n|___| so that this Office will no longer expect to receive Reports.\n    2. State the general legislative interests of the person filing and \nset forth the specific legislative interests by reciting: (a) Short \ntitles of statutes and bills; (b) House and Senate numbers of bills, \nwhere known; (c) citations of statutes, where known; (d) whether for or \nagainst such statutes and bills.\n    3. In the case of those publications which the person filing has \ncaused to be issued or distributed in connection with legislative \ninterests, set forth: (a) description, (b) quantity distributed, (c) \ndate of distribution, (d) name of printer or publisher (if publications \nwere paid for by person filing) or name of donor (if publications were \nreceived as a gift).\n\n(Answer items 1, 2, and 3 in the space below. Attach additional pages  \n  if more space is needed.)\n\n4. If this is a ``Preliminary'' Report (Registration) rather than a \n``Quarterly'' Report, state below what the nature and amount of \nanticipated expenses will be; and, if for an agent or employee, state \nalso what the daily, monthly, or annual rate of compensation is to be. \nIf this is a ``Quarterly'' Report, disregard this item ``C4'' and fill \nout items ``D'' and ``E'' on the back of this page.

The term ``contribution'' \nincludes anything of value. When an organization or individual uses \nprinted or duplicated matter in a campaign attempting to influence \nlegislation, money received by such organization or individual--for \nsuch printed or duplicated matter--is a ``contribution.'' ``The term \n`contribution' includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit \nof money, or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or \nagreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make a \ncontribution''--Sec. 302(a) of the Lobbying Act.\n\n        (b) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN EMPLOYER.--(i) In general. Item \n``D'' is designed for the reporting of all receipts from which \nexpenditures are made, or will be made, in connection with legislative \ninterests.\n\n        (ii) Receipts of Business Firms and Individuals.--A business \nfirm (or individual) which is subject to the Lobbying Act by reason of \nexpenditures which it makes in attempting to influence legislation--but \nwhich has no funds to expend except those which are available in the \nordinary course of operating a business not connected in any way with \nthe influencing of legislation--will have no receipts to report, even \nthough it does have expenditures to report.\n\n        (iii) Receipts of Multi-purpose Organizations.--Some \norganizations do not receive any funds which are to be expended solely \nfor the purpose of attempting to influence legislation. Such \norganizations make such expenditures out of a general fund raised by \ndues, assessments, or other contributions. The percentage of the \ngeneral fund which is used for such expenditures indicates the \npercentage of dues, assessments, or other contributions which may be \nconsidered to have been paid for that purpose. Therefore, in reporting \nreceipts, such organizations may specify what that percentage is, and \nreport their dues, assessments, and other contributions on that basis. \nHowever, each contributor of $500 or more is to be listed, regardless \nof whether the contribution was made solely for legislative purposes.\n\n        (c) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE.--(i) In \ngeneral. In the case of many employees, all receipts will come under \nItems ``D 5'' (received for services) and ``D 12'' (expense money and \nreimbursements). In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, \nit will be presumed that your employer is to reimburse you for all \nexpenditures which you make in connection with legislative interests.\n\n        (ii) Employer as Contributor of $500 or More.--When your \ncontribution from your employer (in the form of salary, fee, etc.) \namounts to $500 or more, it is not necessary to report such \ncontribution under ``D 13'' and ``D 14,'' since the amount has already \nbeen reported under ``D 5,'' and the name of the ``employer'' has been \ngiven under Item ``B'' on page 1 of this report.\n\nD.
